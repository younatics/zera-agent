"Families are to foot the bill for Sky’s decision to pay £4.2billion for Premier League football rights after the firm sneaked out an inflation-busting price rise on Budget Day. The firm is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or £3 a month to £36, or £432 a year. The bundle does not even include its sports channels, which means those who have no interest in football are subsidising Sky’s deal to show Premier League games. Scroll down for video . Sky is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or £3 a month, just weeks after it paid £4.2billion for the rights to screen 126 live Premier League football games a season from 2016 to 2019 . Sky paid £4.2billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the Premier League . Sky is also putting up the price of its Sports Bundle, which includes a basic range of channels plus seven dedicated to sport, by £1 a month to £47 - £564 a year. Film fans will also be hit with a 50p a month increase in the cost of the Sky Movies package and some £1.50 a month more for the combination of movies and sport. Critics say the price rises appear to be an attempt to recoup the huge sum that will be paid to super rich clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City. Sky paid £4.2 billion to show 126 live English Premier League matches a season from 2016 to 2019. That equates to £11m per game, which is up by 66per cent compared to the current TV deal. Analysts suggested the TV giant overpaid for the football rights in order to fend off competition from BT and others, however it is clear that the pain is now being passed to viewers, whether they like sport or not. When the deal was announced, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, heralded it as a success story for the nation’s biggest and richest clubs. However, it is viewers who will be funding the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and £200,000 a week contracts of the likes of Wayne Rooney, Yaya Toure, Eden Hazard, and Falcao. The company, which has more than 11m customers in the UK, bid about £300m a year more than analysts had expected in February’s auction. At the time Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, said the bill would largely be financed by cost cuts, however, he hinted that price rises would be necessary. Sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record Premier League TV deal . This graphic charts the significant rise of domestic Premier League TV revenue from 1992 until 2019 . The timing of the announcement appears designed to limit media coverage. Details appeared on the firm’s website on Wednesday, when the nation’s attention was focused on George Osborne’s Budget. Attempts to reach Sky spokesmen were frustrated by the fact most were at the London premiere of the new season of TV fantasy drama, Game of Thrones. Normally, Sky would announce any price rise in September, however making the announcement then would have coincided with its loss of the TV rights for the Champions League to BT. It would have been obvious to viewers that they were being asked to pay more for less. The inflation-busting increases will come into effect on June 1 and coincide with the middle of the latest series of Game of Thrones. Fans will effectively have to agree to the higher subscription. Sky last increased prices in September with the figure for its Sports Bundle going up by six per cent. That meant the price of its Sports package had risen about 30 per cent above inflation since 2001. The fact it is putting up prices yet again could well drive millions of people to switch to the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime, both of which cost less than £7 a month. Viewer reaction to the news was hostile. One contributor to the Engadget website wrote: ‘Hey Sky, I don’t care if you overpaid Premier League, I’m not paying for something I didn’t buy.’ Critics claim the price rises mean viewers will be funding the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and £200,000 a week contracts of the likes of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney (left) and Man City's Yaya Toure (right) Eden Hazard (left) and Manchester U's Falcao (right) are among the other highest paid Premiership players . Another, wrote: ‘If only Game of Thrones was available elsewhere I could cancel.... Surely the sports option itself should pay for the bid?’ A third questioned the rises for the non-sport packages. He wrote: ‘So wait, they’re increasing their prices to cover Premier League costs, yet the sports package is the one that’s increasing least? Way to show your audience who’s important!’ Another said: ‘I think it’s time I dump my Sky subscription. There is now so much competition in the market I can get the same content elsewhere.’ Virgin Media has complained to the TV regulator Ofcom about the way Premier League rights are sold to broadcasters, claiming it leads to expensive subscriptions which do not even provide live coverage of every game. Spokesman, Brigitte Trafford, said: ‘Too many people feel they now have to choose between basic essentials and watching the game they love. If action is not taken to change the way the Premier League sells TV rights, the rapidly rising cost of watching football at home will see even more people priced out of the national sport.’ Sky offered a bizarre explanation for the timing of the announcement, claiming it was necessary to comply with regulations imposed by the Advertising Standards Authority. In fact, the ASA has absolutely no role in the timing of such announcements. A spokesman said: ‘We work hard to make Sky the best value entertainment choice for subscribers. On average, bills will rise by less than £3 per month.’","Sky is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels to £432 a year .

"Manuel Pellegrini looks likely to continue as Manchester City manager, in part due to the lack of suitable candidates to replace him this summer. Serious questions are being asked of Pellegrini after another chastening defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League and what has so far been a weak defence of the Premier League title. But although there is deep concern at the Etihad about City’s lack of progress this season, it is understood there are no plans to sack him at the end of the campaign. However, Pellegrini’s position would be untenable if his team finish outside the top four. Manuel Pellegrini looks likely to continue as Manchester City manager for the foreseeable future . The club are already working on summer transfer targets identified by the Chilean - primarily Paul Pogba . The club are already working on summer transfer targets identified by the Chilean — primarily Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba — and the feeling is that he will survive into the final year of his three-year contract as City wait for No 1 target Pep Guardiola to end his spell at Bayern Munich. Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti have been touted as possible replacements, though Simeone is not liked by the City board, while Ancelotti’s links with the club are, according to sources, the result of allies putting his name forward as he looks to find a way out of an increasingly unhappy spell at Real Madrid. Guardiola talks regularly with City chief executive Ferran Soriano and football director Txiki Begiristain, though any switch is unlikely until 2016 when the Spaniard’s contract expires. City, meanwhile, could lose highly-rated head of youth Patrick Vieira. The ex-Arsenal star is out of contract in the summer and no talks about an extension have taken place.

"Fiorentina scored three goals in the opening 22 minutes to set up a 3-0 away win over struggling Roma to secure their place in the Europa League quarter-finals, with the all-Italian match-up finishing 4-1 on aggregate. Roma's season is falling apart, with the team having fallen 14 points behind Serie A leader Juventus in the Italian league and at risk of losing second place. A late sending-off for Adem Ljajic for a second yellow card capped a dispiriting night which saw about a hundred of the club's `ultras' leave the Stadio Olimpico after 30 minutes, by which time Roma had conceded three times in a 13-minute span.

"The FA want to send two Great Britain football teams to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics but a row has broken out with other home nations even before the qualification process starts. FA technical director Dan Ashworth and England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate want young England players to gain tournament experience. Their view has the backing of chairman Greg Dyke, leading to the FA changing their mind about sending only a women’s side — if any — to Brazil.

However, the manner of the FA taking the lead on raising the teams infuriated Wales, especially, and Northern Ireland, leading to a stormy meeting between officials at the IFAB summit in Belfast last Friday. Scotland were less concerned because of their long, unequivocal opposition to the GB football format, which they see as a threat to their independence within FIFA. The main sensitivity with the Welsh and the Irish was why the FA had the divine right to be the national association with the football seat on the British Olympic Association since its inception in 1905. Wales are also upset about the FA reneging — owing to a rules change — on a gentlemen’s agreement over the rotation of the British vice-president seat on FIFA executive committee.

"The first Thursday of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship is something of a national holiday for American sports fans, when office productivity plummets. Also known as March Madness or the Big Dance, the second round of the tournament - which started today - features a hoops extravaganza: 16 games both today and tomorrow, from noon to midnight. The single-elimination bracket-style tournament means every game is a must-win for all 68 schools, producing tense, dramatic finishes. University of Connecticut won the championship title in 2014 against Kentucky. The reigning champs are already out of the tournament this year, having lost to Arizona State University on Wednesday . Upsets are eagerly anticipated as elites like University of Kentucky fend off underdogs trying to spark an improbable run and become the next tournament darling, like last year's University of Dayton. Fanatics, novices and even President Barack Obama are trying to predict the winners of every game by completing an estimated 70million tournament brackets, according to the American Gaming Association — that's more brackets completed than votes Obama received in the last presidential election. Throughout its 77-year history, the basketball tournament has transcended sports to become a national craze. MADNESS FROM THE START . College basketball has long filled the gap in the American sports calendar when baseball and football are dormant. In 1939, Oregon beat Ohio State in the first tournament, which featured only eight teams. The NCAA field kept growing as TV coverage spurred interest. The potential for a David to slay a Goliath set the stage for what remains the most-watched basketball game ever: the 1979 final pitting little-known Indiana State, led by Larry Bird, against powerhouse Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson. The classic game transformed Bird and Johnson into rival superstars and catapulted college basketball into the American consciousness. In this March 27, 1951, file photo, the Kentucky basketball team celebrates winning the NCAA college basketball championship after defeating Kansas State 68-58 in Minneapolis. In 1939, the national title was decided by an eight-team competition . THE BIG DANCE GETS BIGGER . The fledgling ESPN cable network began broadcasting the tournament's oft-ignored early rounds in 1980. The term 'March Madness' was popularized through the 1980s as unlikely champions such as North Carolina State and Villanova captivated Americans. TV ratings skyrocketed, and so did revenue for the NCAA. In 2013, according to the latest figures available from Kantar Media, TV advertising revenue was a staggering $1.15billion. Every game is now on TV and streaming online. The champion must win six games as the field winnows, from the Sweet 16 to the Elite Eight to the Final Four. The semifinals and championship will be played April 4-6 in a football stadium in Indianapolis. In a March 26, 1979 file photo, Indiana State's Larry  Bird (33) gives a helping hand to a fallen Magic Johnson of Michigan State during the final game of the NCAA men's basketball championship in Salt Lake City. In 2015, 68 teams will play in 14 venues across the country, every game will be on TV, and the championship game will be played in an NFL stadium while millions of people watch across the country and around the world. AN AMERICAN OBSESSION: BRACKETS! UPSETS! Fans competing in online bracket pools — often for money, though that's technically illegal — had up until the moment the first game tipped shortly after noon Eastern  Thursday. Brackets will be busted by unpredictable upsets, like tiny Mercer's dethroning of Duke last year. One of the most famous upsets was achieved in 2001 by Hampton. Who does Kentucky, this tournament's overwhelming favorite, play in its first game? Hampton. That game just happens to be scheduled for prime-time on Friday night. Kentucky is favored to win by 32 points, according to oddsmakers. But in March, anything is possible. Kentucky fans cheer as the team steps on to the court for the first half of the NCAA college basketball against Akransas in the championship of the the Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville, Tennessee on Sunday .","2015 marks the 77th NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship .

"John Inverdale’s latest on-air gaffe - inadvertently blurting out the c-word - has come at the worst possible time for his career. The host of Radio 5 Live’s Cheltenham coverage was in conversation with jockey Lizzie Kelly and former champion John Francome. They were chatting about Francome’s early days in racing when Inverdale said: ‘This is looking at it with rose-c***** — rose-tinted glasses from the past ... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.’ John Inverdale inadvertently said 'rose-c***** glasses' live on air during Radio 5 Live's Cheltenham coverage . The blunder comes just over a fortnight before ITV are due to announce their Rugby World Cup line-up. Inverdale was in pole position to be lead presenter after a sure-footed anchoring of the RBS 6 Nations helped restore his reputation following his crass remarks at Wimbledon 2013, when he said women’s champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’. That incident caused Secretary of State Maria Miller to complain to BBC director-general Tony Hall, who wrote back saying Inverdale had been told ‘an incident of this nature must never happen again’. The BBC apologised  but Inverdale could pay the price when ITV name their Rugby World Cup line-up . Paul Downton, managing director of England Cricket, must realise his job would be untenable if Peter Moores, whom he appointed as coach, is axed after the World Cup debacle. Downton naively rounded on a group of cricket reporters in Wellington during his stay at the tournament to ask them to lay off the beleaguered Moores and get behind him instead. If any move galvanises journalists to do the opposite to what they’re told, it’s a crass move like that. ECB managing director Paul Downton (left) asked reporters to get behind coach Peter Moores (right) Olympic gold medal cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who is taking a year to learn how to ride well enough to complete in next year’s Foxhunter Chase Challenge Cup, will be at Cheltenham on Wednesday to gain more knowledge of racing.

It has also emerged that he persuaded Sky and host broadcasters Star to let him be based in New Zealand because he loves the outdoor life over there. Cricket World Cup broadcasters Sky Sports and Star allowed Sir Ian Botham be based in New Zealand because he likes the outdoors there - even if it meant he missed England's humiliating exit . Have 4,335 for the road! Paddy Power, who specialise in causing mischief at Cheltenham, were tame by their standards on Tuesday, handing out a proposed 4,335 pints from a pop-up pub on the way to the course to recognise Tony McCoy’s career winning rides. McCoy’s representatives complained about the stunt, which the bookmakers are not repeating. Meanwhile, the name of Cheltenham’s new £40million grandstand is to be decided by racecourse management and Jockey Club owners. But as the royal box is situated in the building, and given the make-up of the selection committee, a royal name is odds-on favourite. West Ham, who have many racing enthusiasts in their squad, will be envious of Cardiff City and Aston Villa being Cheltenham guests of Betway - the Hammers’ new kit sponsors. But West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has taken the players training in Dubai this week, meaning they will miss the Festival and Betway’s notable hospitality.

The FA’s strong opposition to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar hasn’t stopped them hosting their national team over here.

This is despite FA chairman Greg Dyke saying of the most controversial tournament in football history: ‘The best option would be to not hold it in Qatar, but we are now beyond that so November-December would seem to be the best of the bad options.’ The FA say Qatar using SGP is purely a commercial matter, aimed at making sure the facility is used as much as possible.

"Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh, held in a Dubai prison without charge for more than nine months, is making progress in his fight against his former colleagues at Dubai-based Islamic Investment bank GFH Capital, who are still 25 per cent shareholders at pantomime club Leeds. Hisham Al Rayes and Jinesh Patel, a Leeds director, are the subject of an application to be heard at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 9 that the pair be made the subject of arrest warrants and extradition proceedings on the criminal charge of fraudulently luring Haigh to Dubai on the pretext of the offer of a new London-based job. Leading human rights lawyer, Alan Jones QC, is heading the case against Al Rayes and Patel. David Haigh, former managing director of Leeds, has been held in a Dubai prison for more than nine months . The FA have appointed Martin Glenn as their new chief executive — and the food industry boss is taking a cut of more than half his salary by moving to Wembley. Glenn, chief executive of United Biscuits, was earning £1.4million according to the latest accounts, but will receive no more than around £650,000 at the FA. However, the lure of working at the top of English football was the main incentive for 54-year-old Glenn, who has made plenty of money in top jobs with Walkers, Birds Eye, PepsiCo and United Biscuits — whom he sold to Turkish food group Yildiz as part of a quick turnaround operation since April 2013. Glenn, known as the ‘Codfather’ of frozen foods after he killed off Captain Birds Eye and introduced Alaska Pollock into fish fingers, will have some notable football allies when he starts at the FA on May 18. Wolves season-ticket-holder Glenn, a level one football coach, has been a friend of Gary Lineker since he signed him for the Walkers Crisps ads that have been running since 1994. And Glenn was on the board at Leicester City at the same time as Greg Clarke, chairman of the Football League. Such was the secrecy around Glenn’s appointment that the selection panel only informed the rest of the FA board about their choice late on Thursday night, before the announcement at 10am yesterday. And for once, it looks like the FA have selected wisely with Glenn described by pal Lineker as an ‘inspired choice, a genuine football fan, terrific leader, great bloke. Gets things done.’ Praise indeed. However, the FA could have appointed Glenn 10 years ago when he was understood to be interested in the job. Instead, it went to TV sports chief Brian Barwick.

The 2015 Rugby World Cup roadshow in the UK will start 100 days before the tournament — an even longer build-up than the 70-day Olympic torch relay ahead of London 2012. The international leg of the roadshow has demonstrated a big demand to see the trophy because of the craze for sporting selfies — fans wanting a picture of themselves with the World Cup. The Football League are understood to be looking into the way Leicester City have stayed within Financial Fair Play regulations, despite declaring a loss of nearly £21m in the last financial year when they gained promotion. It is unclear how the Foxes kept on the right side of FFP limits that allow a maximum loss of £8m — not offset by football-related activity — partly through a multi-million-pound marketing and licensing deal with Sheffield-based agency Trestellar, capitalising on their Thai owners’ profile in the Far East. Trestellar is fully owned by former Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards and his son. Richards was an adviser to the Thais after leaving the PL in 2013. Leicester are being investigated into how they were able to stay within FFP regulations despite declaring £21m losses in the last financial year .","Former Leeds managing director David Haigh is making progress in his case against Dubai-based Islamic Investment bank GFH Capital .

"Kevin Pietersen has backed incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves to make the changes needed to revitalise the national team. Graves will take up his new post in May and high on his list of priorities will be to reinvigorate England's one-day side, who were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages after an embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on Monday. The defeat gave ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe Pietersen from the international set-up 14 months ago, while Graves appeared to leave the door open for the star batsman earlier this month when he suggested he would have a better chance of an England return if he played county cricket in this country.

"England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton insists he retains 'every faith' in coach Peter Moores despite England's humiliating exit at the World Cup on Monday. A 15-run defeat to Bangladesh saw England crash out in the group stages of the one-day tournament after a dismal campaign that included four defeats in five matches. Moores' tactics and team selection have come under heavy scrutiny since he was appointed head coach 11 months ago but Downton insists the former Lancashire coach remains the right man for the job.

'We had a side that broke up in Australia, we had to introduce new players and part of dealing with it - which was obviously going to be pressurised - was that experience. 'We're very early into an appointment. Much as we'd like to change things instantly, it takes time. 'Look at New Zealand and where they were with their one-day cricket two years ago - it takes time to bring things through.

"Racing will shake up its TV tender process this summer by asking broadcasters which races they want to bid for rather than restricting them to specific packages. The sport is not in a position to dictate terms, in contrast to football’s Premier League. The new going rate of £11million per live PL match dwarves the £4.8m per year C4 pay for their monopoly terrestrial coverage. And even such an outstanding day of racing as the opening Tuesday of the Cheltenham Festival saw a worrying drop in C4 viewing figures, with the peak of 910,000 a significant 71,000 down on the previous year’s figure. Annie Power falls at the last fence on an action-packed first day at Cheltenham on Tuesday - but TV figures on C4 were still down 71,000 on last year's event . Racing Media Group, the TV arm of English racing, remain remarkably pleased with C4’s coverage, which runs until the end of 2016, despite the decline in armchair watchers. But allowing TV networks to customise their bids means racing could separately sell its crown jewels — Cheltenham, Royal Ascot, the Derby and Grand National — to terrestrial channels. Other marquee meetings may follow. This makes commercial sense, especially as racing is already well served by two subscription channels for the run-of-the-mill meetings. The secret of Irish trainer Willie Mullins’s remarkable success at Cheltenham may be there for all to see, emblazoned on his horse boxes parked at the Festival. The promotional message is ‘What a difference the hay makes’. Mullins gets the specially selected hay for his County Kildare stables from Alberta in Canada, through supplier Ransley Hay, based in Ashford, Kent. They say: ‘Mr Mullins is one of our best customers, so naturally we look after him.’ Co-authored with Michael Moritz, the book will detail Ferguson's tactics and management techniques . Publishers Hodder & Stoughton look to have already maximised their investment in Sir Alex Ferguson with two seven-figure advances and two best-selling autobiographies. Yet Fergie, as if £2m for 20 days’ work as a Manchester United ambassador isn’t enough to augment his pension, will no doubt be trousering another £1m plus advance for a leadership book based on his Harvard business school work, written with tycoon Sir Michael Moritz. However, one subject sure to receive little attention in the book is Fergie’s fall-out with JP McManus over the breeding rights to champion racehorse Rock Of Gibraltar. Their paths will cross only accidentally at Cheltenham on Thursday. ......................................................................... Top football agent Jonathan Barnett claims the FA have not properly consulted with the middle men ahead of bringing in new regulations. Next month’s changes may be the subject of an injunction. And Barnett — who says his Stellar agency, run with David Manasseh, is now the biggest in the world in terms of representing players — declared: ‘It’s ridiculous the FA have not bothered to come and see and learn how a big football agency operates. They haven’t got a clue at Wembley. ‘They are bringing in unworkable rules without finding out about the business, especially when an agency of our size is on their doorstep.’ The FA say they are following guidelines from FIFA, who have passed the buck on to national associations to manage agents. Inverdale’s evening out . John Inverdale is understood to have lost his BBC position presenting Wimbledon tennis highlights, with the omnipresent Clare Balding expected to anchor the revamped evening show at this year’s Championships. John Inverdale inadvertently said 'rose-c***** glasses' live on air during Radio 5 Live's Cheltenham coverage . Inverdale’s move to a possible TV commentary role at Wimbledon was made before his latest high-profile gaffe — inadvertently blurting out the c-word while presenting the first day of BBC Radio 5 Live’s Cheltenham coverage. ITV Sport will closely examine his crystal-clear ‘rose-c***** glasses’ blunder, described as a ‘slip of the tongue’, before announcing their Rugby World Cup team, which Inverdale was expected to lead. Wales may be playing Ireland in a pivotal Six Nations rugby game on Saturday but coach Warren Gatland, his assistants Rob Howley and Shaun Edwards, and several of the players were enjoying the lavish hospitality of the Jockey Club, including lobster for lunch, at Cheltenham yesterday.

"English football agents are to take legal action against the FA unless a compromise can be reached over the introduction of ‘unworkable’ new regulations next month. The Association of Football Agents agreed unanimously this week to injunct the FA to prevent them from bringing in ‘unacceptable’ rules from April 1 - after FIFA washed their hands of responsibility for managing the middle men, passing the buck to the national associations. The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the FA called to resolve the issue. The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner over new FA rules . The agents object to the way the FA intend to administer their lucrative work. This includes a reduction in fees, no pay for representing players under 18 and a free-for-all with no agent’s licence required in future. Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, said: ‘There is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached. At least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress.’ The FA, who are understood to have chosen the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, were certainly aiming high with their original wish list. It is understood to have included Formula One Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is said to have been asked whether he was interested in leaving his £6million-a-year job in motor racing to earn 10 times less at Wembley. You can imagine his quick answer. It is understood Red Bull principal Christian Horner was asked to succeed FA general secretary Alex Horne . Former British No 1 tennis player Buster Mottram, better known for his extreme right-wing political views, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks. Mottram, 59, who plays regular social tennis at Wimbledon when not involved in games of bridge, refused to comment on the reasons for his suspension. The secretive club, who don’t like talking about their internal business even when staging the Wimbledon Championships, also refused to discuss his misdemeanour. Buster Mottram, pictured in 1955, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks . The Welsh FA have expressed anger with the FA over their plans to field Team GB football teams at the Rio Olympics without consultation. Welsh FA president Trevor Lloyd-Hughes said he was ‘livid and absolutely gutted with the English FA’, while Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford wants to be involved in all decision-making around 2016, having been given the impression that participation in the 2012 London Games was going to be a one-off. The FA say they have asked the three other home nations where they stand. The Welsh FA were under the impression a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympics was a one-off . DYKE COACHING ROW . There is a major split developing within the FA over chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board. Dyke’s initiative, with £2.7million per year being switched from other parts of the FA budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots (24) and professional game (11), has been approved by the FA board. But amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash. National game chairman Roger Burden has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues’ concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in FA Trophy and FA Vase prize-money may have a ‘devastating effect’ on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat. An FA spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the FA board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts. There are major splits developing within the FA over Greg Dyke's proposal to make cuts . England cricket chiefs Paul Downton and Peter Moores, having presided over abject preparation, performances and team selection at the World Cup, are fortunate the new ECB hierarchy had such low expectations. The high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation, so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda. This probably means Downton and Moores will have this summer’s Ashes series to secure their jobs.","The AFA have engaged sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner .

"Rohit Sharma, aided by a contentious decision that gave him a second life, scored his first World Cup hundred on Thursday to help the defending world champions India post a daunting total of 302 for six in their quarter-final against Bangladesh. Rohit was caught in the deep when he was on 90 but was allowed to keep batting when the umpires ruled that Rubel Hossain's delivery was above waist-height and therefore a no-ball, although television replays suggested it was a fair delivery. Rohit had initially been forced to abandon his normal cavalier approach as his team mates struggled to score quickly on a windy afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground but exploded later in the innings. While Suresh Raina (65) was the only other batsman to make a significant contribution at a rapid strike-rate, Rohit batted for 47 overs to make 137 off 126 balls, highlighted by 14 boundaries and three sixes. For a man who scored a world record 264 last year, it was almost sluggish going by his normal standards but no less crucial in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the World Cup. Of the three matches already played at the sprawling MCG during this tournament, the team batting first has scored over 300 runs and won each time and Bangladesh now face a formidable challenge to break that sequence. The MCG can be an intimidating bear-pit of a stadium and India opted to bat first in front of their fanatical supporters, and got off to a flying start, racing past 50 inside the first 10 overs. Bangladesh, appearing in their first World Cup quarter-final, managed to put the brakes on India's scoring after the fielding restrictions were lifted and they brought on their spinners. From the end of the 10th over till the start of the 35th over, India added just 104 runs for the loss of three wickets.

Rohit Sharma is congratulated for his milestone by Suresh Raina (left), who second top scored with 65 . Rohit's innings ended on 137 from 126 balls when he was bowled by Bangladeshi quick Taskin Ahmed . Shikhar Dhawan was the first Indian batsman to go, stumped for 30, and he was quickly followed by Virat Kohli, who was caught behind for three after a reckless slash at a wide delivery. When Ajinkya Rahane departed for 19 in the 28th over, the world champions were suddenly looking under pressure and Bangladesh the team with all the momentum. But cricket is a game where things can turn on the smallest of margins and India got two big breaks that proved decisive. Raina survived a confident appeal for lbw when he was on 10 then Rohit got a massive let-off 10 runs short of his century when he holed out at mid-wicket. The pair put on 122 for the fourth wicket as Bangladesh began to lose their way in the field. Raina threw his wicket away in the 44th over when he skied a catch behind then Rohit joined him after he was bowled by Taskin Ahmed but their efforts left India in a strong position to join South Africa as the second team in the semi-finals.

"Geoff Parling returns to the England starting line-up on Saturday with a clear vision of what is required — title glory, nothing less. Leicester’s Lions lock resumes his role as the team’s lineout conductor and a vocal leader offering support to captain Chris Robshaw, having overcome concussion and knee injuries which blighted a large chunk of his season. The 31-year-old will commit body and soul to the RBS 6 Nations finale against France with an acute sense of England’s need to reach a fresh peak and replace fading highlights. Geoff Parling is one of only five survivors from England's 38-21 victory against New Zealand in 2012 . England’s 38-21 win over world champions New Zealand at Twickenham in December 2012 is widely considered Stuart Lancaster’s finest hour. But, just over two years on, only five of that starting XV are set to start against France... ENGLAND (v New Zealand, December 1, 2012) A Goode; C Ashton, M Tuilagi, B Barritt, M Brown; O Farrell, B Youngs; A Corbisiero, T Youngs, D Cole, J Launchbury, G Parling, T Wood, C Robshaw, B Morgan . Despite their best endeavours in the championship, England’s most eye-catching achievement under Stuart Lancaster remains the record 38-21 demolition of New Zealand. But that historic victory took place 27 months ago and Parling — a central figure on that heady day — craves a more substantial achievement. ‘After that New Zealand game I was obviously over the moon, but it was a one-off,’ he said, after being recalled in place of Bath’s Dave Attwood. ‘We need something tangible now to say, “Look, we’ve won the championship, this is what we’ve got for our efforts — we can push on now with the goal of consistently beating any team that comes our way”. This is a game with the championship on the line in which we need to show character.’ Parling feels that won’t be a problem. He believes the England squad contains plenty of men who have an abundance of the necessary character and fighting spirit; men ready for the sort of taxing assignment that awaits tomorrow. Dan Cole (left), Dylan Hartley (centre) and Joe Marler get ready to pack down for a hit at the scrum machine . ‘There are a lot of players who enjoy those moments when you feel your backs are against the wall,’ he said. ‘These games are when you see a team’s character. We know there is a lot of pressure and we shouldn’t hide away from that. ‘We said at the start of the tournament: we have to win it. We’ve come second three years running and we don’t want that feeling again, but we’ve got a chance here to put things right and win it. ‘We are good enough, with good enough players. The way we’ve been progressing and with the players we’ve got, it’s still within our control to win a championship and I think we should put the pressure on ourselves to not accept anything less.’ Parling became a stalwart of the Lions’ series triumph against Australia in the summer of 2013, playing in all three Tests, starting in two of them and excelling in that exalted company. That tour gave him a first-hand view of the talent available to Ireland and Wales, who are vying with England for this year’s championship title, but he is adamant Lancaster’s squad contains talent to compare with their more established rivals. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . Parling will pack down with Northampton lock Courtney Lawes in the engine room for England against France . He said: ‘I see guys like George Ford and the way he controls the game at 22. He comes across as so much more experienced. I see the talent in JJ (Jonathan Joseph) and Anthony Watson. We have definitely got enough talent to win it.’ On a personal level, this is a welcome return to the starting XV for a player who has been a fixture throughout Lancaster’s tenure and would have won more than his 22 England caps but for injuries. ‘I am chuffed to be playing again, but I also see it as the start of the hard work. I haven’t done anything yet,’ said Parling. ‘I played every game between the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, then got the knee injury in the last game before meeting up, which was frustrating. ‘Then I thought I might be fine, but probably pushed it too hard.’ England will need full back Mike Brown at his attacking best against Les Blues at Twickenham . His exploits as a replacement in the win over Scotland convinced the management that Parling was worthy of a place alongside Courtney Lawes at the heart of the pack in the only change to the starting line-up for a high-stakes instalment of ‘Le Crunch’. Lancaster said: ‘The experience Geoff brings is important. He didn’t go on the Lions tour by accident. He’s been a high-quality player. Geoff has presence and speed around the field. His ability carrying the ball is excellent.’ England’s head coach was asked if he would feel any joy in beating the French but not claiming the title. ‘Eventually — potentially,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think I’ll feel anything other than disappointment if we don’t achieve it.’ Nothing less than glory will suffice.","Geoff Parling has overcome concussion and knee injuries to take his place .

"Oldham chairman Simon Corney believes Paul Scholes will manage the Sky Bet League One club 'one day', but admits it will be 'difficult' to tempt him to take the vacancy at the moment. The former England and Manchester United midfielder, 40, was immediately linked with his boyhood outfit when the Football League's third youngest manager Lee Johnson exited SportsDirect.com Park last week to join League One rivals Barnsley. The romantic notion that Scholes would take his first managerial position with Latics appears fanciful but Corney does think he could take the helm one day. Boyhood Oldham supporter Paul Scholes will manage the Latics in the future according to Simon Corney . However, Oldham chairman Corney was doubful Scholes could commit considering his current media duties . Speaking on a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in alongside director Anthony Gee, who suggested that the Oldham job 'may interest' Scholes 'at some point', Corney said: 'We speak on a regular basis and Paul occasionally comes down and does training sessions. 'He's a friend of the club. We know what Paul's all about, he's very low key, he doesn't make a big deal about things. He turns up at the games - never turns up at the directors' box - he turns up with his two lads, flat cap down and you wouldn't even know he was there. 'I'd love to have him on board, (but) it's difficult. Again, you have to ask would Oldham be the right club for somebody like Paul? It's not just about us wanting Paul, it's also would it be the right thing for him? 'I think Anthony's right that one day he will come and manage the club but it's all about timing with him.' Gee also confirmed Scholes, who now has media commitments with the likes of BT Sport, had not applied for the position but that they did intend to hold talks with him in the near future. The two Oldham board members also touched on the club's controversial move to attempt to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans in January, a signing they eventually pulled out of in the face of overwhelming pressure from sponsors promising to withdraw their support, while staff members were also subjected to abusive threats. Since his retirement from football the former Manchester United star has taken up a role with BT Sport . Latics had originally indicated they had no desire to acquire Evans back in December, but Gee revealed they returned to the possibility in the new year when Johnson told the board of directors he had had a change of heart. 'We did a hell of a lot of due diligence,' added Gee. 'We met with the player on two or three occasions and if you remember when we were first linked with him, the manager actually said to us that he'd rather pass. We pulled our interest immediately. 'It was when the manager came to us the second time and said, 'Actually, maybe I'll go and have a chat with him', that we rekindled our interest which led to all the scenes that you remember in January. 'If I was put on the spot and asked would I do the same thing again? I think the truth of the matter is I probably would. 'I'm also a firm believer in the rule of law. If we don't have the rule of law and we don't have rehabilitation in society then I don't know what sort of society we have. 'Whilst his crime was very serious there are other people out there playing football who have killed people. We've had a similar case at Oldham with Lee Hughes. 'If I'm asked whether I regret it? No. Do I understand how difficult it was for the fans and the community? Yes. It was hard for us as directors as well. 'We always had the best interests of the club at heart, even if it's hard to believe.'","Oldham chairman Simon Corney said Paul Scholes will manage the club .

"Saucy: The Athena poster that led to the apology . It's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Whether Athena's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum is another matter entirely. Following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media, the All England Lawn Tennis Club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. Earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket, alongside the famous image, to promote its Powerful Posters exhibition, due to open tomorrow. That such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma was outraged, writing: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who call themselves 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The offending image was swiftly deleted from the official Wimbledon Twitter account and a new post went up which said: 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it.' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition . However, a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Last night an All England Club spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter . Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. One Twitter user said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for – I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19.","All England Club used iconic Athena girl image to promote exhibition .

After timing Uxizandre's run to perfection, McCoy said: 'I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him. I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase. 'He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up, but I was quite happy coming down the hill, he kept looking at the television camera on his inside and I thought he had saved a bit for himself.'

King said: 'He's always been a very good horse but we just lost him a little bit in mid-winter on the heavy ground. 'We hoped that back up to two and a half miles on better ground was the key and my goodness he can go some pace. McCoy was greeted by the winning owner JP McManus after Uxizandre beat Ma Filleule into second . McCoy celebrates winning the Ryanair Chase on St Patrick's Day during the Cheltenham Festival . 'It's huge for the whole team and I'm delighted to part of the whole AP thing as well. The horses have been running well all week, but there's nothing like a winner here. 'It's the only way to ride him, to let him bowl along and we wanted to see if he was a Queen Mother horse earlier in the season. 'To be fair, AP said at halfway he was wishing he'd run in the Queen Mother as he didn't think he'd last home but it was only last year he was narrowly beaten here in the JLT and then won a Grade One at Aintree. 'Spring ground helps and some of his jumps today were breathtaking. 'We'll not see AP's like again, the winners, the dedication - I'm just delighted to have played a small part in it.' Of Ma Filleule, Anthony Bromley, representing owners Simon Munir and Isaac Souede, said: 'She ran a brilliant race and I'm delighted for the connections of the winner as he's an ex-Million In Mind horse and I think the visor has probably helped him. 'Our mare ran great race and assuming she's OK, we'll aim towards the Bowl back over three miles at Aintree.'","Champion jockey AP McCoy is riding in his final Cheltenham Festival .

"A Chelsea fan on Twitter - @TalkoftheBridge – tweeted recently: 'I dread the day John Terry retires more than I dread my own death.' At first it makes shocking reading, but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans, the love they have for their club, and the astonishingly high regard Chelsea fans have for their captain, it all makes sense. It should be interpreted in the same way as Bill Shankly’s famous quote: 'Football is not a matter of life and death, it’s more important that that.' Here’s another way of saying it. Chelsea will not be able to replace Terry when he finally retires. England have had to move on already. But the question remains, how on earth will Chelsea cope when the inevitable happens? Life and Chelsea Football Club will go on of course, but reflecting on yet another incredible man-of-the-match performance from Terry at Wembley, it occurred to me that he is unique. John Terry and Jose Mourinho celebrate on the Wembley pitch after Chelsea's win on Sunday . Not so long ago some were declaring Terry was finished. He couldn’t train properly, we were told. He couldn’t play two games in a week apparently. The truth is very different. Andre Villas-Boas' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from Terry and made the player look vulnerable. And then Rafa Benitez arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably Chelsea’s greatest ever player. Jose Mourinho has resurrected the King of Stamford Bridge. It is now a major cause for concern among Chelsea fans if Terry isn’t in the starting line-up. So in playing terms, he is still the first name on the team sheet, even with the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Nemanja Matic and Eden Hazard at the club. But the love for Terry among Chelsea fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half. And that’s why he is seemingly irreplaceable. Terry beat Hugo Lloris to score Chelsea's crucial first goal in the Capital One Cup final . The Blues captain ran off to celebrate after breaking the deadlock at Wembley... And he led the celebrations at the end as the Chelsea players partied after winning the League Cup . He came through the youth ranks, and is now a revered Chelsea captain. His team-mates respect him, and they listen to him. The fans still idolise him. The football world laughed when he lifted the Champions League trophy with his full kit on despite being suspended for that final. But most if not all Chelsea fans understood it. Terry was a huge part of that journey, and in their minds he belonged on that podium, he deserved the champagne, and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began. The cynics and critics will go on and on about Terry’s indiscretions – some alleged, some not. He’s far from perfect of course, a bit like the rest of us. And I wouldn’t say Chelsea fans don’t care about any of that stuff. But it doesn’t hide the fact that when he does decide to retire, there will be a massive Grand Canyon to fill. The Chelsea captain celebrates after they beat Bayern Munich to win the Champions League in 2012 . I’m not a Chelsea fan, so I asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up. A work colleague, Emma, said this: 'He is our rock, our leader, without him we don’t win all those titles and we love him for how much he gives his all to the shirt. You can imagine cutting him and his blood would spill out blue. Every other fan hates him but knows deep down they would love him in their team.' Another friend, Laura used the cliche – 'Mr Chelsea' to describe him, and then went on: 'You can see what the team and the club mean to him. His reactions after every game, he always comes over to the Matthew Harding Lower and gets the rest of the team over as well to applaud the fans. A few games ago he signed my shirt, got on the team coach, then got off again and offered a family tickets as he thought he’d heard them say they had travelled but couldn’t get in to the game. It’s a side of him that shows what the fans mean to him and a side that not enough people and media see.' Another colleague, the ex-Chelsea defender Jason Cundy, told me this: 'John is the best ever CFC youth product, best ever CFC centre back, and most successful captain ever. He’s still so important to the club on and off the field – captain, leader, legend. With so many foreign players at CFC, and so few homegrown players to come through over the last 15 years, he represents the fans on the pitch and plays with the same passion, pride and love for CFC that we fans have in the stands for the club. It will be impossible to replace him.' Enough said. Terry and his Chelsea team-mates celebrate winning their first Premier League title in 2005 .","John Terry was man of the match as Chelsea won the Capital One Cup .

"Luis Enrique says England's lack of a winter break may have given Barcelona an advantage against Manchester City – and he hopes the Premier League don't change their fixture list. Manuel Pellegrini suggested after City's 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp that the number of games English clubs played in December and January meant they struggled in the latter stages of the Champions League. City's 3-1 aggregate defeat followed Arsenal's exit at the hands of Monaco on Tuesday and Chelsea's defeat by Paris Saint-Germain last week – leaving no English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. Luis Enrique conceded Barcelona may have an advantage over English sides due to the winter break . Ivan Rakitic (right) scored as Barcelona beat Manchester City 1-0 in the Nou Camp on Wednesday . City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes the games his team play over Christmas hinder them in Europe . And Enrique has some sympathy for Pellegrini. 'We are used to resting during winter with our families,' Enrique said. 'I heard (Southampton manager) Ronald Koeman complaining about the number of fixtures in England, so maybe it is an advantage for us. 'I don't know, it is impossible to say, but we do enjoy watching the English teams playing on Boxing Day.' Speaking after the game, Pellegrini suggested the heavy fixture scheduling played a part in City's demise. Lionel Messi's Barcelona eliminated City by beating them 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League . For the second time in three years, there are not any English teams in the last eight of the Champions League . Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to analyse because the Premier League is strong, with money and very good players. 'We play so many games in December and January and we are not fresh in February. In Spain, Italy and Germany they stop playing. Last year we played nine games in December and nine in January, and that was before we played Barcelona.'

"As excitement builds around Sunday's top-four showdown between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield, Sportsmail asked two fans to take part in a Q&A. David Tyrer from Live4Liverpool and Sam Peoples from The Peoples Person answered questions on England's biggest rivalry, what they make of the race for the top four and how past results and recent form will affect the clash. Scroll down to read their answers. Click here to check out David Tyrer's work on Live4Liverpool . Click here to follow L4L on Twitter . Click here to check out Sam Peoples' work on The Peoples Person . Click here to follow TPP on Twitter . Games between Manchester United and Liverpool are always among the most hard-fought of the season . Feeling confident? DT: I am, despite Monday’s game (1-0 win over Swansea) I think we’ve our best chance in years of getting a good result; even more so than last season at Old Trafford. SP: The performance against Spurs came at just the right time to instil some confidence in fans and the players. It wasn't the win, it was the tempo but that being said, it is Anfield. When was the last time United played well there? Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney come head-to-head in a Premier League clash that is vital for both teams . What would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game? DT: Considering how United have fallen in recent years, it means a lot more in the grand scheme of finishing in the top four. United’s scalp for us is still a big one but the three points are just as – if not more important. SP: It is and always will be the biggest game of the season and Sunday is the biggest game between the clubs in years. Both have a lot on the line and so much to lose, so it is going to be an intense atmosphere, more so than usual. United fans have always viewed Liverpool as their biggest game of the season, this year it's even bigger . Is this the biggest rivalry in English football? DT: Without a doubt, regardless of what City or Everton fans like to think – it’s still the first one I look for when the fixture list comes out. SP: Without question it is the biggest rivalry. Man City might be challengers now but United fans spent decades laughing at them trying to hold on to our coat tails and as for Chelsea, that rivalry has been forced on to everybody thanks to Roman Abramovich. I miss the old days of Arsenal being a bitter rival but although that feeling has dampened in recent years, the rivalry with Liverpool has never lost its potency. Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher argues with Gary Neville during a United-Liverpool clash back in 2010 . Matches between the two sides are always potent - it is the biggest rivalry in English football, say the fans . Patrice Evra encourages the United support ahead of Liverpool rival Luis Suarez after a United win in 2012 . What was your take on Man United's 3-0 win over Liverpool in December? DT: It was particularly miserable, as it felt as if our previous season was just a one-off. Obviously, we’re back to something like last season’s form now but that was hard to take, as I felt we deserved something. SP: What a cracking game that was but the 3-0 over Spurs last weekend was much more convincing. We were vibrant in attack against Liverpool yet defensively we were weak and it was all about David de Gea's heroics. If not for an outstanding performance from him, it could have been very different. Rooney scored United's opener in an impressive 3-0 win at Old Trafford when Liverpool were struggling . Juan Mata added a second goal for the home side to compound Liverpool's misery under Brendan Rodgers . Robin van Persie scored the third goal but Liverpool and Rodgers have not lost in the league since that day . What's changed for both teams since that result? DT: I don’t think much has changed for United, they’re still winning games, often without being the better side, but they were good against Tottenham, which could be a concern. Liverpool have improved so drastically though, and it wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that a bit of better early-season form would’ve seen another title challenge. SP: Liverpool haven't lost in the Premier League since then which says it all. They've had a post-January renaissance akin to what United did annually under Sir Alex and come into the game on Sunday as the league's in-form side. On the other hand, United have been a mixed bag all season but have been able to grind out a lot of results as well, so we've become quite hard to beat which is certainly progress. Jordan Henderson scored Liverpool's winner at Swansea in the latest impressive result of a good run of form . Rooney starred in United's 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur which kept up hope of finishing in the top four . Angel Di Maria is free from suspension to return to the United team. Is that a good or a bad thing? DT: Sadly, it makes little difference. He’s one of the world’s best but Louis van Gaal just doesn’t know what to do with him. Here’s hoping he starts him up front again! SP: You can't underestimate any world-class player regardless of what form they are in. Before his red card against Arsenal, Di Maria actually had his best 45 minutes in a long time and his pin-point cross set up Wayne Rooney's equaliser. I expect him to come straight back into the starting XI because of his pace as United will more than likely set-up on the counter-attack as we did away to Arsenal. With Ashley Young and Rooney bang in form, United should have some great pace up front. Angel di Maria returns after being sent off in the FA Cup against Arsenal, and could start for United . Do you expect Steven Gerrard to start for Liverpool? DT: No, and nor should he. He was solid and calmed us down when he came on on Monday but if the game has any of the usual frantic pace about it he’ll be our major weak link. SP: I really hope Liverpool get caught up in the sentimental wave of Gerrard's last derby and start him but I can't see it happening. They're a better side without him as Jordan Henderson has stepped it up this year. Rodgers may elect to leave his captain Steven Gerrard on the bench as he continues to recover from injury . What are your plans for the day of the game? DT: I usually find the games against United too nerve-wracking so I tend to not be around other people. There’s usually a lot of work to do on the day of the match too so, I’ll most likely watch with family or by myself and hope I don’t have to drown my sorrows later on! SP: It's an early kick-off so won't be much time to do anything before 1.30 comes around. As there's so much riding on this game, I'll probably just be a bag of nerves right up until the first whistle. Daniel Sturridge isn't quite back to his best after returning from injury but could have a key role to play . What would a win for your team do to their Champions League qualification prospects? DT: I wouldn’t say a win for either side would seal the other’s fate but I do believe if Liverpool win then the confidence the three points would bring would be incredible in terms of momentum, it may even lead to a push for third or (whisper it) second. SP: A win for either side would be absolutely massive. It would give United a very nice cushion over Liverpool and consolidate our spot in fourth and for Liverpool, it would see them leapfrog United. It's all to play for. Liverpool supporters are eyeing up Manchester City's second spot in the Premier League if they beat United . United manager Louis van Gaal has already stated his belief that his team can catch their local rivals City . The last six meetings have all had a winner and the bookies expect Liverpool to be victorious here. What's your prediction? DT: I’m going to say a less comfortable win than we’d hope but still, I’m going for a 2-0 to Liverpool. SP: I'm going to disagree with the bookies here and go for a draw. It's a derby so anything can happen and form usually doesn't count for much. Both sides are going to have chances as there are defensive weaknesses in United and Liverpool. Hopefully United can be as clinical as they were against Spurs but away at Anfield is a different kettle of fish. My prediction? A score draw: 1-1.

"England have promoted Geoff Parling to the second row and recalled Nick Easter to the bench for Saturday's decisive RBS 6 Nations clash with France at Twickenham. The solitary change to the starting XV that toppled Scotland 25-13 last weekend sees Parling replace Dave Attwood, who has been dropped from the 23 altogether. Instead, head coach Stuart Lancaster has looked to Easter to provide lock cover among the replacements as England aim to clinch a first Championship since 2011. Lancaster named his squad before taking a training run at England's base in Bagshot, which was attended by renowned rugby fan Prince Harry. Geoff Parling, here training in Bagshot on Thursday, has been named in England's starting XV . England coach Stuart Lancaster and Prince Harry watch over training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Lancaster and the royal rugby fan share a laugh ahead of England's Six Nations finale against France . 'Geoff did well off the bench against Scotland and now that he has got some games under his belt we feel it is the right time to start him and use his experience and quality in the starting line-up,' Lancaster said. 'The same goes for Nick Easter, who has really impressed in camp and in his appearances off the bench. 'Nick is a quality ball carrier and great defender - things we feel we'll need in the latter stages of the game.' England were delighted by Parling's forceful 30-minute shift from the bench against Scotland, so the Test British and Irish Lion returns and he will replace lock partner Courtney Lawes in running the line-out.

Prince Harry makes his way to watch the England go through their paces and talks to Sky Sports' Alex Payne . The England team form a huddle during England training ahead of their final Six Nations match of 2015 . Nick Easter comes back to the bench and will provide lock cover with Dave Attwood dropped altogether . Attwood has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with Lancaster believing the street-wise Easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware. Tom Youngs was strongly praised by Lancaster following his substitute display at Twickenham last Saturday, but Dylan Hartley has held off the challenge from his rival and continues at hooker. The backline remains unchanged and now has a settled look to it with inside centre providing the only real question mark. Luther Burrell continues at 12 knowing that had Brad Barritt not been stricken by a high ankle sprain, his place in the starting XV would have been in doubt and the Northampton midfielder needs to impress against France. Lancaster said he was keen to 'use (Parling's) experience and quality in the starting line-up' Full back Mike Brown shows his trademark speed when shown a little space on Thursday .

'It's a great achievement for Dan to win his 50th cap, especially coming back from his injury last year. He is one of the cornerstones of our squad and we all wish him all the best,' Lancaster said. Bookmakers view England as favourites to be crowned 2015 Six Nations champions on a nerve-shredding day of staggered kick-offs that conclude at Twickenham. Wales and Ireland are also in contention - they visit Rome and Edinburgh respectively - but it is the Red Rose who top the table courtesy of a points cushion of plus four.

For a third successive year the outcome is set to be decided by points difference and with their showdown against the typically unpredictable French closing the Championship, it is the 2015 World Cup hosts who will know exactly what target they must chase down. 'Finishing off the tournament at home is going to be a great occasion,' Lancaster said. 'The support against Scotland last week was fantastic and this weekend we really need the crowd to get behind the team and drive them forward in what will be an exciting finale to this year's Championship.'

"Sky is to increase its prices for sports and family entertainment packages in Britain, just six weeks after it agreed to pay a record fee for the rights to show Premier League football matches. Sky, which normally increases its prices in September, said on Thursday the price of a sports TV package would rise by £1 to £47 a month. It reflects the balancing act it is attempting after agreeing to pay £4.2billion to show 126 live Premier League matches a season from 2016 to 2019, fending off fierce rival BT. Sky said upon the announcement of the record Premier League deal that it would try to make sure its customers would not have to foot the bill. As of June, it will cost £47 a month to watch Sky Sports pundits such as Thierry Henry (centre) Sky will no longer have rights to broadcast Champions League games from next season . Sky paid £4.2billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the Premier League . 'The company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers, with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans,’ a Sky spokesman said upon the announcement of the rights in February. Sky's family bundle, which includes its highest profile shows and box-sets of drama, would rise by £3  a month to £36. Analysts said the lower price rise for sports channels might reflect a concern within the company that viewers could defect to BT, which won the right to show 42 games a season and has also beaten Sky to show Champions League matches from later this year. The price increases will take effect in June. Analysts at Citi said this was prudent as the previous timetable would have resulted in Sky trying to increase prices just as the Champions League matches disappeared from its channels. Sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record Premier League TV deal . Graphic charts the significant rise of domestic Premier League TV revenue . Seven packages were available in the auction, five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season. THE PACKAGES SKY WON . Package A comprises 28 games on Saturday lunchtimes (12.30pm). Package C has 28 games kicking off between 1.30pm and 2.15pm on Sundays. Pack A has 6 'first pick' games from 38 rounds and B has 9 first picks. Package D is the 4pm Sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 'first pick' games. Package E is the 'Monday night football' (8pm) bundle, with 18 games on Mondays plus 10 on Fridays; this is the first time Premier League games will be shown live on Friday evenings. There are no first picks in this package. Package G is a bundle of 14 games on Bank Holidays and other Sunday matches with two first picks. THE PACKAGES BT SPORT WON . Package B has 28 games at tea-time on Saturdays (5.30pm) Packages F has 14 games, a mix of midweek and Saturday games including three first picks. Under the current ongoing deals Sky have paid £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season, or in other words, get 348 games at £6,551,724 each. BT have paid £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season, or in other words, get 114 games at £6,473,684 each. 50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs . 25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis, determined by final league positions . 25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches . NICK HARRIS . Sky may also have been encouraged to move ahead with price rises now after recent quarterly results showed the number of people leaving the platform had reduced. 'The experience of Canal+ in France suggests losing rights does not impact subscriber volumes, but does impair pricing power,' Citi said. The analysts said the price rises could result in an around 10 percent increase to earnings per share.

"Manchester United youngster Andreas Pereira offered a student £10,000 for a threesome with him and Old Trafford team-mate Paddy McNair, it was reported on Thursday. The Belgian-born Brazilian, who made his Barclays Premier League debut on Sunday against Tottenham, allegedly offered 19-year-old Kelly McKinney cash to spend the night with him and McNair after she met the United squad at their Christmas party. Pereira is also said to have invited Kelly to his home for sex days before his Premier League debut, mentioning that he was with two other members of the first-team squad. Kelly McKinney was offered £10,000 by Andreas Pereira (right) for a threesome with him and Paddy McNair . Fellow United player McNair is not suggested to have been involved in the messages sent by Pereira . The messages said to have been sent by Pereira (left, in white) and student Kelly (right, green) McNair is not suggested to have been involved in or aware of the sending of Pereira's messages. Kelly told The Sun: 'I nearly fell off my chair when he offered me £10,000 for a threesome. What kind of low-life does that? I'm not that kind of person at all and found it very, very insulting. 'He's clearly desperate and struggling to find anyone that he doesn't have to pay for a sex.' Kelly claims that Pereira tracked her down on Twitter after the team's Christmas party at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester where she was invited to the VIP area to drink with the other players. In a series of WhatsApp messages, the midfielder allegedly asked if she wanted to meet with him and McNair  before she responded questioning what he meant. The Belgian-born Brazilian messaged Kelly after meeting her at United's Christmas party in Manchester, saying 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each' Pereira made his Premier League debut against Tottenham in United's 3-0 win on Sunday . Pereira is said to have replied: 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each.' It remains to be seen whether Louis van Gaal will punish Pereira for his behaviour, with the starlet having embarrassed his manager in a week when he has been full of praise for the 19-year-old's class on the field. 'When you are 19 and already in the squad of Manchester United, then you must have a big talent otherwise you would not be in there,' Van Gaal said. 'I am very happy that I could give him his Premier League debut.' United's players met Kelly in the VIP area on a Christmas night out at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester . United manager Louis van Gaal had high praise for Pereira's work on the pitch after Sunday's game . Pereira's agent Leo Scheinkman said: 'He is young and single and can have sex with whoever he wants. What does he have to apologise for?' Pereira is yet to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, with his current deal expiring in the summer and top clubs from around Europe ready to swoop. Juventus, who took former United youngster Paul Pogba on a free transfer from United in 2012, are said to be interested with French champions Paris Saint-Germain also keen.","Andreas Pereira made his Premier League debut for United against Spurs .

"The sister of convicted rapist Ched Evans is set to appear on the next series of Big Brother. Kylie Evans, 30, who has drawn public condemnation in the past after appearing on television to defend her sibling, was apparently selected after being fast-tracked through the early phases. Former Manchester City striker Evans has been trying to restart his career since he was sacked by old club Sheffield United after being convicted of rape in 2012. And his sister looks set to be named on Big Brother, according to The Sun. Ched Evans used to play for Sheffield United before he was convicted of rape and his contract was severed . It was believed that Sheffield United were planning to sign him again as a free agent, but after a public outcry the club said it had no plans to bring him to Bramall Lane. A proposed move to Oldham Athletic also fell apart due to negative media coverage, and Evans has yet to find another club to take him. Ms Evans allegedly plans to use the appearance to try to convince the public of her brother's innocence after he served time in jail for rape. The former Wales international started his career at Manchester City and scored against Portsmouth . She caused outrage when she appeared on ITV's This Morning alongside Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, to claim her brother was innocent while he was still behind bars. According to The Sun, Ms Evans was fast tracked through the early auditioning phases after securing the services of a professional agent. Endemol, the TV production company behind the Channel 5 reality show, could not be reached for comment on the controversy. Kylie Evans is believed to have been fast tracked through the application stages of the reality show . Evans was found guilty after he went to a hotel room in Rhyl, south Wales, after being messaged by fellow footballer Clayton McDonald saying he had 'got a bird'. Once there Evans had sex with the girl, who says she has no memory of the incident. Evans claims the sex was consensual, but a jury ruled otherwise. McDonald was acquitted, but Evans was jailed for five years. He was released late last year while continuing to protest his innocence. Evans pictured in Cheshire yesterday with his fiancée Natasha Massey, apparently wearing a solid gold Rolex . He continues to protest his innocence, largely via a website set up and funded by the millionaire father of his girlfriend, to whom he is now engaged. The footballer's sister has been one of his most outspoken supporters since his conviction, and has publicly challenged high-profile figures who oppose his return to football. After Sky Sports presenter Charlie Webster threatened to resign as a patron of Sheffield United if they took Evans back, his sister called her a 'hypocrite' because Ms Webster had previously written positively about convicted rapist Mike Tyson.","Ched Evans' sister is set to appear on the next series of Big Brother .

"A new and unlikely fashion trend has emerged in Colorado for sporting jewelry in the shape of IUDs - birth control implants otherwise known as intrauterine devices. Wearing the glittery, brightly-colored objects as earrings or, in the case of men, lapel pins, is a show of support for a new bill which would plunge $5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low-income women. The jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative, from web retailer Etsy, and is crafted out of resin by Dr Virginia Smith, an OB-GYN based in Ohio. Trending: Wearing these IUD replicas is a show of support for a new bill which would allocate $5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low-income women in Colorado . IUDs are small T-shaped implants which, when inserted into the uterus, prevent pregnancy from occurring for between three and 12 years, or simply until removed. IUDs (intrauterine devices) are small T-shaped implants which are fitted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. They work by interfering with the way sperm usually fertilize an egg, and are more than 99% effective. IUDs last anywhere between two and 12 years, depending on the type. The implants must be fitted and removed by licensed healthcare providers. Once they are removed, a woman can generally become pregnant straight away. The Colorado Family Planning Initiative has handed out an estimated 30,000 of these contraceptives since its inception in 2009, and up until now, has been grant-funded. According to ThinkProgress, this program has contributed to a 40per cent drop in teen births over the past five years. The new legislation, expected to be introduced on Friday, would allocate $5million of state funds to the cause, allowing IUDs to be fitted for free or at little cost in 68 clinics across Colorado. Some conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers, however, stand against the program, with some - including Republican Senator Kevin Lundberg - even incorrectly claiming IUDs cause abortions. Dr Jennifer Hyer, a Denver-based OB-GYN, dismissed these claims as neither 'medically' nor 'scientifically' accurate, in a statement distributed by NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado. 'They are among the most effective forms of contraception, especially for at-risk women, because they automatically prevent pregnancy,' she said. Glittery: The resin jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the bill, from web retailer Etsy, and is made by Dr Virginia Smith, an OB-GYN based in Ohio . Republican House Rep. Don Coram is actually in disagreement with members of his own party on this issue, and has taken to wearing one of Dr Smith's IUD pins on his lapel as a sign of his support for the bill. 'A redneck Republican wearing an IUD - it just doesn't make sense does it?' Mr Coram told The Herald. 'Seriously though, I think this is one of the most important bills we are looking at.' Dr Smith, who has seen business for her IUD jewelry go through the roof recently, told ABC's 7News Denver: 'I think women should have access to options and so if this promotes access to options then I think that is a good thing.'","The earrings and lapel pins, which cost $20, are sold on Etsy and made by Dr Virginia Smith, an Ohio-based OB-GYN .

"Retired footballer Pat van den Hauwe has revealed how he once pointed a gun at a man's head and considered pulling the trigger - all because he owed him £100. The former Everton, Tottenham and Birmingham defender, now 54, used to carry a '38 snub' gun after being given it for protection by a friend. And, after being angered by the man in a chance meeting outside a pub, Van den Hauwe admits that he was tempted to use the weapon. Pat van den Hauwe, pictured in action for Everton, has revealed how he once almost shot a man over £100 . The Belgium-born defender also enjoyed a successful spell with Tottenham, winning the FA Cup in 1991 . Van den Hauwe lifts the European Cup-winners' Cup and Division One trophy at Goodison Park in 2010 . Clubs: Birmingham (1978-84), Everton (1984-89), Tottenham (1989-93), Millwall (1993-95) Honours: Division One title (Everton, 1985), Cup Winners' Cup (Everton, 1985), FA Cup (Tottenham, 1991) International Caps (Wales): 14 . In an interview with the set pieces, the former Wales international said: 'I used to wear an ankle strap and at night if I went out, I carried it. There was just one incident, some guy who owed me money. 'He kept ducking me and ducking me and after I'd had a few drinks and god knows what, I bumped into him outside a pub. I said ""Where's me money?"" and because he was a black belt in karate I thought ""I'm not gonna f*** around with this"". 'He said to me ""Well, what you gonna do about it?"" and you know when I lose my temper, I lose my temper. 'So I just turned around, put me leg up on the wall, pulled me gun out and pointed it at his head. Then I looked up to him and said, ""What are you gonna f****** do now then?' Now 54, Van den Hauwe played for Spurs for four seasons before leaving to join Millwall in 1993 . The former Wales international chats with ex-Everton boss Howard Kendall at an event back in 2012 . Van den Hauwe, known as 'Psycho' among fans, clashes with Nottingham Forest's David Campbell in 1986 . 'I had a moment where it was touch and go, and, I really thought to myself ""Before I do the ultimate wrong thing, it's time to give it back,"" you know? Because once it goes wrong there, you're banged up for life. I had to think seriously about it. I'm not a violent person anyway, you know what I mean?' Van den Hauwe, who won the Division One title and European Cup Winners' Cup with Everton in 1985 and the FA Cup with Spurs in 1991, is now living in South Africa after suffering with depression. And he insists that the gun incident, although potentially dangerous, altered his life for the better. 'I would say, that incident, carrying it, pulling it, p****** about with it, it was just a matter of time for me. I think it was a life changing thing. It calmed me down,' he added.","Pat van den Hauwe retired in 1997 after a career of nearly 20 years .

"Kevin Pietersen has been given no assurances about a return to England’s set-up in a phone call with the new power- broker of English cricket. Mixed messages coming out of the ECB have left the impression the door is open to the maverick batsman, who was sacked last year after the Ashes debacle. But incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who takes over from Pietersen’s arch-opponent Giles Clarke on May 15, has spoken to the 34-year-old and made it clear there are no guarantees — even if he scores heavily for Surrey on his expected county comeback. Kevin Pietersen will return to Surrey in the summer to play in the LV= County Championship . Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has made it clear there are no guarantees . Graves, who instigated the conversation, hoped to keep it confidential but the tenor of the chat was that Pietersen’s England future rests entirely with the selectors, who would consider form as well as other aspects — such as upsetting team spirit — when picking the Test side this summer. A number of players, led by captain Alastair Cook, would strongly resist a KP comeback. Though Graves told Pietersen he would not interfere with selection, having never done so as chairman of Yorkshire, Pietersen (right) remains so enthused about the slim possibility of playing for England again that he will commit himself to Surrey this season. He said while commentating on Test Match Special at the World Cup: ‘If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England, then it’s something I want to do.’ Surrey still have to agree the detail of Pietersen’s re-engagement but he is expected to fulfil at least some of his £205,000 IPL contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad. He would then need some practice in red-ball cricket, which he last played in the Sydney Test of January 2014 that completed the 5-0 Ashes whitewash. Pietersen has hinted he could change his IPL contract in a bid to push for an England place . After playing for the Big Bash League's Melbourne Stars, Pietersen has signed with the Sunrisers Hyderabad . England cricket managing director Paul Downton said he watched every ball of that game and had never seen a player so disengaged from his team-mates. Given the strong opposition of Downton and chairman of selectors James Whitaker, Pietersen’s hopes boil down to the side doing so badly against the West Indies and New Zealand in the next two Test series that radical changes are considered for the Ashes, which starts in July. Former England captain Michael Vaughan has called England’s current situation a ‘soap opera’, and says the team need to beat the West Indies 3-0 to stop talk of a Pietersen comeback. ‘It is clear that for Kevin to have any hope of playing for England — and it is only a small hope — he has to play county cricket and we will see what happens,’ Vaughan said on TMS. ‘The game needs a change, it needs someone to come in and say the past is the past and to start afresh. Graves is clearly going to do that. Obviously it’s going to ruffle a few feathers but maybe that’s what they need. ‘Maybe this is a fantastic motivational tool. If the team don’t want Pietersen in the side then go to the West Indies and win 3-0. Play better, score more runs and win more games and Pietersen will never play again.’","Kevin Pietersen will line up for Surrey in the LV= County Championship .

"Harry Kane has revealed he can't believe a 'crazy' year at Tottenham has culminated in his first call-up for the senior England squad. Kane was given the nod by Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson for the forthcoming Euro qualifier with Lithuania, followed by the friendly with Italy after bagging 26 goals 42 games for Spurs this season. The Chingford-born forward was a regular on the Tottenham bench until November, but has blossomed from bit-part player into one of the Premier League's most deadly strikers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Kane's interview with Spurs TV . Tottenham striker Harry Kane has earned his first call up to the England squad following a fine run of form . The 21-year-old, pictured in action against Manchester United, could face Lithuania and Italy this month . Kane scores his second goal of the game against QPR - his 26th in all competitions this season . Kane said: 'I haven't had time to sit down and think about what's happened. It's obviously been a hectic season - a lot has been happening, but I'm enjoying every minute of it and I just want it to continue. 'It's crazy how things can change in football in such a short space of time. I can remember coming off the bench against Benfica and nearly getting that big comeback win away from home. 'But we're here now and it's crazy, but it's what I've always wanted to achieve.' Hodgson - who made the announcement at Wembley Stadium - also called-up his team-mates Kyle Walker and Andros Townsend to the 24-man squad. 'I think the whole country is excited about Harry,' said the England boss. 'It would have been a surprise if he wasn't selected.' Kane is refusing to allow himself to get carried away, but has set his sights firmly on winning that all-important first cap, despite competition coming from Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. England boss Roy Hodgson announces his 24-man squad during a press conference at Wembley Stadium . Kane took to Twitter on Thursday to talk of his pride at being called up to Hodgson's senior squad . Kane, pictured celebrating at Loftus Road, has more Premier League goals than any Englishman this season . 'It's a very proud moment for me and my family. It's an honour to be called up to the senior side and something I always dreamed of as a kid, when I got the message I was full of joy and hope it's the first of many. 'I'll be aiming to go there and compete for places, try and get myself into the team. There's a lot of great players there and I know that.'

"The Football Association are confident the FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Reading will draw a much larger television audience than Manchester United’ s Premier League trip to Chelsea after revealing the matches will clash. Just 10 minutes separate the kick-off times of two of the biggest games this season, with the FA Cup encountering an awkward conflict on what is supposed to be a standout weekend for the competition. Arsenal face Reading at Wembley on Saturday April 18 at 5.20pm for a place in the FA Cup final, with Chelsea hosting United at Stamford Bridge at 5.30pm the same evening in a hugely important Premier League encounter.

Much of the build-up to that slot will focus on Jose Mourinho facing Louis van Gaal, with points on the line for the title race and Champions League qualification. Arsenal’s game against Championship Reading may play second fiddle in the eyes of many neutral football fans. But FA sources insist viewing figures for their match, broadcast on the BBC, will far outstrip the Premier League contest shown on Sky.

"Mixed martial arts is the biggest growing sport in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a buzzing story. Their five-star Mobile App 'Team Stream' helps you follow the MMA 24-7: DOWNLOAD NOW . Ryan LaFlare will put his undefeated record on the line against crafty veteran Demian Maia this Saturday at UFC Fight Night 62. It will be his toughest test to date and a chance to prove he's a real title threat. Unlike many fighters currently competing in the UFC, including guys like Jon Jones and Demetrious Johnson, LaFlare has never tasted professional defeat. Here is our pick of the best unbeaten fighters right now. Ryan LaFlare will be hoping to make it 12 from 12 when he takes on Demian Maia at UFC Fight Night 62 . Veteran fighter Maia (left), pictured fighting Alexander Yakovlev, will pose a real threat to LaFlare's record . 1. Ronda Rousey - It's difficult to imagine a world where Rousey is not undefeated. So long as the champ's focus remains on MMA and not becoming the next Audrey Hepburn, her Octagon success should only continue to flourish. And yes, that includes a potential showdown with Cristiane 'Cyborg' Justino's heavy artillery. Ronda Rousey can keep her unbeaten UFC record going unless her attention is taken by acting . 2. Chris Weidman - At this point in his career, having capped off two victories over Anderson Silva with an impeccable title defense over Lyoto Machida at UFC 175, there's no denying how good UFC middleweight kingpin Weidman truly is. When healthy, Weidman is a pound-for-pound force who is arguably the most complete champion in the sport today. Vitor Belfort, Luke Rockhold, the winner of Ronaldo Souza vs. Yoel Romero and possibly Machida stand in Weidman's way from securing one of the most impressive Octagon runs of all time. Chris Weidman is arguably the sport's most complete fighter and could be on his way to making UFC history . 3. Khabib Nurmagomedov - Aka The Eagle, aka Mr. Funny Hat, aka Last Guy to Beat Rafael Dos Anjos, is MMA's Red Star. Equipped with some of the best wrestling the lightweight division has ever seen, the 26-year-old combines power and tenacity to pulverize his opponents. With victories over current divisional champ Dos Anjos, veterans Gleison Tibau and Pat Healy and the hard-hitting Abel Trujillo, the Russian's 26-0 record is gaining quite the accolades. Khabib Nurmagomedov (right), who also goes by many nicknames, is one of best wrestlers ever seen . 4. Joanna Jedrzejczyk - There's something about the current UFC women's strawweight champion that suggests she'll be the division's titleholder for a very long time. She's young, lean, athletic and cocky enough to keep even the most casual of fight fans interested in a 115-pound female. Undefeated at 9-0, the Polish Princess has dissected her opponents with unparalleled striking consisting of perfectly timed combinations, body strikes and suffocating pressure. Joanna Jedrzejczyk remains undefeated in nine fights and doesn't look like being beaten any time soon .

Get news for your teams all in one place and get real-time alerts for breaking stories. DOWNLOAD NOW. 5. Paul Felder – The UFC lightweight Felder has come out of nowhere. Unranked and undefeated, the Irish Dragon is quietly flying under the radar coming into his fight with Jim Miller at UFC on Fox 15. But with versatile striking, knockout power and budding grappling skills, Felder will ultimately force his way into the limelight. Paul Felder has come from nowhere to take the UFC lightweight division by storm . 6. Bethe Correia - It's unlikely that she has what it takes to defeat champion Rousey. Even with the best power punching in the women's bantamweight division, the confident Brazilian has struggled to maintain the composure and patience it would take to win the title. Her resume certainly commands respect, but it only took Rousey 16 seconds in a recent title defense opposite Cat Zingano to beat a contender with the same 9-0 record. Brazilian Bethe Correia (left) packs a powerful punch but still might not be strong enough for Rousey . 7. Ryan LaFlare - Even with a record of 11-0 (4-0 in the UFC), rising welterweight LaFlare has yet to earn undivided respect. Due in part to his inability to capture a Octagon finish thus far, the wrestling-based 31-year-old needs to show a little 'flair' to make noise in a talent-rich division. But with an excellent ground game and budding striking skills, the New Yorker slightly resembles a less accomplished Weidman. The jury is still out over LaFlare, especially since he has not managed an Octagon finish so far in his career .","Ryan LaFlare faces Demian Maia at UFC Fight Night 62 on Saturday .
Rising welterweight star LaFlare is undefeated in 11 fights .

"After leading Barcelona to Champions League victory against Manchester City at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night Lionel Messi hit back at those that criticised him earlier in the season before celebrating Spanish Father's Day with his family. The Argentina international's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo posted a picture to her Instagram account on Thursday morning wishing him 'Happy Father's Day'. Roccuzzo and two-year-old son Thiago each planted a kiss on Messi's cheek as the trio posed for a family selfie to mark the occasion. Lionel Messi poses for a family selfie on Thursday to celebrate Spanish Father's Day . Messi taunts the Man City defence on the edge of the penalty area during a classy performance . The night before Messi had produced another stunning performance and brilliantly set up Ivan Rakitic to score the only goal of the game as Barca reached the Champions League quarter-final for a record eighth consecutive season. Earlier in the season, however, Messi was subjected to intense scrutiny as he and Barcelona struggled for form. He was beaten to the Ballon d'Or trophy by Cristiano Ronaldo as rumours of transfer surfaced. But any concerns that Messi's star was fading have well and truly been dispelled since the turn of the year and, after the City game, he was quick to remind his detractors of the criticism he received. Messi joins in the celebrations with Rakitic and Luis Suarez of Barcelona's first-half goal at the Nou Camp . Messi tries to take the ball around the onrushing Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart who makes the save . 'A short while ago I was supposed to be a disaster, it's tricky to go from being a disaster to the best form of ones career,' Messi told Canal+ after the game. During Wednesday's last-16 second leg, although Messi ran the City defence ragged, he met his match against Joe Hart. The England No 1 produced one of the great Champions League goalkeeping performances to thwart Messi with several fine stops. Had it not been for Hart's heroics it could have been a humiliating defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side and Messi, in typically sporting fashion, was quick to congratulate him. Hart thwarts Messi again as the Manchester City goalkeeper kept his side in the game . Argentina international Messi and Hart acknowledge each other's performances with a hand shake . 'He saved everything. We did all we could to score more goals but the keeper played fantastically well and I’d like to congratulate him. The most important thing was to make it through.' Barcelona now turn their attention to the small matter of the Clasico on Sunday with a chance to open up a four-point lead over Real Madrid in La Liga, but Messi is expecting a tough match. 'One has to respect them and their current form makes them more dangerous. I wouldn’t say that they’re not in good shape or lacking form. On an individual basis they have great players. We’ll just try and play our game.'","Barcelona beat Manchester City 1-0 to progress in Champions League .

"A football match was called off after just 58 seconds when the referee realised he could not see his linesmen due to intense fog. The top-of-the-table clash between St Austell and Bodmin in Cornwall on Wednesday had already been delayed due to poor weather when referee Neil Hunnisett decided to get on with the game. But it was called off less than a minute later, making it one of the shortest games in football history. A top-of-the-table clash between St Austell and Bodmin in Cornwall on Wednesday had to be called off after just 58 seconds due to intense fog which blanketed the pitch . Referee Neil Hunnisett had already been forced to delay the game due to the poor weather, and was keen to get on with the Carlsberg South-West Peninsula match, but eventually had to concede defeat . Local league official Mike Sampson said: 'When we arrived in St Austell it was hard to see out of the windows. I had to put my glasses on to eat my pasty.' He added: 'We only knew the game had kicked off because the whistle went. The linesman put his flag up and it took the referee 58 seconds to see him.' Home team St Austell said they would refund all 150 fans who turned out for South West Peninsula League game. Mr Hunnisett defended his decision to start the game and claimed: 'I've officiated in worse. I wanted to see if the fog would clear.' He told BBC Radio Cornwall: 'I could have called the game off when I got to the ground. 'My two assistants and assessor went along with my decision to start. However, just prior to kick-off it was very apparent I had probably made the wrong decision. Spot the players: Concealed somewhere in this image are the match officials and starting 11 players from both teams lined up shortly before the kickoff . Mr Hunnisett was forced to end the game when he realised he couldn't see his linesmen, making it one of the shortest games in football history . 'Do I feel bad? Of course I do. I was looking forward to this game as it's a big appointment and I am aware that St Austell have a bottleneck of fixtures too.' Mr. Sampson added: 'The fans were very good about it. St Austell refunded all their money and everybody was very good about it. 'It was a very important game in the league. 'St Austell's games are piling up, they'll be playing three or four times a week come the end of the season, so to be fair to the referee he tried everything he could to get it on.' Local league official Mike Sampson, who came to watch the match from the touchline, said he only knew the game had started after hearing the referee's whistle as he couldn't see the centre circle . This game is not the quickest to be called off, as a 1998 World Cup qualifier between Scotland and Estonia finished after three seconds when the Estonian team boycotted in a row over floodlights . St Austell, who are through to the semi-finals of the FA Vase, are fourth in the league and have eight games in hand on leaders Saltash United, who are 13 points ahead. The game is expected to be rearranged in April. However this game was not the quickest-ever to be called off. A 1998 World Cup qualifier between Estonia and Scotland was abandoned after three seconds .

"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has reassured Danny Ings that the door is still open to a senior England call-up if his rise to stardom continues. Ings has emerged as one of the most exciting young strikers in the country alongside Tottenham’s Harry Kane this season, and has been linked with moves to Liverpool and Manchester City when his contract at Burnley runs out in the summer. But while Kane was called up for the first time on Thursday when Roy Hodgson named his squad to face Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month, Ings had to be satisfied with a place in the Under-21 party. Burnley striker Danny Ings was left out of Roy Hodgson's England squad despite his recent good form . Ings' manager at club level, Sean Dyche, said he is sure Ings is in England's thoughts and told him to push on . The young striker has become a big part of the England Under 21 set up and is in Gareth Southgate's squad . ‘I’m not surprised,’ said Dyche. ‘I’d like to think he’s in their thoughts and in and around their thinking. ‘There are lots of other players out there doing well. Obviously the main one is Harry Kane. ‘I would certainly promote them to continue monitoring him because I think he’s got a freshness to the way he plays and is different to a lot of centre-forwards who would be considered. ‘We’ve enjoyed what he’s doing here and he’s definitely learning. That’s the big thing when you’re a young player, and particularly playing at this level. Are you getting used to it? Are you learning? Overall he has. ‘There are no guarantees. It’s for Roy Hodgson and his staff to decide. As long as he keeps progressing, he’ll certainly always be in their thinking.’ Ings' contract at Turf Moor expires at the end of the season but Dyche wants him to push on for Burnley . The Clarets boss was not surprised to see Ings left out of the senior set-up considering the depth of forwards . Ings’s strike partner Sam Vokes has been recalled to the Wales squad for the first time in more than a year for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel, just a few days after making his first Premier League appearance for Burnley in last weekend’s surprise win over Manchester City. Vokes, 25, missed the first five months of the season with a knee injury and Dyche admits the player is still getting back to his best. He added: ‘I’m sure judging by how Sam operated last week that he’s well and truly on his way to full match fitness. I don’t expect it to happen overnight, it’s down to the game time we can give him when we think it’s appropriate. Hodgson opted for Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck as his strikers . Ings and Kane (right) are  key members of the side for Southgate (left) ahead of the European Championships . ‘I spoke to Chris (Coleman) and let him know where he was at. I said it was touch and go whether he started (against City), and I did start him. ‘I still think there is more to come from him – that true match fitness that can only come from games – so we’ll try and be wise with that. ‘It’s important with a player’s recovery to be given time. That has paid itself back with a reasonable, if not a good performance actually, last week. There is still more to come as he gets used to this level and the sharpness returns.’ Sam Vokes has been named in Wales' squad for their upcoming games after over a year out of the set-up .

"France are coming to Twickenham to take on England in the Six Nations finale this weekend, but Olivier Giroud showed there is already one Frenchman in London with rugby ability. The Arsenal striker was eager to show off his keep-ups skills, which were impressive, despite using a rugby ball. The Gunners frontman managed 29 kick-ups before losing control of the ball and shrieking in frustration. Olivier Giroud, with team-mates watching on, attempts to do keep-ups with a rugby ball . The French striker made a reasonable stab at the attempt, keeping the oval ball under control . Although he eventually began to lose his composure, the French star showed plenty of rugby skill . Giroud eventually lost control of the ball after 29 keep-ups, a strong effort with the tough ball . Giroud, who missed a large part of the season with injury, has been in superb form recently, scoring seven times in his last eight games. He was on target against Monaco on Tuesday night as Arsenal attempted to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Champions League last 16, but fell just short. On Thursday the 28-year-old was named in France's squad to play Brazil and Denmark next week. The 28-year-old scored Arsenal's first goal in the 2-0 win over Monaco at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday . But despite his goal, France striker Giroud was not able to inspire his team to an aggregate victory .","Giroud shows off his skills with rugby ball after Arsenal training .

"Sam Allardyce is more bothered about winning points than playing attractive football and has confirmed defender James Tomkins will be out for the remainder of the season. West Ham have won just one Barclays Premier League match in 12 and questions have been asked about whether Allardyce will remain in charge beyond his contract, which expires at the end of the season. The Hammers face a Sunderland team under new management on Saturday after Dick Advocaat replaced sacked boss Gus Poyet at the Stadium of Light on Tuesday. James Tomkins will be out for the remainder of the season after having surgery on his shoulder problem . Sam Allardyce is more concerned about picking up points rather than playing attractive football . Big Sam will be without Tomkins after the defender needed surgery on a dislocated shoulder suffered in training, while Winston Reid will be assessed on Saturday following his hamstring problem. Yet the good news for West Ham is that goalkeeper Adrian and Carlton Cole will be available for selection against Sunderland in a game Allardyce feels is a must win. 'Carl comes back into the fray. We're going to wait a little longer for Winston,' the West Ham boss. 'He's still a little way off with a hamstring problem, and we're prepared to wait until Saturday morning to see what it is. 'Our squad is suffering a little bit at the moment. We can't feel sorry for ourselves. It's about overcoming it and winning results, starting Saturday against Sunderland.

The bottom line is playing fantastic is great but not winning is crucial. Critical. 'We have a big problem in winning football matches at the moment. Our goal is to win football matches. The most important thing for Saturday is for us to gain victory.

"Drink-drive: Estate agent Tina Knowles crashed into a pipe in a petrol station forecourt while drunk . An estate agent faces jail after she crashed her BMW into a petrol pump on a garage forecourt while she was more than four times over the drink-driving limit. Tina Knowles was apparently on her mobile phone when she careered into the petrol station and smashed into a large pipe used to release vapour from underground fuel tanks. The garage in Driffield, Yorkshire had to be evacuated over fears the crash could endanger the public, a court heard. In aftermath of the accident, Knowles, 43, remained in the car talking on the phone, slurring her words and ignoring the garage attendant. David Ward, prosecuting, told Beverley Magistrates' Court that forecourt attendant Rebecca Roberts was looking out of her kiosk when she saw Knowles 'shoot across' in her silver BMW Z4. He continued: 'It drove across the forecourt without stopping and collided with a substantial metal vapour release pump opposite the kiosk. 'The female driver appeared to be on a mobile phone at the time. Miss Roberts was initially ignored by the female driver. 'Miss Roberts could smell alcohol on her breath. She was very drunk. She could not talk properly and was slurring her words. 'Miss Roberts said to turn off the petrol pumps immediately for public safety.' The court heard that Knowles was led into the garage's shop as staff took her keys off her and waited for police to arrive. The estate agent 'became emotional' after the police were called, Mr Ward said, adding: 'She started sobbing. She said, ""It's my car. I've f***ed up. I'm an alcoholic.""' A breath test revealed that she had 152 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35. Mr Ward said: 'Police were so concerned about the amount of alcohol she had drunk that they sent her to hospital to check for alcohol poisoning. 'They had never seen anyone drink that much before and get in a car and drive.' Crash: Knowles smashed into a venting pump at this petrol station in Driffield, Yorkshire . Car: The estate agent was driving a silver BMW Z4 similar to this one at the time of the accident . Knowles, from Driffield, pleaded guilty to drink driving and breach of bail after she missed a scheduled court appearance this week because she was in a rehab clinic. The court heard that last year she was spared a driving ban after she was convicted of failing to provide a specimen of breath. Knowles has now been banned from driving ahead of a sentencing hearing next month, which could see her sent to prison. Defending solicitor Rachel Davies said: 'There's clearly a lot of issues in her life. She freely accepts she's an alcoholic and needs help and support.'","Tina Knowles, 43, drove into Yorkshire petrol station at high speed .

"Crisis-hit Serie A club Parma were declared bankrupt on Thursday with estimated debts of 100 million euros (£72.4m). It took just 10 minutes for an Italian court to make the decision and it is not known whether the club, who are bottom of Serie A, will now finish the season. However, there is a plan in place with the league's governing body and the Italian football federation to fund the club for the rest of the campaign. Parma's new president Giampietro Manenti was arrested for alleged involvement in money laundering . Parma's new owner and president, Giampietro Manenti, was not present following his arrest on Wednesday on charges of money laundering and embezzlement. The court appointed accountants Angelo Anedda and Alberto Guiotto as receivers. 'I believe we'll play on Sunday against Torino,' board member Osvaldo Riccobene told reporters at the end of the hearing. Parma's players and staff haven't been paid in months, with players having to do their own laundry and drive the team bus while games were postponed because the club could not afford stewards or police at their Tardini stadium. Players also refused to play after Manenti failed to fulfil a promise to pay them by mid-February. Captain Alessandro Lucarelli said: ‘I hope sooner or later this all ends because honestly we can’t take any more.’ Manenti became the third owner of Parma this season after purchasing the club for a nominal sum from a Russian-Cypriot group in February. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Manenti is under investigation for various acts of financial irregularity including money laundering and fraud.

"He might be a strapping 6ft 2"" but compared to the man mountains who make up the England rugby side, Prince Harry is a mere minnow. Perhaps with that in mind, Harry declined an invitation to show off his ball skills during a training session this morning and stayed safely on the sidelines instead.

Standing with head coach Stuart Lancaster, the 30-year-old Prince exchanged quips with the players before watching the action in an official England jacket and jeans. Despite his proficiency in the art of banter, Harry kept talk of tactics to a minimum, according to Lancaster. 'He was just there as a supporter to observe what we were doing,' said the England coach. 'There were no motivational talks.' Nevertheless, Harry will also at Twickenham for Saturday's match and will watch two girls' rugby teams from Reigate School and Quest Academy face off ahead of the main match.

"Whoever agreed to schedule Aston Villa’s FA Cup quarter-final with West Bromwich Albion at 5.30 on a Saturday evening showed a dangerous lack of foresight. It seems nobody at the Football Association, the BBC, the clubs or West Midlands Police seriously considered that trouble might follow a day off work when fans of the two local rivals had all afternoon to drink. That miscalculation contributed significantly to scenes described by several former players as from the 1970s — pitch invasions, seats ripped out and used as weapons, players barged and forced to fight their way to the sanctuary of the dressing rooms. Police clash with unruly fans in  scenes reminiscent of the  of the 1970s following Aston Villa's FA Cup defeat of West Brom . West Brom players look concerned as Aston Villa fans invade the pitch at the end of their FA Cup quarter final . Aston Villa fans celebrate by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Fans of both Villa and West Brom behaved irresponsibly and have been condemned by their own clubs. Action will follow. But it is clear questions need to be asked about the way matches that carry the potential to be ‘tasty’, as Tony Pulis described this fixture, are arranged. In the past, police have insisted derbies kick off early in the day. In this instance, the local force claim it was out of their hands, with the decision down to the FA. Sources at English football’s governing body say scheduling is a collaborative effort, including police guidance. The wishes of broadcasters play a huge part and evening slots are good for ratings. It is the reason some Arsenal fans will find it impossible to get back to London from Manchester by train. Insufficient numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-finals . Villa fans leap over hoardings at the final whistle - while the decision to stage the game at 5.30pm is being questioned . But the BBC, who reportedly paid up to £120million for the rights to show the world’s oldest competition over four years, declined to accept responsibility. A spokesman said: ‘Both West Brom and Villa, along with the police, agreed to the kick-off time and raised no objections.’ If this was a ball rather than the buck, Villa boss Tim Sherwood would be pleased at how quickly it was being passed. Following the match, the national lead officer for football policing appeared on BBC Radio 5Live, and he questioned the decision to play the match on a weekend evening. 'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he said. West Brom manager had described the Midlands derby fixture as 'tasty' ahead of the game . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . 'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. 'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor. 'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good. 'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously. 'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.' The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle . Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Fans sing and chant on the pitch following Aston Villa's win during what has been a disappointing season . West Brom sources suggested the kick-off time did cause concern but no formal objection was made. Similar timings have been used before for derbies but with 6,500 West Brom fans travelling across town on Saturday — significantly more than usual — the risk of trouble was surely increased. Villa face the prospect of a fine in the region of £100,000 for failing to adequately control hundreds of fans who ran on to the pitch before referee Anthony Taylor blew for full-time. The top-end punishment would be a partial stadium closure. The FA have launched an investigation and will ask why only a dozen or so stewards were at the Holte End corner where Villa fans burst on to the pitch, causing a two-minute delay. There had been invasions after both goals and the final 60 seconds were played out with a mass of people congregated on the sidelines. Thousands spilled on when Villa’s win was confirmed. Many were in a celebratory mood, wishing to hug their players, even if first goalscorer Fabian Delph was inadvertently bitten by fans overly eager to plant a kiss. On this basis, pitch invasions have been previously celebrated. But there was a sinister undercurrent too. Many wanted to goad beaten opponents. Albion goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was repeatedly shoved in a confrontational manner. A group encircled him, filming on their mobiles. He picked one phone up and chucked it away. Aston Villa players Leandro Bacuna (centre) and Jack Grealish (right) are mobbed by fans after the game . Goalscorer Fabian Delph claims fans nicked his captain's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion . West Brom forward Callum McManaman is escorted off the field after a row with an Aston Villa fan . Callum McManaman had to be shepherded to safety after an altercation with a Villa fan left him shaken, while sub keeper Ben Foster had a finger pushed in his face. Even those who feel pitch invasions can joyously mark a momentous occasion must recognise the inherent danger of Saturday night. During the 93rd-minute surge those who remained in their seats booed loudly. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore said on talkSport: ‘Absolute disgrace, drunken yobs besmirching the name of Villa.’ Mark Lawrenson, commentating on the BBC, said: ‘There are not enough stewards at the Holte End. There are about 15. It’s like a scene from the 1980s all over again.’ An Aston Villa supporter is escorted off by stewards after invading the pitch before full time . Sinclair is crowded by Aston Villa supporters after scoring his goal in the 2-0 victory . There appeared to be almost three times as many stewards at the other end, forming a line in front of the North Stand housing West Brom fans above those supporting Villa. Those seating arrangements have been questioned after one fan was left with a bloody wound when a seat ripped from the tier above hit him on the head. Kevin Phillips, who played for both clubs, said: ‘Seeing those seats come down, it could kill someone. Those people should be found and banned.’ A West Brom statement read: ‘The club is aware of reports of serious misbehaviour involving some of its own supporters. It issues an uncompromising reminder that any supporter found guilty of disorder can expect the appropriate sanction from the club. We will continue to operate zero tolerance to any fans who bring the club’s reputation into disrepute.’ Privately, West Brom were perplexed about the seating arrangements. A match against fierce rivals from across town, finishing as night descended, was always going to carry an edge. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood admitted he could understand the fans' emotions after the victory . The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass . Also of concern will be coins thrown at Craig Gardner as he took corners. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is said to have left Villa Park in a rage. No injuries have been reported to West Midlands Police, who said 17 arrests had been made for public order as well as drunk and disorderly offences. Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson said a probe had also been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub, down the road from Villa Park. Stadium CCTV will be studied as will any footage obtained from the police helicopter. But those investigating should look at themselves.

"Theo Walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new Arsenal contract. Talks over a new deal have begun with the Arsenal forward nearing the final year of his contract. The pacy forward currently earns in the region of £90,000-per-week - but Walcott will ask for a sum significantly north of £100,000-per-week before agreeing to an extension. Theo Walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new Arsenal contract . The pacy forward currently earns in the region of £90,000-per-week but will ask for a sum significantly higher . It remains to be seen whether the Gunners will meet the demands but his current position in Arsene Wenger’s plans may provide an indication. Since returning from a long-term injury, Walcott has struggled for regular football, with the likes of Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all vying for a slot in Wenger’s four attacking positions. Arsenal top-earners Sanchez and Ozil earn in the region of £140,000-per-week. The Emirates Stadium are unlikely to offer Walcott anything near that amount, particularly given his lack of games. His wage demands could lead to another long drawn out contract saga, similar to the discussions for his existing deal which nearly saw Walcott leave before he signed his last contract in January 2013. Liverpool and Manchester City will be monitoring Walcott’s situation closely ahead of a potential summer move.

"Patrick Bamford scored three goals at the iPro Stadium during a successful loan last season that helped Derby County reach Wembley. He claimed another here of an entirely different complexion. The 21-year-old striker, borrowed from Chelsea, delivered the cutting edge to send Middlesbrough five points clear of their promotion rivals. Having taken stick all game from Derby fans who once cheered him, he revelled in celebrating his defining contribution. Too right. Patrick Bamford celebrates as the Chelsea loanee strikes to earn Middlesbrough all three points . In the 64th minute the hosts were caught attempting to play the ball out from the back. Lee Tomlin nicked possession and threaded a pass to send Bamford clear. He stretched to reach it before Lee Grant and looked like he may go over when the Derby goalkeeper spread himself. Instead he kept his feet and his head, slotting a neat finish from a tight angle. His 16th goal of the season. Quite a way to end St Patrick’s Day. George Friend celebrates with Bamford as the away side secure all three points against Derby County . This result will hurt Steve McClaren as much as it satisfies Aitor Karanka. Aiming for automatic promotion, Derby are faltering. The roar from the visiting section at the final whistle told a story. So did the solemnness with which Derby fans vacated their seats. They look set for the play-offs again at this rate. The visitors so nearly took the lead in spectacular style five minutes before the interval.

Will Hughes of Derby and Adam Clayton compete for the ball during the  Championship match . From 40 yards out the Belgian controlled in an instant and lofted the ball high towards the goal. The capacity home crowd seemed to hold its breath as the shot hung in the air, only letting go when the ball dropped to bounce back off the post and into Grant’s arms. It was not a first half to savour for either of these teams with Premier League aspirations.

Booked: Vossen, Clayton . Subs not used: Ripley, Kike, Whitehead, Omeruo . Manager: Aitor Karanka 7 . Referee: Andy D’Urso 6 . Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford . The double absence of Chris Martin and Darren Bent clipped Derby of their attacking focus in the previous three games leading to defeat and two draws. Johnny Russell made a fist of playing the striker’s role again but as a natural winger he does not possess the hold up ability of Martin or predatory instinct on Bent. Middlesbrough’s form entering this match was quite literally hit and miss: win followed loss in their past six games. They have struggled away from the Riverside before this. Derby held greater possession but did not create a much. Their best opening of the first half came in the 15th minute when Tom Ince whipped a cross to the back post to Jamie Ward, who was unable to apply the killer touch from two yards. Boro went straight down the other end with Bamford slipping in Albert Adomah to strike for goal. Grant beat away that effort and then did well to save Bamford’s follow-up too. Five minutes after the break simmering tensions sparked into a mass melee when Jamie Hanson left Grant Leadbitter on the floor with a tackle. When referee Andy D’Urso blew for a stoppage, Vossen squared up to Hanson, prompting a dozen or so to get involved. Vossen and Cyrus Christie were booked for their parts. Bamford had a chance to score before he did, miscuing badly from Adomah’s cross. But the mark of a good striker is showing confidence the next time. Bamford did that. Clayton beats his man to the ball as Middlesbrough secure all three points away against Derby . After his goal McClaren made three changes seeking to salvage something. Jesse Lingard came on and had Derby’s best chance, but dragged wide when the ball fell his way in the box. In injury time Bamford could have doubled his tally, finding himself with a clear run at goal as Derby poured forwards. But as he closed in on Grant, Richard Keogh arrived to block his shot wide. No matter, he was still the match winner.","Patrick Bamford struck in the second-half to earn Middlesbrough the win .

"Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has admitted his failure to invest in the squad in January has left them desperately short of cover as they prepare to face Arsenal with just 13 senior players. Head coach John Carver appeared for Thursday's pre-match press conference with a 4-4-2 line-up of players unavailable to him. It read: Rob Elliot (thigh); Paul Dummett (knee), Fabricio Coloccini (suspended), Steven Taylor (Achilles) Massadio Haidara (knee); Rolando Aarons (hamstring), Cheick Tiote (knee), Mehdi Abeid (thigh), Siem de Jong (lung); Papiss Cisse (suspended), Facundo Ferreyra (back). John Carver revealed that Mike Ashley regrets not investing in the squad in the January transfer window . The Newcastle owner didn't invest in January despite sanctioning the sale of Davide Santon . And Carver says he has been left in a difficult position after United's hierarchy – Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley – decided to allow defenders Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Davide Santon to leave the club in January without bringing in replacements. 'The fact that Lee and Mike have acknowledged that (we are paying the price for not strengthening the squad) doesn't make me feel better, but at least people understand that's what has happened,' said Carver, whose side have won just one in six since the close of the window as he bids to win the job on a permanent basis. 'Now whether it was me or Alan Pardew, if he was still here, that would be the same situation. Mike Williamson and Daryl Janmaat (centre right) are the likely pairing for the upcoming Arsenal match . Captain Fabricio Coloccini (left) was sent off for a reckless lunge and will miss the next three games . 'I have got to deal with that situation and I will. What I won't do is give up on it, I won't think, 'Well, I've got all those people out, that's it, that's me done, I'm not going to get this job'.' And Carver says the board have already made assurances of significant investment in the summer. 'The squad needs to be stronger and they have acknowledged that to me - they know they have to invest,' he said. 'I have been part of it in the last few weeks and there are things in place. That's from the top. They've got to do something about it, and they know that.'

"England’s Euro-flops flipped the hand-wringers into overdrive, like a Le Mans-style dash for their favourite hobby horse as soon as Manchester City’s fate was sealed in Barcelona. Winter breaks, possession statistics, revenue streams, what’s your poison? Or any other hell-in-a-handcart issue which is about to bring down our national game. Two years in three without a team in the Champions League quarter-finals is a worrying trend and the Barclays Premier League will lose its cherished four-team party invite if it cannot be reversed. Yaya Toure's Man City side struggled to impress as they crashed out of the Champions League to Barcelona . Sergio Aguero (left) missed a penalty as City were eliminated 3-1 on aggregate by the Catalan giants . City's defeat would have been much worse if not for the superb form of goalkeeper Joe Hart (right) There is no English presence in the Europa League either after Everton’s harsh lesson in Kiev on Thursday night. Yet in Germany, a similar debate is unfolding because Bayern Munich are the Bundesliga’s sole representatives in the last eight, two years after Bayern and Borussia Dortmund contested the Champions League final at Wembley and nine months after the World Cup triumph. ‘There is no time to rest, no time to ease off,’ said Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA. ‘We have to keep at it if we are to remain at the top.’ In England, the usual excuses were aired but it is to be hoped the big clubs are looking at what they might do to improve as well as grumbling about how the system is stacked against them. There is no English presence in the Europa League after Everton’s harsh lesson against Dynamo Kiev . Romelu Lukaku scored his eighth European goal of the season, but it wasn't enough . The Dynamo players celebrate during their impressive 6-4 aggregate victory over Everton . Too many games? Let’s start with the favourite complaint of the managers who overlook how the extra income from the Champions League should improve their squad, if spent wisely. Besides, who has the most games? Barcelona have played 44 to City’s 42 this season, Chelsea 44 to Paris Saint-Germain’s 45 and Arsenal played 45 to Monaco’s 44. Lionel Messi has played 3,531 minutes for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo 3,323 for Real Madrid, while Alexis Sanchez has played 3,326 for Arsenal and Eden Hazard 3,539 for Chelsea. It’s more intense in England, they say. No easy games, more physical, no respite. Well, it always has been this way. David Luiz helped Paris Saint-Germain knock Chelsea out at the last 16 stage following a 1-1 draw in France . Luiz celebrates victory with team-mates Thiago Motta (right) and Maxwell at the final whistle . John Terry looks defeated during Chelsea's last 16 exit at the hands of PSG last week . It was in the 1970s when Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa were winning the European Cup and it was in 2008 when Manchester United and Chelsea were in the final in Moscow and half of the last eight were from the Premier League. The intensity of English football used to be considered an advantage with improved fitness and hardened minds. Modern players may run more but usually on better pitches, with lighter balls. In fact, footballers have never had it quite so good. At the top of the Premier League they have the best money can buy in terms of physical care from the moment they step into the academy building. But tell them they are tired and they might feel tired. In 2008 United and Chelsea were in the final in Moscow and half of the last eight were from the Premier League . Eden Hazard has played 3,539 minutes for Chelsea compared to Cristiano Ronaldo's 3,323 for Real Madrid . When competition ends, touring begins. Tottenham will visit Australia in May. Southampton were skiing in Switzerland earlier this month. Manchester City flew to Abu Dhabi before returning to lose at home to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. Chelsea had two days off and a free week to prepare before they were knocked out of Europe by PSG. The wrong type of football? The competitive tempo which gives English football its appeal will never nurture a player like Andrea Pirlo, and yet all-action midfielders thrive in the domestic game, living on mistakes which rarely occur against the best European teams. This is perhaps most keenly felt at international level. Only one English outfield player started for Manchester City in the Nou Camp, and it was not all James Milner’s fault. City have a foreign team and a Chilean manager. Arsenal have not subscribed to traditional English values for years. Few pass the ball better than Arsene Wenger’s teams and few have played in the Champions League with such regularity without winning it. Few have passed the ball better than Arsene Wenger’s teams, but the Gunners still struggle in Europe . Arsene Wenger's Arsenal teams have not subscribed to the traditional English values for years . James Milner was the only English outfield player to start for City against Barcelona on Wednesday night . Barcelona can mesmerise in possession, but it is four years since they made a final. In the 2010 semis, they lost to an Inter Milan team that did not want to know the ball. It is about finding ways to win, which is what Chelsea were doing when they surrounded the referee against PSG. Since West Ham won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1965, through the domination of Liverpool and into the renaissance led by Manchester United and maintained by Chelsea, English clubs have been successful with fast, aggressive football and spirited, well-balanced sides. In the past two years, our strongest teams have dipped. The Chelsea side first built by Mourinho is being rebuilt and the new model is not yet as good. United are in post-Fergie turmoil, Arsenal are left short by the same old problems and City are still trying to learn what it takes. There are also the restrictions of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules but English clubs do not want for income, thanks to a bumper television deal, which is about to get even bigger. Money is not the problem. It guarantees nothing in any case. Real Madrid spent a fortune chasing their 10th European Cup. It is about finding ways to win, which is what Chelsea were doing when they surrounded the ref against PSG . Chelsea were the last English to to win the Champions League, defeating Bayern Munich on penalties in 2012 . It took them more than a decade because they became obsessed with superstars and forgot about the team. In England wealth confuses strategy. Clubs have realigned for the Moneyball generation with sporting directors, finance experts and sports scientists involved in transfers while coaches are marginalised. The upshot? Squads lack balance and big-money investments sit on the bench because managers cannot — or will not — accommodate them. What is United’s recruitment strategy? Are City about to sack Manuel Pellegrini and start again? Will Wenger ever change his approach? Yes, a winter break might be helpful, as would the complete restructure of the English league system. And yes, it would be nice if English players could pass the ball, and clubs should invest in youth development until they can. But if our Euro-flops are to flip and rule the Champions League again, they must use their millions more carefully and build better teams.

"Harry Kane turned to social media on Thursday, full of emotion after England manager Roy Hodgson called him up for the first time. The Tottenham striker talked of ‘pride’ and ‘honour’ on Twitter after being named in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next Friday and the friendly in Italy four days later. Kane, who has scored 26 goals for Tottenham this season, merits his place alongside England captain Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling is also in the squad but a niggling toe injury could see him play against Lithuania and sit out the Italy clash. Scroll down for full squad . Harry Kane celebrates after scoring for Tottenham Hotspur against Arsenal at White Hart Lane last month . Kane rounds QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to score Spurs' second goal at Loftus Road on March 7 . ‘The whole country is excited to see Harry Kane,’ said Hodgson. ‘His rise has been fantastic. He deserves his chance. He hasn’t been in the squad before, but he has to show he belongs.’ Beyond that, poor Kane discovered what it is really like to be a senior international when he was immediately caught in a club-versus-country row. First the background. The lure of the Aussie dollar has seen Tottenham agree to play Sydney FC on May 30, six days after the final game of the Premier League season. That same weekend, the England squad meet to prepare for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 in Dublin, followed by the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia on June 14. There is also a possibility that Kane, a regular in Gareth Southgate’s Under 21 squad, will be selected for the European Championship starting on June 17. ‘Playing for England at Under 21 level is more important than a friendly in Australia and I would be hypocritical if I didn’t give that answer,’ said Hodgson. ‘This business about being tired — he’s played quite a lot of games but he’s not played any more than Wayne Rooney, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and lots of other players. ‘If he needs a rest there’s a great opportunity when the season ends, before our Under 21s get together. You can’t expect me to say, “Oh no, I understand he will play in Australia and be resting when the Under 21s pitch up”.’ Kane celebrates after scoring for England U21 against Croatia in a Euro 2015 qualifier last year . Still, Tottenham were adamant on Thursday that Kane will travel to Australia to fulfil the Sydney fixture. Kane, 21, has played 42 times for Spurs this season and his goals in three competitions — Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup — have earned him international recognition. Inevitably, boss Mauricio Pochettino would prefer the potential PFA Player of the Year to put his feet up this summer. There is a fear of burn-out. ‘We will speak (with Hodgson). It’s a good chance to speak because England train here,’ said Pochettino after England’s squad of 24 was announced. ‘We always try to find what is best for the player. We need to understand every position, but we have a good relationship and after that (talks with Hodgson) we will take a decision.’ As for Kane, he is concerned only with proving himself to the England manager. ‘I’ll be aiming to compete and get myself in the team,’ he said. ‘There are a lot of great players there and I haven’t had time to think about what’s happened but I’m enjoying every minute and want it to continue.’ Beyond the Kane situation, Hodgson had to attend to some general housekeeping at Wembley on Thursday, such as the knockout blow Phil Bardsley seemed to land on his pal Rooney at the captain’s Cheshire home last month. Hodgson said he had no view on the incident, which was revealed last weekend in a Sunday newspaper. ‘You will have to guess whether I am concerned but Wayne’s celebration against Tottenham was one way to take the sting out of the situation,’ said Hodgson. On Monday, when the squad meet at St George’s Park, it will be the first time Hodgson has seen them since November. He had hoped to meet the players at a dinner in January but club managers were against the idea. England manager Roy Hodgson takes his seat before announcing his squad at Wembley on Thursday . Instead, Hodgson recorded a video message which was sent to the squad via England’s video analyst Andy Scoulding and was downloaded on to their iPads. ‘I don’t want to do the Sherlock Holmes bit to find out who has and who hasn’t watched it,’ said Hodgson. ‘I did an introduction to each video and then Gary Neville and Ray Lewington talked over the actual clips. ‘It will break the ice that can develop when the last game was in November and your next one is in March. ‘Whether they found it a worthwhile exercise, I don’t know. If it’s not, then it’s an awful lot of work to do for nothing.’","Harry Kane revealed his 'pride' and 'honour' on Twitter after receiving his first England call-up on Thursday .

"England's top football clubs, all out of the Champions League before the quarter-finals, are concerned their chances of signing the next generation of stars are being hampered by the FA’s new regulations governing agents. The rules, which come into force next month after FIFA passed the buck on managing the middle men to national associations, include a ban on agents earning money for representing players under 18 years old. As a result, clubs fear there will no longer be a level playing field in the global hunt for young talent because the players’ representatives will want them to sign for teams in countries where the agents’ code is far more relaxed. Arsene Wenger vents his frustration on the sideline as Arsenal crash out of the Champions League . Lionel Messi (second left) was at his mesmerising best as Barcelona beat Manchester City on Wednesday . And English clubs, who will abide by the rules, have further worries on how these restrictions will be policed by the FA, with agents no longer needing a licence to operate. The competitive market in signing teenage prospects is shown by the Chelsea juniors who have just reached their fourth consecutive FA Youth Cup final. Among the class of 2015 are Jay Dasilva, plucked from Luton at 13, while Isaiah Brown, on the fringe of the first team, arrived from West Bromwich at 16. Isaiah Brown is on the fringe of the Chelsea first team having arrived from West Bromwich aged 16 . BT Sport’s rugby coverage has been recognised for its class by most of its pundits, presenters and commentators being plundered for the World Cup. ITV are taking on loan Brian O’Driscoll, Lawrence Dallaglio (right), Ben Kay, Ugo Monye, Craig Doyle, Sarra Elgan and Nick Mullins while BBC 5 Live have made temporary signings in Matt Dawson and Alastair Eykyn. After the fallout from England players’ bad behaviour on a Land Rover promotional day during the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, it makes sense that none of the England backers have been given sponsorship days with the squad during the 2015 tournament. However, the RFU claim the team have behaved ‘impeccably’ on sponsorship duty since Stuart Lancaster took charge in 2012. The RFU claim England have behaved ‘impeccably’ on sponsorship duty since Stuart Lancaster took charge . UK Sport spent £46,272 on a survey by research company COMRES ‘reassuring’ the organisation their no-compromise approach to funding only Olympic medal contenders is overwhelmingly the right one. As predicted, the only real change is that participation numbers will now be taken into consideration in judging sports with equal medal chances. So basketball, whose loss of backing from UK Sport led to enough criticism of the no-compromise strategy for the survey to be commissioned, will continue to rely on special case hand-outs from Sport England to afford to participate in elite competition. At a time when the ECB need to get their PR act together, head of selectors James Whitaker chose not to front a print-media briefing when announcing the England Test squad for the West Indies. This meant when Whitaker, a hapless public performer, got in an embarrassing tangle with Radio 5 Live’s Pat Murphy over Kevin Pietersen and his possible England return, he did not have the press conference to redress the mixed messages coming out of the ECB over what KP has been promised — which is nothing. Kevin Pietersen's possible England return got James Whitaker in a flap with Radio 5 Live's Pat Murphy . Swimming have been remarkably positive about Sport England taking a whopping £667,895 from their grass-roots monies after a steep decline in participation. In fact Amateur Swimming Association CEO Adam Paker even welcomed ‘Sport England’s continued investment’. The sport realises the cuts could have been more drastic and the lost cash will at least stay in the sport as swimming pool operators, working with ASA, have been charged with making venues more customer-friendly. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has not only turned down the opportunity to take part in a live TV debate with his three rivals, but also the opportunity to speak as a candidate at the UEFA Congress in Vienna next week.

The Hollywood star once said he only 'truly grew up' when he spent months working with in Australia's most remote Indigenous communities.

Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said.

"Roy Keane has the ‘broad shoulders and mental toughness’ required to manage Manchester United, according to his former Old Trafford engine room colleague, Paul Ince. Ince, 47, a double-winner with Keane at United in 1994, on Thursday hailed the Irish assistant manager as ‘a leader of men.’ ‘I speak to Roy and he does want to get back in (to management) but at the right establishment, with the right project.

Ince slides in for a tackle during United's game against Sheffield Wednesday in 1992 . ‘And if the right thing (job) comes along then I’m sure he will get back into it (management).’ Keane was last in charge at Ipswich over four years ago but even so Ince is convinced the 43-year-old will ‘be a top, top manager’ and could even return to the front-line at United. ‘To be Man United manager you need broad shoulders and take a lot of criticism. Roy has broad shoulders and he is mentally tough. Things don’t affect him,’ said Ince. ‘He has a poker face, doesn’t show if things are affecting him, and there is no reason why Roy couldn’t go back to Manchester United (as manager).’ ‘You cannot lose people like him from the game,’ warned Ince. ‘He knows so much about football, no matter what your cup of tea is.

You don’t get the players anymore with Roy’s standards,’ he added. ‘You do hear people say “Roy rules by fear.” Maybe, that’s Roy and the way he is. Maybe, that’s how he feels he can be a success in what he does and he did it at Sunderland.’ ‘Roy Keane has an ego. We all had egos at Man United because that’s what made us who we were,’ he added.

"Recalled paceman Josh Hazlewood took four wickets as Australia dismissed a wasteful Pakistan for 213 runs at the Adelaide Oval on Friday, boosting the co-hosts' hopes of a World Cup semi-final with India. Hazlewood, replacing seamer Pat Cummins, combined with left-armer Mitchell Starc to remove Pakistan's openers cheaply and returned to punch a hole through the Asian team's middle-order on a sun-drenched autumn day. Part-time spinner Glenn Maxwell took two wickets and Aaron Finch three catches at deep midwicket, as captain Misbah-ul-Haq and two other Pakistan right-handers gave up their wickets on a platter when attempting to clear the short boundary. Misbah won the toss and opted to bat first but the move backfired with openers Sarfraz Ahmed and Ahmed Shehzad both out within three balls before the sixth over. Sarfraz, on 10, edged a quicker ball from Starc to Shane Watson who took a fine, low catch diving to his right in the slips. Hazlewood (4-35) then struck to remove Shehzad for five, the opener edging behind to Australia captain Michael Clarke. Misbah was nearly out for a duck two balls later when the ball brushed his stump after clipping his thigh pad, but the bails stayed intact. He and number three batsman Haris Sohail battled to steady the innings and the Pakistan skipper smashed Maxwell over the fence twice. But Maxwell had the last laugh, breaking the 73-run partnership when Misbah miscued a slog-sweep straight to Finch in the 24th over. The writing was on the wall when Mitchell Johnson had Sohail out for 41 soon after, following up a venomous bouncer with a wide, fuller delivery to the left-hander who sent a leaden-footed edge to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. Infuriatingly for Pakistan fans, Umar Akmal (20) and Shahid Afridi (23) repeated their captain's horrid dismissal, holing out to Finch on the rope off the bowling of Maxwell and Hazlewood respectively. That left Pakistan reeling at 158-6, but paceman Wahab Riaz added 30 runs with Sohaib Maqsood before the middle order batsman slashed Hazlewood straight to Johnson at cover to be out for 29. Wahab was out a few balls later for 16, nicking Starc behind to Haddin, before Sohail Khan sent a top-edge from a Hazlewood ball soaring high into the sky before landing in the wicketkeeper's gloves. Pakistan's tailenders nudged their team past 200 before all-rounder James Faulkner had a slogging Ehsan Adil caught for 15 on the penultimate ball of the allotted overs.","Australia need 214 runs to beat Pakistan in World Cup quarter-final .

"Stuart Lancaster has urged Twickenham to will England to victory on Saturday evening as he prepares to order his RBS 6 Nations title hopefuls to carry the game to France. Lancaster believes the noisy support of a sold-out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role to play in edging rivals Ireland and Wales for Championship glory on a nerve-jangling final day of staggered kick-offs. England are favourites to lift a first piece of silverware under Lancaster and their head coach refuses to view the match through the prism of the looming World Cup on these shores. England scrum half Ben Youngs fires out a pass as Courtney Lawes and Joe Marler (left) watch on . 'It will be hugely important that the crowd get behind the team,' Lancaster said. 'If there's ever a day when we need the crowd to push us over the line and give us the momentum we need then it's Saturday. 'Whether we just need to get the win or win by 10 points or whatever it might take, the crowd will have a huge part to play. 'This game is not about the World Cup, it's about winning the Championship. And that's all it's about. It's about Saturday night only. 'Our mindset is to go and win the game. We can't play just to hang in there. We have to have a front foot mentality and have an intensity and tempo to our game from the first minute.' England fly half George Ford winds up a pass in training at his side's team base at Pennyhill Park . England head coach Start Lancaster has backed his side to handle the pressure of their final day shoot-out . England enter the final round of matches with a points cushion of plus four and having digested earlier results from Wales' trip to Italy and Ireland's visit to Edinburgh, their victory target against France will be made clear. The scheduling appears to have favoured England, but Lancaster insists providing the climax to the tournament creates its own challenges. 'I don't think we can be seen as favourites. I don't think anyone can. It will play out on the day,' Lancaster said. 'Whether the staggered kick-offs help us depends on what the other scores are. 'If we have to win by 20, psychologically if you concede seven points in the first five minutes and then a penalty, you then have to score 30. 'Psychologically it's an interesting dynamic for the players to manage. The danger is that sometimes you can want to chase the game too early rather than build the score. 'It's an 80-minute game. Knowing that is one thing, but dealing with everything that's around it puts incredible pressure on the players. The England squad gather for a huddle at the end of their training session as Lancaster looks on from afar . Former France No 8 Imanol Harinordoquy insists all the pressure will be on England on Saturday . 'On the staggered kick-off times, we all know the rules when we start. It makes it exciting.' Lancaster has made one change to the starting XV, promoting lock Geoff Parling at the expense of Dave Attwood, who drops out of the 23 altogether, with Nick Easter recalled to the bench. Attwood has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with Lancaster believing the street-wise Easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware. 'When you boil it down, it's the experience that Geoff brings. He didn't go on the Lions tour by accident, he's a high quality player,' Lancaster said. 'Dave is a very good player who has lots of qualities, but Nick will make a stronger impact from the bench and that's why the decision was made. 'Dave understood the decision. There were performance reasons as well. It wasn't just done because of Geoff. There are areas of Dave's game we've been asking him to improve on. 'It was a difficult conversation but ultimately done on a performance point of view. Dave accepted it and knows the areas he has to work on.' England have finished runners=up for the last three years running with points difference alone deciding the 2013 and 2014 tournaments. When asked if he was fed up at finishing second, Lancaster said: 'Yes! It would be nice to win this time.'","England will know what points target is needed by the time they run out to face Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Hollywood star Russell Crowe has done little to dampen speculation about his possible interest in buying Sky Bet Championship club Leeds. The 50-year-old Oscar-winning actor and lifelong Leeds supporter sparked rumours he was keen to invest in the club last month when he asked a fan on his Twitter site whether it would be a good idea to buy them. Crowe did not deny or confirm the speculation of potential investment during an interview on Simon Mayo's BBC Five Live show on Thursday, but said that he wanted 'nothing but success' for Leeds and was 'getting a little impatient'. Russell Crowe has done little to dampen speculation about his possible interest in buying Leeds United . Lifelong Leeds fan was speaking onSimon Mayo's BBC Five Live show on Thursday . Speaking ahead of the release of his latest film, The Water Diviner, Crowe also said he had learned a lot about owning a top sports club during his nine years as joint-owner of Australian rugby league side South Sydney Rabbitohs. 'I've followed Leeds since I was a little kid,' Crowe said. 'I used to come home from sport in the afternoon, me and my brother, and watch Match of the Day. 'I love the club. I want nothing but success for the club. But like many other Leeds fans - and probably in fact 99.9 per cent - I'm getting a little impatient, you know?' 'Some of your listeners may not know that I own a rugby league team in Australia which, again, is my childhood team and they were a champion team when I was younger. 'Then they'd fallen in to a state of disarray and they were perennial losers. So, nine years ago, I put my cheque book where my mouth is and bought the club.' The Rabbitohs won the NRL Championship for the first time in 43 years in October and recently beat Super League side St Helens to become world champions. 'Step-by-step, by changing the culture, changing the merchandise, changing the player roster, changing the coaching staff, changing the administrative staff and changing our connection to our community - we have risen from being perennial losers to being competitive, to being dominant - and now we're champions,' Crowe added. Mirco Antenucci celebrates as the Championship side beat Fulham 3-0 on Wednesday night . Crowe was with actress Olga Kurylenko for the photocall for film 'The Water Diviner' at Claridge's this week . 'I have learnt a lot in nine years - it would give me nothing but pleasure to see that white army marching on together, getting back in the Premiership and being where they should be.' Italian Massimo Cellino, who bought Leeds from Bahrain investment firm Gulf Finance House Capital in December 2013, is currently disqualified from running the club. Cellino was disqualified by the Football League in January following his conviction in Italy for tax evasion and had his ban extended until May 3 earlier this month for withholding information about his conviction. Cellino is currently appealing against the League's punishment under the Football Association's Rule K, which could result in an independent arbitration tribunal.","Russell Crowe could be tempted to lodge a bid to buy Leeds United .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes the only way is up for Tim Sherwood as the two coaching course mates prepare to cross tactical swords at Villa Park. Monk and new Aston Villa boss Sherwood got to know each other on the same Football Association of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on Saturday with three Barclays Premier League points at stake. Sherwood got his break in management at Tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to Monk - and the former England midfielder has revived Villa's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the Premier League danger zone and into the semi-final of the FA Cup. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate Garry Monk . Sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the Villa Park managerial hot-seat . 'He's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group,' Monk said at his pre-match press conference. 'You need results to do that but they've got very good players there who obviously weren't playing to their full potential before Tim took over. 'But he's had an instant impact. He's a very honest guy, black and white, and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game. Garry Monk believes himself and Sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities . 'They're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us. 'We've got our own agenda, we want to achieve our best total of 47 points, and I think you've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against Tottenham and Liverpool. 'The actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at Villa.' The pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright, young British managers, even if the 46-year-old Sherwood is actually 10 years older than Monk who celebrated his first anniversary as Swansea boss last month. Swansea manager Monk observes his players during the training session at the Fairwood Training Centre . But Monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences. 'When Tim came in at Spurs he was already within the club at that time, albeit within a different coaching role,' Monk said. 'I came from a playing background into it and I wouldn't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that. 'But we've got the same desire, commitment and principles and are clear in what we want. 'I'm on the same coaching course as Tim and his views on football are very interesting. Monk believes the former Tottenham Hotspur boss will certainly take Aston Villa forward in the future . 'He's had a fantastic start and I am sure he will take Aston Villa forward after being unlucky at Tottenham. 'He has been given his chance and taken the opportunity really well, he has got them going.' Swansea are seeking to recover from back-to-back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at Villa Park in the shape of Scott Sinclair. The 25-year-old's career nose-dived after his £6.2million move from Swansea to Manchester City in August 2012, Sinclair starting only two league games at the Etihad Stadium before joining Villa on loan in January. Scott Sinclair will come up against his former Swansea teammates during the game at Villa Park . But Sinclair has thrived under Sherwood with three goals in five games and Monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career. 'Scotty has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing,' Monk said. 'He did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here. 'It is no surprise to see him playing regular football in the Premier League because he's got the talent to do that.' Sinclair has thrived since arriving at Aston Villa following an unproductive spell with Manchester City .","Swansea manager Garry Monk believes Tim Sherwood has a big future .

"Goalkeeper Joe Hart is determined not to let Manchester City's season end with a whimper. The England number one has made a rallying call to his team-mates in the hope of sparking a charge through the closing games of the year. City's campaign has fallen apart in 2015 with a run of three wins in 12 games costing them heavily in the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and in Europe. Joe Hart was in inspired form against Barcelona, pictured here saving from man-of-the-moment Lionel Messi . The Manchester City and England No 1 moved to back his manager despite the team's last-16 exit . Hart arrived back to Manchester with the rest of the City squad on Thursday afternoon . City now seem unlikely to retain their title having fallen six points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, while they were ousted from the Champions League by a far superior Barcelona side on Wednesday. But Hart is not ready to concede defeat to Chelsea yet and insists City, who host West Brom on Saturday, still have a lot to play for. The 27-year-old said: 'I will never give up, ever, and I could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either. We will see where that takes us. 'West Brom is a huge game and we turn our focus to that. We have no excuse not to throw everything at the Premier League now and give our all - to the fans, the owner, to everyone. 'Every game is a must-win now. We have no time to lick our wounds, we have to fly into that game. 'We have to win every game, and that is how we will go into it, and see where it takes us. 'We have had a few knocks this season, but we have proved it time and time again, and so have our fans, that we come back and we keep fighting.' City's recent form has brought heavy criticism of the team and manager Manuel Pellegrini, who could now be facing a fight to keep his job. But Hart, who was outstanding in Wednesday's 1-0 loss at the Nou Camp, believes all the negativity coming the team's way is only par for the course and is not overly concerned. Manuel Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming Manchester City manager . Ivan Rakitic scored the only goal of the game as Barcelona progressed at Manchester City's expense . Luis Enrique had praise for City keeper Hart after watching him deny Barcelona a number of times . He said: 'That's part of being at Man City. We all get talked about. I have been the worst keeper in the world recently and Vinny (Kompany) has been the worst defender in the world. 'We have all had our moment. That's the role of being at Man City. If we don't win we are going to get slaughtered.' It has also been suggested the squad needs a shake-up in the summer but Hart continues to back his current team-mates. He said: 'We have nine games left with his fantastically talented squad. We have a lot of tired legs but we have players to come in. They are good players. They can freshen us up. I think we have what we need.'","Joe Hart doesn't want Manchester City to lose focus this season .

"A woman arrived home to find that her husband had tied up a naked teenage man in the living room of the family home, a court has heard. Joanne O'Connor said she discovered the bizarre scene after she returned home early from work one day last year. Her husband John Young, a radio DJ, then assaulted her and grabbed her hair, and has now been fined £300 for the attack. Row: John Young fought his wife after she found a naked 18-year-old man tied up in the family home . Ms O'Connor, 48, told Kilmarnock Sheriff Court: 'I knew our marriage was in trouble when I found an 18-year-old boy naked and bound in the living room.' The court heard that Young, 49, then smashed up his own collection of CDs during the ensuing row in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, the Evening Times reported. An antique clock which was a family heirloom was also damaged in the fight. The couple's daughter went into the room and said: 'What are you arguing about now?' Young denied assaulting and injuring his wife by grabbing her hair and chest. Fined: Young was convicted of assault after a trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, pictured, and fined £300 . He told the court that he has since come out as gay, but claimed that Ms O'Connor accused him of being a paedophile. The DJ said that if he had attacked his wife she would have hit him back. Sheriff Brian Murphy found Young guilty of assault, and ordered him to pay a £300 fine. He could also lose his new job with North Ayrshire Council. Young, who uses the professional name Ian Young, helped to set up Irvine Beat FM, but has now left the station.","Joanne O'Connor discovered her husband John Young had a naked teenager tied up in the living room of Ayrshire home .

"Sir Alex Ferguson is set to take his earnings closer to £10million since stepping down as Manchester United manager after signing up for a new book. Ferguson, whose best-selling autobiography was only released by Hodder & Stoughton in October 2013, has agreed a deal with the publishers for a book titled Leading, which promises to ‘analyse the pivotal leadership decisions of an astonishing career’. The book is being co-written with investor and author Sir Michael Moritz, and will hit the shelves in the autumn.

Co-authored with Michael Moritz, the book will detail Ferguson's tactics and management techniques . Ferguson said: ‘Since stepping into retirement I have had the opportunity to reflect on my time as a football manager, and to consider the reasons behind my success through personal recollections, conversations with Mike Moritz and my role at Harvard Business School. ‘It has been a new experience for me to be looking into the past rather than planning for the future, but one I have found enjoyable and rewarding.’ Ferguson, who earned £7.6m a year towards the end of his reign at Old Trafford, has continued to profit from his huge success in football — he won 13 Premier League titles — since retiring from management in May 2013. The 73-year-old was paid an advance of £2m for his second autobiography published later that year. It became the biggest-selling book of 2013, with sales earning him at least an additional £1m. Ferguson continues to bank more than £2m a year for 20 appearances as a club ambassador for United, a role that was agreed when he stepped down as manager.

"Vern Cotter fears Alex Dunbar’s season-ending injury may also rule the star centre out of Scotland’s World Cup campaign. The Glasgow Warriors back suffered a major blow ahead of Saturday's Six Nations clash at Twickenham when he damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Thursday morning’s training session. The SRU confirmed that he is ‘out for the rest of the season’ but, speaking before the result of scans on Dunbar’s freak injury were released, Cotter said ACL damage could mean up to six months on the sidelines and remove the 24-year-old from his World Cup plans. Alex Dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after injuring his knee at training . Scotland coach Vern Cotter fears Dunbar may not recover in time for the World Cup, starting in September . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash . Visibly shaken by an incident that happened just a few hours before the team flew to London, Cotter now hopes his squad will be galvanised in the face of fresh adversity for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash. Explaining that Dunbar had been a key figure in his starting XV, Cotter said: ‘We had named Alex to start at centre but he has perhaps done his ACL this morning. ‘Alex did it on his own. A change of direction and his knee went out from underneath him. If it’s the ACL, that would be the World Cup as well. That’s not good. ‘We’ll miss him in attack and defence. He’s one of our best line breakers and has been playing very well up to now. ‘He is with some competent surgeons at the moment, he’s getting scanned. He’s understandably very upset about it. ‘We’ve seen guys come back from an ACL before, so it’s just about when we get him back. But, if it’s the ACL, he’ll be six months. ‘He was getting tested this morning. I went to see him during a break in training and he’s been whisked off with the pros. I will obviously talk to him again.’ Dunbar, here showing his disappointment after Scotland's loss to Wales, awaits results of scans on his knee . Matt Scott has now taken Dunbar’s slot for the England game. ‘It’s an opportunity for Matt Scott, who was initially named on the bench,’ said Cotter. ‘You saw his two tries for Edinburgh last weekend, he is ready to step up. We’ve got an able replacement who has played well recently. ‘We would dearly love to have Alex starting and then have someone like Matt come in and keep pace, bring physical intensity and presence to the game. But Matt has stepped straight in, and it means we’ll have to juggle the bench if we get injuries. ‘I think it has tightened the group up – and that will be important when we play this weekend. We are playing what is probably one of the best teams in the world as they are preparing for the World Cup. The group adapts and moves on.’ Coach Vern Cotter said the 24-year-old centre had played a key role in the Scotland XV . Dunbar’s withdrawal is one of five changes Cotter has made to his starting XV. Along with Scott, David Denton, Jim Hamilton and Dougie Fife all come in for their first starts of this Six Nations, while Finn Russell returns after serving his ban. Scott’s promotion sees Greig Tonks move on to a bench that boasts six forwards to only two backs – although No. 8 Johnnie Beattie has been told to prepare for playing a part in either unit. Cotter revealed: ‘Beattie is a midfield replacement, emergency cover. He knows he could be marking (England centre) Billy Twelvetrees or he could be marking (No.8) Billy Vunipola. ‘I know he’s got a good boot on him. We know he’s a very skilful player. We want to have some physical density and some experience at the end of this match. ‘So he and Adam Ashe, who has come back and has aggressive defence and is good on the ball, are there to put pressure on England. We want to stay close and finish this game with strength and experience.’","Alex Dunbar was running on his own when his knee gave way on Thursday .

"St Helens captain Jon Wilkin inspired the Super League champions to a first home win over their near-neighbours for five years in an entertaining derby at Langtree Park. Warrington had ended Leeds 100 per cent record in toppling them from top spot in their last match but they could not repeat the feat against a Saints side that for an hour played like champions. Wilkin, once more revelling in his role of makeshift scrum-half, was the architect of a superb 32-24 victory, Saints' sixth out of six so far in their title defence, scoring one try and setting up two others to put his side into an 18-6 half-time lead. Jon Wilkin scores a try past Matty Russell during the Super League match  at Langtree Park . St Helens' victory was based on their aggressive forward display but some of the shine was taken away by the loss of outstanding second rower Joe Greenwood with a suspected broken arm. Warrington carved out the first scoring chance of a frantic opening, with centre Ryan Atkins breaking out of his own 20-metre area to give winger Kevin Penny a sniff of the try line but Saints scrambled superbly to keep it intact. It was end-to-end football, with Wolves stand-off Chris Bridge unable to finish off a clean break by Stefan Ratchford and St Helens left winger Adam Swift twice bundled into touch before Greenwood broke the deadlock on 17 minutes. Chris Bridge of Warrington Wolves is tackled by Kyle Amor and Jordon Turner of St Helens during the game . He maintained his impressive start to the year by taking Wilkin's short pass to crash over for his fourth try of the campaign and Travis Burns kicked the first of his six goals. The champions were clearly winning the physical battle but the visitors demonstrated their potency on 24 minutes when hooker Daryl Clark dummied his way over from dummy half after prop Ashton Sims had been hauled down short of the line. Ratchford's goal levelled the scores but Saints, with hooker James Roby making a belated return to the side from the bench, struck twice in the last 12 minutes of the first half to establish control. Micky Higham celebrates his second half try during the  match . Wilkin fortuitously scored the first, taking advantage of a kind bounce by regathering the ball after centre Jordan Turner had twice kicked ahead and then produced a sublime cut-out pass to get Swift over. Burns' conversions made it 18-6 at the break and he attempted to extend the lead with a 40-metre penalty early in the second half but was off target for the first time. Warrington pulled a try back on 48 minutes through replacement hooker Mick Higham, who shot through a gap in the home defence from dummy half to touch down, with Gareth O'Brien adding the goal to cut the gap to just six points. However, Saints were unmoved and scored their fourth try six minutes later through forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook, who took three defenders over the line with him. Ashton Sims of Warrington Wolves is tackled by James Roby at Langtree Park . St Helens suffered a blow when the outstanding Greenwood went off on the hour and they survived a scare when Penny produced a spectacular dive at the corner only for slow-motion replays showed he touched the ball down on the touch-in-goal line. Saints looked to have wrapped up the win when second rower Atelea Vea charged 60 metres after picking up a loose ball to set up the position for Roby to get right winger Tom Makinson over at the corner. Burns' touchline conversion put his side 18 points clear but the champions were given a late fright when the visitors scored two tries in the last 11 minutes. Bridge gained possession from a charge-down to send Penny away for a deserved try and prop Chris Hill romped over from close range, with O'Brien adding both goals. However, Burns had the final say with a last-minute penalty to seal a notable success.

"It has been an annus horribilis for British clubs in Europe. Ten clubs from north and south of the border began their European campaigns last year, with dreams of Berlin and Warsaw. But before Easter, all have seen them shattered. Here's how. Europa League qualifier: Motherwell 2-3 Stjarnan (agg 4-5) - July 24, 2014 . Motherwell's European campaign ended before it began with an extra-time defeat in Iceland. Stuart McCall's men led the first-leg tie 2-0 but were pegged back at Fir Park, and Atli Johannsson's 113th-minute goal won it for the minnows.

Europa League qualifier: Hull 2-2 KSC Lokeren - August 28, 2014 . They had waited 110 years for continental competition in Hull, but after two ties Steve Bruce's Europa League dream was over before the Europa League group stage had even begun. The Tigers managed a 2-1 second leg victory at the KC Stadium, but the 1-0 defeat a week earlier meant early exile.

"Simon Easterby has warned Ireland not to repeat the mistakes of 2007 when chasing RBS 6 Nations glory in Edinburgh this weekend. Easterby watched in horror as Ireland chased a points-difference boosting final try rather than punt the ball out for full-time in Italy eight years ago, only to concede a pivotal converted score. Roland de Marigny plundered the last-gasp score for the Azzurri, with Ireland winning out 54-21: France then hammered Scotland 46-19 to swipe the title on points-difference - by just a four-point margin. The Ireland squad warm up ahead of training on Thursday, with Johnny Sexton (centre) involved again . Rory Best (left) and Jamie Heaslip (right) arrive at training ahead of the crucial game against Scotland . Ireland coach Simon Easterby has urged his team not to repeat the mistakes of 2007, when he was involved . Easterby has moved from flanker in 2007 to forwards coach in 2015 - but knows Ireland face a similar situation and is wary of the pitfalls of chasing glory rather than focusing on victory. Ireland can still retain their Six Nations title with victory in Edinburgh on Saturday. England's Twickenham clash with France kicks off last though, and Easterby is keen to avoid any repeat of that 2007 pain. 'It is exactly that, you've got to focus on what you can do in that 80 minutes,' said Easterby, recalling Ireland's aborted 2007 title challenge. 'We've got to focus on what we can produce in Murrayfield. 'The performance first and foremost will give us the right result and what goes outside of our environment in Rome and London is exactly that, outside our control and we can't factor that into what we're doing in the 80 minutes against Scotland. Sean O'Brien flicks a pass out the back of his hand as Ireland prepared for their vital final game . Tommy Bowe receives a massage on the training pitch as Ireland prepared for their Edinburgh showdown . 'They are going to make it difficult enough as it is without us focusing on what else is going on elsewhere. We've got to focus on our job and make sure that is right and hopefully that puts us in the best possible position come Saturday evening.' England were forced to watch television in frustration last year as Ireland claimed the Six Nations title with victory in Paris, but back in 2007 it was the Irish themselves who suffered that fate. Easterby and company were forced to endure France stealing the 2007 title from under their noses, as Elvis Vermeulen claimed the last-ditch try that sealed glory for Les Bleus. To add insult to injury, Vermeulen's title-winning try was awarded by Irish television match official Simon McDowell. Ireland's players were understandably stony-faced when the reality of that 2007 situation hit home - but Easterby has revealed this week that he has effectively shut that video nasty out of his mind. 'I don't recall that. I genuinely can't remember that. If you say I was there, I must have been but I don't recall,' said Easterby. Peter O'Mahony stretches during the session, as Easterby urged his side to focus on wining the game . Cian Healy catches the ball, as Ireland go into the game level on points with England and Wales . 'I recall watching it together and the disappointment of not getting over the line. 'We did our utmost in the game to give ourselves the best possible opportunity that year and we have to make sure we do the same this week.' Rather than linger on the past Easterby has instead backed the current Ireland outfit to fix the white-line fever that blew a Grand Slam in Wales last weekend. Easterby threw his full support behind Ireland's attack, despite several try-scoring chances going begging in Saturday's 32-16 defeat at the Millennium Stadium. Replacement prop Cian Healy knocked on with the line at his mercy after racing through the middle of a ruck in Cardiff, with Tommy Bowe frustrated a gaping backline overlap went begging. Asked how to solve the front-foot shortcomings, Easterby replied: 'By backing the players to make the right calls at the right time. Mike McCarthy trains at Carton House in Dublin as the Ireland squad stepped up their preparation . 'All the players are comfortable to catch and pass and make good decisions; that's the bottom line. 'The players will always be backed to make decisions.' Former Scarlets boss Easterby insisted Ireland's management will not lose any faith in their frontline stars, just because of defeat in Cardiff. 'They are more than capable of producing the right things at the right time and sometimes under a bit of pressure, when the opposition are making it awkward to do certain things, you are going to come up with a few errors,' said Easterby. 'It's not for lack of quality of having the players who can see those things. 'You have to make sure that they make the right decisions at the right time and we'll back them as coaches to do so. 'It is one decision of many in a game and sometimes you make the right one, sometimes you don't. 'That's the pressure at this level.'","Ireland lost out on championship on points difference eight years ago .

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has seen a reaction from goal-shy Graziano Pelle after dropping him in the league for the first time. The 29-year-old striker enjoyed a dream start to life at St Mary's after moving from Feyenoord in a reported £9million summer deal. Pelle scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for Saints in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for Italy. Graziano Pelle (19) has struggled with form recently and wasn't happy at being dropped for the first time . The goals have dried up of late, though, and he was replaced in the starting line-up by Shane Long in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Chelsea. Pelle ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle, having played the final few minutes, and Koeman hopes the striker can end his three-month wait for a Premier League goal when Burnley visit this weekend. 'There has been a little bit of a reaction, yes, because nobody is happy to stay on the bench,' the Saints boss said. Ronald Koeman (centre) says he's 'seen a reaction' from Pelle after leaving him on the bench against Chelsea . 'Sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation. He is doing well. 'In that game, in that moment, I think it was good to change the way of playing with more fast players up front. Saturday we play at home.' Koeman has no fresh injury worries to contend with against Burnley, with Eljero Elia coming back into contention after missing last week's match through injury. Sean Dyche's relegation-threatened side head to St Mary's buoyed by last weekend's shock win over champions Manchester City and having overcome Southampton 1-0 earlier in the season. 'Yeah, they beat us but it wasn't a very good game that day and we missed a penalty,' Koeman said. The targetman was in superb form at the start of the season and scored nine goals in 12 matches . 'It was a stupid goal against us but, of course, we analyse always the opponent and we play 11 against 11 and then one team is playing like Burnley. 'Sometimes it is difficult to prepare a training session for the match, but we expect an aggressive opponent who will press us with direct play. 'That is always difficult because they don't give you time to play and you have to that and you have to prepare for that.' Saturday's match will be their last before a two-week international break, during which time many of Southampton's players will be away with their national teams. Martin Odegaard (left) was linked with a loan move to the Saints next season but Koeman denied the claims . England duo Nathaniel Clyne and Fraser Forster are amongst those players, with some eyebrows raised by the fact left-back Ryan Bertrand did not join them in Roy Hodgson's squad. 'I am not surprised,' Koeman said. 'He had suspension for three games. After that he came back and is playing well. 'I think he played very well against Chelsea but I am not surprised because his time will come if he keeps working like this, keeps playing like this.' The 16-year-old signed for Real Madrid from Norwegian side Strømsgodset and big things are expected . Meanwhile, Koeman downplayed speculation linking Southampton with a loan move for talented Real Madrid teenager Martin Odegaard. 'It is not my job to do scouting of young players,' he said of the 16-year-old Norwegian midfielder. 'He moved to Real Madrid - that means that he is a very good player.'","Ronald Koeman admits he's seen a reaction from striker Graziano Pelle .

Baylor, from the Big 12 conference had been favorited in the game by 9, though Georgia State was able to beat the Bears behind the younger Hunter's 16 points.

"Angel di Maria will prove his detractors wrong and become a hit at Manchester United, believes the club's former defender Rio Ferdinand. Di Maria made an impressive start to his career at Old Trafford following his £60million summer switch from Real Madrid last summer. The 27-year-old netted three times in his first five games for the Red Devils but has since struggled for form since in recent weeks. Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes Angel di Maria will prove a hit at the club . Di Maria (centre right) was sent off on Monday night as United tumbled out of the FA Cup at home to Arsenal . Despite providing the assist for Wayne Rooney's goal in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit to Arsenal on Monday night, Di Maria's night ended prematurely as he was sent off in the second half. Regardless of his dismissal, Ferdinand is adamant that the Argentina international's star qualities will be evident once he has had time adapt to playing in the Premier League. 'I thought [Angel] Di Maria was a great signing for [Manchester] United and I still think he was a good signing because he is a top player,' Ferdinand told Goal. Ferdinand (pictured, left, playing for QPR) feels Di Maria just needs time to adapt to playing in a new country . 'He was arguably [Real] Madrid's best player last year, him and [Cristiano] Ronaldo were their standout players. I think he is a highly talented player. 'But it always takes time for a player to adapt to his new surroundings, especially when you go to a foreign league. Not every player can be like Ronaldo and just turn up and instantly become a superstar. Maybe it will take Di Maria a bit longer. It might take him a year, you never know.

Saturday's encounter will be a third home game for Italy in this season's tournament, but they have so far scored just three points at home, going down to France and also being beaten 26-3 by Ireland. They have, though, beaten Wales twice from seven previous Six Nations starts in Rome, even if the Azzurri - especially without Parisse - go into battle as huge underdogs. Wales are currently third in the table on points difference behind leaders England and second-placed Ireland, and realistically they need to better their record Six Nations win in Rome - 38-8, 10 years ago - to maintain hopes of a third Six Nations title during the past four years.","Italy captain suffered foot injury during last weekend's 29-0 loss to France .

"George Ford is an artist and a pragmatist rolled into one and the England fly-half is quickly discovering that the latter trait is a more consistently valuable asset in international rugby. The 21-year-old Bath playmaker spends most weekends with his club demonstrating the range of his attacking game — as a creative rookie able to unravel defences at close quarters. He has shown that part of his repertoire during this RBS 6 Nations, but is also having to embrace the earthier demands of his role, involving substance over style. England’s defeat by Ireland in Dublin gave Ford a first-hand view of Jonny Sexton, the home fly-half, following orders to the letter and quelling his own instincts in the process.

Asked whether he would feel fulfilled if ordered to kick so often, Ford said: ‘It was obviously Ireland’s plan. If they come in with a plan and execute it as well as they did and come out with a 10-point win, then you would (feel fulfilled). You don’t always have to play the same way against different teams. ‘You go into a game with a plan and if it comes off at the weekend, you feel you’ve done your job.’ But surely he gains more satisfaction from conjuring tries than kicking for territory? ‘People always like to score tries,’ he added. ‘They are more exciting.

That will always be our aim. First and foremost we need the win. It’s vital we get it.

"Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in his back garden . Snooker legend Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in the back garden of his mansion – just a stone's throw from Gleneagles. The seven-times world champion, 46, is set to build a multi-million pound housing development on land currently used as a horse paddock and stables on his Perthshire country estate. He and neighbour Alexander Birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world-famous course at Gleneagles. But the move upset  residents in the upmarket village who voiced fears that  it will invade their privacy and spoil the natural beauty of the area. The Auchterarder development was originally given the go-ahead in 2012 but construction never started because of the decline in the housing market. Renewed plans were submitted to Perth and Kinross Council last month by Mr Birnie's company Craigmount Developments and they have now been given the green light. Drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on Mr Hendry's land show a large four-bedroom property. The proposed house has a massive snooker room at the rear as well as a studio, a TV room, a drawing room and a built-in garage. Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy, but he still owns the land. The couple moved into the turreted five-bedroom mansion in 1996 after paying £300,000 and they carried out extensive renovations. They rented the house out for rumoured five-figure sum during the golf tournament. Council planners approved the application after finding it complied with the local development plan and that there were no 'material considerations' to justify refusal. The former player and his neighbour Alexander Birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world-famous course at Gleneagles, pictured are planned new homes . In an objection letter sent to the council, neighbour Colin Campbell said: 'You have requested comments from property owners bordering this development. What is the point? 'Your department has already rubber-stamped every housing development plan for Auchterarder in recent years. 'Bett Homes, Cala, Robertson Homes, Muir Homes, Milne Homes etc together will build in excess of 1,000 new homes. 'When occupied this will double the population of Auchterarder with little or no consideration given by you to the impact of schooling, town parking, medical facilities or shopping facilities. 'This application is yet another example of a developer squeezing many properties onto a small plot.' Another neighbour said: 'I am concerned about the loss of privacy this would cause and because it spoils the status quo. 'The area is absolutely beautiful in terms of the visibility I have right up to the Grampians and we thought we were very lucky to find this house. 'I'm not surprised our concerns have been ignored. I don't have much faith in the system.' Drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on Mr Hendry's land show a large four-bedroom property with a large snooker room . Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy (pictured together with their oldest son Blaine in 1999), but he still owns the land . Last year, it was reported that the father-of-two, who has estimated £11 million fortune,  left his wife and moved to England with 26-year-old actress Lauren Thundow. Mrs Hendry, 46, has launched divorce proceedings against him at Liverpool County Court. Following their split Mandy said: 'I am heartbroken Stephen has made the decision to leave the marital home and relocate to England for a new relationship.' Mr Hendry, widely regarded as the greatest ever snooker player, retired from competitive sport in 2012 and now works as a BBC pundit and as an ambassador for the sport. He was not available for a comment when contacted.

"Playing for England is a 'dream' Harry Kane is putting to the back of his mind, such is the striker's determination to propel Tottenham forwards. There were not many clamouring for the 21-year-old to be in the Spurs starting line-up at the start of the season, never mind the national team. Now, though, Kane is one of the most talked about players in the country as his Roy of the Rovers rise continues apace. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has insisted he is fully focused on helping the club progress this season . Kane rounds QPR goalkeeper Robert Green to score his second goal in a 2-1 win on Sunday at Loftus Road . Kane has now scored 26 goals in 41 appearances for Spurs in all competitions so far this season . Saturday's brace in Spurs' 2-1 win at QPR increased his goal tally to 26 in all competitions - a remarkable haul which is likely to earn a first senior call-up this month. Roy Hodgson could not fail but to be impressed by Kane's latest display, but front man is trying not to think about the potential of facing Lithuania or Italy this month. 'I've always said, I've got to keep doing what I am doing,' he said. 'There are still a few more games until the international break and I want to do the best I can for Tottenham Hotspur. 'That's what I am looking to do. I want to get some more wins from until then and, yeah, we'll see what happens. 'Obviously, I've just got to keep doing what I am doing. 'I think any English player playing would love to play for England. It would be a dream but there are a lot of great players in England. 'I just have to keep concentrating and doing the best I can for Spurs. We'll see what happens.' Kane is widely being tipped for a call up to the England team following his impressive form for Spurs . Kane lashes a shot at the QPR goal only for Hoops defender Steven Caulker (left) to get in the way . That determination to continue impressing at club level is certainly helping Spurs get over a disappointing few weeks. The north Londoners' Europa League exit was compounded by defeat to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, but they responded impressively with back-to-back victories over Swansea and QPR. 'That is massive,' Kane told Sky Sports. 'That is what we said. 'We had a disappointing couple of weeks, going out of the Europa and obviously losing the final, so we knew we had to get back on it, build a bit of momentum and get as far up in the league as we can. 'We have managed to do that with two very important wins and hopefully we can continue it.' This latest victory moves Tottenham within three points of the top-four, while it leaves QPR deeper in the mire. The west Londoners have now lost seven of their last eight top-flight matches, with relegation edging closer by the week. Again, though, manager Chris Ramsey defended his players' application and, in particular, Rio Ferdinand. The former England international was culpable for both goals, leading to chants from the away end of 'It's time to retire' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with. 'I think Rio's applied himself well,' Ramsey said. 'I'm very pleased with the way he played. 'In the position we're in, when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others. 'For Rio to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games, we need to encourage him. 'It's always disappointing when a goal goes in, and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points. The players involved will always be disappointed.'

"Tom Ince’s England future is in serious doubt after he and dad Paul took the decision to snub a place at the Under-21 European Championships this summer. Boss Gareth Southgate has warned his former England team-mate of the consequences of his son turning his back on the Three Lions. Ince Snr – England’s first black captain – has told Southgate they want to concentrate on Tom’s club career rather than represent his country in Czech Republic. Tom Ince has been left out of the latest England Under 21 squad by Gareth Southgate at his own request . Ince, currently on loan at Derby County, has been a regular under Southgate but will now not be selected . Goalkeepers . Marcus Bettinelli (Fulham) Jonathan Bond (Watford) Jack Butland (Stoke City) Defenders . Calum Chambers (Arsenal) Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur) Luke Garbutt (Everton) Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough) Carl Jenkinson (West Ham, on loan from Arsenal) Michael Keane (Burnley) Liam Moore (Brentford, on loan from Leicester City) John Stones (Everton) Matt Targett (Southampton) Midfielders . Tom Carroll (Swansea City, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur) Nathaniel Chalobah (Reading, on loan from Chelsea) Jake Forster-Caskey (Brighton and Hove Albion) Will Hughes (Derby County) Jesse Lingard (Derby County, on loan from Manchester United) Alex Pritchard (Brentford, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur) Nathan Redmond (Norwich City) James Ward-Prowse (Southampton) Forwards . Patrick Bamford (Middlesbrough, on loan from Chelsea) Saido Berahino (West Bromwich Albion) Danny Ings (Burnley) Callum Wilson (Bournemouth) That is certain to leave a bitter taste among those at the Football Association, including senior manager Roy Hodgson. Southgate said: ‘I have told Tom and Paul they need to be aware of the possible consequences of this decision in terms of how it would appear from the outside. I think they understand that. ‘I have had discussions with Tom and his dad over the last week or so and the message from both was exactly the same. I have to say I was surprised. ‘It was not something we’d been conscious of previously and it is for Tom to explain his full reasons. ‘But he feels at this moment in time he has got some priorities at club level. There is some uncertainty about where he is going to be next season.’ Southgate – speaking at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium where he announced his squad for forthcoming friendlies with Czech Republic and Germany - added: ‘He will not be involved in the summer now. That’s because he has been through qualifying and I assumed he would have wanted to put himself on this big stage. England captain Paul Ince has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a World Cup qualifier against Italy in Rome in 1997 . Southgate has warned Ince and father Paul of the consequences of the player turning his back on England . ‘I think in life you should be as open as you can to opportunities and stay in positions that lead to opportunities. Tom has decided this is an opportunity he doesn't want to take.’ Ince is currently on loan at Derby County after falling out of favour at Hull City, the club he only joined last summer amid interest from Inter Milan. However, it now appears he will again be on the move in the close-season. It was only this season that the 23-year-old told Sportsmail about his pride at representing England. Indeed, his dad’s blood-stained England shirt from the famous goalless draw in Italy which secured qualification for France ’98 is framed at home. Ince challenges for the ball with Middlesbrough's Lee Tomlin during Tuesday's top-of-the-table clash . And Ince had hoped for promotion to Hodgson’s full squad after his appearance at the Euros. ‘I’ve had two great years at Under-21 level and my ambition now is to try to push for the senior team,’ he said in September. ‘Playing for a club in the Premier League and the exposure that comes with that will hopefully provide me with the pathway to do it. ‘You can see at the minute Roy Hodgson is giving a lot of young players from the Under-21s and Premier League clubs a chance. I hope I can get that opportunity – although it doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate playing for the Under-21s at major tournaments.’","Tom Ince has snubbed a place at the 2015 U21 European Championships .

"Wimbledon winner Andy Murray has blasted claims that he dislikes the English as 'nonsense' pointing out 'I am going to get married to one'. The British tennis number one, who will tie the knot with English fiancee Kim Sears in April, said he finds the accusation upsetting as some of his family are English as well as his future in-laws. 'The whole notion that I don't like English people is nonsense,' he said. 'I work with English people on a daily basis. I am going to get married to one. I live here. It is just nonsense.' Wimbledon winner Andy Murray, who will tie the knot with fiancee Kim Sears (pictured together) in April, has blasted claims that he dislikes the English as 'nonsense', saying: 'I am marrying one' 'That's the thing that upsets me the most about it. Some of my family are English. I am also getting married to an Englishwoman so my in-laws are all English.' He defended his late intervention into the Scottish independence debate to declare his support for a Yes vote on the eve of the referendum. 'I was lying awake at night. I wanted to say something,' said the Scot. 'The thing that irritates me the most is that somehow you can't be pro-independence and pro-British. 'My feeling is Scotland is its own country. Every country would work better if it was in control of its own destiny. 'I said at the time was that the people of Scotland will make the right decision. Just because I think one way doesn't mean it's the right way for Scotland.' He defended his late intervention into the Scottish independence debate to declare his support for a Yes vote on the eve of the referendum . His tweet saying that 'No campaign negativity totally swayed my view on this' provoked a backlash on the eve of the poll. And after an onslaught of abuse online, the player said he was 'disappointed' by his decision to send the tweet and claimed it was not really in his character. 'I don't normally do stuff like that. So, yeah, I was a bit disappointed by that. It's time to move on. I can't go back on that and I'll concentrate on my tennis for the next few months,' he said at the time. Murray first received his anti-English tag in 2006 as a 19-year-old when he jokingly said he  hoped 'anyone but England' would win the World Cup. But the champion tennis player insisted his commitment to playing for Great Britain was beyond doubt, saying he 'loved' representing his country. The champion insisted his commitment to playing for Great Britain was beyond doubt and said he 'loved' representing the country . He won the British public round when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the Wimbledon title in 2013 . 'When I compete for GB, I absolutely love it,' said Murray. 'My results when I have competed for GB since I was 12 would suggest that. 'When I represented Britain in the Olympics, I played maybe the best tournament of my life. I love competing for my country. I don't think any differently about Great Britain after what has happened.' He inspired a generation and won the British public round when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the Wimbledon title in 2013. The historic win ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion. He has won 19 Davis Cup singles rubbers and lost only two and on Friday he will anchor the British side again in their anticipated World Group first-round match against the USA in Glasgow. Kim Sears  is also known for her fiery temper after she was caught swearing on camera in January and then turned up to Murray's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content' His long-term partner Kim has spent years cheering him on from the sidelines and is set to marry him this spring. The tennis star met his match when he first locked eyes with aspiring artist Kim at the US Open back in 2005. It was a year before the couple went public at a tournament in San Jose, California, where Murray scored his first big win. After the final he found his girlfriend in the crowd and gave her a kiss. She has been by his side  as he competed across the world ever since - often leading the fashion pack from the stands.

"Only once did Paul Ince pause for breath in Dublin 8 on Thursday. Nothing else fazed 'The Guv'nor' on a Carlsberg gig in the shadow of St Patrick's Cathedral. Not Roy Keane's managerial qualities, his relationship with Fergie, Ryan Giggs' role at Old Trafford, where Wayne Rooney should play, or Manuel Pellegrini's future. No. The only question which caused him to puff his cheeks and buy time, was a simple one: are Liverpool a better team with Steven Gerrard, or without? Paul Ince is pictured in Dublin on Thursday as he spoke about Liverpool vs Manchester United . With Manchester United docking at Anfield on Sunday, and Gerrard – or Stevie G as Ince called him - available after injury, the query was relevant. And Ince knew it. 'I think any Liverpool team with Stevie G is going to be better, not just from a footballing point of view but a leadership point of view,' he said. 'Stevie G is like a comfort blanket. When he is in your team you feel comfortable, you think 'oh good, Stevie G is there.' 'When Stevie G is not in the Liverpool team, players worry. But when they see him leading them out, they feel alright, 'we've got our leader here.' 'They've won without him, done well, but Sunday is one of those games where you need your men, your warriors, and that's what Stevie G is.' Whether Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers feels the same remains to be seen but Ince is adamant Gerrard should play. 'If I was manager, I'd pick him,' he said. With or without Gerrard, Ince feels Liverpool have a slight edge. Steven Gerrard (right) puts in a tackle on Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis at the Liberty on Monday night . 'If you'd asked me a couple of weeks ago I'd have said a comfortable win for Liverpool, now, I think there's a bit more to it as United were more like the old United against Tottenham. 'Liverpool are flying and are really strong at home, and I think they will win.' Not that a swallow will make a summer for a club without a championship since 1990. 'The only way Liverpool will overtake Man United is to start winning titles again,' acknowledged Ince. Ince is out of management since Blackpool showed him the door 14 months ago, but 45 minutes in his company left the impression he could do a decent job for any number of clubs. Open, engaging, informative, Ince covered almost as much ground as he did in a distinguished playing career which spanned 20 seasons, eight of which he spent at United, where he won plenty, and Liverpool, where he won nothing. At that time, Ince reckoned everyone wanted to play for those two clubs, but now they 'ain't the big giants anymore.' 'We're not talking about two teams fighting for the title, we're talking about two teams fighting for Champions League football. That says it all.' Ince feels that Liverpool are a better team with Gerrard as he looked ahead to Sunday's match at Anfield . 'If Chelsea were playing Man City the same day we'd be talking about those two giants instead.' While building up Roy Keane as a contender to manage Man United in the future, he doesn't believe Ryan Giggs can succeed Louis Van Gaal. 'Absolutely no chance,' he said. 'Giggsy's my mate and he enjoyed last year, he loved it. And now under Van Gaal he's learning. But I said to Giggsy, 'you gotta go to a club to get experience. Go manage a League One side or League Two side or because you're Ryan Giggs you might get a Championship team.' 'You can't just throw him into Man Utd, one of the biggest clubs in the world and say 'there ya go Giggsy.' He's not ready for that.' 'Why would you put Giggs in a situation where if he doesn't succeed you have to sack him? 'Learn from Van Gaal and then go out and find your own feet. Then come back and say 'I've done five or six years.' That's how I see the road for Giggsy.' Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs (left) speaks with Wayne Rooney during the FA Cup sixth round match against Arsenal last week . Ince took that route, starting off at Macclesfield and working his way to the Premier League in just two years at Blackburn, where he became the first black manager in the top flight. He hasn't made it back there again, and been out of work grates. 'You can't just say 'I'm Roy Keane' or 'I'm Paul Ince' and wait for someone to come. It doesn't work like that. You're soon forgotten. You've got to put your CV in. 'I don't want to go to a firefighting job. I want a three-year project, where you can build and try to be successful.' Ince retains the coltish enthusiasm of the tearaway teenager who broke through at West Ham under John Lyall in the late 80s where he played beside Liam Brady – for so long Ireland's comfort blanket. Ince (left) is pictured speaking to son Tom during his days in charge of Blackpool in September 2013 . 'I was watching Chippy last night on TV and I couldn't believe I played with him. Am I that old? Surely not, but what a player,' he smiled. 'Liam wasn't quick anyway and he was even slower at West Ham. But he had a wonderful, cultured left foot and his mind was so far in front of anyone else.' 'I was only 18-19 and thinking 'move over, old man I'm taking over' but he would flick the ball around the corners and get it back. He taught me a lesson.' Then, just like today, the top flight of English football had room for outstanding 34-year-olds. It's still a place for old men, like Stevie G.","Paul Ince says Liverpool are a better team with Steven Gerrard .

"And then there were eight. The line-up for the Champions League quarter-finals was completed on Wednesday night as Barcelona and Juventus sealed their passage and though it may be a total wipeout for the English clubs, we certainly have a high pedigree field. Now, more than ever, it's all about scoring goals at crucial moments as the Berlin final on June 6 looms on the horizon. But which of the eight survivors is best-equipped for the challenge? We assess the forward trios of each team. Lionel Messi was excellent for Barcelona in their last 16 defeat of Manchester City . Paris Saint-Germain vs Barcelona . Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid . Porto vs Bayern Munich . Juventus vs Monaco . BARCELONA . Lionel Messi - Absolutely mesmerising against Manchester City and we are swiftly moving into territory where Messi may be considered the best player of all time. The Argentine maestro has 43 goals and 23 assists in 40 outings so far this season and, as ever, is central to Barcelona's hopes of another European Cup triumph Rating: 9.5/10 . Neymar - A real joy to watch, the 23-year-old Brazilian just gets better and better with every passing week. May not be able to match Messi's prolific goalscoring but is just as influential when it comes to carving out chances with a moment of magic 9 . Luis Suarez - His troubles of last summer behind him, £75m man Suarez is slowly growing into the kind of player Barcelona want him to be. Looks comfortable working in tandem with Messi and Neymar, running City ragged in the first leg of the last round tie 7.5 . TOTAL: 26/30 . Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart and Barcelona's Neymar compete for the ball . Luis Suarez tormented Manchester City in the round of 16 tie which Barcelona won 3-1 on aggregate . REAL MADRID . Cristiano Ronaldo - It's become a season of frustrations for Real Madrid, but Ronaldo rises serenely above the negativity. With 41 goals and 21 assists in 39 appearances, his return this season has been as good as ever. Their guiding light when Real ended their long wait of the 10th European Cup triumph last season, he is needed again now 9 . Gareth Bale - It's been a turbulent season for the Welshman, who seems to have been made the Bernabeu scapegoat for their shaky form post-Christmas, leading to suggestions he may return to the Premier League in the summer. But he has still scored 16 goals in all competitions this season 7 . Karim Benzema - Often overshadowed by the aforementioned Bale and Ronaldo, the French striker just gets on with the business of scoring goals. He has plundered 20 in the season so far and is always capable of getting into dangerous positions 7.5 . TOTAL: 23.5/30 . Cristiano Ronaldo is, as ever, integral to Real Madrid's hopes of winning the trophy . Gareth Bale has endured a difficult season but is sure to have an influence in the latter stages . Karim Benzema celebrates a goal for Real Madrid against Schalke in the second leg . JUVENTUS . Carlos Tevez - The renaissance of Tevez continued this week as his two goals in the Westfalenstadion carried Juventus through at the expense of Borussia Dortmund and increased his season's tally to 23, including six in eight in Europe. His deadly finishing combined with a strong work ethic is one of the reasons Juventus can be considered dark horses 8 . Alvaro Morata - A 22-year-old with plenty of maturity and promise, moving from Real Madrid to Juventus for £17m last summer has proved the making of Morata. Also scored in Dortmund on Wednesday night and has 11 for the season 7 . Roberto Pereyra - Proving an increasingly integral part of Massimiliano Allegri's system, Argentine Pereyra has licence to roam and run at defences. The 24-year-old has proved he can cut it at the top level this season 7 . TOTAL: 22/30 . Carlos Tevez helped Juventus cruise past Borussia Dortmund 5-1 in the round of 16 .

VIDEO Allegri not surprised by Champions League win . MONACO . Dimitar Berbatov - The most chilled footballer around, Berbatov can still deliver the goods, as shown by his goal in Monaco's shock 3-1 win over Arsenal in the first leg of the last round. His goal tally may not be what it once was, but the Bulgarian is still more than capable of producing a moment of magic 7 . Anthony Martial - While Berbatov is winding down, Martial is stepping up to the big time and hoping to live up to expectations. His goal return of five in 23 games this season isn't really good enough to suggest he'll take the Champions League by storm 6 . Yannick Ferreira Carrasco - Monaco's other great young hope, Belgian winger Ferreira Carrasco came off the bench to score the decisive third at the Emirates. Can trouble defences with his pace and positivity. 7 . TOTAL: 20/30 . Dimitar Berbatov leaps above the Arsenal defence during the second leg of their last 16 tie . Anthony Martial gets clear of Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin during the second leg in Monaco . Monaco's Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco challenges for the ball with Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny . PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN . Zlatan Ibrahimovic - PSG's one-man show just can't keep himself out of the headlines, for better or worse. We all know, on his day, the Swede can be unplayable but PSG will have to do without him in the last eight following his sending off against Chelsea. Get through that and he could help them spring a surprise 8 . Edinson Cavani - Long-linked with a move away from the French champions, if Cavani is to depart this summer he'll want to go out with a flourish. An ever-present in the Champions League this season, the Uruguayan has a great return of 18 goals this season, a third of those coming in Europe 7.5 . Ezequiel Lavezzi - It's been a hit-and-miss season for the Argentine, who has also been linked with a move away from the Parc des Princes. Nonetheless, he played a role in helping to guide PSG past Chelsea in the last round and could yet conjure a winning moment 6.5 . TOTAL: 22/30 .

Edinson Cavani in a test of strength with Chelsea's Willian during last week's second leg in London . Ezequiel Lavezzi sneaks up on Chelsea captain John Terry during the match at Stamford Bridge . BAYERN MUNICH . Robert Lewandowski - With so many magnificent creative talents in the team, it's little wonder Bayern Munich are dominating domestically and the favourites to win the European Cup. But those chances need to be converted and Lewandowski has been the man this season, with 17 goals in all competitions. There's also that Thomas Muller fella too... 8.5 . Arjen Robben - He may be into his fourth decade but Robben is arguably in the form of his life. He has a remarkable 17 goals in 20 in the Bundesliga, plus a couple more in Europe this season and has been terrorising defences and taking great pleasure from it 8.5 . Franck Ribery - On the other side, Bayern's alternative attacking force - Ribery. With three goals in the Champions League campaign, he will inevitably have an impact if Bayern are to go all the way again 8 . TOTAL: 25/30 . Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich in their 7-0 rout of Shakhtar Donetsk . Arjen Robben shows his flawless volley technique in the last 16, second leg tie with Shakhtar .

Jackson Martinez - If Porto are to replicate their feats of 2004 and win the Champions League, the goals of Colombian Martinez will be key. He's already carrying them along, with five in the group phase. Despite his absence with a calf injury, Porto prospered against Basle in last round but will want him back with tougher tests lying in wait 7.5 . Cristian Tello - It's been a productive loan spell for Tello, with seven goals and 11 assists contributed by the Barcelona forward. With a long-term stay at the Nou Camp pretty unlikely, Tello should use these high-profile Champions League games as a shop window 7 . Hector Herrera - The Mexican midfielder's form is increasingly sharp, reaching a peak in the second leg with Basle where he scored and created another for Vincent Aboubakar. With nine assists overall this season, he can supply the ammunition for Martinez and Tello ahead of him 7 . TOTAL: 21.5/30 . Cristian Tello leaps over the Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik during the second leg . ATLETICO MADRID . Mario Mandzukic - Replacing Diego Costa is no mean task, but Mandzukic has made a decent fist of it with 20 goals this season, including five in the Champions League. If Atletico are to replicate last season's amazing run to the final, they'll need a few more from him 7.5 . Antoine Griezmann - The Frenchman has been Atletico's driving force and a very classy one at that. He has 17 goals and six assists so far this campaign and plays with flair and confidence 8 . Fernando Torres - A striker who is slowly but surely putting the torrid times endured at Chelsea and Milan behind him back on familiar turf.

Hart was in inspired form at the Nou Camp on Wednesday as he pulled off a string of world-class saves to keep the scoreline down.

"Australia reached the semi-final’s of the World Cup as they defeated Pakistan by six wickets on Friday. Under the lights at the Adelaide Oval a drop by Rahat Ali proved to be the turning point as Australia chased down the below-par 213 set by Pakistan. The recalled Josh Hazlewood took 4-35 to restrict the 1992 World Cup winners to such a low total before Shane Watson hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie. Mitchell Starc celebrates a wicket with his team-mates as Australia ripped through Pakistan's batting line-up . Sohail Khan successfully appeals for the wicket of Aaron Finch, as Pakistan fought back with the ball . Sohail Khan puts down a catch in the outfield, as Pakistan failed to take their chances and apply the pressure . Aggressive, brave, attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the World Cup so far. Brendon McCullum, AB de Villiers and today Michael Clarke are proving that despite the wickets by-and-large being a paradise for batsmen, their ingenuity can and does lead to success. Yet Misbah brings his own unique style of captaincy to the table with a calm demeanour, even in the face of collapse and struggle, that breeds belief within his side and almost earned them a shock win. Pakistan came into the match in a confident mood, on the back of four successive victories, following heavy defeats in the first two matches of the World Cup group stage. Batting first, after winning the toss, seemed the sub-continental side’s best chance of defeating Australia. Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan’s centurion in their previous match against Ireland, couldn’t replicate his heroics as he edged Mitchell Starc to a diving Watson at slip for 10. And Hazlewood, brought back at the expense of Pat Cummins, justified his selection as he sent down a wide ball that moved away from Ahmed Shehzad and was edged to Clarke at second slip. Wahab Riaz cannot hide his disappointment as, despite a strong spell, Pakistan came up short . Shane Watson (left) and Steve Smith (right) steadied the ship as Australia eventually made it home safely . With both of Pakistan’s openers back in shed, the indomitable Misbah strode to the crease, in what was to be his final one-day international match. The circumstances, with Pakistan 24-2 in the sixth over, were nothing new to Pakistani captain who has long been called upon to be the saviour of the side – not least in this World Cup. But every great sporting saviour needs a bit of luck from time to time and Misbah’s came just two balls into his innings. Hazlewood steamed in, saw the ball clip the 40-year-old’s thigh pad and hit leg stump, the bails lit-up but then stayed in place. It was a lifeline both Misbah and his side desperately needed and along with Haris Sohail, Pakistan’s innings began to be rebuilt. The pair shared a 73-run third wicket partnership and just when they looked ready to propel their side to a competitive total, greed became the undoing of their usually risk-free leader Misbah. Misbah-ul-Haq top scored for Pakistan with 34, as they lost wickets at regular intervals against Australia . Umar Akmal works the ball away behind square on the offside, as plenty of Pakistan batsmen got in and out . Mitchell Starc dives to take a catch which ends the Pakistan innings in the final over of their 50 . Equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from Australian captain Clarke, who brought Glenn Maxwell back despite Misbah having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack. But, it was Maxwell who had the last laugh as the right-handed batsman eyed the shortest boundary once more but instead holed-out to Aaron Finch in the deep for 34. It was a sad end for one of Pakistan’s greatest players, who passed 3,000 ODI runs as captain during his innings. A typical Johnson short ball got rid of the set Haris (41) before Maxwell claimed his second scalp of the innings as Umar Akmal (20) was dismissed in an identical fashion to his captain. So at 124-5 Shahid ‘Boom Boom’ Afridi, the only batsman to have hit more sixes than fours in ODI’s, was required to clear the ropes a few times. Though he did that, smashing three four’s and one six in his innings, he needed to make far more than the 23 of 15 balls that he amassed. Pakistan bowled well early on, but didn't take their chances as Australia began to exert control . Australia’s fast bowlers; Hazlewood and Starc (2-40) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213, they were the side on top going into the break. The statistics really best summed up Pakistan’s batting performance; eight batsmen made double figures, none of them passed 50, all 10 were out caught. Pace bowlers have dominated the World Cup thus far and with both sides boasting some of the best in business it was of little surprise that Australia faltered in their chase of their modest target. Sohail Khan trapped Finch plumb in front for just two and although Finch reviewed the decision, there was no changing how straight the delivery was. What followed, from the eighth over onwards was a masterclass in brutal but glorious fast bowling from Wahab Riaz. The 29-year-old’s first over accounted for the dangerous David Warner for 24 as he sent a short and wide delivery down third man’s throat. Wahab’s second got rid of Clarke (8) as another well-directed short ball was gleefully taken by Sohaib Maqsood at forward short leg. The left-handed bowler continued to steam in and had Shane Watson scampering around as if he was holding a bat for the first time. Steve Smith hit an excellent half century to set Australia back on the path to victory at the Adelaide Oval . And for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to Wahab’s name but for a spectacularly poor drop by Rahat Ali at fine leg as Watson sent the ball to him. Meanwhile at the other end Steve Smith, easily Australia’s best batsman for the past 12 months, was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings. But having made 65, the 25-year-old seemed to momentarily lose concentration and fell lbw to a fuller Ehsan Adil delivery. The task of seeing Australia home then fell on Watson's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings, he shared an unbeaten 68-run partnership with Maxwell (44 not out) as Australia reached their target with 16 overs to spare. Undeniably Wahab produced one the greatest World Cup bowling spells and deserved so much more then to be on the losing side. Australia may have outplayed India, their semi-final opponents, during the tri-series prior to the World Cup but the match on Thursday will be very different. The 2011 World Cup champions have considerably raised their game and Australia will face their sternest test yet in Sydney as they chase a fifth World Cup title.","Pakistan bowled out for 213 in the final over of their 50 .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr has refused to agree to a $5million (£3.4m) fine should either he or Manny Pacquiao fail a drug test, according to the Filipino star's adviser. Both fighters are subject to random, Olympic-style testing by USADA in the build up to their $300m (£200m) mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2. Should either fail a test, they would likely be banned for four years but Pacquiao also wanted a financial penalty. Manny Pacquiao had his first blood and urine test last Saturday ahead of his fight against Floyd Mayweather . Pacquiao and Mayweather must both undergo random testing which is overseen by USADA . 'Today we were informed that Mayweather turned down the request,' Michael Koncz told EPSN. 'Manny had requested that there would be a reciprocal fine of $5 million for a failed drug test.' The details of the testing were not written into the fight contract but were instead included in a separate agreement. And Mayweather's adviser Leonard Ellerbe said that was Pacquiao's mistake. 'Michael Koncz is an idiot, and Manny Pacquiao should be ashamed to have him as his representative, in my opinion,' he told ESPN. 'It's obvious he didn't read the contract. Why would he have his fighter sign something he was not happy with? Mayweather and Pacquiao failed to agree a $5million penalty should either man fail a drug test . Mayweather has long demanded his opponents submit to random, Olympic-style drug testing . 'The deal was negotiated up and down by his promoter  on behalf of Manny with Floyd and Mayweather Promotions, and it's been well documented in the media for quite some time. 'If this moron didn't convey his fighter's wishes when the negotiation was going on, that's their problem. This is a lame-ass attempt to generate publicity.' Drug testing was the central reason for a collapse in negotiations five years ago when Pacquiao refused to agree to the same strict conditions. Pacquiao was tested for the first time last Saturday when he was visited in Los Angeles.","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are undergoing random drug tests .

"Officers are searching for three men wanted on assault charges after a public brawl with two teenagers in front of a bar on St Patrick's Day. Police say the three men, who were all dressed in New York Jets jerseys, got into an argument with the 17-year-old victims inside O’Brien’s in Midtown Manhattan before the fight spilled into the street. Pix11 reports the two teenagers were transported to Bellevue Hospital with facial fractures after being punched, kicked and hit with bottles. Scroll down for video . Street fight: A bottle is wield by one man (left) as a group brawled outside of O'Brien's bar on St Patrick's Day in midtown Manhattan, leaving two teenagers injured, police say . Huffington Post reports that bystander Anthony Rooar Decarlis was out drinking when he saw the fight occur, so he pulled out his phone to record a video of the fight. 'All of a sudden this fight just erupted,' Decarlis said. 'I started recording. There were three different fights. One guy got hit with a bottle, one guy fell to the ground and got kicked in the face.' One of the men struck during the brawl was knocked unconscious with his eye 'swollen up to the size of a grapefruit,' according to Decarlis. 'People were trying to see if he had a pulse,' he added. Decarlis said he called 911 after recording the fight, but said he left before officers arrived because onlookers had called police as well. Huffington Post reported that on Wednesday they were told the NYPD had 'no complaint report on file for this incident.' Caught on tape: Anthony Rooar Decarlis says he recorded the fight on his cellphone before calling police, though he left before officers arrived . Search: Police are looking for three individuals who fought in front of a midtown Manhattan bar, leaving two teenagers with facial fractures . No arrests: Though a bystander says he called police, he left before officers arrived, and Huffington Post said the NYPD did not have a complaint report on file for the incident . Decarlis posted the video to Facebook where it has so far earned more than 450,000 views and added the hashtag #WORLDSTAR, referencing a popular site for videos of fights. He also criticized lack of attention on the St Patrick's Day brawl after New York media outlets covered a group of black teens who beat a 15-year-old in a Brooklyn McDonald's extensively last week. 'I feel like the media is trying to show African-Americans in such a negative light,' Decarlis said, explaining he'd like to see 'public outrage' over the drunken brawl, which appeared to include only white males. Police have arrested six allegedly involved in the Brooklyn beating, which left a teenage girl with non-life threatening injuries. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video 'deeply disturbing' and suggested the attackers had 'mental health' issues that needed to be addressed, as well as said bystanders should have stepped in. Community organizer Tony Herbert, meanwhile, sided against television and video games while trying to find a reason behind the attack. 'Young people don't have positive images in front of them,' Herbert told ABC7. 'They get these dumb reality TV shows, the violent video games and the music.'","The NYPD are searching for three men seen wearing Jets jerseys .

"A former Royal Marine killed fighting Islamic State extremists was last night described as a ‘one-man army’ who was ‘very angry about the Middle East’. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by atrocities carried out by IS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Scroll down for video . Last message: In the video message Mr Scurfield says he was in Syria of his ‘own free will’ and had gone there ‘to help’ Konstandinos Erik Scurfield (kneeling) pictured with Jordan Matson (second from right), a former US soldier . The Marine’s family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated at being told of his death on Monday. In a statement, they said: ‘His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.’ Last night video footage emerged of the Afghanistan veteran in Syria wearing combat gear, jeans and a black T-shirt. Speaking to the camera he says: ‘My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.’ It also emerged that he was questioned by police last October on suspicion of going to Syria to fight jihadists. On camera: Mr Scurfield introduces himself to the camera before giving a short message explaining why he has gone to fight Isis . Mr Scurfield (pictured), one whose fellow-fighters said he 'gave his life combating terrorism for his nation' He was preparing to fly from the US to Turkey after contacting a Kurdish group on Facebook. He was returned to his unit in Arbroath, Scotland, but decided to leave the Armed Forces before Christmas so he could travel to the war-torn region to fight. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the US Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of Islamic State, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. Mr Scurfield, known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting Islamic State in Syria. The former drama student, who had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines aged 21, was described by his comrades as ‘Kosta’s one-man army’ who raised the morale of fighters. John Foxx, who served alongside him in a team of foreign fighters nicknamed the Chappies, said: ‘He was hands down one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. ‘From beginning to end he was 100 per cent about helping everyone else. ‘No matter what the issue was or who you were he would try to help you however he could.’ Last night a fellow Royal Marine said: ‘He was very angry about the Middle East and the Islamic State. ‘As a unit we had been on standby several times but nothing happened and he was frustrated that the UK was standing back. ‘He was a very focused and good Marine, but the Islamic State was his priority.’ While back in the unit he became ‘tired of seeing what IS were doing to people’, and decided to quit to join the Kurdish Peshmerga after befriending fighters in the region on Facebook. Mr Scurfield left his UK base in November, telling his parents and three siblings that he was going to provide ‘medical and humanitarian support’ as an expert in battlefield medicine. Fellow fighters in Mr Scurfield's 'Lions of Rojava' group have posted tributes to him online today . Mr Scurfield was described by family friends as 'strong-willed', with a 'deep sense of duty and honour' A pro-Kurdish campaigner says he has informed Mr Scurfield's family of his death. They said last night they had not had official confirmation. Pictured: Mr Scurfield . Konstandinos Erik Scurfield died while fighting with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG) in the Al-Hasakah province on Monday . But last night details emerged from soldiers fighting on the frontline in Syria that painted Mr Scurfield as a hardened warrior desperate to help the Kurds defeat jihadists. 'We are devastated to confirm the death of our son Konstandinos Erik Scurfield in Syria where he went to support the forces opposing Islamic State. 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' Mr Foxx added: ‘He would always volunteer to be on the ambush team, spend the night on the berm [defence fortification] or go on any assault.’ Jordan Matson, a former US soldier also fighting with the Kurds, paid tribute on Facebook to Mr Scurfield, describing him as a ‘disciplined warrior’. He added: ‘Kosta volunteered for every attack and guard duty opportunity. He wanted nothing more than to bring the fight to the enemy.’ In recent weeks his father, archaeologist Christopher Scurfield, and his mother Vasiliki – a writer and teacher – became increasingly concerned and contacted their MP for help. Neighbours of the family, Mary-Jane Hemmings (left) and David Miller (right), paid tribute to 'Kostas' today . The Lions Of Rojava boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Jordan Matson, the former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. The Lions of Rojava (pictured) are a group of foreign fighters dedicated to fighting and defeating ISIS . Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said: ‘They came to me a few weeks ago very worried for their son’s safety and tragically it appears their worst fears have been realised.’ He said the young man had been ‘horrified by the atrocities carried out by IS’. Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner, who broke the news to the family, said: ‘It was very, very emotional, she was literally in tears for the whole conversation.’ He said the Peshmerga wanted to bury Mr Scurfield as ‘one of their comrades in arms, as a hero’. The Royal Marines were understood to have been ‘upset’ that he had chosen to fight with the Kurds rather than the British military. David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday warned against British nationals travelling to Syria to fight. People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters sit in the back of pick-up truck in the town of Tal Hamis in Syria. Mr Scurfield was fighting alongside the YPG .

"When Manny Pacquiao promised to come out swinging against Floyd Mayweather Jnr, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. The Filipino star looked relaxed as he took his mind off his upcoming $300million (£200m) mega-fight with a trip to the playground. Earlier on Wednesday, Pacquiao had completed the 15th day of his training camp with little more than six weeks until he faces Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2. Manny Pacquiao headed for the playground after his morning workout in Los Angeles . Pacquiao appeared without a care in the world as he continued preparations for Floyd Mayweather . The day before, the 36-year-old sparred for the first time with partners Edis Tatli and Kenneth Sims Jnr, completing a total of five rounds. Tatil, a Finnish lightweight, has lost just once in 25 fights while Sims has fought just five times but his style has been likened to Mayweather's. 'After 13 days of strength and conditioning and boxing drills at Wild Card plus weeks more of working out in the Philippines in February, it was great to finally put on the headgear and spar,' Pacquiao said. Mayweather continued to work on the pads in his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather also worked the heavy bag and tweeted that his training was 'easy work' 'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.' Trainer Freddie Roach, meanwhile, said he was impressed with what he had seen. 'Manny looked so fresh today. I'm very happy with what he showed me,' he said. 'You couldn't tell he had been away from the ring since the Algieri fight in November. Manny is on fire in the gym.' Mayweather on the other hand, was sticking to more tried and tested training methods as he continued to work on the pads. The 38-year-old seemed to be enjoying himself, tweeting 'Easy work' after his session.","Manny Pacquiao took a trip to the playground after his training session .

"A picture is definitely worth a thousand words, especially in this mesmerising new time-lapse video showing a century of beauty in Korea. In the latest 100 Years of Beauty film,  model Tiffany Lee is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010. The fast-changing video shows the elaborate looks worn early last century from intricate woven looks to carefully styled curls - and how political change influenced styles. Scroll down for video . The first look in the video shows Korean model Tiffany, at a time when Korea was first under Japanese rule . During this time, women preferred ornamented hairstyles and minimal make-up . What is truly captivating is the manner in which the styles mirror the economic, political and social disparity in the country during the respective decades. Between the 1910s and 1940s, the video captures how women copied beauty trends from Japan, such as ornamented hairstyles, and emulated Western trends such as finger curls from the flapper era. The trends continue until the clip reaches the 1950s where the screen splits into two, to reflect the historical division of Korea into separate states (North and South), during the Second World War. In 1945, Korea was divided into two spheres of influence, during which America controlled South Korea, and Russia installed a Communist regime in North Korea, later surrendering power to China. In the Fifties, following the divide of the country, South Korea showed an understated appropriation of Western trends with TIffany wearing lightly rouged cheeks, scarlet lips and a styled quiff. But in North Korea, women were fresh-faced, hair was scraped back and the model is shown wearing a military cap, which signals the beginning of repression under the Communist regime. Under the Japanese colonial rule, Koreans preferred to emulate Japanese beauty trends, which in the Twenties included pinned hair and fresh-faced make-up . In the 1930s, Korea was still very much emulating Japanese beauty trends, such as matte red lips and hats . The video is the latest in a series by Cut.com, which created two demonstrations of 100 years of American beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty  in Iran over the last century. The latest installment in the series reveals how South Korea's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the Second World War and beyond. But  in North Korea, women's styles reflected huge political upheavals and government propaganda, with women donning humble peasant hats, modes headscarves and Army caps. The American trend of finger curls were worn by style-conscious Korean women in the Forties . In the Fifties, Korea is divided into two states - the trends reflect that America controlled the South, and Russia created a communist state in North Korea . By the time it was the Swinging Sixties made it to  Korea, the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious. The South, very much focused on capitalism, appropriating glamorous trends from the US or Japan. This is depicted by the berry-pink lips, pencilled-in brows and dark,  bouffant-styled hair with a dramatic side-parting. Tiffany blows kisses alluding to female freedom and a growing sexualisation. On the other hand, the looks for North Korean women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna, synonymous with labourers at the time. The Sixties shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals, with South looking to American trends and the North sticking with Communist ideologies . North Korea's Communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers. This is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this . While North Korea  focuses on women as labourers and providers, South Korea follows American trends freely . This portrayal was created by the Communist ideologies in the North: propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed-down, healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful. Tiffany even has freckles pencilled in, showing her exposure to the sun as a worker. The Seventies similarly saw South Korea following American trends, as the model showcases garish earrings, a stylish bandanna, winged eyeliner and a beehive. But in  North Korea, Tiffany is depicted in a worker's straw hat, and seen wiping sweat off her brow. The styling reflects the diktats that were less about vanity, but more about what a person could contribute to society - this longstanding belief is shown by the fact that the make-up trends are pretty much unchanging in North Korea from the Fifties until the Nineties. The Eighties were still seeing South Korea's preoccupation with following capitalist trends, as shown by Tiffany's appropriation of the 'techno' trend. In the 1990s, the North saw a widespread famine, bringing economic hardship to an already repressive regime . While South Korean women made sure their hair was as big as possible, slapped on pink eyeshadow, pink lipstick and matching blusher, their northern counterparts wore simple bobs and kept their faces largely make-up free. In the Nineties, South Korea fell victim to the techno trend, shown by the use of fake eyelashes, wild teased bunches and neon clips in the hair. Tiffany is shown joyfully dancing and pouting in a playful manner. The 1990s saw a widespread famine for North Korea,  which saw around one million people die of starvation. This explains Tiffany's sombre expression; the hair is sleek and pulled down into a modest ponytail, and the make-up is subtle. The Noughties saw the South continue on its glamorous trajectory while the North was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry . In the 2010s, North Korea has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women, shown by Tiffany's increased use of make-up and accessories. The South have continued appropriating Western trends . In 1992 Kim Jong Il began to take over North Korea, and instituted a policy whereby the military was emphasised above all aspects of society and dominated resources. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, and travel restrictions were tightened. Security surrounding the country was also strengthened - all leading to a highly repressive way of life, where many people are denied basic human rights. This is shown in the video where the Noughties continue on its glamorous trajectory, but Tiffany in North Korea sees a return to the days where women sport military gear. As time went on, South Korea became an industrial powerhouse and women were able to campaign for legal equality and became increasingly independent. This is shown by Tiffany's freedom in terms of her physical appearance: sporting tanned skin, garish jewellery and glamorous make-up, as well as pouting  in a sensual manner. At this time, North Korean beauty ideals are shown to still be very subtle and modest in the Noughties, but there are slight advancements in terms of hair accessories, and relatively minimal make-up with small dabs of eye shadow and slightly glossed lips.

"The total wipeout of English clubs from European competition this week has led to another feverish debate about where our game stands in relation to our continental counterparts. But before we get too down about things, there is still one Englishman standing in Europe this season. Manchester City may have crashed out to Barcelona but their on-loan defender Micah Richards is still eyeing European glory with Italian side Fiorentina. Manchester City defender Micah Richards is currently on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina . The 26-year-old helped Fiorentina to knock out Tottenham during the Europa League round of 32 . Richards is the only remaining English player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the Champions League and the Europa League. His team produced a stunning performance to beat Serie A rivals Roma 3-0 in the Stadio Olimpico and complete a 4-1 aggregate triumph. Although Richards was not involved, he has featured in the Europa League this season and helped them knock out another Premier League club, Tottenham, in the round of 32. Richards, 26, had fallen out of favour under Manuel Pellegrini at City, making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first-team opportunities in Florence. And while he has not been a mainstay of Vincenzo Montella's team, he has made 15 appearances across all competitions, almost certainly more than he would have made at City. Richards began to find first-team opportunities limited playing for Manchester City and was sent on loan . England international Richards has admitted he is uncertain where he will be playing his football next season . Richards could feature in the latter stages of the competition as La Viola bid to win their second European trophy in Warsaw on May 27. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan at the end of the season, who are managed by his former City boss Roberto Mancini. But Richards told talkSPORT on Wednesday: 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment. Every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me, I'm still only 26 and I just want to play every game, that's what's important.' For now, however, Richards is flying the flag solo for England in European competition. Richards has been linked with a move to Inter Milan, managed by his former City boss Roberto Mancini .","All English clubs have been knocked out of European competition this season .
This leaves Micah Richards as the only English player in the Europa League .

"On Sunday Manchester United will travel to Liverpool for their biggest match of their season. It will be a rip-roaring, full-bloodied battle which may well be settled by one moment of magic - an occasion made for those who shine on the biggest stages. And yet last year's Champions League man-of-the-match, a man who also played at the World Cup in Brazil, may well struggle to make Louis van Gaal's starting line-up. Angel di Maria has had a difficult start to life in a Manchester United shirt since arriving from Real Madrid . Di Maria (second right) has suffered a Fernando Torres-eque loss of form that nobody saw coming . Based on ability, Angel di Maria should be a shoo-in. His explosive pace and unnerving eye for a killer pass would seem to be the perfect fit for a 90 minutes in which United may well spend long periods on the back foot, looking to counter. But the skills that made Ed Woodward write Real Madrid a cheque for the best part of £60m have rarely been displayed after Di Maria suffered a Fernando Torres-esque loss of form that nobody saw coming. The promise of an explosive partnership down the left with fellow new boy Luke Shaw had United fans drooling. Louis van Gaal has stuck by his man so far, but he has a big decision to make ahead of Sunday's match . Manchester United travel to Liverpool, and Di Maria may not be in the starting line-up at Anfield . Di Maria, however, did not want to leave Madrid and that is where the problems began. Then came the weather. Mancunian winters, as Roy Keane pointed out, can be hard to endure for those used to sunnier climes. Six hours of grey light a day and continual rain can hammer at the mindset of those not used to it. Di Maria also struggled to adapt to Louis van Gaal's tactical switches. He is not alone in that, and has rarely been given licence to roam up and down the left wing. The problems for Di Maria began when he left Madrid - he was happy there and did not want to leave . Di Maria was sent off in Manchester United's FA Cup clash with Arsenal earlier in March . Van Gaal pointed out that most players do not find their feet until their second season - but try telling that to Chelsea fans who have seen Diego Costa fit seemlessly into Jose Mourinho's Premier League leaders. As if the above were enough to contend with, then came the break-in. Sat at home in a foreign country watching TV with your wife and young daughter when suddenly a quiet night in is interrupted by the terrifying sound of raiders armed with scaffolding poles trying to smash their way into your isolated house. Juan Mata started for Manchester United in Di Maria's absence against Tottenham and impressed throughout . Van Gaal now has to decide whether to stick or twist - Mata (centre) or Di Maria (right) on Sunday? Yes, the thugs were disturbed by the alarm system and made their getaway. But the trauma of that experience must remain. There may have been, and may still be, recurring nightmares. In a state of panic, the Di Marias fled to a city centre hotel with a security team. The family now live high above the ground at a separate city centre apartment. It is safe and it is luxurious but it may well feel like a prison and is not the ideal environment in which to raise a young child. Van Gaal, a family man, knows this. He has given Di Maria compassionate leave and stood by his man after the latest low, a red card for grabbing referee Michael Oliver's shirt in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal. Di Maria has shown flashes of his potential, scoring four goals in United colours since his arrival in August . Di Maria (right) was all smiles on international duty in September, but his form has been poor for United . In the subsequent victory over Tottenham, for which Di Maria was suspended, United delivered their best 45 minutes of the season. Replacement Juan Mata linked well with Ander Herrera as Van Gaal's side displayed a synchronicity rarely seen this season. The Dutchman now has to decide whether to stick or twist. Mata, for all his qualities, lacks pace. Di Maria is a better player but can he finally deliver when United need him most? With £60m already spent it is a gamble worth taking.","Manchester United travel to Liverpool for a huge game on Sunday .
Louis van Gaal has to decide whether to start out-of-form Angel di Maria .

These sides have met twice before in the Champions League quarter-final stage. The French side progressed 3-2 on aggregate in 1995, while Barcelona went through on away goals in 2013 (3-3 on agg).
Barcelona have never won in three away trips to face PSG (L2 D1), including a 3-2 defeat in this year’ group stage.
PSG have lost one and drawn two of their three visits to the Nou Camp to face Barca, including a 3-1 defeat in this year’s group stage.
Both teams have scored in six of the seven previous meetings between the sides in European competition. The only game where one team failed to score was in the 1997 Cup Winner’s Cup final, with Barcelona winning 1-0.
Lionel Messi has scored three goals in four Champions League games against the French side, while Neymar also scored in both group stage games against them this season.
Barca have lost just one of their last 11 games against French opposition, though this was against PSG this season (W6 D4).
Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid have already met six times this season with Atleti remaining unbeaten, winning four (including both league clashes) and drawing two.
Atletico Madrid have scored exactly once in all four previous European meetings with city rivals Real, winning just once and losing three.
Including this season, there has been at least one Spanish team in the Champions League quarter-final for the last 10 campaigns.
For only the third time in European Cup history, a quarter-final tie will feature two Spanish sides; however it is the second season in a row that this has happened (Real Madrid v Sevilla in 1958 and Atletico v Barcelona in 2014).
Bayern only lost 1 of 22 competitive matches versus Portuguese teams (13 W, 8 D): the European Cup final 1987: 1-2 versus Porto.
Bayern won the last knockout tie against a Portuguese team 12-1: 5-0 A and 7-1 H against Sporting in the Last 16 of the CL 2008/09.
Porto's one previous knockout European Cup victory over a German side came in the 1987 final; they have been eliminated from three knockout ties since, two against Bayern and one against Schalke.
Bayern Munich have kept seven clean sheets in their last nine against Portuguese sides, conceding just twice in total.
These two sides have only ever met before in the 97/98 Champions League, when Juventus won 4-1 at home and lost 2-3 in Monte Carlo on their way to the final where they lost 1-0 to Real Madrid.
In their 24 European meetings with French teams (including Intertoto), the Old Lady have lost just five times, winning 14 and drawing five.
However in the Champions League only, Juve has won just two of their six games against French sides (one win v Monaco in 1998 and a victory against Nantes in 1996).
In their 11 European meetings with Italian sides, Monaco have won just three times (D2 L6), although two of those victories have come in their last three clashes with Serie A sides."

"This is the touching moment a hundred strangers embraced a blindfolded Aboriginal woman on the middle of a popular beach. As part of a social experiment, Western Australian teenager Jasirah Bin-Hitam headed to Cottesloe Beach in Perth blindfolded with a sign that read: 'I trust you. Do you trust me? Let's hug.' The heart-warming video, uploaded yesterday by artist Peter Sharp, is intended to encourage Australian's to be more trusting. Western Australian teenager Jasirah Bin-Hitam is seen standing in the middle of Cottesloe Beach in Perth blindfolded with the simple sign . It begins with the 17-year-old Marine Biology student opening her arms and setting up the sign. While the crowd are initially dubious, they're soon swooping in for a warm embrace, telling Hitlam she is 'very brave' and 'bloody amazing darling.' After a sequence of heart-rending hugs, the video finishes with a concerning statistic from the Australian Reconiliation Barometer: . 'In 2012, only 13 per cent of Australians said they trusted an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.' Ms Bin Hitam told Seven News she hopes the video, which shows several 100 strangers offer her a hug in a half an hour, can help change that statistic. 'It was really emotional for me, having random people come up and hug me,' she said. While the crowd are initially dubious, they're soon swooping in for a warm embrace, telling Hitlam she is 'very brave' and 'bloody amazing darling.'

He told Seven News the video is intended to change people's conceptions. 'We are just human beings who want to make a difference and it can be as simple as standing there with a sign,' he said.

"Four more players have signed National Dual Contracts in Wales to take the current total number to 12. Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Biggar, Scott Williams and the uncapped Gareth Anscombe have all become NDC players just 24 hours after Rhys Webb was announced as the eighth signing. The four latest signings join Webb, captain Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Jake Ball, Samson Lee, Rhodri Jones, Tyler Morgan and Hallam Amos. Alun Wyn Jones is the highest profile name of the latest four Wales players to sign dual contracts . Dan Biggar and Scott Williams has taken the number of players signing dual contracts to 12 . Wales coach, Warren Gatland, said: 'Alun Wyn, Dan, Scott and Gareth represent a cross-section of experience, but each one of them is a player of proven talent. 'Within the group of 12 we have signed a mixture of emerging talent and players who have secured reputations for excellence through their appearances for their regions, Wales and the British & Irish Lions. 'The strength of the group is of great benefit to professional rugby in Wales and we are looking forward to working closely with the regions and these players in the years ahead.' Ospreys second-row forward Jones, who captained the Lions in their final Test victory in Australia in 2013, is the most high-profile of the new quartet to sign. Wales coach Warren Gatland has been boosted by the news and looks forward to working with the players . 'For me the National Dual Contract allows me to continue playing with ambition for the Ospreys and put myself in the best position to be selected for Wales,' Jones said. 'Hopefully, now a good number of players have committed to this process, there will be a clear pathway of progression for youth and regional players to perform on the international stage.' Ospreys team-mate Biggar said: 'I'm thrilled to have signed an NDC and honoured to have been considered for one in the first place. 'After a lot of consideration it's apparent that it's in the best interests of all parties.' Williams, who scored Wales' try in their 23-16 RBS 6 Nations victory over Ireland last weekend, added: 'I am very grateful to all the assistance I have at the Scarlets and within the Wales coaching structure, and I am now looking forward to continuing to work as hard as I can within Welsh rugby.' Wales face Italy in their final Six Nations game after defeating Ireland 23-16 on Saturday . The announcement of the four new deals comes just three days before Wales play Italy in Rome with a chance of winning the Six Nations title, although they have ground to make up on England and Ireland on the final weekend of the championship. Welsh Rugby Union Group chief executive Roger Lewis said: 'We have achieved our ambition of securing some of our most talented players under the umbrella of National Dual Contracts. 'This is a landmark moment for Welsh rugby and serves as evidence of our ambition to protect and develop regional rugby while ensuring the national squad can remain competitive in the top tier of the international game.'","Wales took their number of players signing National Dual Contracts to 12 .

"Britain is a nation of soap lovers, but it’s not just us humans that like to watch some on-screen drama. Apparently dogs – well a particular Shetland Sheepdog – just cannot get enough of popular soap opera EastEnders. Videoed lying on the sitting room floor, the dog named Alfie initially appears to be content minding its own business. Suddenly, Graham Broad’s iconic drum roll that features at the start of the famous EastEnders theme tune is audible from the television, and the dog turns towards it in anticipation. As the melody picks up, the dog, which is now staring intently at the screen, lifts its head back and lets out a little howl. At first it appears to be like any other dog singing along to a particular tune of their choosing. The Shetland Sheepdog named Alfie initially appears to be content minding its own business . But it’s only as the song continues that the dog’s musical prowess is shown off in all its glory. Howling in a relatively controlled manner, Alfie actually appears to mimic the exact notes present in the song. And better still the dog doesn't just howl over the top of the melody, but instead stops in time for the breaks within the composition. The dog listens to the sound of Graham Broad’s iconic drum roll that features at the start of the EastEnders theme tune . The video was captured by the dog's owners at home in Whitehall, London. Composed in 1984, the EastEnders theme tune is the work of Simon May and Leslie Osborne. The theme tune  was cited as the most recognisable piece of music in the UK in a 2008 poll conducted by PRS for Music, seeing off competition from the English national anthem. Alfie appears to mimic the exact notes present in the song and even pauses for the breaks .","The song's drum roll initially gets the dog's attention .

Lancaster believes the golfing showpiece contested by Europe and the United States every two years is the only sporting occasion that can match the drama created by the Six Nations' refusal to synchronise the last instalment of games. 'I can't think of another situation in sport where you'd go into it with this points differential that can affect the psychology, so it is different from a World Cup,' Lancaster said. 'The only scenario I can think of that is similar is the final day of the Ryder Cup when you're ahead or behind when the singles are coming. 'It's that sort of feeling. It will tell us a lot about the players, but it is a pretty unique situation as well.' England enter the final day with a points advantage of plus four and it is in the context of how Wales and then Ireland, who travel to Rome and Edinburgh respectively, perform that Lancaster must prepare his team. England players huddle up together as head coach Lancaster watches on during the open training session in south west London . England coach Lancaster says England must not try and win the game too early and deal with circumstances as they arise during the match . 'I have thought long and hard about the psychology of how you deal with your own players,' Lancaster said. 'There are only so many players who need to be involved in the key decisions. The rest of the players have been given a simple message - you go all-out for the win and you don't stop until 80 minutes is up. 'The key to begin with is not to chase the game too early. We have to go out there to perform and win the game, then we'll deal with whatever circumstances come along as we go.'

England's Jonathan Joseph runs with the ball during the Captain's Run at Twickenham on Friday . Lancaster has made one change to his starting XV after promoting Geoff Parling from the bench at the expense of Dave Attwood. Parling has called for England to stand up and be counted as they seek to claim a first title since 2011. 'These sort of games are when you probably see a team's character,' Parling said. 'We know there is a lot of pressure on it and we shouldn't hide away from that. We said at the start of the tournament: we have got to win it. We've come second for three years running. 'We messed up a bit in two games again, but we've got a chance here to put things right and win it. 'These are the games you want to play in, the games you want to show your character as a player, as a pack, as a team.'

"When Liverpool and Manchester United meet at Anfield on Sunday, there will not be a single local lad starting in this iconic fixture for the first time in the Premier League era. April 26 1992, the final time the two sides met in the old Division One, was the last time no player in Liverpool's starting XI was born within 30 miles of Anfield or a United player within the same distance from Old Trafford. In the 53 league and cup meetings since, the likes of Steven Gerrard - likely to start from the bench on Sunday - Jamie Carragher, Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler have starred for Liverpool, while United's local lads have included Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Danny Welbeck. Steven Gerrard looks dejected in defeat after Liverpool were beaten 3-0 by Manchester United last December . Local lad James Wilson also started that game for Manchester United . Manchester-born Danny Welbeck tackled by Gerrard at Anfield last season . Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Nevill during a game at Old Trafford in March 2010 . Wayne Rooney, a designated Scouser, doesn't count (although he was born less than four miles from Anfield), while Ryan Giggs is also excluded as he was born in Wales. Back in April 1992, when Liverpool won 2-0 at home, there were 11 English players on the pitch, but none born within 30 miles of either stadium. In fact, the closest on that day was Rob Jones, born 31 miles from Anfield - but in Wales. While Lancashire lad Mike Phelan, born 29 miles from Old Trafford, came off the bench that day for United. Liverpool's Robbie Fowler is sent tumbling by Manchester United's Nicky Butt in March 2001 .

Ryan Giggs of Manchester United goes past Liverpool's Jonjo Shelvey in January 2011 . In the most recent encounter between the two sides, a 3-0 home win for United in December, both clubs featured a local lad from the start. Gerrard began the game for Liverpool, while James Wilson, born in Staffordshire 27.5 miles away from Old Trafford, was selected by Louis van Gaal. Like Gerrard, there is also a possibility that Wilson and Tyler Blackett - also born in Manchester - could feature on Sunday. Jon Flanagan, meanwhile, will return at some stage from injury to boost the Reds' Scouse contingent. But with the departure of Welbeck from United last summer, and Gerrard leaving Liverpool at the end of the season, the chances are that the trend of no local lads starting the biggest game in English football will continue for a little while longer.","Steven Gerrard is set to start on the bench for Liverpool on Sunday .

"A year after letting top wide receiver DeSean Jackson go, Chip Kelly has again put his stamp on the Philadelphia Eagles with a jaw-dropping piece of business. Two-time All-Pro running back LeSean McCoy will be traded to the Buffalo Bills in exchange for third-year linebacker Kiko Alonso. The stunning trade will reunite Eagles head coach Kelly with former Oregon star Alonso, who is coming off ACL surgery after a dominant rookie year in 2013. LeSean McCoy will move to Buffalo to work under new head coach Rex Ryan . Kiko Alonso will be reunited with Chip Kelly as he looks to recover from ACL surgery . McCoy was regularly sidelined in favour of Chris Polk during the Eagles' disastrous stretch, which saw the Dallas Cowboys claim the NFC East title. The move should end CJ Spiller's time in Buffalo and further confirms the devaluation of the running back position. Freeing up $11.95million in cap space, the move adds fuel to the fire that the Eagles will move up for former Ducks quarterback - and Kelly protege - Marcus Mariota in April's draft. ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported the trade, with NFL.com's Michael Silver confirming the move.","LeSean McCoy, 26, heads to Buffalo after six season in Philadelphia .

"David de Gea's girlfriend Edurne Garcia has backtracked over claims she said Manchester is 'not very nice', insisting that words were put into her mouth by the media. Rumours of De Gea's exit from Manchester United were fuelled earlier this month when an interview with Garcia surfaced, in which she is alleged to have announced her dislike of the city. 'It's not very nice, that's for sure,' Garcia says in response to the presenter claiming 'Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.' Edurne Garcia has refuted claims she said Manchester is 'not very nice', insisting she loves the city . Edurne Garcia (left), a singer, is the girlfriend of Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . Garcia has backtracked over claims she told a Spanish television show that Manchester is 'not very nice' 'You have hunt out specific places, the nice places. But even then Spain is nicer.' But now, the singer, who will be representing Spain in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, has hit back at the reports, insisting that her words have been twisted. 'It was an incredible revolution but I didn't say that,' she told Chance. 'They put words in my mouth. I haven't said that. 'I don't know if they are seeking out the news or they want to be controversial, but it surprises me when I saw everywhere this sentence that I have never said. I am delighted with Manchester, I love it, and the city has wonderful corners.' De Gea's United contract runs out at the end of next season, and there are rumours of a return to Madrid . Garcia's initial comments on El Hormiguero fuelled rumours of the couple's return to Spain . Two days after the interview surfaced, Manchester City Council chief Pat Karney invited Garcia on a tour around the city, remarking 'the only thing Manchester has in common with a fridge is that it’s really cool' in an interview with Manchester Evening News. Garcia admits she is happy to be shown around: 'There's a Councillor who wants to show me the city, and I am delighted to know more wonderful corners in Manchester. But I have never said that. The people could watch the video and see that they misrepresent the information.' De Gea's contract at Old Trafford runs out at the end of next season, but there have been strong rumours regarding Real Madrid's interest in bringing the goalkeeper back to the city he was born in. Garcia's initial comments stoked the fire, but her most recent interview may provide some hope to Manchester United fans that they will keep hold of their star man beyond this season. Garcia has since been offered a tour around Manchester by a Councillor, which she gratefully accepted .

"Real Madrid and Barcelona have two of the most talented, and expensively assembled, teams in world football. But who would make a combined XI out of the two squads based, not on reputation, but on current form? Allow me to get ahead of the fury of the comments section. If you're Ancelotti do you pick Ronaldo? Of course you do. Cristiano Ronaldo may be the World Player of the Year, but on current form he doesn't make combined XI . Our combined XI, which has no place for Ronaldo, but does feature some of the world's best players . Ronaldo hasn't scored a league goal from open play in a month, and Gareth Bale is preferred on the wing . Did Ronaldo have a brilliant first four months of the season? Of course he did? Might he score the winner on Sunday? Quite possibly. Does he deserve to be in a combined XI based on current form. No. Goalkeeper - Marc-Andre ter Stegen . There are four to choose from. Keylor Navas has barely played and Iker Casillas continues make mistakes in big games – Schalke, Atletico Madrid - so that leaves the two Barcelona goalkeepers. Claudio Bravo is the league keeper but every time Marc-Andre ter Stegen plays he impresses and he’s fresh from a penalty save in midweek. Marc-Andre ter Stegen has not played in the league this season, but he has earned his chance this week . Right back - Dani Alves . It’s a close call between Alves and Dani Carvajal but the Brazilian shades it after an aggressive, positive performance in midweek and because for all his much-debated defensive shortcomings Carvajal has actually shown many of the same deficiencies of late. Dani Alves put in a strong performance against Manchester City, and just shades Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal . Centre back - Gerard Pique . One of the best defenders in Europe this season – so much for the poster boy with the pop star wife who was now more interested in playing poker and running his web business than playing football. No one has been better than Pique, not at Barca, not in La Liga, not anywhere. Gerard Pique, Europe's best defender this season, stops Sergio Aguero in the Champions League . Centre back - Pepe . He gets in just ahead of Ramos courtesy of the Spain defender having only just come back from injury. Pepe has held together Real Madrid’s defence in his partner’s absence and is playing like a man who wants and will probably be given a new contract. Has shown why Manuel Pellegrini wanted him at the start of the season. Portuguese centre back Pepe has been in excellent form in recent weeks, holding the Real defence together . Sergio Ramos (left) has returned to fitness, and should start on Sunday, but Pepe just pips him in our team . Left back - Jordi Alba . A very close call between Jordi Alba and Marcelo. Alba is the fastest full-back in football. The only defender quicker than Jesus Navas and he showed it on Wednesday. Marcelo offers Madrid so much going forward and has improved defensively but Alba shades it. Jordi Alba proved against Jesus Navas that he is the fastest full back in the world, and he makes the XI . Real Madrid's left back Marcelo has improved his game, and offers plenty going forward, but just misses out . Right midfield - Ivan Rakitic . Scored against City and in the league against Granada two weeks before. The Croatian is starting to show the sort of form that made him one of La Liga’s best midfielders last season. Ivan Rakitic has been a top performer for Barcelona recently, including his well-taken goal in midweek . Centre midfield - Javier Mascherano . It was bad luck for Manchester City that when injury hit Barcelona before the midweek second leg it probably made them even stronger. Sergio Busquets is perhaps the second best holding midfielder in the world, Mascherano, who as Roy Hodgson well knows (after getting slightly carried away and selecting him as the world's best player in the Ballon d’Or vote), is the best. The injury to Sergio Busquets has allowed Mascherano (left) to prove again that he is the world's best . Left midfield - Isco . He is not the complete midfielder that many Real Madrid supporters seem to believe he is but all the same he is in very special form at the moment and in this team he can play alongside Messi, who famously has a dog named after. Isco is in a rich vein of form for the European champions recently, and can thrive in a number of positions . Right forward - Lionel Messi . Does there need to be an explanation here? Lionel Messi mesmorised Manchester City in midweek with a performance for the ages at the Nou Camp . Messi is currently the best player in the world, on form, and possibly even the greatest of all time . Centre-forward - Luis Suarez . Selecting between Suarez and Karim Benzema was one of the toughest choices but in this combined super-team you have Messi dropping into midfield so the battering ram that is Suarez gets in ahead of him. Luis Suarez just edges in ahead of Karim Benzema to allow for his combination with Messi up front . Left forward - Gareth Bale . It has to be Bale or Ronaldo or Neymar so what can you do? Neymar and Ronaldo both went off in a huff in their last league games, Bale scored twice to silence some of the disproportionate criticism he has been on the end off. Put Bale back on the left where he can whip the ball on his favoured foot or just do as he did last season against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final and power so far in front of his marker that he can still cut inside and shoot. There is also only one player who has scored with a direct free-kick for Real Madrid this season... and it isn’t Ronaldo it’s Bale. TOTAL: BARCELONA 8 REAL MADRID 3 . Gareth Bale gets in ahead of Ronaldo after his two goals, complete with great celebration, against Levante . Bale can have a real impact if he is moved back to the left hand side, and starts up front in our team .","Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona on Sunday .
Barca are top of the league, one point ahead of their great rivals .

"John Terry has closed the door on a return to the England team despite his man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on Sunday. The former England captain retired from international football when he was suspended by the FA and banned for using racially insulting language towards Anton Ferdinand in 2011. After being cleared in a magistrates' court, he quit England in September 2012 after he was punished by the FA. John Terry shakes hands with Roy Hodgson (circled) after the defender's man-of-the-match performance in Chelsea's victory over Tottenham Hotspur - but he won't be returning to his England team . Terry (left) will not be returning to England's national side after rejecting talk of a comeback . Terry, celebrating at the national stadium after Chelsea's triumph, has closed the door on England . Terry, belting out the national anthem at Euro 2012, represented England 78 times and scored six goals . Caps: 78. Goals: 6. Games as captain: 34 (August 2006 - October 2009, March 2011 - November 2011). Debut: vs Serbia and Montenegro (H), friendly, June 3, 2003. Last game: vs Moldova (A), World Cup qualifier, September 7, 2012. Terry, 34, is playing some of the best football of his career but he cannot be tempted out of retirement. 'No, is the simple answer,' he said in response to questions about whether he would make an England return. 'I don’t want to go into it right now. 'Being back at Wembley, the atmosphere, the stadium, it’s one of the best I have played in, but it’s never crossed my mind. 'I have drawn a line under it and the England squad can move on now. 'They started playing the national anthem before the game and I was going then. I was ready before the game, I have missed it, playing in these big stadiums, and in these competitions. I’m delighted to get back to Wembley.' Terry might have been performing well alongside Gary Cahill (left) but he has no desire to do so for England . Terry captained England for two separate periods before quitting in 2012 after he was punished by the FA . Terry's England career saw him pick up 78 caps over a nine-year period and he was part of the squad at the World Cup in 2006 and 2010 as well as the European Championship in 2004 and 2012. He was twice named as captain, once under Steve McClaren - before later being stripped of the title - and again by Fabio Capello. Terry scored the opening goal for Chelsea as they ran out 2-0 winners over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, and was named the man of the match for his performance. Terry celebrates scoring the opening goal in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday . Diego Costa congratulates the Chelsea captain on his goal that put Chelsea ahead in the first half . And the Chelsea skipper, who was part of Jose Mourinho's dominant Chelsea side in his first spell between 2004 and 2007, saw the Wembley win as the start of a new blue era. 'That's the first one, it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us (to win the League Cup) in 2004-05 in Jose's first year here,' Terry told Sky Sports. 'That (Sunday's win) could be the start of something special but we have to kick on and we have the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win. It was a successful afternoon for Terry, but he later rejected talk of a return to the England set-up at Wembley . Terry celebrates in the goalmouth in front of the Chelsea supporters during the post-match party . 'The pressure was there before the game, obviously, but that's what cup finals do to you. I thought we played very well, handled the game very well and we're delighted with the win. 'I think it was a fairly even first half, second half I thought we controlled it a little bit better and deserved to win.'

August 10, 2006: Named England captain, with Steven Gerrard as his vice-skipper.

November 21, 2007: England fail to qualify for Euro 2008. February 5, 2010: Following allegations that he had an affair with former team-mate Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend, Terry is stripped of the England captaincy. June 27, 2010: Starts in all four of England's World Cup games, ending in a 4-1 second-round defeat by Germany. March 20, 2011: Reinstated as captain by Fabio Capello. The England manager says: 'I think one year's punishment is enough.' February 3, 2012: Terry is stripped of the England captaincy for a second time with the FA deciding it would be inappropriate for him to lead his country in light of his clash with Anton Ferdinand. June 24, 2012: Starts in all four Euro 2012 matches for England but they are knocked out by Italy. July 13, 2012: Cleared of racism against Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

"Forget the bragging rights - victory in Sunday's Liverpool vs Manchester United clash could be worth as much as £70million. While nothing will be decided in the latest installment of the old rivalry, at 3.20pm we will be a lot closer to knowing who will be in pole position to land a treasured place in the top four and the Champions League qualification that brings. The victors can look forward to a £70m cash bonanza from appearing on Europe's biggest stage thanks to the TV money and gate receipts that brings. Louis van Gaal (left) and Brendan Rodgers come face to face in a huge clash at Anfield on Sunday . After United's disappointing 2013-14 season, they will be desperate to break into the top four this time around . Liverpool are two points behind Manchester United in the league, and desperate to topple their rivals . Group participation: £6.3million . Win bonus: £720,000 . Draw: £362,000 . Qualification to round of 16: £2.54m . Quarter-Finals: £2.83m . Semi-Finals: £3.55m . Winners: £7.61m . Runners-up: £4.71m . Gate receipts per match (United): £2m . Gate receipts per match (Liverpool): £1.5m . (Numbers based on 2013/14 figures) The losers, however, may be advised to find out what number ITV4 is on their TV boxes and brace themselves for the prospect of a fraction of that sum from the Europa League. In the packed stands it will all be about what happens on the pitch. In the directors box, however, officials will no doubt be calculating the rewards of glorious victory and the cost of miserable defeat. Should Louis van Gaal's visitors triumph in the early kick-off they will stretch the gap on Liverpool to five points with eight matches to play. Victory for Brendan Rodgers's resurgent Reds would see them take over fourth spot by a point. A draw and the advantage remains with the visitors from the other end of the Ship Canal. While officials from both clubs are desperate to make the Champions League, failure to do so would do more damage to the Old Trafford coffers. There has been plenty at stake in previous matches, but Champions League money is now bigger than ever . Andy Cole (left) and David Beckham celebrate during a United vs Liverpool clash in 1997-98 . Liverpool are two points behind United going into Sunday's huge game at Anfield . United, perennial participants, are already counting the cost of this year's non-participation. Figures recently released reveal that they are set to see a drop in revenue of around £50m as a result of their inability to qualify under David Moyes. Should they repeat the trick this year that figure will rise to around £70m thanks to the new TV deal with BT Sport which is worth an extra £20m. Then there is United's £750m kit deal with adidas. That features a £22.5m penalty should they fail to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons. If the unthinkable happens, the loss would hit a staggering £100m. David Moyes' failure to reach the top four last season has made success imperative this time around . Liverpool got a taste of the Champions League this season, and will want the same again in 2015-16 . The impact another year without Champions League football would have on existing and potential sponsors cannot be quantified but it could run into the millions. United have a vast commercial operation with offices in Manchester, Mayfair and Hong Kong aimed at squeezing every penny out of their global brand. While they could label one year without Champions League football as a one-off, investors may see two years of non-qualification as more of a trend. That logic would no doubt spread to the New York Stock Exchange where failure to qualify could have an impact on the club's share price. United are used to European success, and will want to recreate nights like this - Moscow in May 2008 . Much of their success came under Sir Alex Ferguson (centre), and they have struggled since his retirement . In 2013-14, when United were knocked out by Bayern Munich in the quarter finals, they picked up £31.3m in broadcasting money alone. As for prize money, UEFA pay around £800,000 for each win and £415,000 for a draw. There is also the extra gate receipts, although this would be offset by an appearance in the Europa League. Season ticket holders at United commit to buying tickets for European matches and they would be looking to pick up around £2m per game. Sunday's match is set to be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries around the world . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and David Beckham (right) left Manchester United for Real Madrid .

"Liverpool players ramped up their preparations ahead of the crucial top-four showdown with fierce rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday. The Reds are currently fifth in the Premier League table with 54 points, just two behind United in fourth. Having both spent heavily in the summer transfer window, both teams are under huge pressure to secure Champions League football next season and while previous meetings between the two sides may have been contested higher up the table, this year's encounter still has plenty at stake, given the broadcasting revenue linked to Europe's top club competition.

He told Liverpoolfc.com: 'Of course, it's a rivalry, but it's another three points and we'll just approach the game as we always do - that's the most important thing. 'It's going to be a big game for us. We're going into the game looking to win it, as we always do, and we're looking forward to it.

On Coutinho, Sturridge said, 'He's great to play with. He's very skilful, sees a pass and scores very nice goals, also, so it's a pleasure to play with him. 'He's quite chilled, he's not too loud. He has a little bit of a joke, but he's just a relaxed, calm guy. He comes in and does his work and is humble, just like everyone else is. 'I think it's down to him to work as hard as he possibly can to get to where he wants to be - and I am sure he wants to aim for the stars. 'That's very possible with the attributes he has, so as long as he continues doing what he's doing, I'm sure he'll go a long way in the game.'

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants his team to focus on maintaining their own performances levels over the final nine Barclays Premier League games rather than worry about whether leaders Chelsea might slip up again. Despite having gone out of the Champions League to Monaco on away goals after Wednesday night's 2-0 win at the Stade Louis II Stadium, with a run of eight victories from the last nine league matches, Arsenal are certainly in fine domestic form, having also progressed to the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they will face Reading at Wembley on April 18. Following last weekend's Premier League results, which saw Manchester City lose and leaders Chelsea held to a draw at Stamford Bridge by Southampton, Blues boss Jose Mourinho declared the Gunners now back in the title race, albeit still seven points behind and having played a match more. The Arsenal squad are put through their paces in Colney ahead of facing Newcastle on Saturday . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger only wants his side to focus on maintaining their level of performances . Monaco celebrate after knocking the Gunners out of the Champions League on away goals . Arsenal will host Chelsea at the end of April, but Wenger maintains his men must first continue to deliver consistent results and not concern themselves with the form of other sides. 'At the moment we are too far away from Chelsea, but we have an opportunity every week to get closer and for that we need positive results from us, and negative results from Chelsea. The only thing we can master is positive results from us,' said Wenger, who takes his team to Newcastle on Saturday. 'I believe Chelsea still has a very good cushion and very good security.' Wenger continued: 'It is very tight. Santi Cazorla (centre) sprints off during a training exercise, and will hope to keep up his fine recent form .

"It's becoming as regular as clockwork at Arsenal: a Theo Walcott contract saga. Just over two years after signing a £90,000-per-week deal, the winger's future is again in the spotlight. As Arsene Wenger so jovially put it last week, contact has been made with 'the embassy' (Walcott's representatives) about a contract extension. Arsenal forward Theo Walcott comes on from the bench against Monaco, is now not a guaranteed starter . But just like two years ago, there are no guarantees Walcott will commit. Perhaps, even more so this time. Ever since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for the majority of last year, Walcott has been on the peripheries. Walcott was flying before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against Tottenham last January. He'd established himself as an integral member of Wenger's first-team plans. Walcott sprints away in celebration having scored against Leicester during the 2-1 victory last month . Theo Walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new Arsenal contract . Since then, though, the landscape at Arsenal has changed. Alexis Sanchez has arrived, so to has Danny Welbeck. Walcott is no longer indispensable. In addition to Sanchez and Welbeck, there is Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to contend with. Walcott no longer walks into this team. So, with that in mind, does he warrant a pay-rise? That's the question Arsenal's moneymen will be asking themselves over the coming weeks. Because that's what he wants; a hefty hike on his current £4.6million-per-year deal. Can you justify paying someone in excess of £100,000-per-week who isn't a first-choice option for the manager? The England international gestures at Tottenham fans after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament last year . The Arsenal hierarchy are likely to argue not. And all that points to one thing: another Walcott contract row. You can understand where Walcott's representatives are coming from. At the age of 26, this could be his last big contract. His advisors have a duty to secure the best possible deal for their client. There will certainly be takers for Walcott if he leaves this summer. Liverpool and Manchester City are both monitoring the situation closely. The fact he has pace and is English (helping homegrown quotas) means he will be a valuable commodity if he's made available for transfer. Walcott has faced increased competition for a starting place in the Arsenal attack this season . As for Arsenal, they have four options. The first is to meet his demands, the second is to try to reach a compromise. The third is to let him enter the final year of his contract, which opens the door to Walcott leaving for nothing next year. Fourth is to sell him this summer. It's a game of poker. We're waiting to see who'll blink first. Walcott will be hoping to earn a similar amount to Gunners star man Alexis Sanchez on £140,000-per-week . Walcott looked certain to leave the Emirates Stadium in 2012 after rejecting a new contract. Wenger managed to persuade the speedster to stay and his subsequent performances led to the Gunners improving their offer, which was signed in January 2013. There will be a similar incentive for Walcott this time, too. But will he spend enough time on the pitch to make a similar impression? Things change. Maybe it's time for Walcott to make a change, too.","Theo Walcott is currently earning around £90,000-per-week, £4.6m a year .

"Everton's defence may have been ruthlessly exposed by Dynamo Kiev on Thursday but Roberto Martinez's problems don't end there. The Toffees were second best in all areas of the pitch as they exited the Europa League 6-4 on aggregate, leaving them to concentrate on a Premier League campaign which has failed to ignite. With Martinez's men languishing 14th in the table - 23 points and nine places worse off than at this stage last season - Sportsmail takes a look at the underperforming players the Spaniard must get rid of this summer if the Blues are to get back on track in 2015-16. Everton's players look dejected during their 5-2 defeat at Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League last 16 . Everton boss Roberto Martinez has a huge summer ahead of him when the transfer window opens . Tim Howard . After a stellar first season under Martinez and some brilliant performance at the World Cup with the USA, Howard been arguably Everton's worst player this season. High profile errors - particularly at home to Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester - have helped cost the Toffees much-needed points and contributed to a shaky, unsure defence. Martinez's decision to return Howard to his starting XI after injury - despite some promising displays from Joel Robles - has backfired. At 36, he will only get worse. Goalkeeper Tim Howard is left on the turf at the Olympic Stadium after conceding a third goal on the night . Antolin Alcaraz . Off the pace and out his depth against Dynamo, Alcaraz's 18 months at Goodison Park have been a mixed bag of injuries, decent performances and some truly awful defending. The Paraguayan, who was also part of Martinez's back-three at Wigan, lacks the speed and consistency to play for a team with European aspirations, while he is always liable to pick up a knock. With his contract up at the end of the season, it'd be wise to invest Alcaraz's wages elsewhere. Antolin Alcaraz had an evening to forget as the Toffees were dumped out of Europe in embarrassing fashion . Steven Pienaar . A regular under David Moyes, Pienaar has simply been unable to stay fit under Martinez. He shone on the opening day of the season against Leicester, working in tandem with Leighton Baines down the Toffees' left side, but has not played since mid-December and has made just eight Premier League appearances this season. The team has missed his partnership with Baines, guile and eye for a pass but, at 33 and with his injury problems persisting, Pienaar's time in the first-team looks over. Steven Pienaar (right), pictured in action against Krasnodar, has barely played this season due to injuries . Sylvain Distin . Age appears to have finally caught up with Distin after a catastrophic start to the season left him out of the team and almost certainly on his way out of the club. The 37-year-old was consistently at fault in the early stages of the campaign, contributing to the Toffees' awful defensive record with ponderous, error-prone displays. Now stuck playing for the Under 21 side after falling out of favour with Martinez, it's time the Frenchman hung up his boots or moved on. Defender Sylvain Distin is believed to have fallen out with Martinez and has not played since last year . Aiden McGeady . Over a year into his Everton career and McGeady is still yet to show the form which convinced Spartak Moscow to spend almost £10million on him in 2010. Although quick with the ball at his feet, the Republic of Ireland international's delivery leaves much to be desired and he has chipped in with just one goal since his arrival. Improvement is needed if he is ever going to earn a regular place in Martinez's starting XI - and in the hearts of Evertonians. Aiden McGeady, pictured being sent off against West Ham, has struggled to make an impact at Everton . Gareth Barry . One of the most important cogs in Martinez's well-oiled machine of last season, Barry has fallen well below the high standards he set last year. At 33 he has played too much football in 2014-15 and should've been rested when in the midst of an awful run of form prior to Christmas. Nevertheless he looks to be growing slower by the game and is struggling more and more to keep up with the pace of the Premier League. Gareth Barry, pictured tussling with Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko, struggled with the pace of the Ukrainian side . Tony Hibbert . Another player with an awful fitness record, Hibbert has managed just four Premier League appearances all season and last played in the top-flight on December 6. As a local lad with over a decade at the club it's easy to let sentiment get in the way when it comes to Hibbert and his role as a squad player. But with promising defender Tyias Browning coming through the ranks, there's little need for him now. Veteran defender Tony Hibbert (left), pictured chasing Angel di Maria, has barely played this season .","Everton were dumped out of the Europa League on Thursday evening .

"Defender Marcus Olsson insists Blackburn have still not given up hope of a late charge into the Sky Bet Championship play-offs and the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final place will not distract them from that aim. Sunday's goalless draw at Anfield to earn a replay back at Ewood Park - where they have already dispatched Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke - may have improved their chances of booking a trip to Wembley. However, they are likely to have at least five league matches to play before the expected return leg against the Reds in early April and, even though Rovers are 14 points adrift of the play-offs, Olsson stressed they have to give it one last push. Marcus Olsson (right) says him and his Blackburn team mates are only thinking about gaining a play off place . 'We don't really think about the FA Cup,' he told Press Association Sport. 'We try to give 100 per cent every game as there is still a chance of getting into the play-offs but we have to concentrate in the last 11 games of the league. 'We have a big game at home to Liverpool which we will take on when it gets closer but going to Anfield, with them on form and being a strong team, will give us a boost.' The full back had a busy game trying to deal with the skill of Liverpool's Adam Lallana in the FA Cup clash . Rovers matched what fellow Championship sides Middlesbrough (in the Capital One Cup) and Bolton (FA Cup) have done this season in not getting beat in 90 minutes at Anfield. They enjoyed the better of the play before the interval and - but for a brilliant save from Simon Mignolet - could have won the match with Alex Baptiste's header early in the second half. That has given them hope they can claim another Premier League scalp at home in a few weeks' time. 'I think playing at Anfield we did well and at least deserved another chance at home,' Olsson added. Alex Baptiste (15) sees his close range header tipped over the bar brilliantly by Simon Mignolet . 'We had two big chances to score, one of which the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from, but we play at home now and we are strong there. 'We thought we could come here and shake them up a bit. We did very well as a team, defending all over the pitch with the midfielder's and (striker) Rudy Gestede as well. 'We didn't give them too many chances to create in 90 minutes and it was a good day. 'Rudy (top scorer this season with 14 goals) on his day will give any defender a hard time as he is good in the air and hopefully next game he will score against them.'

"Reading must dust themselves down and turn their attention back to league matters when they host Brighton in the npower Championship on Tuesday night. The Royals face an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford next week following Saturday's goalless draw in Yorkshire. But before that Steve Clarke's side must attempt to ease any fears of being sucked into the Championship relegation battle with two tough matches, the midweek visit of the Seagulls followed by a trip to promotion-chasing Watford on Saturday. Reading manager Steve Clarke watches on from the dugout as Reading drew 0-0 with Bradford on Saturday . Reading captain Alex Pearce broke his nose during the FA Cup last-eight clash . 'Between now and the replay there's two important games for both sides,' said Clarke. 'We want the same resolve and desire on Tuesday night, and hopefully a couple of goals and three points.' Clarke must decide whether to risk centre-half Alex Pearce, who suffered a broken nose in the bruising encounter at Valley Parade. 'I was delighted with the attitude from the players, it was top class,' added Clarke. 'I thought it was typified by our captain coming back on with a broken nose, nothing was going to stop him. His nose is miles over here somewhere. But he went back on, a proper centre-half. 'It would have been easy to say ""I'm not going back on"", but no, Alex said ""patch me up, straighten it later"" and he was straight back on the pitch.' The central defender played on after being patched up on the sideline at Valley Parade . Clarke said that Pearce's attitude typified his side and urged more of the same against Brighton on Tuesday . Brighton, a point and a place below Reading in 19th, will be without striker Sam Baldock who looks set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Kazenga LuaLua is likely to come into the starting line-up in Baldock's absence and the winger expects a stern test against the Royals. 'It's going to be a tough game for us, but every match is going to be tough now,' he told the club website. 'Reading are not far from where we are in the league, but it's still going to be a very difficult game. 'They've a powerful team that has a lot of pace and they've got some good wingers as well. With the squad they have, they may feel they should be in a higher position, but this league is very tough and competitive.'","Reading drew 0-0 with Bradford in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday .

"Compare and contrast these two manager quotes about Danny Welbeck from this season. The uncompromising Louis van Gaal, asked in November whether he still thought it was a good idea to sell the in-form Welbeck to Arsenal on deadline day, said: 'I don't have to prove that [I was right]. 'Why do I have to prove that? I have already said what I think - he was not a line-up player, he was more a substitute than a line-up player. Danny Welbeck trains ahead of his return to Manchester United with Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth round . The England striker has been reduced to a bit-part role in recent weeks, spending time on the bench . Louis van Gaal wrote Welbeck off as not good enough for the Manchester United first team . 'He was already, with different coaches, not a line-up player, but then with Mr Van Gaal, the world is changing? No the world is not changing. They are the facts. They are not my facts, they are the facts of Danny Welbeck.' And Arsene Wenger, speaking on the impact of Welbeck just the other day: 'He's very important and has played many, many games since the start of the season. 'I think he's played in nearly every single game. His position is one of the three up front, central, left or right. He can play anywhere.' So Welbeck has apparently gone from a condemned man at Manchester United, destined to rot away on the bench, to a versatile and indispensable part of Arsenal's team. But, as the England striker returns to Old Trafford for the first time for Monday night's crunch FA Cup sixth-round tie,  has he actually fared that well at the Emirates? Welbeck celebrates a goal for Manchester United against West Ham under David Moyes last season . Welbeck was given a chance to impress on United's pre-season tour of the United States . Well, at the time of Van Gaal's outburst, just ahead of United's away match with Arsenal on November 22, he had every reason to be tetchy. While United had endured their worst start to a season in living memory, Welbeck had made light of his £16m transfer fee. Given regular football by Wenger at the head of Arsenal's attack, he looked revitalised, a player brimming with confidence who looked on course to score 20 goals this season for his new team. Just days after his move, Welbeck scored two for England in their 2-0 European qualifying win in Switzerland, before he opened his Gunners account in a 3-0 win at Aston Villa. The highlight was a hat-trick in Arsenal's 4-1 Champions League win over Galatasaray, a performance praised by Wenger as 'electric'. Arsene Wenger was thrilled with Welbeck's early performances in an Arsenal shirt . Welbeck's best performance in an Arsenal shirt was a hat-trick against Galatasaray in the Champions League . Welbeck pictured here completing his treble against the Turkish side at the Emirates back in October . MANCHESTER UNITED . 2008-09 . 13 appearances, 3 goals . 2009-2010 . 11 appearances, 2 goals . 2011-12 . 39 appearances, 12 goals . 2012-13 . 40 appearances, 2 goals . 2013-14 . 36 appearances, 10 goals . 2014-15 . 3 appearances, 0 goals . ARSENAL . 2014-15 . 20 appearances, 7 goals . At that point, it was all looking very awkward for Van Gaal. Events since then have made him feel a little better, if not entirely vindicated. Welbeck has scored just three more goals for Arsenal since the Galatasaray match. There have been mitigating circumstances though. Welbeck suffered a thigh injury and missed the whole of January, his absence coinciding with a return to form for Olivier Giroud. By the time Welbeck had rediscovered his fitness, Wenger found it very difficult to take the Frenchman out of the forward position. So Welbeck's versatility has become something of a curse. When he plays, he is stuck out on the wing, a position he is less effective in. When he left for north London, he said: 'I prefer to play through the middle. Once I get into the box and am getting the chances, I have got faith in my ability.' And, at this pivotal stage of the season, his game time has dried up as well. Arsenal are prospering without him. Welbeck's £16m move to Arsenal led to a resurgence in form for England too . Welbeck's last goal for the Gunners came in the win over West Ham just after Christmas . Welbeck was left on the bench during the win over Leicester and he was brought on for mere cameos in the wins over Everton and Queens Park Rangers. So the 24-year-old returns to Old Trafford with plenty to prove. He believed Arsenal was a club that would advance his career but evidence of this has so far been in short supply. However, earning Champions League qualification and winning the FA Cup for Arsenal - the two things Van Gaal craves so dearly this season - would certainly make him feel better.","Danny Welbeck returns to Old Trafford for FA Cup sixth-round tie .

"It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. David Villa has hit the ground running in New York and Wayne Rooney's celebration was a knockout. But Fulham are staring at successive relegations and questions remain about Roy Hodgson's England squad. WHAT'S HOT . DAVID VILLA .

Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has played precisely two hours of Premier League football since choosing Manchester over New York in December. David Villa scored for New York City against New England Revolution last weekend . WAYNE ROONEY . Great goal against Tottenham, great celebration too. After news of his kitchen boxing match with Phil Bardsley appeared in the Sun, though, there are lessons. Choose friends you can trust and never again be caught wearing white socks anywhere other than on a tennis court. Wayne Rooney responded to a leaked video of him boxing with a knockout celebration against Tottenham .

If his decision to ride several Tour stages with Lance Armstrong this summer does not please everyone I am sure he will cope. Geoff Thomas (right) plans to cycle several stages of the Tour de France this summer with Lance Armstrong . WHAT'S NOT . FULHAM . Five years ago this week Craven Cottage witnessed a 4-1 destruction of Juventus. Now Fulham are threatened with relegation from the Championship, having won once in thirteen games. This is what happens when you choose the wrong managers. Fulham's 3-0 defeat to Leeds in midweek left the Cottagers mired in a relegation battle in the Championship . Five years ago, Fulham beat Juventus at Craven Cottage en-route to the Europa League final . ROY HODGSON . An England squad with almost as many left-backs (three) as strikers (four) suggests Hodgson is about to experiment with 7-2-1 against Lithuania or doesn’t actually know where Leighton Baines plays. It’s a dispiriting selection and tells us all we need to know about our prospects at Euro 2016. ALASTAIR COOK . English cricket’s sense of self-pity has now spread to those who haven’t even been playing. Cook should realise that although the decision to appoint Eoin Morgan as World Cup captain wasn’t right, it doesn’t mean that jettisoning him beforehand was necessarily wrong. RAHAT ALI .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke will continue on the attack over his homegrown players campaign by taking the controversial issue to the FA council next week. Dyke will be giving the presentation to councillors that he was unable to make at last week’s Premier League meeting. He is looking for big support from the chamber in his battle with the PL to increase homegrown numbers from eight to 12 players in top-flight squads. Dyke has also been in combative mood with two other opponents — Wales and FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . The FA chairman wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs from eight to 12 . Speaking at the official Wembley function before the Lithuania game, Dyke described them as a small footballing nation who he hoped would not cause as many problems as another ‘small footballing nation . . . Wales’ had been doing. This was a reference to Wales opposing a Team GB football side at the Olympics, David Gill’s right to the British vice-presidency on the FIFA executive and the arrogant anti-FA slurs from the FA of Wales’s loose cannon president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes. Dyke suggested that Gareth Bale's Wales were a 'small footballing nation' causing problems . Blatter also said that Gill’s main target in Zurich should be the ‘little bald chap sitting at the other end of the table’. Dyke was also in the mood to attack his own organisation — complaining that the vase the FA always gave their Wembley visitors as a gift was not the best. An FA spokesman said Dyke’s speech was meant to be light-hearted and the sensitive FAW did not bite for once. 'Little bald chap' Sepp Blatter should be David Gill's first target at FIFA, according to Dyke . lt’s hard to see how the FA, who are looking for 15 per cent cuts across the board, can justify the extra expense of booking separate hotels on away trips — one for the England team and key support staff and another for the rest of the FA entourage — especially as they stay in the same accommodation when in England. The twin booking was brought in after the World Cup where manager Roy Hodgson  felt the presence of the FA’s huge travelling party was a distraction on match days. England boss Roy Hodgson has asked for separate hotels for the team and entourage on away trips . Hodgson has confirmed that Harry Kane will start alongside Wayne Rooney in Tuesday's friendly with Italy . However, the post-World Cup promise the FA made that England would spent most of their time preparing for matches at £120million St George’s Park in the Staffordshire countryside has not materialised. The Grove Hotel outside Watford is still utilised more often because of its proximity to London. RFU silent on Jevans . The RFU’s continued refusal to discuss the shock departure of England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans — chairman Andy Cosslett claimed the statement that she resigned for unexplained personal reasons ‘says it all’ — will only lead to speculation that does no party any good whatsoever. No jobs were being advertised on the ER 2015 website on Monday, which supports the theory that staff numbers and expenses had been spiralling out of control — as does Jevans’s alleged huge use of Addison Lee taxis. But an ER2015 spokeswoman claimed there will be more job opportunities posted this week. England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans has departed for 'unexplained personal reasons' One of Jevans’s first acts on arrival in 2012 was to select the England ball at the World Cup draw when Boris Johnson and his advisers had expected him to do so. And England ending up in the ‘group of death’ with Wales and Australia could still come back to haunt everyone concerned. Mark Pougatch, in his new role as ITV’s lead football presenter, travelled to Turin on Monday in BA business class alongside pundits Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright. But at least he gave his sometime BBC 5 Live colleagues cramped at the back in economy a wave on arrival in Italy.

"Wales assistant coach Rob Howley has called on the RBS 6 Nations organisers to adopt a Premier League-style format of synchronised kick-off times on the final day of competition. Under current broadcasting agreements, the last round of fixtures is staggered throughout the day in a bid to maximise television audiences; with Wales facing Italy in tomorrow's early tie. With the three-way race likely to be decided by points difference, the approach gives fellow challengers Ireland and England – who are up second and third – a clearer indication of their required score-line and, according to Howley, lessens the entertainment value. Wales assistant coach Rob Howley (left) wants the final round of Six Nations games to be sychronised . 'I do really enjoy the last day of the Premier League, where everyone listens to their radios to hear the scores,' said Howley. 'The drama of that situation is unique and it would be unique in rugby - probably that should be the case in the Six Nations. 'Ultimately, in terms of all of us kicking off at the same time, there would be some drama in the game; knowing what changes need to be made and the message we need to get onto the pitch. Going up first, it's important we win the game. Ireland and England will have the opportunity after our game to know what they have to do, which is always a good thing.' Wales need a landslide victory to overturn the points advantage of their two title rivals. They must capitalise on every attacking opportunity and, following an injury to Sergio Parisse, the chances of a significant winning margin have been given a major boost. Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that the Italian skipper had just a '30-40 per cent' chance of being fit for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico, where it was yesterday confirmed that he will play no part because of soft tissue damage to his foot. Howley thinks his side's opening 15 minutes against Ireland was their best display since 2008 . The much less experienced Samuela Vunisa has replaced the Azzurri No 8. He will line up against Toby Faletau but - despite being connected to Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale – the Welshman does not share Howley's view about following football's lead with fixture scheduling. 'I've not spoken to Gareth,' said Faletau. 'I'm not related to him; our girlfriends are sisters but that's about it. I watch the last couple of games in the football when it gets exciting. I would rather have it this way round, but with us playing last. It's not the case this time, but it's exciting for the players who play the first game, because they can watch the other games and wait in anticipation.' Bale often sends messages of support for the Welsh rugby team through Twitter, while Faletau's nearest and dearest will also be keeping a close eye on how results unfold. If Wales go on to win the championship, it will be the first time they have claimed the title outside of Cardiff since 1971, when Barry John scored the winning points in a 9-5 victory over France at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir. But Gatland's side are building momentum and, if results over the last two years are any indication, they will be confident of ending the 34-year wait in the Italian capital. Italy will be without they skipper and talisman Sergio Parisse for the clash against Wales in Rome . Wales are slow starters in tournament rugby but, in 2013 and 2014, they won their final-round Tests against England and Scotland by 27 and 48 points. The famous victory over England clinched the title for Wales, but Howley believes winning this year's championship would be an even sweeter feeling than two years ago. 'It would beat that year,' said Howley. 'Losing to England at home was hugely disappointing and I think Sam Warburton hit the nail on the head. To beat Ireland third in the world was fantastic and the defence in the second half was huge. The first 15 minutes before Samson [Lee] got injured was best start we have made since 2008.' With the race in for the title being so tight, Gatland has played down the psychological World Cup significance of finishing on top. Performances since the opening round defeat by England have given the Kiwi a settled idea of his squad but, following the long-term injury to Lee, the selection saga surrounding Adam Jones looks set to rumble on. Adam Jones has re-iterated that he will not come out of retirement despite Samson Lee's recent injury . The front-row - who announced his international retirement in January - has been touted as a replacement for Lee, but hit back on Thursday at claims that he needs to reverse his decision to be re-considered for selection. 'The one thing I will say is the decision wasn't premature,' Jones told TalkSport. 'I had a knock back in the summer, then the autumn, and again in the Six Nations - so it wasn't premature. Hopefully Samson will be fit because he's a great player. At the moment the door is pretty shut. I've shut it but I guess it's up to others to open it.'","The Six Nations has come down to a three-horse race on Saturday .

"Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone was in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home where her sister died for the first time on Thursday. The TV producer hid behind sunglasses and a baseball cap as a friend drove her to the house she had shared with her sister, whose death by asphyxiation is being treated as a murder by police. The 52-year-old was visibly shaken as she approached the home, and she could be seen wiping her eyes after undergoing a particularly traumatic week. Jill had initially been charged with Wendy’s murder, but the Los Angeles District Attorney dropped the charges and she was released on Wednesday afternoon. Painful: Hollywood producer Jill Blackstone was in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home on where her sister was murdered for the first time on Thursday evening . Visibly shaken, producer Blackstone  was arrested last Saturday on suspicion of murder of her sister, returned to the San Fernando Valley home the two of them shared for the first time last night . Blackstone was an animal activist. There were three dogs found dead in the garage with her sister Wendy . However, many questions remain over her partially blind and deaf sister’s death. Wendy was found on Saturday in the home’s garage, apparently asphyxiated by carbon monoxide gas. Also found at the scene was a handwritten suicide note, which police determined had been written by Jill, and the bodies of their three dogs. According to TMZ, Jill had woken up in her bed and called neighbors who, in turn, called 911. She was treated in hospital for effects of gas inhalation for two days before being discharged, at which time she was arrested. Earlier, a police spokesperson emphasized Wendy’s death is still being treated as a murder. LAPD officer Drake Madison told Daily Mail Online this is 'an ongoing murder investigation'. 'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he added. Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information to give at this time. Neighbors have speculated the sisters – who ran the Thumping Tails Animal Rescue Center together out of their home – had entered into a suicide pact. House of horrors: The San Fernando Valley home where Jill Blackstone lived with her sister Wendy . Blackstone painfully returns to the scene of the crime where her sister Wendy and their three dogs died in the garage from inhaling smoke and carbon monoxide . Police say the murder investigation is ongoing. It is possible that Jill could be re-arrested . Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’ Numerous signs are posted on the property saying it is marked for demolition. Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’ As a producer, Jill has worked on shows including Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Dr. Drew On Call, The Real, and The Osbournes. On her Linkedin page she describes herself as: 'Some of you know me as a TV producer, others as an animal welfare advocate and dog rescuer. I'm all those things.’","Jill Blackstone, who worked on Jerry Springer and Dr Drew, was arrested last Saturday on suspicion of murder - then released .

"Manchester United have been linked with summer moves for both Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. But who would you buy if you could only pick one? We asked our experts... Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo have both been linked with a move to Manchester United . MARTIN KEOWN - Ronaldo . Bale is a better long-term investment but if you’re talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact, then it has to be Ronaldo. United have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth. Signing Ronaldo would bring United instant success and put them back on the map. He understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task, but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans. What a statement that would be. Ronaldo enjoyed six successful years under Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford . NEIL ASHTON - Ronaldo . This feels like a trick question. Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch. Ronaldo has done it all before at United - and we would love to see him do it all over again. Ronaldo trains ahead of El Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday night . ROB DRAPER - Ronaldo . There’s no real debate. No disrespect to Bale, but the all-round game of Ronaldo, from his range of skill, shooting, free-kicks, finishing, heading is just better. That doesn’t make Bale a bad player - just not as good. In financial terms you could make a case for Bale being five years younger but I’m pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of Ronaldo. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring in the Champions League tie against Schalke earlier this month . JOE BERNSTEIN - Bale . It is purely an age thing. Ronaldo is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend, you wouldn’t want him around if he feared he was in decline. Bale’s game is tailor-made for the Premier League and if his pace was added to the current United technicians they would be champions . Bale trains at the Valdebebas training ground before heading to Barcelona for the crunch clash . RIATH AL SAMARRAI - Bale . No doubting Ronaldo is the better player but Bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team-mate scores. PETE JENSON - Bale . Gareth Bale, no question. The former Spurs man is only going to get better. Cristiano Ronaldo has peaked. Bale would make a sensational return to the Premier League if he joins Manchester United .","Manchester United have been linked with a move for Gareth Bale .

"It doesn't get more Australian than that! Cars have been brought to a hasty halt after a unique animal crossing of a hopping kind. A group of over 20 kangaroos have made a quick dash across the Craigieburn East Road in Victoria on Thursday morning. At 10.50 am on Thursday, many cars were brought to a hasty halt as over 20 kangaroos crossed the highway . The swarm executed perfect timing with the cars able to safely slow down and watch the group . The video shows the troop hopping across the busy road in single file and jumping over a barbed-wire fence to make it to the land on the other side. All caught on a driver's Dash Cam, some of the animals are seen to be doing flips over the fence and disappearing into the long grass. Luckily all other cars slow to a halt on the 100km/hr road to wait for the group to safely cross, with all cautiously driving off after the encounter. With no clear 'kangaroo crossing' signage the confrontation could have been potentially dangerous. Kangaroo crossings are more dangerous at night as the animals become blinded by vehicle head lights . Some of the kangaroos can be seen performing expert flips over the barbed wire fence and disappear into the grass . The crossing took place at 10.50 am on a Thursday and there were clearly not too many vehicles on the usually busy road. The Craigieburn East Road is 45 minutes north of Melbourne and the driver was on his way to work. In the day, our hopping friends are more likely to make a safer crossing by choosing their moments to dash more wisely. However in the evenings, when they are most active, they are easily collected as they become blinded by the headlights of cars.","A troop of over 20 kangaroos have been captured on video .

"Aston Villa and West Brom fans have joined forces to criticise the scheduling of their FA Cup quarter-final clash on Saturday evening.

Aston Villa and West Brom fans have joined forces to criticise the scheduling of their FA Cup quarter-final tie . Trouble flared before, during and after the Villa Park showdown, including the pitch invasion . Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . The police, FA and BBC pass the buck over who's to blame for shameful scenes following Aston Villa's FA Cup win... it was DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE for this to be a 5.30pm kick-off . Aston Villa fan Matt Turvey, editor of astonvillalife.com, watched the game from the Upper Holte End and insisted: 'The timing was pretty stupid. 'I'm not overly sure about the rationale but 12.30pm would have been ideal. You're getting people drinking from 9.30am and turning up at Villa Park at 5.30pm - it's a pretty obvious result. 'If it was down to TV then it just illustrates that everything is pushed aside for money.' Police made 17 arrests related to the game, during which Villa fans invaded the pitch and seats were thrown from the North Stand housing visiting supporters.

I spoke to the police four weeks ago and told them it was going to happen. 'The answer to this one was to kick off at 12pm on Saturday, or even 11am - the real fans would have been there at that time. The game should never have kicked off at the time it did.' Meanwhile Cleverley urged the clubs and the police to take a no-nonsense approach to any fans found guilty of involvement in the disturbances. He added: 'If they are found guilty of fighting and throwing seats I hope they are banned for life - and they should accept the punishment.'

The footballer passed shortly after the attack began and was only rescued when his teammates saw what was going on and bravely intervened, freeing his limp body from beneath the attackers. Having rescued him from the mob, Mr Pacheco's colleagues released that, frustratingly, all the first aid crews and ambulances on duty at the stadium had already left.

The lack of support from the NHS and local councils is leaving patients distressed, lonely and humiliated, says the report by Macmillan. It estimates that around 512,000 patients with cancer – around one in three of the 1.6million diagnosed in the last ten years – do not get enough help. The charity says the problem is partly the fault of doctors and nurses failing to tell patients how to access extra help from the NHS, councils or voluntary organisations. But many patients who apply for extra funding from either the NHS or their local council are told they are not eligible. Macmillan’s report is based on a survey of 1,037 cancer patients and their carers. One in seven said the lack of support in attending an appointment, collecting a prescription or other basic care had led to them needing to go to hospital as their condition suddenly deteriorated. Lynda Thomas of Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘It is heartbreaking that so many people with cancer are not getting the practical support and personal care they desperately need, too often living with constant feelings of fear, anger and isolation as a result. There is a growing recognition that social care is often vital for people living with long-term conditions.’ Lacking support: Macmillan estimates that around 512,000 patients with cancer do not get enough help . Cancer patients are too often assumed to have all their needs met by the NHS, because they are thought to require purely medical care, she added. ‘The findings debunk this unfair myth. They show that people with cancer have needs which are far more widespread than we had even realised and that sadly the health and social care systems are too often failing to provide basic support.’ Lisa Grice, 55, from Cheshire, who has womb cancer, said: ‘There was no support after I was discharged. I felt as if I was alone in dealing with everything. I was in a wheelchair, unable to wash myself or use the loo properly, and I felt very depressed.’ Frank Spurrock, 63, a retired teacher from Folkestone, Kent, is housebound for most of the week unless a friend or relative is free to help. He has a brain tumour and is mostly in a wheelchair. His partner works in London to support them and the only time he can get out is at weekends. Yet he was told by his local council he was not eligible for funding to pay for a carer because he has a pension. Macmillan has repeatedly warned that the health service is struggling to cope with the rising numbers of patients with cancer. NHS England said: ‘We are diagnosing and treating more people with cancer than ever before, and as a result more people than ever are surviving. ‘But with this comes a greater need to provide patients with practical and emotional support outside of the hospital setting – which is why we’re putting an unprecedented focus on better integrating health and social care services across the country.’","Over 100,000 not given enough help with routine tasks such as washing .

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney will hope his side are at top gear at Anfield on Sunday, as he headed into training in his new BMW i8 hybrid sports car. The 29-year-old showed off his new wheels at Carrington as Manchester United prepare to take on Liverpool in a crucial clash in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Liverpool are only two points behind Louis van Gaal’s side, who are occupying the fourth qualifying position, but Brendan Rodgers’ side haven’t lost in the Premier League since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. Wayne Rooney heads into Manchester United training in his sparkling new £104,590 BMW i8 sports car . Rooney relaxes at the wheel of his new motor as he prepares to take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday . Rooney has splashed out £104,590 on his new BMW i8 having scored five goals in his last six Manchester United appearances. The new hybrid from BMW uses the combination of an electric motor and a powerful petrol engine which provide extremely low emissions into the environment. Rooney will certainly be quick into training as the sports car can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 4.4 seconds, and has a top speed limited to 155mph.

"Linebacker Erik Walden and his girlfriend were seriously injured in an attack that took place Saturday evening. The ex-girlfriend of the Indianapolis Colts star, Erica Palmer, broke into his house through a backdoor and attacked him and his girlfriend, whose name has not been released, with a bat. The two allegedly found Palmer sitting on the couch with a loaded gun waiting to attack, and as they tried to leave for the hospital after she broke the woman's arm with the bat, Palmer surprised them by jumping out of the woods and slashing Walden's arm with a knife. All this as Palmer left the two young children she has with Walden alone in a car a mile away. Indianapolis Colts linebacker Erik Walden (left) and his girlfriend suffered serious injuries after an attack that took place Saturday night at the hands of his ex Erica Palmer (right) Palmer reportedly left her two young children with Walden (above) alone in a car roughly a mile away during the attack . NBC 11 reports that Palmer suspected that Walden was seeing other woman, so she parked the car a mile away to see if she could catch him in the act. After the two came in shortly before midnight and saw Palmer with the gun, Walden, who owns the weapon, managed to wrestle it away from the woman. Walden claims that Palmer then began swinging the bat at the two, breaking his female companion's arm. Palmer fled after this and Walden called police, who came, took a statement and left. Then, when Walden left to drive the female to the hospital to have her arm treated, Palmer jumped out of the woods with a knife and slashed his arm. Police were able to locate Palmer soon after using her cell phone to track her and she has been charged with multiple crimes, including  several counts of aggravated assault. The two young children have been placed in Walden's care and Palmer is being held at the Hall County Jail.","Indianapolis Colts linebacker Erik Walden and his girlfriend suffered serious injuries after an attack that took place Saturday night .

"Neil Jenkins says that Wales will be concentrated totally on winning - rather than potential mathematical permutations - when they tackle RBS 6 Nations opponents Italy at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. Wales, courtesy of successive victories over Scotland, France and Ireland, have put themselves firmly in the Six Nations title mix alongside England and Ireland. Although Wales' inferior points difference means they have a mountain to climb in pursuit of silverware, a possible third Six Nations crown in four years cannot be discounted. Sam Warburton (left) and George North (right) lead the celebrations after beating Ireland last week . Neil Jenkins (left) says Wales are only thinking about an Italy victory, rather than checking other results . Wales are first into action on so-called Super Saturday, with Ireland then tackling Scotland before England host France. 'The main objective and focus for us is obviously winning a Test match. If other things happen, well, so be it,' said Wales skills coach Jenkins, speaking at the team's Rome hotel on Friday. 'I am sure that we will be kicking ourselves if we didn't win and the other games went Scotland's way and France's way. 'The main objective is to win the game, and see where that takes us. 'England will know what they have to do when they play last on Saturday, but no matter what time you play, the focus is still the same for us. We have to win the game and win another Test match.' Italy's preparations have been rocked by the absence of their inspirational captain Sergio Parisse through injury, which has meant the Azzurri back-row being reshuffled and hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini taking over as skipper. 'Sergio is obviously a fantastic rugby player, a world-class number eight, and no matter what side he plays in, if he is not playing they are obviously going to miss him,' Jenkins added. 'We played them two years ago in Rome and Sergio didn't play, and they were pretty strong. Conditions weren't great that day, but it was a pretty tough Test match. 'He played pretty well against us in Cardiff last year and caused us an awful lot of problems. He is a world-class player, and any team would miss him. 'I think Italy have played some good rugby in the competition. 'It was nip and tuck with Ireland early on in that first game, and Italy probably just lacked a bit of possession. They played some good rugby against England, and then had a fantastic win in Edinburgh. 'They will probably say themselves they were disappointed with their performance last week against France. Wales, pictured this week in training, have travelled to Rome knowing a win could secure Six Nations glory . Mike Phillips passes the ball during an open session in Cardiff on Tuesday . 'But look, every time we come here it is a very tough game. Generally, we have been successful, but not by much, so we are expecting another tough game tomorrow.' Key for Wales will be to set out their stall and build points, like they did in destroying Ireland's Grand Slam dream last Saturday. 'We started incredibly well last week and ticked the scoreboard over,' Jenkins said. 'Up until Samson (Lee) got injured, which was a huge disappointment for us, it had been nigh-on perfect rugby. Territory, possession and everything we did was spot-on. 'The boys have recovered well. They know how important tomorrow is. It is an opportunity for us to go out and give ourselves a chance to try and win the championship.' Wales performed a title-winning feat in 2013 after losing their opening game - then it was against Ireland, this time England - by reeling off four successive victories and taking the championship on points difference. While this season's equation is far more complex, the desire is unchanged. 'If you look at the Six Nations, the unpredictability is what's great about the tournament,' Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny said. 'Every game is competitive, and that is why it's a huge achievement to win the Six Nations. 'All we can do is focus on our game in Rome. That's all we can do, before we wait and see what happens. 'If we go on to win it, it would give us that confidence and belief ahead of the World Cup.' Warren Gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the Italians .","Wales face Italy in final Six Nations tie at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday .

Liverpool have been in negotiations for several months with the 20-year-old and his agent over a deal to replace the old one which expires in 2017. And the Reds boss confirmed it will not be resolved until after this season's conclusion. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling has put his contract talks on hold until the summer, Brendan Rodgers has said . Sterling's current deal runs until 2017, and he had been in negotiations with Liverpool over an extension . 'Not between now and the end of the season,' said Rodgers. 'It has been made clear by Raheem's agent. I repeat that this is the best place for his development and it is clear.' Sterling is set to start as Liverpool face a huge clash with Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday, with a place in the top four of the Premier League at stake. 'It is an important game,' continued Rodgers. 'I don't think the result will have an overriding factor but it will certainly give you a great boost psychologically if we were to win. We want to win, we want to be competitive.

Rodgers also backed Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left), saying he is committed to the team . 'It is very simple with me and Steven,' said Rodgers. 'I think it has been really unfair on the boy. 'When he was out injured, people tried to sensationalise a story about him getting in the team. It might not be the story you want but he is committed to the team. But his support to Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen has been fantastic. I see people trying to predict the team but he hasn't been fit. He is going to have a big part to play, and is a wonderful, wonderful player who has so much still to give. 'Even when he doesn't start, he comes off the bench and gives calmness to the team.

"Unless Manchester City can produce the greatest result in their European history - arguably their entire history - and overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night, England faces an embarrassing total wipeout from this season's Champions League. With Paris Saint-Germain dumping Chelsea out last week and Monaco resisting Arsenal's spirited fightback on Tuesday night, we face the prospect of having no Premier League representatives in the quarter-finals. The English charge on the continent halted by mid-March? It never used to be like this, you know. Arsenal's Santi Cazorla is commiserated as Monaco celebrate knocking out the English side on Tuesday . Dejected Chelsea players walk off the field at Stamford Bridge after their Champions League exit to PSG . Joe Hart roars his frustration during Manchester City's first-leg defeat to Barcelona at the Etihad . This graphic showing the English clubs that have reached the Champions League quarter-finals since 2004 . You don't have to flick too far back through the record books to find a time when England ruled in Europe's foremost club competition. The last halcyon days were the three seasons from 2006-07 until the end of 2008-09, when the Premier League supplied 11 of the 24 quarter-finalists. Going back to Liverpool's miraculous triumph in Istanbul in 2005, England has provided eight of the 20 finalists. In the 2006-07 season, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United all made it to the semi-finals. They all repeated the feat 12 months later, with United beating Chelsea on penalties in the Moscow final. In 2008-09, United knocked out Arsenal in the last four, while Barcelona squeezed past Chelsea. Since then, it's been an overall trend of decline. While United were runners-up again in 2011 and Chelsea lifted the trophy in 2012, as well as reaching the semi-finals last season, the English dominance seen during that golden three-year period hasn't been replicated. Chelsea and Manchester United contested the 2008 Champions League final in a golden period for England . Man United met Arsenal in the Champions League semi-finals in the 2008-09 campaign . Chelsea and Liverpool met in the 2008 Champions League semi-finals, with the London club advancing . The mantle has been passed to Spain, who will expect to see Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the last four unless paired in the next round. So while the Premier League continues to grow ever-richer, with the astonishing £5.1bn television deal signed earlier this year ensuring record returns for years to come, money doesn't necessarily guarantee success across the board in Europe. Though Chelsea reached the last four a year ago, United exited at the quarter-final stage, while City and Arsenal departed in the last 16. The season 2012-13 was even worse, with United and Arsenal crashing out in the last 16 and Chelsea and City failing to get out of their groups. There isn't one single reason to explain this slump in Premier League performance, but a growing school of thought is that the lack of a winter break is beginning to hold our teams back. Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho have always advocated a winter pause and the evidence to support them grows with every passing season. Wayne Rooney and Manchester United were beaten by Bayern Munich in last season's quarter-finals . Lionel Messi scores for Barcelona in their win over Manchester City this time last season . Tomas Rosicky and Arsenal were eliminated by Bayern Munich at the last-16 stage last season . City boss Manuel Pellegrini joined the chorus in an interview with Sportsmail this week, saying: 'December and January are very tough months because of the number of games. 'You reach an important part of the season and you are not in optimum shape because there is no winter break as there is in other countries. 'English football gives other leagues an advantage. There are some traditions you can't change, I realise that. Boxing Day is non-negotiable. But you can't play nine games in December and nine in January. You have to stop at some point.' He has a point. The quantity and intensity of fixtures in England means that no player can emerge from the hectic December and January period firing on all cylinders. It is a time that features vital matches in the Premier League as the title race takes shape, while the leading clubs are increasingly keen to win the FA Cup and League Cup, which might at one time have warranted weakened teams. The leading sides are scared witless of finishing the season empty-handed - even the once-maligned League Cup is now taken seriously. Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini has joined the chorus of managers favouring a winter break . Paris Saint-Germain didn't play a competitive match between December 21 and January 4 . Chelsea played five times during that period, including a 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day . In explaining Chelsea's exit, you might consider that PSG didn't play a single competitive match between December 21 and January 4. In that same time, Chelsea played Stoke City, West Ham, Southampton, Tottenham and Watford. While Monaco broke off after winning at Metz on December 20 and didn't resume until January 4, Arsenal had to play Liverpool, QPR, West Ham, Southampton and Hull City. For both London clubs, the fixtures continued to come thick and fast in the subsequent six weeks before their European ties. There is no respite. And while Manchester City played Crystal Palace, West Brom, Burnley, Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday, Barcelona were out of action. After cruising into the winter break with an 8-1 rout of Huesca and a 5-0 win over Cordoba, when they resumed, Lionel Messi and Co - after a shock defeat by Real Sociedad - recorded thrashings of Elche (5-0, 4-0 and 6-0) and Deportivo La Coruna (4-0). There is no escaping the reality that Barcelona's matches are far more straightforward than those played by City. Little wonder they had the greater energy at the Etihad. Barcelona had not only a winter break but a reasonably straightforward run of games in January . While football over the Christmas period should be kept sacred, a couple of weeks off in January would not go amiss and would boost English chances of getting through the last-16 stage. The scrapping of FA Cup replays would also be a sensible move. Of course, there was no winter break in England between 2006 and 2009, but English clubs still prospered. This points perhaps to a growing pace and intensity of all domestic games and perhaps a strategic naivety in approaching two-legged ties. Owen Hargreaves, well-placed to compare styles having played for Bayern Munich and United, observed on BT Sport last week that: 'If we got past the first 20 or 30 minutes, we'd probably win the game because the English teams used to come out all guns blazing, the defence would push the team forward and we used to realise if we could keep it at 0-0 we would win. 'In the Premier League, that works, but in Europe the teams are too talented, too good in possession.' Should City exit, as expected, against Barcelona, the debate as to why English clubs no longer reach the latter stages of the Champions League en masse will intensify. There is no definitive answer or quick fix but a breather in English football's ruthless, relentless schedule is an increasingly popular option to give our teams a fighting chance in Europe.","Chelsea and Arsenal are already out of Champions League at last-16 stage .

"One wrong choice over Spring Break nearly ended her life. McKinzy Livsey, 15, of Oklahoma City was driving around in a golf cart on Sunday at Arbuckle Mountains with  friends when the decision to switch seats with the driver likely caused her to fall out head first. It is thought the cart hit a bump, propelling McKinzy onto the ground and leaving her with skull fractures, brain swelling, and blood clots, reports News 9. Scroll down for video . Life changing moment: McKinzy Livsey of Ohlahoma City was driving around in a golf cart on Sunday at  with friends when the decision to switch seats with the driver likely caused her to fall out head first . Hospitalized: McKinzy has been left with skull fractures, brain swelling, and blood clots and on Wednesday night in the hospital she passed out in her mother's arms, nearly hitting her head again . McKinzy's parents Travis and Shannon Livsey were horrified to receive a call on Sunday with the sounds of their injured daughter screaming in the background. 'Something happened with McKinzy, and you need to come home immediately,' McKinzy's mother says she was told during the heart wrenching phone call. 'I said who is that screaming in the background, and she said it was McKinzy,' said Shannon. McKinzy was flown to OU Children's Hospital where the family is standing by their daughter as she gets numerous x-rays to asses her condition. McKinzy's father says his daughter was just being a teenager and a momentary decision to switch seats without paying attention to the gas pedal caused her injuries. 'They switched. McKinzy's foot stayed on the gas,' said McKinzy's father, Travis Livsey. 'They were just being typical teenagers, and without thinking, or stopping, apparently they kept driving.' In recovery: McKinzy is recovering from her injuries (right) and has still maintained her youthful spirit from before she was in the tragic accident . Spring Break trip: McKinzy was riding around in a golf cart with friends in the Arbuckle Mountains (pictured) when she was seriously injured on Sunday . Travis says he thinks the girls hit a bump causing McKinzy to fall out head first. 'I'm thinking first part to hit the ground was her head, because that's where the most trauma is obviously.' Shannon told News 9 that Wednesday night in her daughter's hospital was terrifying. McKinzy passed out in her mother's arms and had her mother not been there to catch her she might have hit her head again. 'Last night was really bad,' said Shannon. Traumatizing: McKinzy's parents describe the horrifying phone call they received after their daughter was injured and say they could hear her screams in the background . Positive attitude: McKinzy and her family are trying to stay strong and her parents say they put their faith in God to help them get through these difficult times . 'And if I hadn't been there to catch her, she would have hit her head again.' Shannon said that she is staying strong my having faith and was recently moved by a message from a motivational speaker. 'It gets real when your struggle lasts longer than your strength, but God will carry you through,' said Shannon Livsey reading the quote by Trent Shelton.

"Manchester City have failed to freshen up their starting line-up despite spending a staggering £327million on new players during the last four years. The Barclays Premier League champions, who must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since the start of the 2011-12 season. Despite spending an extravagant amount of money, Martin Demichelis and Fernando are the only two players who have managed to hold down a regular starting spot since sealing moves to the Etihad Stadium. Man City have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since 2011 despite spending £327m - Aleksandar Kolarov will replace Gael Clichy from the side defeated by Barcelona on February 24, 2015 . Fernando has replaced Gareth Barry while Martin Demichelis has come in for Joleon Lescott - above picture was taken before Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Napoli on September 14, 2011 . The aforementioned duo have replaced Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry respectively in what is perceived to be Manchester City's strongest line-up. Gael Clichy has come close to edging his way into Manchester City's side but he shares left back duties with Aleksandar Kolarov and is suspended on Wednesday after being sent off in the first leg. Their major European rivals, on the other hand, have made at least six changes to their starting line-ups. Arsenal have made the most with 10 while upcoming opponents Barcelona have made six. Manchester City may have to change tack in Europe if they crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday, as a side of their calibre should be progressing to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious competition. 2011: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko . 2015: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Fernando, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko (two changes) Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) have joined Lionel Messi (right) at the Nou Camp . 2011: Valdes; Alves, Puyol, Pique, Abidal; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Villa, Messi, Pedro . 2015: Ter Stegen; Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Six changes) European champions Real Madrid have made six major changes in the same period - with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale sealing moves to the Santiago Bernabeu during the last four years. Real Madrid have freshened up their side by spending £344m on new players while also selling Angel di Maria, Mesut Ozil and Gonzalo Higuain for big money. 2011: Casillas; Arbeloa, Carvalho, Ramos, Marcelo; Diarra, Alonso; Di Maria, Ozil, Ronaldo; Benzema . 2015: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Modric, Kroos, Rodriguez ; Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema (Six changes) Gareth Bale (left) joined Real Madrid for £86m in 2013 while Angel di Maria (right) was sold to Man United .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists it is no major surprise that English clubs have struggled in Europe this season because of the domestic demands of the Barclays Premier League. The Toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before a 5-2 loss to Dynamo Kiev in Europe on Thursday night meant they followed Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City in crashing out at the last 16 stage. It meant that there were no English teams in Friday's draw for either the Champions League or Europa League quarter-finals for the first time since 1995, sparking a countrywide debate about the state of the domestic game. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has highlighted an extensive fixture list behind their Europa League exit . However, Martinez believes it is the competitive nature of the Premier League, coupled with a lack of a winter break, which is hampering clubs when they face fresher, less-tested teams in European competitions. 'I think there are aspects there that make it very, very difficult for an English club to have success in Europe,' the Spaniard said. 'If you look at the top leagues in Europe most of those have got a little break in the winter. I'm not saying that's the difference but it can make a big difference in a squad that is playing domestically two cup competitions, when others are playing one cup competition. Everton's Phil Jagielka, Tim Howard and Leighton Baines look dejected after Dynamo Kiev ran riot . Everton's Ross Barkley and James McCarthy (right) look miserable during the painful defeat on Thursday . 'We need to understand that our league is the best in world football. And when I say the best it's because if you are at 70 per cent in a game, you're going to lose it. That's how competitive it is. It doesn't matter about position in the table and I don't think the other leagues have that. 'The top teams that are normally involved in Europe can cruise through games and that makes it a lot easier to plan a group of fixtures in a two-to-three-week period. That is a big difference and that affects English clubs. 'It's not by coincidence. Some of the clubs in the Champions League have been unfortunate, there have been small margins but those small margins could easily be the demands that you face domestically. It's something that clearly hasn't been working in our favour.' Roberto Martinez and substitute Leon Osman remonstrate with the fourth official Christoph Bornhorst . Martinez's men were ruthlessly eliminated in Kiev by a display of clinical attacking finishing as the hosts exposed their visitors' defensive frailties. But while the manner of their exit was disappointing to Martinez, he took plenty of heart from a campaign which saw them beat Wolfsburg home and away and take four points off Lille in the group stage. 'It's started a real thirst to be in that environment again,' Martinez added. The scoreboard tells its own story as Everton were outclassed by Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine . 'For our younger players, it is the first time they've been in Europe and the way we succeeded in many of those games, going away into different countries and being able to perform has been very important. 'I do feel that the players in the squad, myself, my staff and the football club as a whole will want more of it. It gives you a real desire to push ourselves to become a winning team and have that more often. 'We're all disappointed from the result last night but to reach the quarter-finals of this competition is something we last did 30 years ago, that shows you the size of the achievement.' Dynamo Kiev players celebrate during a rampant display which saw them ease into the quarter-finals .","Everton were dumped out of the Europa League on Thursday evening .

"You'd never know it with his clothes on, but 22-year-old blogger Matt Diaz is carrying around sizable rolls of excess skin underneath his shirt, and he's finally ready to reveal it to his fans. Mr Diaz, from Brooklyn, New York, has lost an impressive 270lbs from his nearly-500lb frame since the age of 16 - a journey he's documented on his Tumblr blog, My Annoyances - but he has 'never' shown his excess skin before, and says he can no longer 'preach' about body positivity while continuing to hide his own flaws. So, in an emotional video he shared on Tuesday, Mr Diaz removed his shirt and stated: 'I'm really scared to put this up. But I think it's important for me to share this with you guys, because this is who I am.' Laid bare: Blogger Matt Diaz, 22, revealed his excess skin in an emotional video he made for his fans this week, saying he could no longer 'preach' about body positivity and continue to hide his own flaws . Before and after: Mr Diaz, from Brooklyn, New York, has lost an impressive 270lbs from his nearly-500lb frame since the age of 16 (left) - pictured (right) after his weight loss . Mr Diaz, who is on the verge of tears throughout the five-minute video, says he suffered 'an anxiety attack' before going ahead with the big reveal. 'I have stretch marks, I have birth marks, I have all this excess skin,' he says as he shifts from side to side and showcases his folds of skin. 'I'm scared people won't find me attractive anymore. I'm scared that all the nice messages will stop.' On the contrary, Mr Diaz was amazed to receive nothing but support from his fans and followers. 'You are gorgeous Matt, I would date you,' wrote one user. 'This is hands down the bravest thing I’ve ever seen,' commented another. Not easy: Mr Diaz, who is on the verge of tears throughout the five-minute video, says he suffered 'an anxiety attack' before going ahead with the big reveal . This is me: 'I have stretch marks, I have birth marks, I have all this excess skin,' he says . No trolls: Mr Diaz was amazed to receive nothing but support from his fans and followers in response to the video . Mr Diaz, who describes himself as a 'writer, comedian [and] all-around f*** up', states in the video: 'I want to be proud of who I am, and I want all of you to be proud of who you are, and part of that is not hiding it.' Despite working out 'hard' and following a healthy diet plan, Mr Diaz knew that the only way he would be able to get rid of his excess skin would be with surgery. With that in mind, he set up a GoFundMe campaign on Wednesday to raise the $20,000 he needs for the procedure, and already, donations have reached $32,000.

Asked by Upworthy to offer advice to anyone struggling to come to terms with their own body-related insecurities, he said: 'I want you to remember that you are not the problem, certain aspects of society are the problem.' He continued: 'Luckily, we're slowly starting to see these ideas get phased out by modernity. 'Plus-sized, un-retouched models are getting more attention in major brands... it's becoming clear that these negative ideas are not going to last, though it's going to take a while.' Yesterday, Mr Diaz uploaded another (clothed) video to thank people for their donations. 'You have shown me so much kindness and now I have so much more faith in people,' he said, promising to document the skin-removal surgery with his fans when he undergoes it.","Blogger Matt Diaz, 22, weighed nearly 500lbs at the age of 16 .

"Gary Cahill has hinted Chelsea are feeling the pressure of the Premier League title run-in. Jose Mourinho's men are chasing a first Premier League title in five years. The Blues have four draws in their last six games in all competitions, including on Sunday at home to Southampton as they missed the chance to move eight points clear. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill tussles with Southampton forward Shane Long at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Diego Costa (second from left) opens the scoring in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Southampton . Two of those draws were against Paris St Germain, in exiting the Champions League on away goals, while one of the two wins in the same unbeaten run secured the first silverware of the season. 'We're desperate... not desperate, it's the wrong word - we're looking for the next convincing win, the next win, to get us back up and running,' Cahill told Chelsea TV. 'We should be going out playing with freedom and not feeling the pressure. 'We should be going out and enjoying (it). I think that comes with winning games. The next win I'm sure is just around the corner for us.' Hull, Chelsea's next opponents on Sunday, have been warned, particularly as the Blues have a full week's preparation, unusual at this time of the season. 'We're out the competitions, apart from the Premier League,' Cahill said. 'We can prepare well. A week, which is rare for us, to prepare for the next game, which is important.' Chelsea lost on New Year's Day at Tottenham - whom they beat two months later in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley - but since exiting the FA Cup to Bradford, have won half of their games in an unbeaten 10-match run. Former Atletico Madrid striker Costa celebrates with team-mates including Cesc Fabregas (left) Chelsea remain six points clear of second-placed Manchester City following their draw with Saints . The Blues' nearest rivals Manchester City lost at Burnley on Saturday but Mourinho's men were unable to fully exploit the slip, instead enhancing their advantage, which includes a game in hand, to six points. Mourinho refuses to believe it is purely a two-team race between Chelsea and City, with Arsenal seven points behind and Manchester United eight adrift. The draw with Southampton came in the first match after the European exit to PSG. Cahill, who has won the European Cup with Chelsea, but is yet to win a Premier League title, said: 'Playing for this club the expectations are so high. We didn't lose the (PSG) game, we drew. All of a sudden everyone's saying 'what's happening here?' 'As players we have to focus on the job in hand and that's the Premier League. 'I'm sure we'll kick on. Man City dropped points and we picked up another point. Our goal difference is good. 'It's by far the end of the world, but we're looking for the next result. 'It's a massive opportunity for us this season, everybody knows (that). Southampton midfielder Dusan Tadic scores his side's equaliser from the penalty spot at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea skipper John Terry looks dejected after the final whistle as the Blues drop points again . 'Ten games left to go now and we're in a fantastic position.' Mourinho bemoaned Southampton being awarded a penalty and Chelsea being denied one when Branislav Ivanovic appeared to be tripped by Dusan Tadic. Ivanovic said on chelseafc.com: 'I was at full speed, he stood on me and I went down. The decision was the referee's (Mike Dean), so I don't have anything to say.' Southampton withstood a late onslaught from Chelsea, with Fraser Forster performing well in goal. The former Celtic goalkeeper told Saints' YouTube channel: 'We've got a fantastic belief as a team. 'We keep moving forward and we can do that. On any given day we can match teams. 'It's just about trying to do that consistently. 'We're going to keep working as hard as we can right until the end.' Ronald Koeman's men are sixth, one point behind fifth-placed Liverpool, ahead of next week's match at home to Burnley. 'We can be very proud of what we've done,' Forster added. 'But it's only a good point if we go into next week's game, work as hard as we can and come out of that with a result as well. 'It's an important game, a tough game so it's vital we get another good week of training and then see what we can do next weekend.'","Chelsea could only manage a draw at home to Southampton on Sunday .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic was forced to apologise for a remarkable rant after Paris St Germain slumped to a third league defeat of the season. The 33-year-old had branded the referee 's***' and said France doesn't deserve PSG, but had to back-track, claiming the comments were not directed towards the French people and that he hadn't meant them. Ibrahimovic was caught on camera by infosport+ after a 3-2 defeat against Bordeaux that halted the defending champions' charge for the French title. Zlatan Ibrahimovic swears loudly as he walks towards the changing room after PSG's defeat to Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . 'I wanted to say that my comments were directed neither towards France nor towards the French,' Ibrahimovic said after the game. 'I was talking about football and nothing else. I lost the game, and I accept it but I do not agree when the referee does not follow the rules. This is not the first time that this happens. 'I was speaking at the height of my anger and everyone knows that at times like these you can say things you don't mean. I apologise if people have felt offended.' The Swedish striker, who scored twice in the 3-2 defeat, had reacted angrily to Diego Rolan's late goal, blasting the officials on his way to the dressing room. The Swedish striker claimed that France doesn't deserve the Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain . Ibrahimovic reacts in disbelief during PSG's shock 3-2 defeat against Bordeaux on Sunday . Diego Rolan smashes in the winner that so upset Ibrahimovic, just minutes after the Swede had equalised . Ibrahimovic gives the referee a disgruntled look during the game, and afterwards branded him 's***' 'I played 15 years, I never seen a referee this s***,' he shouted. 'They don't even deserve PSG should be in this country.' Following Ibrahimovic's remarks French sports minister Patrick Kanner had called on the Swede to apologise, saying 'disappointment did not justify his offensive comments', but later he later called the striker a 'great champion'. Rolan scored from Brazilian defender Mariano's cross with a shot between the legs of goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. The strike ended PSG's 15-game unbeaten run in all competitions, and came just four minutes after Ibrahimovic had equalised from the penalty spot. After ousting Chelsea from the Champions League after extra time in midweek, PSG players looked tired and lost precious points in the fight for the title.

Chasing an unprecedented quadruple, PSG - who lost stalwart defender David Luiz and midfielder Yohan Cabaye through injury - are facing a hectic schedule in the coming weeks and still have to travel to play arch rivals Marseille this season. 'We came back late on Wednesday, we were tired both physically and mentally,' PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot said. 'This is not an excuse, but it's difficult, even though we are professionals.' Ibrahimovic had already put the teams level in the 50th minute from Javier Pastore's through ball after Lamine Sane jumped higher than Thiago Silva to open the scoring with a fine header to Sirigu's right. Midfielder Wahbi Khazri then restored Bordeaux's lead from close range, pouncing on Kiese Thelin's glancing header after fluffing his first attempt on goal.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic says 'I never seen a referee this s***' after defeat .

"Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony believes the champions now have to target victory in every remaining game to retain their title. City remain five points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea after slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday. The London side also have a game in hand and City have just 11 matches left to turn the situation around. Wilfried Bony says Manchester City can still retain the Premier League if they win all their remaining games . Bony has only made appearances from the bench so far for City, and was booked in the defeat by Liverpool . Bony said: 'It is disappointing, we have made it difficult for ourselves now. 'If Chelsea win (their game in hand) it will be more difficult for us to get close to them. But we still hope - there are 11 more games and every game we just have to win, be positive for the rest of the league and try to get maximum points. 'We need to win, win, win and hope Chelsea will drop some points. It is a difficult moment for us but we still hope we can do it.' Bony might hope to play a greater role in City's run-in after making just three goalless substitute appearances since signing from Swansea in January. City were beaten 2-1 at Anfield after stunning strikes from Jordan Henderson and Coutinho (above) Bony will hope to make more of an impact on the title run-in than he has been able to so far since signing . In between Henderson and Coutinho's strikes Edin Dzeko equalised, but City were well beaten . Bony did not feature for a month after the move was completed due to his involvement in Ivory Coast's African Nations Cup win and has had to make do with coming off the bench since. His 78th-minute introduction at Anfield came with his side already 2-1 down and he was unable to affect the outcome. His only notable contribution to the game came when he was booked for an aerial challenge on Adam Lallana that arguably could have been worth a red card. City had cancelled out Jordan Henderson's superb early strike with a well-worked Edin Dzeko equaliser but the outstanding Philippe Coutinho restored the hosts' lead with a 75th-minute stunner. Sergio Aguero had hit the post and he spurned two other good chances, while David Silva also went close late on, but Liverpool dominated and ultimately deserved their victory. Manuel Pellegrini insists he will keep focusing on his own team's games rather than watching Chelsea . Pellegrini defended his selection after he stuck with the same line-up that thrashed Newcastle last week . Manager Manuel Pellegrini will continue to chase Chelsea but the challenge from below is strengthening, with third-placed Arsenal just four points behind.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments after Paris St Germain's defeat to Bordeaux will be investigated by the French football league (LFP). Ibrahimovic scored twice on Sunday but it was not enough to prevent PSG suffering a 3-2 defeat and they trail Lyon by two points at the top of the Ligue 1 table. As he walked off the field Ibrahimovic - no stranger to making controversial remarks - was filmed seemingly making derogatory comments about the referee and France as a country. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice but could not prevent PSG's 3-2 defeat by Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walks towards the changing room after PSG's defeat . THe Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . The PSG talisman reportedly referred to French referee Lionel Jaffredo (centre) as an 'a******' after the game . Speaking in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden striker can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' An LFP statement on Monday read: 'Following the receipt of the officials' report, the disciplinary commission of the LFP will study in its meeting of Thursday March 19 the comments made by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the end of the game between Girondins de Bordeaux and Paris St Germain (29th round of Ligue 1).' French sports minister Patrick Kanner called on the Swede to apologise, telling him 'disappointment did not justify his offensive comments'. He later called Ibrahimovic a 'great champion' after the player wrote on his Instagram account: 'Regarding my comments after tonight's game; they were not against France or the French people.

I lost the game, I accept that but I can't accept when the referee doesn't follow the rules. It's not the first time and I'm sick of it. 'My sincere apologies if anyone was offended or took it the wrong way.' Ibrahimovic's anger was sparked when no free-kick was given after Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a clear backpass from defender Ludovic Sane with five minutes remaining. The outburst comes less than a week after he accused Chelsea's players of acting like 'babies' after he was sent off in his side's Champions League victory over the Blues.

The City boss is under fire after seeing his team crash out of Europe to Barcelona for the second season in a row on Wednesday night.

"Michael Carrick has given Manchester United a big lift ahead of their clash with arch-rivals Liverpool by signing a new one-year contract at Old Trafford. The England midfielder has emerged as a key figure under Louis van Gaal despite missing the first two-and-half months of the season with an ankle injury sustained in the Dutchman’s first training session last summer. Van Gaal has made Carrick his vice-captain and the midfielder’s impressive displays culminated in him creating the opening goal for Marouane Fellaini in last weekend’s 3-0 win at home to Tottenham before scoring himself with a rare headed effort .

Speaking at his weekly press conference ahead of Sunday’s trip to Anfield, Van Gaal said: ‘He is important. He can read the game as a player on the pitch so he can coach during the game but he can improve that, I think. ‘And he is also a midfielder who can play the ball forwards and that I like because our aim is always passing the ball more forwards than sideways or backwards.

"Jose Mourinho has dubbed Paris Saint-Germain the 'most aggressive' team Chelsea has played this season, including a cup encounter with Shrewsbury from League Two. Mourinho claimed the most surprising aspect of the first leg in the Parc des Princes which ended 1-1 was that the French champions had not tried to play more football. 'I was surprised in that game,' said the Chelsea boss, ahead of the return at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. 'I was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls. Jose Mourinho faces the press ahead of the Champions League second leg against PSG on Wednesday . The Chelsea boss out on the training field his players through their paces during the session on Tuesday . John Terry, Thibaut Courtois and Didier Drogba laugh and joke ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie . 'That it was the team making foul after foul, was the team which stopped Eden Hazard with fouls all the time, was the team attacking the man in possession of the ball with two or three players with some very aggressive actions, a team where – even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player – came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering. 'I thought an English team would never be surprised by aggression, because aggression we have in our country. This season we've played against sides form the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG. 'For me, that was a real surprise. With players of such quality, I was expecting more football and less aggression.' Mourinho claims PSG are the most aggressive team Chelsea have faced this season . Juan Cuadrado (centre) heads the ball while team-mates Drogba, Cesc Fabregas, Courtois and Terry look on . Chelsea have played Shrewsbury, Bradford City, Derby, Bolton Wanderers and Watford from the Football League this season.

'It depends upon your concept of football,' said Mourinho. 'What is domination? If that means chances, then yes. If that means making foul after foul, then they dominated. If moving the ball with aggression, yes they dominated. So they dominated in everything except the result.'

"Paul Scholes believes English football has declined to such an extent that Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich would win the Premier League by 10 to 15 points. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City all exited the Champions League in the last 16, while Everton's defeat to Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League meant a total wipeout of the English sides in Europe. And Scholes, the former Manchester United midfielder who twice lifted the European Cup, has entered the debate on why English clubs are so inferior to their continental counterparts.

Mesut Ozil's Arsenal fought back strongly against Arsenal but couldn't overturn the 3-1 first leg deficit . Dejected Chelsea players walk off following their loss to Paris Saint-Germain last week . Writing in The Independent, Scholes said: 'Over the last two weeks our coaches and players in the Champions League have looked second rate. 'If you put one of Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the Premier League, they would win it by 10 to 15 points. 'Even PSG and Juventus look better sides than any of those currently at the top of the Premier League.' While some have blamed the lack of a winter break for English failings, Scholes puts it down simply to inferior players. Paul Scholes has twice won the European Cup with Manchester United - in 1999 and 2008 (pictured) Scholes played 134 European matches during his career, scoring on 26 occasions . 'The bottom line to this season's failings? I think the big two in Spain, and Bayern, simply have better players than the English teams in the Champions League,' he writes.

"And then there were none. English football’s worst European campaign in more than 20 years is now complete. Appropriately, given what went before, it ended with a humiliation. It had been a theme of the season for Everton to provide hope in Europe after poor Champions League results but not this time. Things spectacularly unravelled against Dynamo Kiev and Roberto Martinez looked haunted as the reality of this 5-2 slaying sank in. Yes, Dynamo were superb but they were assisted by abominable defending. Martinez had complained a punishing fixture list is compromising the ambitions of Barclays Premier League teams but fatigue had nothing to do with this night of high farce.

Miguel Veloso hit the third to give Dynamo the lead on aggregate which they never looked like relinquishing . Oleg Gusev followed his goal at Goodison Park with another against Everton as the hosts heaped the woe on the Toffeemen . Vitorino Antunes completed Dynamo's scoring with a beauty from the Portuguese defender to knock the stuffing out of Everton .

Referee: Deniz Aytekin (Germany) Everton conceded five times and were fortunate not to ship another three or four, as Dynamo ruthlessly exposed their naivety. As a result, there will be no English representation in a European quarter-final for the first time since 1992/93. To stand any hope of progressing, it was imperative for Everton to take the sting out of the contest early on and, more importantly, quieten an excitable home crowd that had whipped themselves into a frenzy long before kick-off. Instead, they performed like complete novices. They looked shaky from the first moment on a bare and bobbly pitch, with some players anonymous and others not up to the task. They needed to be tight and compact but they were open and exposed, inviting the hosts on to them. Eventually, Dynamo took advantage. Andrei Yarmolenko had made an impression on Everton’s players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal, bending in a 25-yard drive that flashed past Tim Howard. The execution of the strike was magnificent but, on the touchline, Martinez stood aghast. Why, the manager must have been wondering, was a player of his Yarmolenko’s quality allowed to run 20 yards without anyone making a tackle? It was the moment that sparked the game to life and for 10 minutes, the two teams began trading blows like boxers going through the gears. First Ross Barkley hit the post; Dynamo responded with Yarmolenko testing Howard. Everton roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left-footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball. It should have given them a platform from which to build. Not a bit of it. Dynamo went through the gears and ripped into Everton with a spell that left Martinez and his players bewildered and broken. So bad was Everton’s play, you sensed Dynamo could score every time they got within shooting distance. Lukasz Teodorczyk made the aggregate all square in the 34th minute, nipping in front of Antolin Alcaraz to smash past the stranded Howard. As he wheeled away gleefully, followed by his ecstatic team-mates, a number of Evertonian heads started to drop. This was the key moment.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko reacts after Antunes' strike as the Ukrainian champions marched into the last eight . For the first time since the Premier League's inaugural season there is no English club in a European quarter-final. Here's how each fared. Liverpool, (February 26, Europa League last 32): After finishing third in their Champions League group, the Reds were knocked out by Besiktas on penalties. Tottenham (February 26, Europa League last 32): Knocked out by Fiorentina after a 2-0 defeat in the second leg. Chelsea (March 11, Champions League last 16): Came a cropper against 10-man Paris Saint-Germain in extra time. Arsenal (March 17, Champions League last 16): Knocked out on the away goals rule despite a 2-0 win in Monaco. Manchester City (March 18, Champions League last 16): English champions beaten home and away by Barcelona. Everton (March 19, Europa League last 32): Thumped 5-2 by Kiev in Ukraine. Sensing they could kill the contest, Dynamo swarmed forward and in the next attack, they scored again. This time Miguel Veloso profited from another defensive mix-up, his shot taking a slight deflection off Seamus Coleman on its way past Howard. For a club that has a chant about how they will “fight, fight, fight with all their might” for the Royal Blue jersey, the way in which Everton collapsed was staggering. They lost their shape and lost their heart and were fortunate not to concede a fourth before the interval. How had it come to this? Half-time should have given Martinez a chance to unscramble the senses, to make changes and give Everton clarity but, for some reason, he chose not to make any substitutions and Dynamo simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes. This pummelling was not about to stop. Dynamo made sure of a place in the last eight in the 56th minute when Oleg Gusev converted from close range but, again, there were more shambolic errors. Belatedly, Martinez called for replacements, Leon Osman and Arouna Kone coming on for Steven Naismith and Christian Atsu, but by then it was too late. Dynamo were swaggering and about to crown their display in spectacular fashion. Antunes delivered it, unleashing a 35-yard missile with his left foot that arrowed past the helpless Howard. The execution was breath-taking but, somewhat fittingly, he was given all the time in the world to pick his spot. Why were Everton going to make a tackle now? Eventually, Everton stemmed the tide and scored another of their own, with Phil Jagielka glancing in a Leighton Baines corner, but this was no consolation. It should only have reminded Everton of the opportunity they had squandered and how careless they had been. At the final whistle, they trudged over apologetically to the fans who had made the long journey from Merseyside, the embarrassment finally at end. It was a dreadful way for an adventure that had brought such excitement to conclude. On this evidence, it will be some time before they return.","Trailing by a goal from the first leg, Yarmolenko soon wiped that out with a magical strike in the 21st minute .

"Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest Dane to win 50 caps after he was named in the squad by manager Morten Olsen on Tuesday ahead of friendlies against the United States and France. The 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder should reach the 50 international milestone at a younger age than previous record holder Michael Laudrup. The Spurs playmaker made his debut in March 2010, becoming the youngest Dane to play for the national side since Michael Laudrup and the fourth youngest ever.

During his 49 caps so far Eriksen has only scored one competitive goal with his other four strikes coming in friendlies, and the former Ajax man has often been criticised for his performance for Denmark. Captain Daniel Agger, defender Lars Jacobsen and midfielder William Kvist were named in the squad despite having been involved in a bitter dispute with the Danish FA (DBU) over a collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations to resolve the dispute, which concerns payments and bonuses to men's, women's and Under-21 international teams, are ongoing, the DBU said.","Morten Olsen has named his Denmark squad for upcoming friendlies .

"Arsene Wenger fears Alexis Sanchez is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the £32million Chile striker a well-earned break.

'He's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less,' said boss Wenger. 'He wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles. Maybe goalscoring is on his mind, so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game. Alexis Sanchez has played more minutes this season than every Arsenal player except Per Mertesacker .

It's not that he won't let me, I will decide that. It's just that every game now is so important, you always have a hesitation to do it.' Arsenal are at Newcastle in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, and Wenger will expect a reaction after sliding out of the Champions League on Tuesday. The trip to Tyneside may present a good opportunity to rest Sanchez, with plenty of available options, including Tomas Rosicky set to return after illness, and the manager attempting to keep his squad fresh for the FA Cup defence and to finish as high as possible in the Premier League.

"England must win the RBS 6 Nations title if they want any chance of glory in this year’s World Cup. That is the verdict of hooker Dylan Hartley, who claims the team have put themselves under huge pressure ahead of the home clash with France. ‘I think, timing-wise, this team needs to win something before this World Cup,’ said the Northampton captain. ‘We’ve put that pressure on ourselves.’ England must win the RBS 6 Nations title if they want any chance of World Cup glory, says Dylan Hartley . England hooker Hartley claims they have put themselves under pressure ahead of their tie with France . Stuart Lancaster’s men face a tense afternoon, as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before them — with the destination of the trophy likely to be decided by points difference. The three leading countries have three wins apiece, but England are top of the table with a points difference of +37, set against Ireland’s +33 and +12 for Wales. Wales face Italy in Rome then Ireland meet the Scots at Murrayfield, so by the time Lancaster’s side line up for a teatime ‘Le Crunch’ at Twickenham, they will know what is needed to earn only the second title success since 2003. Hartley was a member of the side under Martin Johnson who claimed the trophy in 2011, but that feat — after a demoralising loss in Dublin shattered their Grand Slam hopes — does not fill a cherished place in the hooker’s memory. Asked where he kept his medal from that campaign, Hartley said: ‘It’s in a box at home somewhere. When you ask me if I have won the Six Nations, I don’t feel like I have. Maybe until the day we do the Grand Slam it probably won’t feel the same, either. There is always that hanging over us.’ England gather as head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on during the captain's run at Twickenham . Lancaster’s team face a tense afternoon as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before they do . Defeat in Ireland dashed hopes of a clean sweep this year, but Hartley suggested that securing a title — which would earn the home players a share of a pay-out worth in excess of £2million — in front of a full house at Twickenham would be ‘lovely’. He added: ‘It would be the best achievement in an England shirt, no doubt. All we can worry about is winning the game and letting everything else take care of itself. Our fate is still in our hands. If we get it all right and win well, I don’t think other results will matter.’ Forwards coach Graham Rowntree acknowledged that England could ‘do with winning any championship, any trophy’ and believes a home team containing several novices can handle the high stakes. ‘We’ve got full faith in the guys,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve shown calmness and leadership. We trust the lads’ decision-making.’ England hooker Hartley is eager to secure a title in front of a full house at Twickenham .

"Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match after propelling New Zealand to a massive first-innings lead in their quarter-final against West Indies. The 28-year-old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 off 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes, of which one found the roof of Wellington's Westpac Stadium in the final over. After posting the highest individual score in a World Cup match, Guptill left his team in an extremely strong position to win as they reached 393 for six. Guptill was undoubtedly the star of the opening innings - but he was given an extra life in the very first over. Just three balls in, Marlon Samuels dropped the Aucklander and Guptill thanked him by finding the first of his many boundaries before Brendon McCullum fell for 12 runs, West Indies captain Jason Holden rising to the occasion to take a stunning catch at deep cover. Guptill then survived two appeals for lbw, chipping away at the attack in between times, and he remained in place after West Indies claimed their second wicket in the 16th over. Kane Williamson had put on 33 before falling to Andre Russell, whose wide delivery ended up with Chris Gayle at short cover. Meanwhile Guptill was moving towards his half-century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put New Zealand on 105 for two. Nothing could stop the Derbyshire batsman and after making his seventh ODI hundred he took off his helmet and saluted the roaring capacity crowd. His ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted Darren Sammy to wide long-on. Guptill was perhaps guilty of ball-watching when Ross Taylor was run out for 42 but, despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics, he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in ODIs with a single off Sulieman Benn. Corey Anderson was then caught by an off-pace delivery from Russell, shuffling across to pull the ball across to Gayle at midwicket for 15. Guptill's double-ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it, achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off Russell before partner Grant Elliott was dismissed on review. The South Africa-born all-rounder had bolstered Guptill's charge with 27 runs off 11 balls, including two fours and two sixes, but he was given out despite appealing Taylor's claim for lbw. Guptill ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199 and the brink of greatness. Then, from the first ball of the 48th over, he drilled Russell's delivery to long-off for a four that made World Cup history. The Black Caps would lose Luke Ronchi (nine) before the break, courtesy of Taylor's yorker that ended up with Benn, but Guptill was uncowed and ploughed on to register a mammoth score of 237. Of the two sixes he hit in the final over, one travelled over 110 metres to end up on the roof of the stadium, and he left the field to a standing ovation.","New Zealand posted score of 393 in World Cup quarter-final .

"Jonny Evans maintains he didn’t wilfully spit at Papiss Cisse – and would’ve been locked out of the family home if he had. The Manchester United defender reacted angrily during their 1-0 win at St James’ Park earlier this month, with television cameras seemingly catching him in the act. But Evans insists the altercations is not what it appears, even if the FA felt the need to slap him with a six-match ban. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared up at St James' Park . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . ‘I can totally understand there is an image around that, and in the British game and our society it’s not something that is accepted, and rightly so,’ Evans told The Times. ‘But I was able to go home and look my mum and dad in the eye because if I’d genuinely spat at someone I think they would have been disgusted in me. ‘It’s not the background I come from in Northern Ireland. My mum and dad would have given me a rollicking if I had done that.’ Evans says his mum and dad would have been disgusted if he had 'genuinely spat at' Papiss Cisse . Cisse was handed a seven-match ban for a clearer spit in the aftermath, the additional game owing to a previous red card for the Magpies this season. Evans added: ‘I did not have the intent to spit at an opponent, so when the FA charged me with that I could never accept it. ‘To spit at anyone is one of the most disgusting things you can do; it’s low and it’s cheap. I would never think to spit at someone. You just look like an idiot.’ Cisse appears to wipe spit away from his eye after the altercation at St James' Park .","Jonny Evans was handed a six-match ban after clashing with Papiss Cisse .

"Don't get me wrong, I am not Marouane Fellaini’s biggest fan, but if Manchester United are to win on Sunday then he is going to have a big role to play. You would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become United’s go-to man but he has knuckled down, worked hard and is now one of Louis van Gaal’s most effective players. Here’s why... TARGET MAN . 2,251 - Burnley . 2,241 - QPR . 2,226 - Manchester United . United have played the third-most long balls this season, so this is not the skilful, free-flowing team of previous years. But with Fellaini it is an effective tactic. He has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season — far more than any other United man — and Crystal Palace’s Mile Jedinak is the only midfielder to win more headers per game. His power in the air is vital for providing knock-downs for the likes of Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata to collect. Liverpool must also track his runs into the box because United will try to find him as often as they can. Marouane Fellaini, pictured during training, has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season . Fellaini is a powerful player that has become a key part of Louis van Gaal's United team this season . POWER PLAY . One thing is for sure with Fellaini, you know you’re in a game with him. Martin Skrtel, Emre Can and Mamadou Sakho are big, physical players but they will have a battle on their hands. Fellaini gives away on average 2.1 free-kicks per game — that’s the fifth-highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is. It’s not pretty, but it unsettles defences. United midfielder Fellaini will not be afraid to get physical with Liverpool's players at Anfield . TOUCH OF CLASS . Fellaini's game is not all about power. Like Peter Crouch, he’s portrayed as a bit of a Lurch when actually his technique is good. Just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against Tottenham. He might not be the creative genius to win United titles, but he has become a useful weapon for Van Gaal. Fellaini lets rip a shot with his left foot as he makes it 1-0 against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford . Fellaini has been a useful weapon for Van Gaal and was on form against Tottenham in United's 3-0 win . Fellaini celebrates his goal for United in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail's Ian Hodgson . FORWARD THINKING . It was painful viewing last season seeing Fellaini play in a deep midfield role. David Moyes wanted him as protection for his defence, but Fellaini turns like a cruise liner and it was easy for teams to press him. Playing further forward, it doesn’t matter if he loses possession as there is no immediate danger and he can provide an attacking threat of his own. Fellaini has been allowed to play further forward for United under Van Gaal, unlike under David Moyes . ELBOW ROOM . Fellaini is a real nuisance player. He’s like a daddy longlegs — all arms and legs as he wrestles and grapples to get himself into position. He gets his elbows up high, which makes him very difficult to mark, and it’s hard to get players around him. It’s that physicality that would make me tempted to start Steven Gerrard on Sunday. Not for sentimental reasons, but because he would offer a vital shield against Fellaini’s threat. Head and shoulders: Fellaini is Van Gaal’s key player . Fellaini has become Van Gaal's key player and he will likely be a nuisance for Liverpool on Sunday .","Manchester United face rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday .

"Sean Penn has revealed that he watches propaganda beheading videos published by ISIS out of a sense of moral responsibility. The actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips, in which Americans, Britons and Kurds have been graphically slaughtered, because 'real violence' is often hidden from us. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'The problem is we are not seeing enough of real violence. We are being anesthetized when you don't see the horror of war.' 'Real violence': Sean Penn, pictured left in his new film The Gunman, said he watches ISIS's propaganda videos showing hostages like James Foley, right, being beheaded . When asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips, he replied that he did. Penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts 'political correctness', which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in Iraq and Afghanistan from being kept off-screen. He also mentioned the ISIS clips in relation to his own new movie, The Gunman, which will feature graphic violence. Penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in Iraq and Syria are not the same thing. Violence in movies: Penn made a point of differentiating fictional violence, like that in his new film, above, from real-life acts by the likes of ISIS . He said: 'Anyone who sees them [ISIS videos] and claims that they were anaesthetised by violent movies, that they weren't horrified by what they saw, on the most primal level, is intellectually dishonest or existentially unpresent.' Penn has voice his opinions about ISIS before - earlier this week he told Conan O'Brien that the terrorist organization was 'created' by George W Bush and Dick Cheney. Beginning with former Vice President Cheney, whom he called 'an embittered bacteria [sic] of humanity', he said: 'These are the guys, he and President Bush and some others, who invented Daesh, or ISIS.' The video ends with three ISIS fighters pulling out their knives and beheading their prisoner. Close up shots of the bloodied bodies are shown. He sarcastically added 'thanks for that'. Meanwhile ISIS continues to produce and distribute sickening videos of its barbaric executions. Its warped criminal justice system has given rise to footage of people thrown off buildings for being homosexual, and having hands amputated for other crimes. On Friday its latest beheading video was released, showing the killing of three Kurdish soldiers who had been taken prisoner.","Actor advocates watches videos because people are 'anesthetized'

"Wayne Rooney is on course to break Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goalscoring record at the club, but the Manchester United captain has struggled to find the net at the home of one their fiercest rivals. Ahead of Sunday's crunch clash at Anfield, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal will be hoping his star striker can lead by example when United travel to Liverpool. Rooney was on target as United swept aside Tottenham at Old Trafford on March 15 - taking his league tally to 11 this season. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will be hoping Wayne Rooney can fire them to glory at Liverpool . Rooney (centre) scored in United's 3-0 win vs Tottenham on March 15 but has struggled at Anfield in the past . However, the 29-year-old's record at Anfield is a poor one during his time at United and at boyhood club Everton. In 10 appearances at the ground, Rooney has only managed to score once. That goal proved decisive though as United ran out 1-0 winners against Liverpool in January 2005. Since then however, the stats make for unimpressive reading for Van Gaal's talisman - with the forward having failed to score in his subsequent seven appearances at Anfield. Rooney has only scored once in 10 matches at Liverpool during his time at Everton and United . Rooney (left) celebrates his strike with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2005 as United won 1-0 at Anfield .

"Click here to read Matt Lawton on how the Liverpool boss put his faith in 3-4-3 . Liverpool have not suffered Premier League defeat since falling 3-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Sunday’s match at Anfield is a measure of how far they have come. United have been more hit and miss in that period, but still only lost twice in the league. They produced their best display of the season in the 3-0 victory over Tottenham. Plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while Brendan Rodgers and Louis Van Gaal have toyed with their systems. Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 3-4-3 formation favoured by Liverpool to fit as many attackers in as possible. Why not. The Liverpool and Manchester United composite XI selected by Sportsmail . Goalkeeper – David de Gea . The outstanding goalkeeper in England and arguably the best in the world right now. Seems to pull off a save a real substance every game, offers good distribution, and exudes calm from his penalty box. David de Gea has been outstanding between the sticks for Manchester United this season . Centre-back – Chris Smalling . A surprise perhaps, but turned in one of his best games in a United shirt against Spurs. He was strong, brought the ball out with assurance, and picked a pass more than once. Chris Smalling produced one of his best performances of the season in United's win over Spurs last week . Centre-back – Michael Carrick . Not his ideal position but for want of excellent defenders could easily operate here. His anticipation and experience are valuable. A breathe of air to United’s team after returning from injury. Michael Carrick celebrates his goal in Man United's 3-0 win over Spurs at Old Trafford last weekend . Centre-back – Emre Can . Has blossomed in his converted role in Liverpool’s back three. Deceptively quick because of his hulking frame, and an excellent ball player. Emre Can . Right wing-back – Adam Lallana . Such a skilful player clever enough to function in a variety of positions. Offers energy and trickery down the flank and a threat when cutting in. Liverpool's Adam Lallana takes on Neil Taylor during last week's 1-0 win at Swansea City . Left wing-back – Ashley Young . Has enjoyed a really consistent season and seems to be growing under Van Gaal. A menace down the left n recent games with renewed drive and end product. Ashley Young rampages down the wing against Tottenham's Nacer Chadli during last Sunday's match . Centre midfield – Philippe Coutinho . Dazzling talent and goal threat from any range. The oil to make the midfield cogs roll seamlessly along and possesses the imagination to unlock defences in the final third. Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal against Southampton last month . Centre midfield – Jordan Henderson . The steely core to the team and the best-performing midfielder in England right now. Two stunning goals from distance in his recent back catalogue and a formidable mentality to seep across the side. Jordan Henderson celebrates his important winner for Liverpool against Swansea last Monday . Right wing – Raheem Sterling . Brings whippet pace to stretch defenders and is illustrating his flexibility by coping intelligently to requests by Rodgers for positional changes. An absolute terror at his optimum. Raheem Sterling takes on Swansea's Jack Cork during Liverpool victory at Swansea . Left wing – Daniel Sturridge . Has not yet burst to life since his comeback from injury, but offering enough glimpses to force his way into this imaginary line-up. A potent scoring danger and able to assist as well. Daniel Sturridge celebrates in hallmark fashion after scoring against West Ham at Anfield in January . Striker – Wayne Rooney . Back to his best as a snarling centre-forward, with five goals in his last six games, so let him continue there. Vast experience, vast ability and a ferocious desire to win. Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring United's third goal against Tottenham at Old Trafford last weekend . So six Liverpool players to five from United, eight Englishmen, and a team full of attacking intent. Marouane Fellaini would be first off the substitutes bench to offer a physical presence up front.","Liverpool and Man United meet at Anfield in season-defining clash .

"Thibaut Courtois believes Chelsea's win at West Ham was the sort which showed they can be Premier League champions. Chelsea followed up last Sunday's Capital One Cup final victory over Tottenham with a 1-0 win at Upton Park to consolidate their five-point lead over second-placed Manchester City. Goalkeeper Courtois was integral to the success, secured by Eden Hazard's first-half header, making a number of key saves, and reckons the win was crucial in the title race. Thiabaut Courtois came to Chelsea's rescue on a number of occasions during 1-0 win over West Ham . The Chelsea keeper parries the the ball with his leg as Kevin Nolan closes in on goal . 'Those games define if you can be champion or not,' Courtois told Chelsea TV 'A lot of teams lose points here. It was a hard game and we came out with a victory. 'At this stage of the competition of the league an away win like this is really important to be champions in the end. Those games decide if you will be champions or not. If you lose points here then you know City is back at two points (behind). 'We did well, so we have to continue in that way and hopefully at the end of May we can lift the trophy.' The Belgium goalkeeper thinks the performance, just a few days after the Wembley win, shows Chelsea have the desire to add a first Premier League title in five years to their League Cup success. The Belgium keeper is congratulated by defender Gary Cahill and John Terry after the final whistle . Courtois dives low to his left to repel another effort at his goal by West Ham striker Diafra Sakho . 'The motivation is to be champions,' added Courtois, who won Spain's Primera Division last term while on loan at Atletico Madrid. 'Every player will be motivated if you know you're playing to win the title. Three days after Wembley, okay maybe for some players it's hard, but everybody showed that we are great professionals who, after winning a title, want more and more.' Courtois, restored after Petr Cech played at Wembley, saved Chelsea time and again as West Ham were thwarted. He has displaced Cech as first choice this term and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho revealed on the eve of the match he would not stand in the Czech Republic goalkeeper's way if he asked to leave this summer. Courtois said: 'He's also one of the best keepers in the world. We train really well together. I can still learn from him. Maybe some things he can learn from me. Courtois praised rival for the No 1 spot Petr Cech and insists he is one of the best keepers in the world . Eden Hazard's header sails past Adrian to give Chelsea a vital three points at Upton Park . 'Obviously I prefer if the team plays well, we defend well and we don't need my saves. (But) I help the team like every other player.' Chelsea, out of the FA Cup, next play PSG next Wednesday in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. The Upton Park win was important for Chelsea after dropping points at home last time out in the league, according to Hazard. Hazard told Chelsea TV: 'Before the game we said after the draw against Burnley we needed to take three points away. After a bad result it's always good to win one game. Hazard leads the celebrations as Chelsea took another step towards winning the Premier League title . 'We had a lot of opportunities, they had a lot of opportunities. 'I scored with my head. It's not every game, but when I can, I close my eyes, I touch the ball and the ball goes in the net.' West Ham defender James Collins, who replaced Winston Reid (hamstring) after eight minutes, rued an opportunity missed. He told West Ham TV: 'We're disappointed in the changing room, to be honest. 'We thought we had the chances to get a point or even win the game. 'Earlier on in the season we were sticking them away, unfortunately at the minute we're not. 'We're in a good spot, we're 10th in the league, 39 points on the board and we've got some winnable games when we get going again. So we've got to kick on.'","Chelsea beat West Ham 1-0 at Upton Park on Wednesday night .

"Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts New Zealand into the semi-finals as they claimed a 143-run win against West Indies. The 28-year-old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes, one of which found the roof of Wellington's Westpac Stadium in the final over. The record-breaking innings, which was the second highest one day international score of all time behind Indian Rohit Sharma's 264, helped New Zealand to 393 for six.

The West Indies' Jerome Taylor congratulates Guptill on his achievement at the end of the innings . Chris Gayle of the West Indies also added his congratulations after the history-making innings . In reply, West Indies were all out for 250 in 30.3 overs, with Trent Boult claiming four for 44 to become the leading wicket taker in the tournament. New Zealand will face South Africa in the semi-finals while Australia play India in the other match. It could have been so different, though, had Marlon Samuels held a the catch just three balls in which would have sent Guptill back to the pavilion. Guptill also survived two lbw shouts, but New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs. Kane Williamson had put on 33 before falling to Andre Russell, whose wide delivery ended up with Chris Gayle at short cover. Meanwhile Guptill was moving towards his half-century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put New Zealand on 105 for two. His ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted Darren Sammy to wide long-on. Guptill was perhaps guilty of ball-watching when Ross Taylor was run out for 42 but, despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics, he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in ODIs with a single off Sulieman Benn. Corey Anderson was then caught by an off-pace delivery from Russell, shuffling across to pull the ball across to Gayle at midwicket for 15. Guptill's double-ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it, achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off Russell before partner Grant Elliott was dismissed on review. Guptill ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199, going on to drill Russell's first delivery of the 48th over to long-off for a four that made World Cup history.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho no longer feels the need to implement a 'confrontational leadership' style with his players because their season is going largely to plan. The 52-year-old Portuguese returned to Stamford Bridge for his second spell in charge last season but got off to a disappointing start by his own high standards and failed to win any silverware in 2013-14. This season, however, Chelsea have already won the League Cup and boast a six-point advantage over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table with a game in hand. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has revealed he has ditched his 'confrontational leadership' style . The Portuguese tactician insists he has had no reason to 'provoke' his players during the current campaign . 'This season I don't need confrontational leadership - last season I felt I needed it a few times,' Mourinho told reporters. 'Basically, it's when you are ready to provoke your players to try to create some conflicts with the intention to bring out the best of them. 'In this moment I don't think I need that with this group because things are going in the direction I want.' It has not been all smooth sailing for Mourinho this season, however, as Chelsea were knocked out of the FA Cup by League One (third tier) Bradford City and were eliminated in the last-16 of the Champions League by Paris St Germain. 'Obviously you can say ""but you lost in the Champions League"", or ""you lost against Bradford"",' Mourinho said. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard has matured into a 'great player', according to Mourinho . 'But globally, generally, the way they work, the way they behave, the way they live together, their motivations, their responsibilities, their frustrations, the way they react to the negative moments, the way they react to the positive moments, the absence of complacency, all this is going well. 'So I just need to be present. I don't need to be a big leader, or even try to find strategies as a leader.' Belgian forward Eden Hazard felt the wrath of Mourinho's 'confrontational leadership' style last season after neglecting his defensive duties during Chelsea's Champions League semi-final exit to Atletico Madrid. Hazard, however, has been Chelsea's standout player this season but Mourinho said he is unsure if the 24-year-old's development is down to the criticism he received. 'I don't know if it was that or it was his maturity coming, his level of ambition,' he said. 'I just think that was a natural evolution. 'He wants to be the best, to improve his game, score more goals. I still call him a kid but he's a man. He's a great player.'","Jose Mourinho is happy with the direction his players are going in .

"Manchester United will fail to qualify for the Champions League due to a difficult season run in, claim BT Sport's pundits. Owen Hargreaves, David James and Steve McManaman were on BT Sport ahead of Manchester City's match with West Brom and the trio all picked Chelsea as Premier League champions with Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool completing their top four. However Louis van Gaal's side, who visit Anfield on Sunday afternoon, have been on a respectable run of recent form whereas neighbours Manchester City have faltered in their past nine matches. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal takes training on Friday ahead of facing Liverpool at Anfield . ‘Chelsea I think will finish top. They’ve strengthened their team better than anybody else and they’ll prove they’re the best, which they have been all season,' said Owen Hargreaves at the Etihad Stadium. Fellow pundit Steve Mcmanaman insisted Manchester City's three wins in their past nine games was only a blip and they'll finish at least second: . 'I think it will be a monumental slip of concentration and huge slip up from City, but I’m sure they’ll be fine,' McManaman told BT Sport. The BT Sport pundits on Saturday all predicted that Manchester United will fall short in the race for the top four . Here is the current form table but the BT Sport pundits think Manchester City will still finish second this season . However the BT pundits all declared that Manchester United will miss out on Champions League football again next season. Louis van Gaal's side face Champions League rivals Chelsea, Manchester City Arsenal and Liverpool before the season concludes. ‘Manchester United have the hardest run in of the lot. Before today (Saturday) I would have said that they would finish fourth but looking through all the fixtures, I really think it favours Liverpool,' added Hargreaves. 'As much as it pains me to say, I think they’re going to struggle to finish in the top four with those remaining fixtures.' The Liverpool players appear relaxed ahead of a crunch Champions League . Manchester United prevailed in the last fixture with Liverpool, winning 3-0 back in December at Old Trafford . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side host United on Sunday in what will surely be a pivotal clash in the race for the top four: . ‘ I completely agree with Owen. Manchester United’s fixtures are very difficult. Liverpool have a huge game tomorrow (Sunday). They’re at home, they have the advantage, they have the form,' said McManaman. 'If they win on Sunday I think it will cement them even more in the Champions League places. With their run in I think Liverpool will finish in the top four.' CHELSEA . Hull (away) - March 22 .

"Seven days on from their Grand Slam-ruining wobble in Cardiff, this was transmission impressively resumed by Joe Schmidt’s Ireland. The proud performance wasn’t without imperfection but their way more direct, full of running approach was enough for them to surpass the points target set by Wales earlier in the afternoon. Then it was all eyes on England before the result at Twickenham brought confirmation that Schmidt’s side could party like it was 1949 all over again – the last time the country won back-to-back championships. The Ireland players celebrate as they are crowned Six Nations champions after England failed to beat France by the 26 points they needed .

Irish fans celebrate their side winning the Six Nations after watching England beat France 55-35 at Twickenham . Sean O'Brien of Ireland goes over to score the second try during the RBS Six Nations match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield . No one can begrudge them their triumph. With just four tries scored this term, this tricky away assignment had become even trickier in the hours before kick-off, as Wales’ runaway win in Rome meant Ireland required a 21-point win to reclaim the top spot which they had initially lost to England last weekend with defeat at the Millennium Stadium. That would have considerably heightened the pressure to deliver but they were largely unfazed, throwing off the shackles and looking a side emboldened by finesse and hungry for scores. Meddling Scotland initially refused to go along with Ireland’s best intentions. They may have offered up a dozen turnovers and bled on the penalty count by a rate of 12 to six, but they were still combative to a degree despite getting held scoreless in a second half where Ireland dominated territory. They came close, mind, rallying well during Geoff Cross’ sin-binning and knocking on just metres short. Even then they sent Irish hearts a flutter, believing they had scored in the corner with only minutes left only for the TMO review to prove Jamie Heaslip had excellently shunted the ball from Stuart Hogg’s hands before he grounded. It was superb scrambling, an appetite which epitomised Ireland’s attitude in comprehensively winning an entertaining battle played out on a fast track vastly superior to the state of previous pitches laid at Murrayfield. Ireland players celebrate at the end of the match at Murrayfield before later being crowned Six Nations champions . Scotland's Finn Russell is tackled by Ireland's Conor Murray and Rory Best during their Six Nations rugby match at Murrayfield stadium . Ireland rectified many of the issues that had affected them last weekend, buoyancy greatly helped by a tonic start. Referee Jerome Garces turned a blind eye to a scrum collapse, telling Conor Murray to play the ball. He did, Johnny Sexton looping with Jared Payne before sending Tommy Bowe haring through the gap, a linebreak that eventually resulted in Paul O’Connell going over off the side of a Rob Kearney ruck. Sexton added the conversion and a 10th minute penalty before Scotland finally found their legs and a series of errors led to a Greig Laidlaw penalty riposte before the momentum swing was pierced by penalty-winning breakdown foraging by Rory Best. With Luke Fitzgerald, shining in his first start in four years, linking well with Kearney, Ireland pounced for their second try on 24 minutes after well-worked set-piece. Best threw to the rear, Devin Toner gathered and his slick transfer before landing resulted in Sean O’Brien stepping Dougie Fife to score. Sexton converted for a 14-point lead, just seven short of the all important Wales target, but there was quickly a painful reminder that there was still much work to do to even win this game first. O'Brien of Ireland goes over to score the second try during the RBS Six Nations match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield . Kearney failed to deal with a grubber kick send his way and the spilled possession led to a three-on-one overlap numerous phases later where Robbie Henshaw couldn’t prevent Finn Russell nabbing the try converted by Laidlaw. It was another example of Ireland getting exposed on their righthand side off quick ruck ball, as France and Wales scored this way and England nearly did so too in the final minute in Dublin. They now needed to better mind themselves and a scrum collapse allowed Sexton to grab the 20-10 advantage they took with them to the break. The out-half added another five minutes after the resumption and then ushered in Jared Payne under the posts on 50 minutes after another metre-eating maul had eaten away at the Scottish defence. Sexton added the extras, 20 points was now the margin and Ireland were now level with Wales’ points difference but on tries scored.

Ireland's O'Brien scores a try during the 2015 RBS Six Nations match at Murrayfield Stadium . Despite their growing dominance, it wasn’t until the 62 minute that they managed the score that put them top of the pile. Sexton inexplicably hit an upright with a close-in ruck penalty, a shocking aberration which indicated the high stakes involved. He then missed another, kicking wide to the right from the 10-metre line after Cross was yellow carded. However, with uncontested scrums now required during the replacement prop’s absence, Fitzgerald probed off a set-piece to offer Sexton another glimpse of the target and he was third time lucky. He then signed off with cramp after the kick-and-chase that closed down Greig Tonks to win the lineout that engineered O’Brien’s 72nd minute try, the back row demonstrating great agility to stretch out beyond Alasdair Dickinson and ground. Hogg’s near-miss followed, as did a penalty miss from Ian Madigan, before all eyes switched to England.","England needed to beat France by 26 points to win Six Nations title after Ireland secured battling win over Scotland .

"Arsenal for the title? That extraordinary possibility cannot now be batted away as pure whimsy after Olivier Giroud’s prolific goal run continued, inspiring his side to overcome Newcastle. This win doesn’t merely cement Arsenal’s top-four place but gives Chelsea and Manchester City above them reason to look over shoulders with increasing concern. Giroud’s goals came within a four-minute first-half spell, the first off his thigh, the second from a header. They take the 28-year-old’s recent tally to nine goals in nine games in all competitions. He also has eight in six games against Newcastle since his £10million move in summer 2012 from Montpellier.

Newcastle were a distant second best in the first half but were impressive after the break, testing Arsenal’s mettle as Moussa Sissoko gave them a consolation. The upshot is Arsenal are just a point behind City and four behind leaders Chelsea, albeit with Chelsea having two games in hand. Chelsea remain odds-on favourites to win the title race. Rightly. But whisper it: this is a race now of sorts, a contest at least, with the season’s biggest prize remaining a feasible for more than one team, for now. ‘Chelsea at the moment I feel have enough [of a ] cushion to be serene,’ said Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger, asked about his side’s title chances. ‘Chelsea have too much security.’ But asked if his players believe they can now cause what would be an amazing upset, he added: ‘We are in a fight right until the end. We will keep on fighting.’ Wenger’s counterpart John Carver said: ‘Until they scored the two goals I thought we were in it. But we conceded from two set plays and that’s disappointing.’ Leaving aside the two-legged exit to Monaco in the Champions League, things have been going Arsenal’s way of late. They have won 14 of their last 16 games, and all six of their last six games. That is title-challenging form and their eight Premier League fixtures to come offer the tantalising opportunity to advance their own cause while damaging those immediately around them. Giroud holds off his marker to head Arsenal into a two-goal lead just four minutes after opening the scoring .

Sissoko points to the sky as he celebrates scoring Newcastle's first Premier League goal since February 28 . Their next game is at home to Liverpool in a fortnight before a trip to Burnley. After that comes what could prove to be a pivotal showdown against Chelsea — at the Emirates. They then play at Hull, at home to Swansea and at Manchester United before finishing with back-to-back home games against Sunderland and West Brom. Newcastle, relatively safe but unremarkable in mid-table continue to frustrate their fans — although they came flying from the blocks in the second half. Carver brushed aside any suggestion his team are free-wheeling. ‘In the second half we took the game to them and we can take a lot from that,’ he said. ‘We’re not on the beach in flip-flops, that’s for sure.’ Arsenal found fertile territory down the right, winning a series of set-pieces. Santi Cazorla’s free-kick found Alexis Sanchez on the left and his shot was blocked by Ryan Taylor. Another Cazorla cross was aimed at Giroud but Tim Krul gathered it. Then came the free-kick that broke the deadlock, Cazorla delivering to Danny Welbeck, whose flicked head-on fell into the path of Giroud, off whose leg the ball flew in.

Two minutes later it was 2-0, with Cazorla again the provider, this time from a corner. Giroud was being ‘marked’ by Mike Williamson, or rather Williamson was standing next to him as the ball came in. Giroud did not even need to launch himself from the ground to meet the ball with his head, simply leaning forward to steer home. Newcastle responded with a hat-trick of chances in 40 seconds. Sammy Ameobi’s left-footed shot was blocked, as was Sissoko’s shot, and then Remy Cabella’s header. After the break their urgency increased still further. They reduced the deficit after Taylor and Cabella exchanged passes, and Cabella crossed to Sissoko, who converted. Newcastle’s tails were up and Ayoze Perez twice unleashed powerful shots that went narrowly over. Yoan Gouffran then shot straight at David Ospina before Williamson tested the Arsenal keeper properly with a header. Ospina made a brilliant reaction save with his legs from Perez four minutes from time to keep Arsenal’s lead intact — and a dream run at the title still viable.

"The makeshift presentation area at the Palazzo di Venezzia and the standby winners’ press conference were all in vain. Wales recorded their second biggest RBS 6 Nations victory under Warren Gatland but - after bolting ahead in the three-horse race thanks to a George North hat-trick - they watched the trophy painfully slip out of their one-handed grasp. It was a scintillating second-half display at the Stadio Olimpico. Italy were chewed up and spat out, while Wales feasted like old emperors of Rome. Gatland’s side will take face from the performance and, looking ahead to the World Cup, the Kiwi rounded off the competition with no anxieties about September’s pool of death. Liams Williams celebrates after crossing over to score one of Wales' second half tries during a stunning display at the Stadio Olimpico .

Conversions: Biggar (6) Penalties: Halfpenny (2), Biggar . ‘We won’t be going into the World Cup with any fears of not qualifying from our group,’ said Gatland. ‘We will improve as we spend time together and there is no fear about playing England at Twickenham, or Australia. We can go there with some real confidence and belief that we can get out of our group. ‘You have sides ranked fourth, fifth and sixth in the world, so that shows how tough it is to get out of that group. Fiji with preparation will be tough as well and it’s unfortunate that you are going to have one of the big teams not making the quarter-finals. That’s what has happened but we are confident we can get out of that group and progress to the quarter-finals.’ Italy, meanwhile, will be easy meat at the World Cup if they do not improve their flaky blue line of defence. They provided easy pickings in the second half, although that should not detract from Wales' ambition and enterprise shown after the half-time break. It was a stark contrast to the opening 40 minutes, when the visitors’ inexperienced front-row were shown up by the Azzurri pack. Italy had been slated, written off and identified as whipping boys, yet they came out growling in the national anthems and would have been in front at the break, had it not been for a Dan Biggar penalty on the stroke of Chris Pollock’s whistle. ‘It doesn’t matter who you’re playing against, it’s difficult to put a team away in the first half,’ said Gatland. ‘We were under some pressure at the scrum and Italy slowed the game down. It was hard for us to get tempo, but I thought we were very, very good when we started playing a bit more positively.’ The experienced Martin Castrogiovanni, back in the Italian front-row after being bitten on the nose by a dog, caused problems at the set-piece and carried hard in the early exchanges. All the talk in the Roma bars had been about not whether Wales would win in Rome, but how many points they could put on their second-rate opponents. There was an instant Italian retort and – after Wales were penalised for using blockers to help Luke Charteris at the kick-off – Kelly Haimona kicked the hosts to an unexpected lead. Wales had to steady the ship and so they did, with a penalty through the ever-reliable Leigh Halfpenny. Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny receives treatement after a nasty collision forced him off the field of play at the Stadio Olimpico . Martin Castrogiovanni (centre) rides the challenge of Luke Charteris (left) as Italy hosted Wales in the Six Nations final day . Parity; a chance for Wales to start again, although that was not the case. Italy were supposed to be short on spirit after the withdrawal of skipper Sergio Parisse, although their was no lack of belief during the early blows. Haimona left the pitch with a broken wrist but Luciano Orquera took over the kicking and edged his side back in front with a 10th minute penalty. There was little on show that would give Ireland or England much to fear. Jamie Roberts and Giovambattista Venditti exchanged scores and Wales went into the break with an unconvincing one-point lead. They had lost Leigh Halfpenny to concussion and their title ambitions were looking bleak. But then, out of nowhere, the flick switched and the lights started flashing red. Italy capitulated and Wales turned up the heat. They upped the tempo and – with Sam Warburton and Alun-Wyn Jones working tirelessly up front – the backline started to fire. Rhys Webb turned down a kick at goal for a tap penalty, finding Liam Williams on a cute inside line to open the floodgates. The banks of the River Tiber were imploding and Andrea Masi was sent to the sin-bin. Within 10 second-half minutes, North had completed his hat-trick, drawing on his pace to finish two out wide and his power to finish a third through the middle. It was the sort of rugby that viewers have been craving throughout this year’s competition. It lacked of edge-of-seat intensity of the defensive phases against Ireland, but would give the southern hemisphere nations a run for easy-on-the-eye viewing. George Biagi followed Masi to the sin-bin and, powering over from the back of a maul, Webb edged the scoreline towards 50 points. Scott Williams reaches out to add another try as Wales put in a sensational second half performance to crush Italy in Rome on Saturday . Wales wing George North stampedes through a challenge from Giovanbattista Venditti to score a third try in the second half . Wales unleashed their loaded bench, with Gareth Davies, Justin Tipuric and Rhys Priestland all making a late impact; after Scott Williams had been introduced early as a replacement for Halfpenny. Finishing off a break from just outside the Welsh 22, Warburton darted under the posts to move his side past the half-century mark, before Scott Williams finished off another fine move to leave the organisers questioning their decision to send the trophies to Twickenham and Murrayfield. Wales had done what they came to do. They had achieved the mammoth scoreline and the celebratory drinks were on ice. They pushed for one last try but, out of nowhere, Leonardo Sarto crashed the party. The Italian winger broken downfield for a late try, with the score confirmed by the TMO. i’It was probably a 14-point swing in terms of the points difference,’ said Gatland. With Wales missing out on the title by a handful of points, it proved to be a costly mistake.

"Ronald Koeman has had worse birthdays. On the same day he turned 52, Southampton kept themselves in the hunt for European football, and it was gift-wrapped by Burnley themselves. Shane Long’s first strike in the Barclays Premier League since November and an own goal by Jason Shackell did the trick against a Burnley team threatened with being sent back to where they came from last season. As for Southampton it will take some doing to get rid of them. Just when Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United thought Champions League qualification was primarily a scrap among themselves, this served as a reminder. Shane Long opened the scoring with his first goal in the Barclays Premier League since November . Long celebrates putting Southampton ahead in the 37th minute against Burnley on Saturday .

Jason Shackell's own goal at St Mary's.Click here for our match zone service . ‘The boys gave me the best present for my birthday,’ said Koeman, who was serenaded by the St Mary’s crowd with their rendition of Happy Birthday. ‘A good win. An important win. Three points. Nice present.’ Yet it was horribly tense at times, as it should be against a team fighting for their Premier League lives. Burnley, fresh from beating Manchester City last week, made the Saints sing for their supper. Southampton moved to within a point of Liverpool, albeit a game ahead, and did so without Fraser Forster, the keeper with the most clean sheets in the Premier League this season. No sooner had the game got started than it was interrupted when Forster, named in Roy Hodgson’s England squad this week, had to be carried off on a stretcher after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by Sam Vokes. There was nothing in it as the Burnley striker tried to block the goalkeeper’s clearance but Forster was replaced by the 38-year-old Kelvin Davis, and Koeman does not think he will be able to feature for England this month. Burnley shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute when Jason Shackell diverted Ryan Bertrand's cross into his own net . Burnley defender Jason Shackell looks dejected after scoring an own goal against Southampton . Yet Southampton made do without Forster, and Long settled their nerves on 38 minutes. A deflected low drive by Nathaniel Clyne from the right corner of the penalty area somehow found the unmarked forward at the back post. A simple tap-in was all that was required, and the Irishman obliged. Southampton have dropped just two points from winning positions this season — fewer than any other team — but this was scrappy, to say the least. Graziano Pelle should have scored, and passed the dreaded 1,000-minute mark in the Premier League since his last goal. He hit the crossbar from close range, produced air-kicks, had headers saved, and his luck never improved. ‘The first half was a little bit more difficult. We had good chances to score more than one goal,’ Koeman added. ‘There was good movement, good attacking, good chances. ‘Pelle was a little unlucky, but he was working hard. That’s what you have to do if you don’t score. Your team-rate is important.The goals will come,’ insisted Koeman. It was a good win.’ The game died when Burnley shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute. Ryan Bertrand had been a nuisance throughout, and his cross led to an outstretched knee by Burnley defender Shackell turning Ryan Bertrand’s cross into his own net under no pressure. Southampton, then, remain in the race, and the seemingly impossible remains possible. Southampton keeper Fraser Forster was injured after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by Danny Ings .

"Harry Arter scored his second wonder goal in five days as Bournemouth stepped up their bid to reach the Barclays Premier League with an emphatic 3-0 win over Middlesbrough. Arter's powerful 20-yard strike early in the second half was sandwiched between penalties from Yann Kermorgant and substitute Brett Pitman as Bournemouth leapfrogged Middlesbrough in the Sky Bet Championship table to assert their claim for automatic promotion. Newly called up by the Republic of Ireland, Arter also showed his quality with a stunning goal in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Cardiff. Harry Arter celebrates his brilliant strike that gave Bournemouth their second goal against Middlesbrough . The Cherries were on the front foot for the majority of the tussle against a team that began the day in second place, and Kermorgant could have put Eddie Howe's men in front in the second minute. Middlesbrough goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos made a good save low to his left to deny the French striker. Callum Wilson's pace created problems for the visitors' defence all afternoon and it was Bournemouth's leading scorer who won the first penalty, as he was bundled over by Tomas Kalas. Kermorgant stepped up and coolly drove the 12th-minute spot-kick into the right corner of the net. The first half was played at a frenetic pace and Bournemouth could have been further ahead at the interval. Yann Kermorgant places a penalty during the first half to set Bournemouth on their way to victory . Matt Ritchie had a drilled effort blocked by the back of George Friend in the 26th minute, before Kermorgant's well-struck volley was saved by Konstantopoulos. Ritchie forced the Middlesbrough goalkeeper back into action again in the 31st minute, but his left-footed effort was easily held. Middlesbrough were unable to truly test Artur Boruc in the first 45 minutes. Their best chance came on the half hour when Adam Reach flicked Patrick Bamford's cross into the hands of the Poland goalkeeper. Bournemouth came out after the break with the same attacking intentions as the first, with Tommy Elphick having a close-range header saved almost immediately after the restart. Arter doubled the Cherries' lead in the 48th minute, with his fine curling left-footed effort going in off the inside of the left post. Brett Pitman celebrates after netting a penalty for Bournemouth's third goal in the win over Middlesbrough . Bamford felt he should have had a penalty in the 58th minute after being pulled in the box by Steve Cook, but referee Anthony Taylor disagreed. Middlesbrough thought they had got a goal back in the 68th minute, but Bamford's header was disallowed as he came from an offside position. Bournemouth won their second penalty of the game in the 74th minute as the lively Arter surged forward into the Middlesbrough box before being pushed in the back by Albert Adomah. Pitman fired past Konstantopoulos to make it 3-0 and seal a priceless win. Bamford had the chance to get a consolation goal for Middlesbrough with four minutes to go, but his free-kick went just over the bar.","Bournemouth overtook Middlesbrough with a 2-0 win at Dean Court .

"Luis Suarez admits he had never even dreamed of playing in an El Clasico match before he sealed a move to Barcelona. But now, the 28-year-old, who arrived in Spain following a £75million move from Liverpool, is preparing for his first El Clasico at the Nou Camp. It's a game that could shape the La Liga title race this season and Suarez, who made his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid earlier in the season, is nothing but excited. Suarez revealed in an interview with Barca TV: 'I never imagined playing in El Clasico. I used to watch the games and look at photos and I used to say how incredible to play in it was. 'Now it's time to enjoy it and make the most of the moment. I was at the 5-0 game and the 1-1 draw in the Champions League (2010/2011). As a fan you enjoy it a lot.' Speaking about making his debut in Spanish football's biggest game, Suarez said: 'I was focused on my nervousness about coming back to play. Lionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar Jnr have netted 55 La Liga goals between them this season . 'Aside from it being El Clasico, it was important for me. I didn't enjoy it as you should enjoy El Clasico, let's hope I can do it this time.' Suarez has become an important part of a three-pronged attack at Barcelona since his arrival and has played some of the best form of his career. However, the Uruguayan striker remains self-critical and is only concentrating on being happy on the pitch and helping the squad. Suarez attempts to score past Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart during a Champions League clash . Suarez said: 'I don't know if this is my best moment of form. I do know that I am happy, I feel like I am helping the team and that allows me to be relaxed. 'It isn't difficult to have an understanding with players of Barcelona's quality. 'But we have to continue in that vein, showing that we want to help the team and that nobody wants to steal the limelight, only to achieve big things.'

"Adorning a large section of a wall in the gym beneath Twickenham’s West Stand is a picture of the England team smiling for the cameras and showing off the Triple Crown. It was taken last year and the expressions worn by captain Chris Robshaw and his colleagues convey a genuine sense of pride. That silver shield has eluded the national team this year, following defeat in Dublin, but it is not the precious metal they covet anyway. On head coach Stuart Lancaster’s watch, the trophy cabinet has been kept stocked. In the course of three years, in addition to the Triple Crown, England have lifted the Calcutta Cup (annually), the Millennium Trophy, the Cook Cup and the Hillary Shield. The latter prize, for beating New Zealand in December, 2012, was received with special relish. Luther Burrell sets off on a run during training as England prepare to face France . But what the coaches and players really crave is a cup that conveys meaningful achievement, and at last that is within their grasp. Robshaw summed up the mood: ‘As a player you want to be picking up silverware. We've collected the odd bit here and there, but to pick up the main trophy would be great.’ The ‘main trophy’, newly commissioned, for winning the RBS 6 Nations is England’s for the taking. Success would also end a generation of under-achievement. It is staggering that the world’s wealthiest rugby country has had so little to show for so much effort and investment in the modern era. England won three of the first four RBS 6 Nations titles (2000, 2001, 2003) but since then have finished top just once in 11 seasons. So near, but so far has been the story of many English campaigns, not least under the current regime. Three times Lancaster’s men have finished runners-up, with four wins out of five. Wales (twice), and France have derailed the Sweet Chariot on its route to a Grand Slam. Everyone in the Red Rose camp has grown weary of the perennial talk about the need for ‘tangible’ reward, to use lock Geoff Parling’s apt phrase. Defeat by Ireland shattered the latest quest for a clean sweep to propel the host nation into their World Cup, but England are still in prime position in terms of the three-way title tussle. This year, four wins from five should be sufficient to clinch the trophy, which will be at Twickenham in anticipation of a coronation at about 7pm. There is a replica at Murrayfield, just in case Ireland run amok and beat Scotland with room to spare and leave England chasing a points-difference tally that proves beyond them. Meanwhile, in Rome, Wales will expect to benefit from the enforced absence of Italy captain Sergio Parisse but they would require French and Scottish resistance on an epic scale to take the title. The made-for-TV staggered schedule affords Lancaster’s side the luxury of a precise target but that could be a blessing or a curse. Being aware of the bigger picture could be a distraction for some England players, hence the coaches’ desire to burden only a select few with the main decision-making responsibilities. It will be up to Robshaw and his half-backs, Ben Youngs and George Ford, to set a patient tone once what is needed has been explained to the whole squad before their pre-match warm-up. The remarkable maturity of England No 10 Ford, at just 22, should be a telling asset on a day when the challenge is equal parts mental and physical. England's players look on in disbelief as Ireland clinch the 2014 Six Nations title by beating France . George Ford has shown a huge amount of maturity for some one who is just 22 . Philippe Saint-Andre’s France team do not boast glorious form, far from it, despite the emphatic 29-0 victory over Italy in Rome last weekend. Crucially, that game took place 24 hours after England beat Scotland and since then Les Bleus have had to fly home, patch themselves up and catch the Eurostar to London, while also dealing with the distraction of a club v country row over fly-half Camille Lopez. What the visitors will bring is physical presence. The French are massive but this English pack has dealt with all-comers in recent times, and the graduated return of Courtney Lawes and Parling in the second row should add dynamism and line-out nous to the mix. Nick Easter could have a big role to play coming off the bench for England . Courtney Lawes should add dynamism to England's back row . Behind the packs, England are more settled and threatening. Jonathan Joseph’s match-up with Gael Fickou will be intriguing, but only if the French threequarters are let off the leash. Ford can make holes in the Gallic defence but England cannot afford to be as wasteful as they were in beating Scotland. Replacements could also have a big say and England will look to the likes of Tom Youngs and Nick Easter to generate momentum, Tom Wood to provide physicality and leadership, and Richard Wigglesworth to make an impact with his astute kicking game. Whether or not Danny Cipriani and Billy Twelvetrees play a part in a points chase, time will tell. Amid the maelstrom, the primary demand from Lancaster will be for cool English heads. Robshaw should have plenty of leadership support, from Parling and a raft of club captains in the ranks: Joe Marler and Dylan Hartley, James Haskell and Ben Youngs. There may be several rookies in white, but there are also enough established players. Together, they can ensure that the plot is not lost and that the ‘main trophy’ is won.","England will know what they need to do to win the title when they kick off .
The agony of missing out on the title last year will be in the memories .
England are best placed to win the Six Nations title if they beat France ."
"Crystal Palace match-winner Wilfried Zaha was all smiles as Stoke City blamed referee Andre Marriner for losing a hard contest compared to rugby Six Nations by victorious manager Alan Pardew. Zaha, who has been ordered by manager Alan Pardew to cut out his 'little sulks' after an inconsistent season, completed Palace's first top-flight victory at Stoke since 1979 with the winner on the stroke of half-time. It completed a comeback victory for the visitors but Stoke will felt badly let down by two key decisions having taken an early lead through  Mame Biram Diouf. Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (far right) celebrates with Glenn Murray after scoring against Stoke City . Zaha beat Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to the ball to put Crystal Palace in the lead just before the interval .

First, Asmir Begovic was harshly adjudged to have brought down Yannick Bolasie as Glenn Murray levelled from the spot after 41 minutes. Then, as Stoke chased an equaliser in the second half, Joel Ward got away with blocking Diouf's sot with his arms. Zaha, left out of Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 squad this week, earned a standing ovation from the noisy Palace fans when he was replaced late on. They are now 11 points above the bottom three and assured of another season in the Premier League. Pardew, whose side are now above his old club Newcastle in the table, said: 'Wilf had a hard game. The Stoke left back Erik Pieters is a player I tried to sign, he is aggressive and Wilf struggled at times. But he still managed to have his moments. 'The whole game was a physical but fair. It was almost like a Six Nations game at times in terms of its toughness.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes was justifiably angry at the two key decisions that went against his side. 'When you see the replay for their penalty, the lad Bolasie has got his foot up high above Asmir, that is why Asmir missed the ball. But the referee deemed it a penalty. It was a key moment and Andre Marriner missed a lot of things. 'The handball (by Ward) was arguably the best save of the match, he has got two hands on it for heavens sake. How that isn't given, I don't know.' Stoke goalkeeper Begovic was adjudged to have fouled Yannick Bolasie during a colision inside the penalty area . Begovic was shown a yellow card by referee Andre Marriner after he was adjudged to have brought down Bolasie . Murray scored from the penalty spot to put Crystal Palace back on level terms following Mame Biram Diouf's opener . Murray, pictured with James McArthur, celebrates his side's equaliser after scoring past Begovic from 12 yards . Pardew's last visit to the Britannia in September with Newcastle United had ended in defeat and calls for his head. He had an inauspicious start again when Charlie Adam's 14th minute free-kick ran through a disorganised Palace defence to  Diouf who scored from close range. The Londoners have won 18 points from losing positions – a Premier League best – and they did it again. The early signs weren't good when Zaha, ordered to smile more by Pardew, shoved Geoff Cameron after a strong challenge from the American and was booked. But spirits changed when the equaliser arrived. Bolasie chased a long pass from James McArthur and crashed into Begovic. Stoke were furious the goalkeeper was penalised but Murray ignored the fuss by smashing the spot-kick into the roof of the net. Improbably, Palace then went ahead when Murray flicked on Speroni's clearance and Zaha accelerated past two defenders to shoot past Begovic. His smile must have looked more than a million dollars to chairman Steve Parish as it effectively guaranteed Premier League survival. Speroni made great saves from Diouf, with his face, and the excellent Adam as Stoke chased an equaliser. And Diouf reacted furiously when his shot was blocked illegally by Ward.

"Former Barcelona manager Gerrardo Martino believes Lionel Messi is a dream player to work with because he can play in almost any attacking position. Messi famously played in the 'false nine' spot for four years at Barcelona when Pep Guardiola, who now manages Bayern Munich, was in control of the Catalan club. The Argentinian has taken up the No 10 role under manager Luis Enrique on occasions this season, but has also been deployed in wider roles to form a three-pronged attack with Luis Suarez and Neymar. Lionel Messi weighs up his options with Barcelona teammate Neymar during the game with Manchester City . Messi celebrates after scoring during the La Liga match between Eibar and Barcelona at the Ipurua stadium . Martino, who is a coach for Argentina, knows all about the 27-year-old having worked with both on the international and domestic scene and admits Messi is effective in almost every attacking role. 'For a long time we haven't seen him be as absolutely crucial as he was against Manchester City on Wednesday,' the coach told Mundo Deportivo. 'He can play on the right, left, as a No.9, behind the striker, or even as a No.4! He is able to make the difference anywhere on the pitch.' Messi looks to take on Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart during their Champions League clash . Messi reels away in celebration having scored against Villarreal in the Copa del Rey semi-final . Martino also admitted it is often best to give him as much freedom in his role as possible, he said: 'Sometimes, it is logical that by analysing a player one thinks it is better to play him in one place or another, but then, if he is good, you can be more flexible.

"The new Rangers regime have suspended Derek Llambias, Barry Leach and Sandy Easdale from the club’s football board pending an investigation. The move against the last remnants of the old order at Ibrox came four days after Dave King and his allies swept to power with an emphatic EGM victory. That shareholder vote saw chief executive Llambias and finance director Leach – associates of Mike Ashley - removed from the PLC board. Sandy Easdale was not a PLC director but had been chairman of the football board. It’s understood all three are no longer welcome to visit Ibrox. Chief executive Derek Llambias (left) has been suspended by Rangers 'pending an investigation' Details of the investigation under way have not been disclosed, but King pledged last Friday to take a thorough look into how the business had previously been run and to examine contracts already in place. Leach was last month criticised after a disparaging remark about the Three Bears consortium – who made a rival funding offer to Ashley’s £10million loan - appeared in leaked minutes of a meeting with the Rangers Fans Board. The consortium then called for Leach to ‘become subject to his employers disciplinary processes and ultimately dismissed for gross misconduct’, adding that ‘it is our view that he has brought the club into disrepute’. A statement from Rangers yesterday confirmed the suspensions and the new make-up of the football board. Dave King's new era post-Mike Ashley (left) has started with direct action to the board of directors . ‘Rangers Football Club announce today that Derek Llambias, Barry Leach and Sandy Easdale have been suspended from their duties pending an investigation,’ it said. ‘It is also noted that Mr Llambias and Mr Leach, along with Sandy Easdale, have been advised that a resolution to remove them as directors of the Company has been received by the Company. A meeting may be required for this purpose but it is hoped that this will not prove necessary. ‘Acting Chairman Paul Murray, fellow directors Douglas Park and John Gilligan, and the Club’s Head of Football Administration Andrew Dickson have been appointed to the Board of the Company.’ In response, Easdale’s spokesman insisted they were ‘surprised’ at the announcement, adding: ‘We also note that they talk about an investigation. Sandy Easdale welcomes that as he has absolutely nothing to fear.’ The development came as Rangers beefed up their new-look PLC board, with the appointment of London-based financial businessman John Bennett – once a member of the Blue Knights consortium - and Rangers Supporters Trust spokesman Chris Graham as non-executive directors. Solicitor James Blair – of Rangers First - has also been announced as company secretary to further recognise the work done by the two main fan ownership groups. Kyle Hutton (right) challenges for the ball during Rangers' disappointing 0-0 draw at Cowdenbeath . Bennett and Graham join Murray, Gilligan and Park on the PLC board. King has delayed his own appointment but intends to become chairman subject to gaining ‘fit-and-proper’ approval from both the financial authorities and the SFA. Sandy Easdale’s brother James was previously a PLC director but resigned along with chairman David Somers prior to last week’s EGM. Llambias and Leach still have executive contracts with Rangers and were viewed by King and his allies as being Ashley’s representatives on the board. The Newcastle United owner - fined £7,500 by the SFA earlier this month for breaching ‘dual interest’ rules – retains a grip on the Ibrox club’s retail operations via his Sports Direct firm.","Dave King was voted on to the Rangers board on Friday .

"Sixty three seconds was all it took. Just over one minute was enough for a game to be turned on its head and for refereeing standards to be demonstrated, once again, to be lamentable. To deal with the first part of that conundrum, referee Neil Swarbrick can’t really be blamed for the game ending as a spectacle before it had even got going. Gareth McAuley and Craig Dawson got themselves in a terrible tangle, the former with a sloppy pass and the latter clumsily challenging Wilfried Bony, who was through on goal. The red card was justifiable and the challenge was a bone-headedly stupid one to make in the first minute. The real drama occurred thereafter, however. Bony, to his credit, attempted to go on and score. McAuley, attempting to redeem his error, ran round to challenge the Ivorian and make a good challenge to block him.

Click here for our match zone service . In the midst of all that, Swarbrick blew up for a foul from where Dawson had made the initial challenge. But instead of sending off the left back he dismissed McAuley. In one year the Premier League has now seen three cases of the wrong man being sent off. Either referees are getting worse, or the game is getting immeasurably faster. And with rugby’s Six Nations tournament reaching a climax yesterday, you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card – he would have probably concurred – and then ensure the right man is sent off. Tony Pulis naturally agreed with that, arguing managers should have the ability to challenge two decisions in a match, citing the fact that in other games Dawson’s challenge might have gone unpunished. ‘The inconsistency is one thing,’ he said. ‘But once he decides it’s a goal-scoring opportunity and he has to send him of I can’t believe he’s picked the wrong player. It’s beyond me. Pellegrini’s assessment was about correct. ‘He made a mistake about the player but I think the rule is very clear,’ he said. ‘The chance was very clear and he was the last man. Then it doesn’t depend on the referee – he has to do what the rule says.’ Naturally the match felt unnaturally uncompetitive thereafter and that seemed to be reflected in the crowd. The atmosphere at City after a week of defeats to Burnley and Barcelona was as muted as could be. Technically they are still in the title race; in fact they are only three points behind, albeit Chelsea have two games in hand. But judging from the mood at The Etihad yesterday, that is merely a theoretical, abstract concept. All belief seems to have been sucked out of the club, meaning that all that is left is a top-four finish to oversee before Pellegrini is thanked for his time and his two trophies. Wilfried Bony celebrates after scoring Manchester City's first goal after 25 minutes at the Etihad Stadium . The Ivorian striker opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box, hooked the ball over and fired into the net .

The Brazilian pounced from close range following Baggies defensive confusion, with goalkeeper Boaz Myhill grounded . David Silva (centre) is congratulated after scoring City's third goal to make absolutely sure of the three points . Silva raises his arms in celebration after touching in a shot by Stevan Jovetic from the edge of the penalty box . There was a brief spell in which you wondered if Pellegrini’s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten-man West Brom. But the visitors, Boaz Myhill aside, weren’t in the mood for gritty defiance. Indeed, it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains. The first two goals they conceded, which made their task hopeless both came from corners, situations at which they should be able to defend more easily than from open play. But for the first goal on 26 minutes, City worked the ball well from a short corner to Wilfried Bony. Craig Gardner attempted a half hearted challenge but Bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down; the unfortunate Dawson was also culpable, not reacting quick enough as the Ivorian controlled, shot and scored his first goal for the club since his £28m move. West Brom might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes – though it too involved some dreadful defending. Jesus Navas corner was met by the high, flying foot of Eliaquim Managala and it seemed perilously close to Stephane Sessegnon’s head. That said, from thereon in, West Brom hardly covered themselves in glory. Jonas Olsson sliced the ball gently into the path of Fernando and James Morrison failed to react as the Brazilian simply poked the ball into the net. Joe Hart collides with West Brom defender Jonas Olsson as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear . Joleon Lescott leaps in behind Pablo Zabaleta but sends the ball over Joe Hart's goal following a rare West Brom attack . Saido Berahino somehow hit the crossbar with this header, with Joe Hart nowhere near it . ‘I think our fans believe we can do it,’ said Pellegrini. ‘The important thing is to demonstrate playing the way we did today that we will try. That is very important.’ That they did, with 46 shots on goal. But it’s not enough to sustain credibility at present.

Frank Lampard rues a missed opportunity as City attempted to boost their goal difference - settling for three in the end . Man City striker Stevan Jovetic appeals to referee Swarbrick for a handball decision . Were it not for Myhill the afternoon would have been even more calamitous. His most notable saves came from David Silva on 23 minutes, 54 minutes and 59 minutes but that was by no means an exhaustive list. West Brom were also saved on 58 minutes by the post when Sergio Aguero struck and then again by the woodwork, when Bony chipped the rebound on to the cross bar. On 73 minutes there was an extraordinary development; a West Brom corner, which was flicked on by Olsson to Berahino, who, just two yards out, flicked an instinctive header on to the bar. The miss summed up a dismal afternoon. Shortly afterwards, Silva, by far the best player on the pitch, confirmed the inevitable. Stevan Jovetic combined well with the rampaging Gael Clichy and the Montenegrin’s shot was turned in at close range by Silva, who departed shortly after to a standing ovation. Still, the overwhelming feeling from both sides was of a season gently winding down rather than reaching a dramatic climax.

"Well, they want continuity and stability at Sunderland. It was perhaps fitting, then, that Dick Advocaat marked his first game in charge with a defeat, a fourth in six matches to leave the Black Cats perilously perched one point above the drop zone. Not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer Adam Johnson – on as a second-half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl – could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015. Gus Poyet paid for that run with his job this week, but Advocaat must repair those ruins if his own CV is not to be stained with a first relegation in 28 years in the dugout. Diafra Sakho scored a late winner to earn West Ham all three points against Sunderland in the Premier League encounter . Sakho struck from a tight angle in the 88th minute to earn his West Ham side all three points against Sunderland .

Stewart Downing and James Collins celebrate a hard-fought victory for West Ham at Upton Park on Saturday evening . Indeed, the Dutchman suggested on Friday that he was ‘relegation proof’. Let’s hope he is also immune to criticism, for without wins the honeymoon period will expire far quicker than his nine-game contract. Advocaat, though, might have celebrated victory on his Premier League bow had former Hammer Jermain Defoe not spurned a first-half sitter. The home fans were jeering him before that miss. Their cheers were laced with irony by the time he was substituted on 88 minutes after a dire display. Within 30 seconds of his exit Diafra Sakho was showing Defoe how to locate the back of the net as he smashed an uncompromising winner. It would have made for painful viewing for Defoe and Advocaat, especially as there was a strong suspicion of a foul on Seb Larsson seconds before Sakho hammered his 12th of the season to lift Sam Allardyce’s side to ninth. West Ham: Adrian 6.5, Jenkinson 6, Collins 6, Kouyate 6, Cresswell 6.5, Song 6.5, Noble 6, Downing 5.5, Nolan 6 (Nene 80), Jarvis 5 (Cole 46, 6), Sakho (O'Brien 90).

Adam Johnson made a return to the Sunderland first-team squad as he took up a place on the bench . Johnson came off the bench in the 73rd minute in place of Steven Fletcher after the club lifted his suspension . And Advocaat said: ‘The luck was not on our side. Everybody saw it (the foul) and not the referee, but I do not want to complain. ‘I can take confidence from that performance. If Defoe scores they have to take more risks and we would have got more space. It was a chance and a player of his quality should at least hit the target. ‘But I did not expect the goal from West Ham because everything was under control.’ Allardyce agreed with his opposite number. ‘It was probably a foul but it’s about time something went for us,’ he said. ‘In the end it was a devastating decision for Sunderland because we scored on the back of it. ‘But I thought we deserved to win. We’re heading for the best points total we’ve had since we’ve been back in the Premier League. You can’t ask for more than that.’ For Advocaat, this is no time for hard-luck stories and the 67-year-old needs to draw on his experience – even though none of it is in the English top-flight – to avoid the ignominy of a first demotion. He did answer one career-long criticism with his first team selection, three strikers in the starting XI a rebuttal to those who suggested the defensive-minded coach would try to spoil his way to survival. Dick Advocaat was an animated figure on the touchline in his first match in charge of the Black Cats . Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe takes on West Ham's Cheikhou Kouyate on his return to Upton Park . Sunderland's Jack Rodwell holds off the challenge from West Ham United midfielder Alex Song . West Ham midfielder Mark Noble turns away from Sunderland's Jordi Gomez and looks for a pass . Two of those frontmen combined in the seventh minute to carve the game’s first opening. Defoe scampered down the right wing before locating Connor Wickham who, 18 yards out, controlled eloquently on his chest before smashing a volley down the throat of Adrian, the Spaniard fisting to safety. Steven Fletcher – the third of Advocaat’s attacking trio – then sprung Defoe clear with a headed flick but the former resident failed to silence the locals as he spooned woefully wide. Advocaat wore a pained expression at the passing of what was the sort of chance Defoe would have dispatched in his pomp. And he would have looked even more horrified had Sakho’s header – from Aaron Cresswell’s whipped centre – bounced inside the post rather than inches wide with Costel Pantilimon beaten. It had not taken long for Advocaat to vacate his dugout earlier in the half and the Little General spent the bulk of the opening period barking orders from the touchline. He had promised to run on the pitch and reprimand any players who did not adhere to his instruction, and Jack Rodwell was very nearly the first to incur his wrath when one pass was jettisoned straight out of play. And he might have been tempted to bolt on and drag Defoe from the action within minutes of the second half when a promising attack broke down following a feeble back-heel from the forlorn frontman. Johnson eventually emerged to warm up just after the hour mark and was predictably the subject of taunts. Sunderland defender Wes Brown had his match cut short early as he was forced off injured . Brown hobbled off in the 12th minute and was replaced by Santiago Vergini at Upton Park in the Premier League clash . Sunderland forward Jordi Gomez evades a challenge from West Ham's Cameroon midfielder Song . But the home fans soon forgot about his presence amid the injustice of the refereeing error which cost them a penalty and a certain red card for Santiago Vergini. Carl Jenkinson loaded a deadball forward from his own half and John O’Shea inadvertently flicked on to Kevin Nolan, lurking in the six-yard area. The Hammers skipper, however, was denied a strike on goal by Vergini’s man-handling act but the flag was up for offside, the assistant having mistaken O’Shea’s head for that of a home player. But West Ham did enjoy a spot of good fortune seconds before Sakho’s winner when Larsson was flattened by Nene. It was Advocaat, however, who was left feeling flat.","Diafra Sakho scores late winner as West Ham win for the first time since January 18 .

"Les Ferdinand believes English football remains inherently racist, claiming John Terry was only saying what most people in the game think when he racially abused Ferdinand’s cousin, Anton, in 2011. Speaking to Sir Trevor Phillips as part of a Channel 4 documentary on race to be screened on Thursday, QPR’s director of football also claimed the fact that he has only once been offered a route into football management since retiring as a player did not reflect well on the game in this country either. But his views on the Terry controversy, which led to the Chelsea skipper being stripped of the England captaincy, banned for four matches and fined £220,000, are most damning. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand says that he believes English football remains inherently racist . Ferdinand claimed John Terry was  saying what most people in the game think in his racial abuse incident . Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’, even though the FA charged Terry with using ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour’ which ‘included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand’ less than a fortnight after Terry was acquitted in court. Asked by Phillips for his view on the Terry incident, Ferdinand said: ‘I suppose it was disbelief really, that the England captain would use language like that on a football field, or anywhere in fact.’ But it is when Phillips then asked Ferdinand for his view on ‘how the game handled it’ that the former England striker put the situation into a wider context. Terry and Anton Ferdinand clashed during QPR's win over Chelsea in 2012 and Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, fined £220,000 and given a four-match ban after being charged by the FA . Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’ and that it could have been put to bed quicker . Weeks before the FA charge, Terry had been cleared of racial abuse at Westminster Magistrates' Court . ‘Terribly,’ he responded. ‘I think it’s a situation that could have been put to bed quite quickly. ‘And when you look at the game and the disproportion of black coaches in the game, maybe they’re not actually saying what John Terry said, but are they thinking it? Because I have to believe that.’ Phillips then asked Ferdinand how many times, in the 10 years since he stopped playing, he had been offered the opportunity to become a first-team coach. The QPR director of football says he has only been offered one first-team coaching job in 10 years . Ferdinand says he knows black players who would like to go into management but don't get opportunities . ‘Once,’ said Ferdinand. ‘Yeah once, when I came out of football I spoke to the then chairman of Bournemouth. ‘I know lots of players that I play with who’d love to go into coaching and management and they’ve done all the badges, but they just won’t get an opportunity. ‘We’ve been talking about this for 15 years now; the only difference is the venues seem to be getting better. When I first started doing it, it was in a little classroom, then we moved onto a hotel room, and now we’re at Parliament but the outcome’s still the same because we’ve not moved on.’ THINGS WE WON’T SAY ABOUT RACE THAT ARE TRUE, CHANNEL 4, THURSDAY, 9PM .","Les Ferdinand believes English football continues to be inherently racist .

"Moses Odubajo hit a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Millwall a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation from the Sky Bet Championship. The Lions looked set to collect their first win in nine attempts - and their first under interim boss Neil Harris - as they led 2-0 through goals in each half from Lee Gregory and Aiden O'Brien. But Brentford, also desperate for points at the other end of the table to maintain their promotion bid, pulled one back through Alex Pritchard's penalty before Odubajo snatched a 2-2 draw at the death. Moses Odubajo celebreates as he hits a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Millwall a precious three points . Millwall, looking revitalised since former striker Harris took over from Ian Holloway earlier this month, threatened first after just two minutes when Ed Upson found Martyn Woolford, whose shot from the edge of the box was parried by David Button. Brentford almost went ahead after 15 minutes through a glancing header from Spanish midfielder Jota, but the ball cannoned back off the crossbar. And in the 28th minute Millwall got their noses in front when Gregory latched on to Upson's long ball over the top, rounded Button and fired into an empty net from 15 yards. It was the former Halifax striker's sixth goal of the season and, tellingly, only Millwall's 14th away from home during a troubled campaign. Brentford: . Button Odubajo Dean (Smith - 71') Tarkowski Bidwell Douglas Peleteiro Ramallo Pritchard Diagouraga (Toral - 71') Dallas (Judge - 60') Gray . Substitutes: Craig McCormack Bonham Toral Judge Smith Long . Millwall: . Forde, Cummings, Nelson, Hooiveld, Harding, O'Brien (Taylor-Fletcher - 77) Williams, Abdou, Upson, Woolford, Gregory . Substitutes: Fabbrini Beevers Gueye Archer Taylor-Fletcher Maierhofer Philpot . Brentford poured forward in search of an equaliser before half-time but found Lions keeper David Forde in inspired form, the Irishman tipping a Stuart Dallas curler over the top, blocking a header from Jonathan Douglas and turning Pritchard's free-kick around the post. Brentford continued in the same vein after the interval but Andre Gray fired over and Sid Nelson bravely blocked Jota's shot. And the Bees were hit by a sucker punch midway through the second half when O'Brien played the ball out to Woolford, continued his run forward and nodded the winger's lofted cross into an empty net from a yard out for his first senior goal. But Brentford were offered a lifeline with six minutes remaining when Woolford tripped Alan Judge in the area and Pritchard rifled home the penalty. And in the first minute of injury time, with Millwall pegged back in their own penalty area, right-back Odubajo fired through a crowd of players to snatch a dramatic equaliser. There was still time for substitute Gary Taylor-Fletcher to win it for Millwall, but the striker's shot flew agonisingly wide to leave the Lions players with their heads in their hands.","Struggling Millwall let a two-goal lead slip as they were held by Brentford .

Premier League sides have won only five of the 28 European trophies possible since the turn of the millennium and the manager believes the punishing nature of the domestic competition is taking its toll. ‘Our British competition demands every game to be 100 per cent,’ said Martinez. ‘Teams that play in other leagues in Europe, they cruise through games and get through at 50 per cent. It is unfair on British teams. ‘A break in the winter would enable the players to regenerate and refresh — a key period in the season is February and March so I think the biggest teams are a little bit unfairly treated. The answer is clear — you need to have a bigger squad at this level where you can make five or six changes to keep the team performing at the same level. With the pitch covered up, Everton players are made to train on the running track that surrounds it . A cold night in Kiev awaits Everton as they look to protect their 2-1 lead from the first leg . Martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both Everton and Dynamo Kiev . ‘I find playing Thursday and Sunday is tough. The Europa League teams should play at least at 4pm, and also be given as many home games as possible after they have been away. We should protect our teams a bit more, otherwise we shoot ourselves in the foot.’ Progress in Kiev will not be straightforward. Everton were unable to train on the Olympic Stadium pitch last night as it was covered in huge white tarpaulins and had heat lamps ready to repair a surface reported to be rain-sodden. Martinez, however, is not going to use the pitch as an excuse, as he is far more anxious about the threat Dynamo pose. Sergei Rebrov’s side have not lost at home this season but Everton will not be cautious in their approach.

We want to show everyone what we can do.’ There is little doubt the 2-1 first-leg win against Dynamo, followed by a 3-0 dismantling of Newcastle, has improved the atmosphere in the squad and helped restore confidence. ‘It was brilliant to get those two results back to back,’ said Everton defender Seamus Coleman. ‘We haven’t been happy with our league form but it is turning. ‘We played ever so hard to get into this competition. Our goal at the start was to win it. It has been a long time since the club won anything and it would be nice if we could change that.’","Roberto Martinez is concerned about the quality of Dynamo Kiev's pitch .

"A 94th-minute goal by substitute Martyn Waghorn rescued a Sky Bet Championship point for Wigan Athletic in a 1-1 draw at home to Bolton, who looked as though they were going to pull off the classic smash-and-grab. The home side had dominated for the vast majority of the contest, only to fall behind 20 minutes from time when Tom Walker's shot was deflected past a helpless Ali Al Habsi for the opener. It was a crushing blow for a Wigan side that had hit the bar in the first half through James Perch, had a Leon Clarke goal chalked off for offside and seen Marc-Antoine Fortune fluff a relatively straight-forward heading chance. A 94th-minute goal by substitute Martyn Waghorn rescued a point for Wigan Athletic against Bolton . But they stuck to their task in the second period, and after Ben Amos had denied Jermaine Pennant with a stunning stop, the goalkeeper then tipped a Clarke header on to the bar as well as clawing away a Sheyi Ojo effort. It looked like time would run out on Wigan, but in the fourth of five added minutes, Waghorn equalised with a goal that could yet save their season. Wigan had started the game on the front foot, with Bolton content to play on the break. And the visitors showed their threat inside the early exchanges when Adam Le Fondre led a breakaway only for Gaetan Bong to save the day in the nick of time. Wigan were getting the ball wide at every opportunity to wingers Josh Murphy - making his full debut - and Pennant. But it was through the middle that they nearly broke the deadlock, with Perch's 30-yard effort beating Amos only to hit the bar and come back out. The ball fell invitingly for Clarke, but the striker's header was weak and straight at Amos. Wigan XI: Al Habsi, Boyce (Kvist - 78), Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Pennant (Ojo - 67), Kim, Perch, Murphy, Fortune (Waghorn - 78), Clarke . Subs not used: Carson, Taylor, McKay, Cowie . Goals: Waghorn 90 . Booked: Maguire . Bolton XI: Amos, Mills, McCarthy, Ream, Feeney, Trotter, Bannan, Rocha (Vela - 55), Walker (Moxey - 82), Le Fondre (Davies - 68), Heskey . Subs not used: Bogdan, Dervite, Gudjohnsen, Twardzik . Goals: Walker 70 . Booked: Davies . At the other end, Walker could not make the most of Liam Feeney's cross, and the same player was unable to make amends moments later when he fired past the post. Former Wigan man Emile Heskey had a great opportunity to open the scoring on the half-hour mark but his free header from a corner flashed past the upright. Latics ended the half on a high and should have taken the lead when Murphy's pinpoint cross found Fortune, whose header from point-blank was straight at Amos when either side would surely have brought about the opening goal. Wigan did have the ball in the net right on half-time through Clarke, but the striker looked well offside and the flag was up on the far side. The home side picked up where they left off after the restart, and a Pennant free-kick bound for the top corner was superbly clawed out by Amos. Pennant then had time and space in the box to pick his spot on the edge of the area, but his shot hit Clarke and was hacked away to safety. The visitors won a couple of corners but they were virtually non-existent as an attacking force, with Wigan asking all the questions. But with 20 minutes to go, the unthinkable happened and Wanders took an undeserved lead in extremely fortuitous circumstances. Walker's shot from distance took a massive deflection off a defender, completely wrong-footing Al Habsi and rolling into the net to the delight of the packed away end behind the goal. Credit goes to Wigan for the way they stuck to their task, and Amos produced another fabulous stop to deny substitute Ojo before Clarke saw a header tipped on to the bar by the goalkeeper. It looked as though Bolton were going to hold on for all three points before, in the fourth added minute, Waghorn sent an overhead kick in off the bar to rescue a point for the hosts.","Thomas Walker fired Bolton into the lead with just 20 minutes left to play .
