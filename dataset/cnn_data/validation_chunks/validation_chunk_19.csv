"Perched atop Norway's snowy Seven Mountains sits the stunning Tubakuba cabin. But the off-the-grid property, made of glass and wood, isn't just known for it's sweeping views of the city of Bergen below. In order to reach the small architectural marvel, guests are required to crawl through its tunnel-like entryway, which remarkably resembles an otherworldly black hole. High above the city of Bergen in Norway sits the Tubakuba cabin, which boasts a very unusual, vortex-like entryway . Made up entirely of glass and wood, staying overnight in the cabin is free for families with young children . Designed as part of a workshop at the Bergen School of Architecture, OPA Form Architect, Espen Folgero was the mastermind behind the striking cabin. It's name is inspired by the tuba, thanks in large part to its curved entryway that opens like a vortex to the woods outside. The interior is made of plywood, while the exterior is crafted from burnt larch that has been treated with a traditional Japanese method called Shou Sugi Ban to prevent fungal decay. It's the portal-like entrance that's really something special, however, made up of curved shavings of pine and untreated larch, which will turn gray with time. The interior is made of plywood and has floor to ceiling windows along one side to allow guests to experience the breathtaking views . There is no electricity and the cabin's amenities are basic with only a wooden stove, bare wooden platforms and lofted sleeping space . To reach the inside of the 14-square-metre cabin, everyone must crawl through the house's 'black hole' tunnel entrance . Best of all, for families with young children, it's free to stay overnight in the playful space. The 14-square-metre cabin offers basic amenities, such as a wood stove, bare wooden platforms and a lofted sleeping area. There's no electricity, but the property is so small that it doesn't require much heating. And it's the view that guests truly stop by for: large windows overlooking the rocky mountainside give visitors the impression that they are 'floating' above the valley below. Every detail of the tunnel was considered, right down to the the use of untreated larch wood, which will turn grey with time . These drawings show exactly how the architecture students envisioned guests relaxing in the lofted sleeping spaces . Referred to as a 'wooden bubble,' the property has since been nominated for a European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture . Sketching was an important part of the students' learning process and helped them identify structural problems and solutions . The tuba-like tunnel is not just a way to reach the cabin's interior, it's also a play space in and of itself for children if the hut is closed . Speaking to Fast Company, architect Espen Folgero explained the concept behind the avant garde house. 'The entrance is shaped like a mouth of a tuba to experiment with wood as a material, to give children a place to play even if the hut is closed, and to force adults to crouch to get in, even if kids don't have to,' he said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Tubakuba has been nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture-Mies van de Rohe Award.","The off-the-grid property, made up entirely of glass and wood, sits high above the city of Bergen in Norway .

"Manchester City playmaker David Silva believes the Barclays Premier League champions have got to stop Barcelona scoring if they are to have any chance of pulling off a miracle at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night. Silva and his team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and head into the game having been written off by just about everybody. However, the Spanish international believes Manuel Pellegrini's team can progress if they manage to become only the fifth team — and the first in the competition — to stop Luis Enrique's team scoring. Manchester City playmaker David Silva believes they have to stop Barcelona scoring to have a chance . Silva and his City team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie . It is a task easier said than done to stop Barcelona, led by Lionel Messi, from scoring at home . Messi (centre) and co will have something to say about City's progress when the come to the Nou Camp . 'We need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against Roma and Bayern Munich in the group stages,' Silva said. 'The most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult. 'Strange things can happen. Everybody wrote Schalke off before they played Real Madrid but they won 4-3 and could have scored again which would have put them through. Nobody predicted that. 'Not many thought PSG could beat Chelsea, especially with only 10 men for so long, so I know that everything can happen, not only in the Champions League but in every game. 'Everyone is expecting Barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we don't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away.' Silva is preparing to face Barcelona with his City team-mates on Wednesday night at the Nou Camp . Silva feels City can progress if they can stop Barcelona from scoring against them in the last-16 tie . City travelled to Spain at this stage last season, having lost the home leg 2-0. This time they are slightly better off following Joe Hart's last-minute penalty save from Lionel Messi at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago. 'We played well in the second leg against Barca last season and played with freedom so we will see,' added Silva. Revered in Spain, where he played for first Celta Vigo and then Valencia, Silva has long been coveted by Barcelona and indeed Real Madrid. The 29-year-old has insisted, however, that he isn't thinking about a move away from City and has enjoyed playing further up the field under Manuel Pellegrini this season. 'I have played closer to the box in a more advanced position this season and that's why I'm scoring goals,' he said. Manuel Pellegrini will look to perform a miracle on Wednesday night against a powerful Barcelona side . 'It's more about the team than individuals. If we are good as a group we can make the difference. I always have freedom in the pitch but now we need all the players at their best if we are to go through . 'I have four more years on my contract and I'm very happy here — I have always said that. The way the supporters are with me is something I'm very proud of and it inspires me to play my best and I'm humbled to have that kind of appreciation every time I play.' City will train at their own base in Manchester on Tuesday morning before flying to Barcelona early in the afternoon.","Manchester City face Barcelona on Wednesday night at the Nou Camp .

"Kevin De Bruyne or Cesc Fabregas? Jose Mourinho knows who he'd choose. The Chelsea boss made a brave decision when he shipped the former off to Wolfsburg, basing the spine of his team on £30million man Fabregas. But could it have been the wrong choice? This season, De Bruyne has racked up more goals and more assists than Fabregas, while Mourinho's current midfield maestro searches desperately for his first goal since December. Kevin De Bruyne has scored more goals and assisted more than Cesc Fabregas has this season . Fabregas (centre) has not scored a goal for Chelsea since mid-December, while De Bruyne is impressing . De Bruyne is in the process of establishing himself as one of the biggest talents in the Bundesliga, helping Wolsburg cement their place in the top echelons of German football. Typically, the pair play in slightly different positions. Fabregas is more suited to a defensive midfield role, while De Bruyne roams further forward. Despite this, for £30m you would expect Fabregas to be firing on all cylinders, chipping in with more goals than he has been. De Bruyne was signed for just shy of £7m in 2012, but mostly consigned to a place on the Stamford Bridge bench, starting just two Premier League games in two years at the club. He was criminally underused in the league, especially if this season's stats hint at his ability. 19 assists to Fabregas' 18, 13 goals to Fabregas' four. Indeed, it is the goal count that is most worrying for Chelsea. De Bruyne was sold to Wolfsburg, and has scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga this season . For Chelsea, De Bruyne was only given two starting places in the Premier League in two years . Fabregas was stifled against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday . Was Jose Mourinho right to sell Kevin De Bruyne? Was Jose Mourinho right to sell Kevin De Bruyne? Now share your opinion . They have not been desperate for scorers, admittedly - Diego Costa and Eden Hazard have that covered - but their side could surely have been improved with the talents of the Belgian midfielder. At the start of the 2013/14 season, De Bruyne was given a fleeting chance to impress, before the door slammed shut on his Chelsea career. His final two starts in the Premier League. First up, Hull. As assist for Oscar, and an impressive performance that warranted praise from Gary Neville. 'The surprise of the season,' he was tipped as. Following that, he was entrusted with a place in the starting XI against Manchester United. 60 minutes, zero goals, zero assists. And from there, zero starts. His only further Premier League appearance came against Fulham a month later. Five minutes at the end, when the game was already won. He was shipped out on loan to Werder Bremen in January, where he impressed. Perhaps it was the change of surroundings, perhaps slightly easier opposition, but German rivals Wolfsburg later decided that his performances were enough to be worthy of £18m. He scored 10 goals in 33 appearances on loan in Germany, and has continued where he left off this season. A brace against Inter Milan on Thursday is his latest story of success. Wolfsburg are now in a commanding position in their Europa League last 16 tie, and that is mainly thanks to De Bruyne. When he wasn't scoring, he was setting them up, and he earned deserved praise from all corners. De Bruyne's European week was far more impressive, as he scored twice against Inter Milan . Jose Mourinho has impressed in charge at Chelsea, but may be ruing his decision to let De Bruyne go . Fabregas, on the other hand, could not do the same against Paris Saint-Germain. Another level of competition, yes, but it is worth considering whether De Bruyne would have been able to make an impact. Stifled by Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta, the Spain international was largely anonymous. There is no questioning Mourinho's eye for talent. He has produced them time and time again, but everyone makes mistakes. De Bruyne may not have impressed week in, week out in a Chelsea shirt, but he was only 20 years old when he joined. Three years later, he has matured into an impressive footballer. Still baby-faced, but far from it with the ball at his feet.

"Reading manager Steve Clarke is hoping to take over from Bradford City as FA Cup underdogs after seeing his side knock the League One outfit of the competition and set up a semi-final meeting with Arsenal. Following a drab goalless draw in the initial tie, Reading welcomed Bradford to the Madejski Stadium on Monday night and eased to a 3-0 victory against 10 men to reach just a second semi-final in the history of the club. Hal Robson-Kanu headed home in the sixth minute before a deflected Garath McCleary shot doubled their advantage shortly afterwards.

Filipe Morais was sent off for a high kick on Nathaniel Chalobah before Jamie Mackie thrashed home a third to send the Royals to Wembley. And now Clarke wants to replicate the cup giant-killing exploits of Bradford - who knocked out Chelsea and Sunderland on their way to the sixth round. 'You see tonight what it means to us,' he said of Reading's cup run. 'We go to the semi-final, a difficult game against Arsenal, but we go there with hope and belief that maybe we can continue the good work of Bradford. Bradford have been fantastic underdogs in this tournament this year and we look to pick up the baton now and do it in the semi-final.' Clarke made 11 changes to the side which slipped to a 4-1 defeat at Watford in the Championship on Saturday and believes he made the right decision to do so. The Bantams were reduced to 10-men after this high challenge from midfielder Filipe Morais (left) Referee Mike Jones brandishes a straight red card to Morais as Nathaniel Chalobah (right) looks from the turf . 'I am paid to do a job for the club and I have to do what is correct for the football club and I think I did that,' he added. 'I am pleased for the players - it has been a difficult season for them. It was very comfortable because we got off to a great start. From there we controlled the game very, very well and the third goal was the one that killed it. It was a very comfortable night.' Bradford boss Phil Parkinson, who was given a warm reception at the Madejski Stadium having enjoyed a distinguished 11-year playing career with Reading, felt the stuffing had been knocked out of his players following the hosts' lightning start. 'Reading were the better team on the night and we gave ourselves a mountain to climb,' he said. 'They played with a spring in their step after that and we found it difficult to respond. A two-goal lead after 10 minutes lifted the whole crowd and their players but we have got to be immensely proud. Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson felt the stuffing had been knocked out of his side following the hosts'  start . 'This is tough to take, we wanted to progress but we have got to quickly move on and reflect on this year's competition. 'When you have these cup runs as a lower-league side there is always a danger you will have an off-day. The lads were deflated on the pitch and I couldn't wait to get them into the dressing room at half-time to give them a lift.' Parkinson had no complaints about Morais' second-half red card and was quick to wish Clarke and his players good luck for the remainder of the competition. 'We wish them all the best in the semi-final against Arsenal,' he added. 'We have got 11 games to go, no-one else in our division has had the high-profile games we have had to contend with and the lads have kept going really well. Now we can focus on the league, we are going to have a good go.'","Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday .

"A former Michigan high school football coach was arrested Friday and faces multiple charges including sending explicit images to students as young as 13 years old. Louis Michael Rau, 46, faces 12 charges including seven counts of distributing sexually explicit matter to a minor; four counts of selling or furnishing alcohol to a minor; and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes -- which is a four-year felony, the Morning Sun reports. Rau resigned from his position at the Beal City High School in January after complaints from parents about the coach's alleged inappropriate conduct led to an investigation by the Isabella County Sheriff's Department. Multiple Charges: Louis Rau, 46 (photographed), was arrested Friday and faces multiple charges including sending explicit images to students as young as 13 years old . During the investigation, the department conducted several interviews and searched phones, tablets, cameras, computers, DVD's, text messages and emails, Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told MLive. The search found that Rau sent nude photos to five victims -- all student-athletes -- between 2011 and 2015, People reports. One of the victims was 13 when the ex-coach began sending him the sexually explicit photos, and all of the others were under 18 years old. Court records obtained by the Sun state that in addition to the photos, Rau gave the boys sex toys. Rau reportedly once gave an eighth grader a toy 'described as a vagina with a tube.' On four different occasions, the Sun reports, Rau purchased alcohol for three of the victims; court records note that both text messages and Rau's admission confirmed the purchases. Victims: The search found that Rau sent nude photos to five victims -- all student-athletes -- between 2011 and 2015 . Toys/Alcohol: Court records state that in addition to the photos, Rau also gave the boys sex toys and bought them alcohol . At Friday's arraignment, Rau's attorney, Dan O'Neill, described Rau as a 'home-grown boy' and noted that the 46-year-old had no criminal record, the Sun reports. He spoke of Rau's notoriety as 'the most celebrated football coach Beal City has ever had.' Rau's bail was set at $80,000, lowered from $120,000 which was set during the time of his arrest, the Sun reports. Upon his resignation, Rau, who also served as a substitute teacher at the school, was banned from school grounds except for school board meetings and public elections held at the school, MLive reports. As part of his bail conditions, Rau is not allowed in any school zones, not allowed to be in the presence of minors, not allowed to attend sporting events where minors or present, and is not allowed to contact the victims in any way, according to MLive. In 2006, Rau received a 14-day unpaid suspension for allegedly slapping a player at a football banquet.

"Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool have second place in their sights after they boosted their Champions League hopes in Swansea. Jordan Henderson’s freak goal in the 68th minute ended Swansea’s spirited resistance and put Liverpool within two points off Manchester United. The two biggest clubs in English football go head-to-head at Anfield this weekend and whoever wins will be favourites to finish in the top four. Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool have second place in their sights following the win against Swansea City . Jordan Henderson (pictured) scored with a deflected strike that was enough to seal victory for the away side . Rodgers, however, insists Liverpool should be aiming higher and feels Manchester City’s defeat at Burnley has opened the table up. Liverpool’s manager said: ‘The aim is to finish as high as we can. Everyone talks about fourth but it’s the same every year for me. ‘We do the best that we can do and the Manchester City result at the weekend gives us an opportunity to finish second so our mentality, the run and confidence we have at the moment we are just going to take that into every game and see where it takes us.’ This was Liverpool’s sixth consecutive away clean sheet in the league – they have not conceded on the road since losing at Old Trafford on December 14 – and defending provided the bedrock of this performance. They equalled a club record dating back to 1972. Liverpool were not at their best in the opening 45 minutes and needed some smart interventions from goalkeeper Simon Mignolet before Steven Gerrard came on as a second half substitute to provide some composure. Rodgers says Liverpool should be aiming higher and feels Manchester City’s defeat has opened the table up . Rodgers added: ‘What we did second half was run more without the ball and that notion for the team that you’ve got to move not just when you have the ball - you’ve got to run off it. ‘We talked at half-time about penetration and options for the guy in possession. But Steve came on and offered that calmness. We switched to a diamond in the second half and he came on and fitted into the bottom of that and his calmness and control was important to that. ‘You have to pay respect to the team as well .They’ve been playing well getting results and over the last 3 months we’ve been in great form but we have to pay attention. ‘He’d been out for a considerable period of time now but he is fit and you see how important he is when he came on.’ Liverpool are now just four points behind City, who struggled to a 1-0 defeat against Burnley on Saturday . Looking ahead to the showdown with United, Rodgers added: ‘We can now really look forward to that. We needed a result so to get the victory was a huge result. They are massive games, great games to be involved in. ‘Hopefully it will show the strides we have made since we played them a number of months back and for that I have to give immense credit to the team. We have put ourselves in a great position but there is still a lot of work to go and recover now and get ready for the weekend.’ Swansea boss Garry Monk feels Liverpool will make the top four but he insisted his side were unfortunate not to take something from the game. Rodgers' Liverpool side face the visit of Louis van Gaal's Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday . Monk said: ‘I think especially after the first half, we really controlled it, dominated it, and that’s the opportunity missed really. ‘We should have scored a goal, maybe a couple in the first half. Second half, we started to make the wrong decisions with the ball, and invited a little bit of pressure. ‘But for all that pressure, they didn’t have a lot of chances. Had it been a well-worked goal, you could have taken that a bit better. We definitely deserved something from the game.’ VIDEO Monk rues missed chances .","Liverpool are now targeting second place, claims Brendan Rodgers .

"This meeting is fast turning into a gala performance by the double act of Irish champion trainer Willie Mullins and his British counterpart Paul Nicholls. Having seen Mullins, ably assisted by stable jockeys Ruby Walsh and Paul Townend, smash the home team on Tuesday with four winners headed by his Champion Hurdler Faugheen, it was Nicholls’ turn on Wednesday. He won the feature £350,000 Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase with Dodging Bullets as well as the Coral Cup with Aux Ptits Soins, both ridden by stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies, and the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle with Qualando, the mount of Nick Scholfield. Dodging Bullets (front) delivered a second winner of day two for jockey Sam Twiston-Davies . With Mullins also landing the RSA Chase with Bryan Cooper-ridden Don Poli, the two dominant stables in jump racing have now won eight of the 14 Festival races run so far. Nicholls denied he had driven home on Tuesday depressed or frustrated having drawn a blank in the face of the Mullins’ mullering. But the mood for the journey home last night must have been some contrast. Almost amazingly, Dodging Bullets’ one-and-a-quarter length defeat of 33-1 shot Somersby was the first steeplechase Nicholls had won at this meeting since Kauto Star landed the 2009 Gold Cup. Back in third was Irish-trained front-runner Special Tiara but the big two — 2013 winner Sprinter Sacre and last year’s champion Sure De Grugy — blew out. Trainer Gary Moore and jockey son Jamie felt the ground had dried out too much for fourth-placed Sire De Grugy, who has endured an injury-plagued season while Sprinter Sacre, a spent force by the home turn, was pulled up before the last by his jockey Barry Geraghty. Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets successfully clear a fence on their way to victory . Twiston-Davies laps up the applause as he is led in after winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase . His trainer Nicky Henderson said there was no evidence Sprinter Sacre’s old fibrillating heart problem had affected his gelding and a scope examination showed no signs of a significant blood vessel break. However, the feeling was an old breathing issue might have re-surfaced. There will be no snap decisions but there must be a chance he has run his last race. Henderson said: ‘It is disappointing for everybody who has worked their socks off to get him back.’ The outcome once again showed how hard it is to come back and the result had echoes of the 2010 Gold Cup won by Imperial Commander when the focus was on the Nicholls-trained pair of Kauto Star and Denman. This time it was the turn of 9-2 shot Dodging Bullets, winner of this season’s Tingle Creek and Clarence House Chases, to be cold-shouldered in the build-up as the spotlight fell on the big two. And there to cheer him home was his breeder, three-time champion Flat jockey Frankie Dettori, looking like he should be part of Elliot Ness’s crew in his brown trilby and mac. He hoped he was breeding a future Derby winner when he sent the mare Nova Cyngi to the stallion Dubawi. He ended up producing the victor of one the season’s biggest jumps races. Dettori said: ‘I am only a small part in this amazing story but I am so pleased for Paul and the owners. I can say I have bred the best jumps horse of 2015.’ Dodging Bullets returned at 9-2 after landing the Queen Mother Champion Chase . Twiston-Davies celebrates with the Queen Mother Champion Chase trophy . The result was no surprise to Nicholls, who said: ‘He was the form horse. He beat Sprinter Sacre at Ascot and I couldn’t see how he could turn that around. With all due respect to Gary Moore, I also thought Sire De Grugy had it all to do. He has had a problem. ‘I can see the sentiment side of it but the progressive horse normally comes out on top. I was fairly confident I had them covered, Champagne Fever was the one I was getting worried about and he was a non-runner.’ Nicholls puts Dodging Bullets’ improvement this year down to greater maturity and solving a gastric ulcer problem, as he has with tomorrow’s Gold Cup favourite Silviniaco Conti. This success can only serve to strengthen both stable and punter confidence in his chance. Nicholls added: ‘We felt he was losing his way but couldn’t work out why. We found the gastric ulcer, treated for that, and like Silviniaco Conti he is a different animal. He won the best turned out award and it was as well as he has been.’ The results were also further vindication of Nicholls’s decision to hand the pressure job of stable jockey to 22-year-old Twiston-Davies at the start of the season, a move made earlier than expected when others threatened to sign him up. Nicholls heeded advice from former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. ‘He said, “you don’t want the best striker in the league playing for another team.” Someone said Sam will last me until I retire. I don’t know if he will last that long but he is a good lad who will be part of the team for a long time.’ A bad day for Henderson was made worse when Rolling Star suffered a fatal injury in the Coral Cup. It was all smiles for the connections of Dodging Bullets .

It occurred five minuted before half-time when McCleary tried to retrieve the ball from the Bradford end . Reading comfortably strolled into the FA Cup semi-finals with a 3-0 win. Click here to read the full match report . The incident occurred five minuted before half-time when McCleary tried to retrieve the ball from the Bradford end. McCleary, who scored the second goal, was shocked by something a fan said to him; the Royals winger immediately informed the referee's assistant, who subsequently told fourth official Andre Marriner. Marriner relayed the information to a senior Reading security chief, who is understood to have promptly ensured the fan in question was ejected from the stadium. The supporter was then arrested. In confirming the incident, a Reading statement read: 'An incident was reported to the match officials just before half time, who in turn told Reading staff. A man was then arrested and ejected during the half-time interval.' Royals manager Steve Clarke admitted after the game he was aware of an incident involving McCleary.

Bradford players applaud the supporters after full-time as they lost 3-0 against Reading on Monday night . The FA will wait for referee Mike Jones' report before deciding on what course of action to take, if any, this morning. Likewise, the end of the encounter was soured by a mass pitch invasion from elated home supporters. And the invasion sparked angry scenes between both sets of supporters as stewards prevented furious Bradford fans from entering the pitch to confront jubilant Reading supporters.

But we've got to move on. We've got so many great memories that we can take into the rest of this season for years to come. 'We came up against a team that play really well.

"Kris Boyd has insisted that even Jose Mourinho himself would have struggled to change Rangers’ fortunes if he were in charge at Ibrox. After their dismal 1-1 draw at home to Livingston on Saturday, the Govan club languish in third position in the Championship table – 24 points behind runaway leaders Hearts – and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end-of-season play-offs. However, Boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season, the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check – before they end up costing yet another man his job. Manager Stuart McCall puts Rangers, third in the Championship, through their paces in training . Boyd said it would not matter if Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (pictured) was in charge at Ibrox . ‘We’re now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players,’ said Boyd, ahead of Rangers’ league meeting with Alloa on Tuesday night at Ibrox. ‘It doesn’t matter if you were to go and bring in Jose Mourinho – he would still have the same players to deal with. ‘Sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye. But, ultimately, it’s the same players going out on the pitch and if we’re being brutally honest, it’s us who need to get a grip. ‘We can sit and say we’ve got international players in the dressing room but, at the end of the day, we haven’t performed and two managers have lost their job because of that, so we need to start winning games of football. ‘It can’t be all the manager’s fault. That’s why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough. I can safely say that I don’t feel as if I have. And I’m willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing. Kris Boyd in action for Rangers in their 1-1 draw with Livingston on Saturday . ‘We have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip. You can blame all different aspects - but it’s only excuses. We haven’t performed on the pitch and that’s the bottom line.’ After admitting recently that his second spell at Ibrox had been a failure on a personal level, with only three league goals to his name, Boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club. And he believes that due to their current malaise, the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting Ibrox. He added: ‘I’ve been in the situation myself when you turn up at Ibrox or Parkhead and you’re already beaten. They might have won 4-0 or 5-0 the week before and you look around you and think: “Oh no”. ‘But that’s not the case any more. Teams are coming with confidence and have seen that we’ve been weak. Previously, it was only European teams who didn’t change their game for Rangers - but teams now aren’t worrying about us. ‘Livingston came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply. They deserved their point. They might have lost five games previously, but they probably looked at us as being weak and tried to get in our faces.’","Rangers are third in the Championship table, 24 points adrift of Hearts .

"Toby Alderweireld would like to make his loan move to Southampton permanent, despite reported interest from the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham.

The Liverpool forward, who will have grown up in the same era as the Harry Potter series, provided a remarkable impression of Dobby the Elf, to the delight of one of his friends. It is certainly a contender for weirdest clip of the season, as the 20-year-old puts on a squeaky voice to imitate the character, voiced by Toby Jones in the JK Rowling adaptations.

In the video, Sterling squeaks: 'Harry Potter must not go to Hogwarts, or else he'll be in mortal danger,' before the camera pans to his friend, howling with laughter. 'Dobby must protect Harry,' Sterling concludes, before the video cuts out. On the pitch, Sterling has helped the Reds to fifth in the league, and is expected to start against Swansea on Monday, where they can close the gap on fourth to just two points.

"Ryan Seager has won the inaugural Barclays Under 21 Player of the Month award after impressing for Southampton in February. The 19-year-old made his debut for the senior team last month against Swansea, as well as scoring one and making one assist for the youth side, and has been chosen ahead of all the players in Division 1 and 2 (24 teams) based on his performance statistics. Seager also recently netted a hat-trick against Derby County in the Under 21 Premier League Cup, and is looking to follow in the footsteps of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and James Ward-Prowse in making the step up on the South Coast. Sportsmail held an exclusive Q&A with Seager after he found out about his award. Southampton youngster Ryan Seager has been chosen as the inaugural Barclays U21 Player of the Month . What's your style of play? A poacher, getting in around the box, it's where I score most of my goals. Who do you model your game on? Michael Owen in his early days, and obviously with Southampton it's Matt Le Tissier. He was my biggest inspiration from early on as a Saints fan. Have you worked with the first team? In the last few months and when I made my debut I was training with them quite a lot, they've got near enough a whole first-team squad fit now so it's getting harder but I still train with them every now and again. It's a good experience. Young striker Seager says he models his game on Matt Le Tissier (left) as a Saints fan and Michael Owen . Do you speak to Ronald Koeman often? He gives me advice in training, as do Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, with my shooting and movement. What do you do to relax away from football? Hobbies? I'd love to say golf but I'm not very good at it! I just relax really, I like all sports but don't play too many. Last album you listened to? Probably The Wanted, someone like that. Last film you watched? Fury. I loved it - I love war films. Another youngster you'd tip to make it at Southampton? Jake Hesketh. Made his debut for the first team in December, we're a good combination on FIFA! I've got a career mode on the game with Southampton at the moment, only in my first season so don't know if I get any good yet. I bring myself off the bench though... The 19-year-old fights for the ball with Chelsea midfielder Isaiah Brown during a youth game . Seager says the best youth player he has ever played against is Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj . Best young player you've played against? Adnan Januzaj in Under 18's. We played them away from home and he was just tearing it up. It was before he made his United debut, but I knew he would make it. What would you be doing now if you weren't a footballer? I think about that all the time. I've always thought it would be nice to work in a supermarket. Don't ask me why. I've always found it interesting. Best advice you've been given? Rickie Lambert, last season when I trained with him, told me I don't always have to shoot with power, to finesse it more often, and since then I've scored most of my goals from that. I look back to that advice. Any advice for young players? Work hard. If you keep working, you never know! Seager says he might fancy working in a supermarket if he wasn't a footballer at Southampton . The award has been established to recognise the next generation of players coming through, coinciding with Barclays' own work to encourage the next generation of fans, which will see thousands of tickets and unique football experiences given away via the Barclays Spirit of the Game website. A winner will be selected every month for the rest of the season, as well as the Barclays Under 21 Premier League Player of the Season being unveiled in May.","Ryan Seager wins inaugural award after impressing for Southampton .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has spoken to Sportsmail's Pete Jenson ahead of their Champions League last-16 showdown with Barcelona. Here are the top 10 quotes from the interview with the Chilean boss. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has spoken  to Sportsmail's Pete Jenson . Pellegrini on Manchester City's triumphs last season going unrecognised . 'We were fighting on all fronts. We won the Capital One Cup, reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, played in the Champions League and we won the League scoring 157 goals. Liverpool only had one competition and that's an enormous advantage.' Pellegrini on Liverpool getting the attention . 'The slip from (Steven) Gerrard? They lost that game 2-0, not 1-0. If he had not slipped, does it end in a draw? We'd still have been two points ahead of them. So why was it Liverpool losing the league and not us winning it?' Pellegrini on being told to buy English players . ‘It is important to have English players but can you sign them? Can you get (Raheem) Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can. If I want an English player in the position of (David) Silva who is there? Maybe (Wayne) Rooney, but who else?' Pellegrini on European silverware . 'Manchester United in all of that great era under (Sir Alex) Ferguson only won two Champions Leagues. Real Madrid went 32 years without winning the European Cup. It is important to be there in the later rounds but you can't think that not being there is a disaster.' Pellegrini poses with the Premier League trophy in May 2014 after he saw his team win the title . Pellegrini on Barcelona . 'You can talk about tactics and technique but if you go a man down against Barcelona, you're put in a terrible position. It is not a disgrace to get knocked out by them. Their squad, if it is not the best in the world, it is the second best. No other team can put together Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez but I want to play them with 11 and if they knock us out then let that be because they were better than us.' Pellegrini on his days as a centre back before becoming a manager . 'If you want to say I was a disaster of a player then say it. But give me another disaster of a player who played almost 500 games across 14 years.' Pellegrini on Manchester City's riches . 'This year Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all spent more than us. People don't accept that we are trying to become a big club in a very short time. I don't think there's such a difference between the top five or six squads.' Pellegrini feels English clubs aren't helped in European competitions by the domestic fixtures during winter . Pellegrini on the festive fixture list . 'English football gives other leagues an advantage. There are some traditions you can't change, I realise that. Boxing Day is non-negotiable. But you can't play nine games in December and nine in January. You have to stop at some point.' Pellegrini on James Milner . 'It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than Milner. There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn't one. 'You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes. It's very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.' Pellegrini on pressure in England compared to in Argentina . 'Here the pressure is normal. There, it's every day, and it's life and death. I've never had a problem with pressure because I believe in my own ability. Last year I wanted to show I could win a major league in Europe. This year the challenge is to repeat the title or to do better in the Champions League.'

"Paul Scholes has blasted Chelsea for their role in getting Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off in their Champions League last 16 second leg encounter on Wednesday night and has warned the Blues that referees will be wiser to their antics in future. Ibrahimovic was dismissed during the first half after challenging for a 50/50 ball with Chelsea midfielder Oscar. The tackle by the Paris Saint-Germain star left the Brazil international in heap as his team-mates clamoured to the referee for the 33-year-old to be sent off.

Blues striker Diego Costa makes a beeline for Ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card . Ibrahimovic has since condemned Jose Mourinho's side as 'babies' and Scholes has sympathy for the striker. Writing in his column for the Independent, the former Manchester United midfielder believes Chelsea's pressuring of referees over decisions has been a recurring theme this season and the west London outfit need realise when they have gone too far. 'I could tell that he [Ibrahimovic] knew he was going off when he looked up and saw every single outfield Chelsea player around the referee telling him to get his red card out. Chelsea have been doing it all season – if it is not the players trying to referee the game, then Mourinho does it from the touchline,' Scholes wrote. 'I accept that at Manchester United, we could also pressurise the referee at times and the picture of Andy D’Urso being backed into a corner is often held up in evidence. But we realised that it had become too extreme and from that point there was much less of it. Chelsea would not be the first team to pressurise a referee but they have to know when they have gone too far. 'When Diego Costa is rushing from 60 yards away to get involved in the argument then that is a sign that things have got out of hand. Against PSG the tactic worked in getting Ibrahimovic dismissed, but it became so extreme that referees will be prepared for it in future. They will have it highlighted in their preparation and they won’t want to make the same mistake that Bjorn Kuipers made on Wednesday.'

David Hooper, 56, was at work at a local cinema in Whanganui on the country's North Island and was monitoring the live CCTV footage from his mobile phone when he noticed the signs of a break in. Mr Hooper reviewed the video, which shows the thief knock on his front door before walking around the side of the house to climb through a window he smashed open with a brick. Scroll down for video . David Hooper, 56, from Whanganui in New Zealand captured the moment a thief broke into his house . The thief stole a number of items and smashed the flat screen TV in an effort to yank it away from the wall . The burglar can then be seen rifling through the draws on a TV stand and filling up a washing basket with electronics and games. He then smashes Mr Hooper's flat screen TV in an effort to yank it away from the wall. The thief then makes his way into a second room to search through more drawers, before walking through the kitchen armed with Mr Hooper's guitar. The man walks out the front door with the guitar slung over his shoulder, carrying the basket of items. He pulls the sleeves of his hoodie over his hands to close the front door without leaving fingerprints. The break in occurred between 6.55pm and 7.20pm last Tuesday, but Mr Hooper did not notice his trashed home until 9pm. As he was the only person manning the cinema he could not leave until after 10.30pm. He installed security cameras into his home after being broken into four times in two and a half years . The burglar can be seen rifling through the draws  and filling up a washing basket with electronics and games . 'When I saw it at nine o'clock I was pretty upset, it was not very pleasant at all,' Mr Hooper told Daily Mail Australia. 'Especially when I saw him breaking the TV - there was no need for that.' The man had stolen his PlayStation, seven games, a digital camera, a guitar, an e-cigarette and even meat from his freezer. Mr Hooper said there could be more items he doesn't yet know about. He estimates $15,000 worth of stuff has been stolen over the five break-ins. The security video was shared on his work's Facebook page and was viewed more than 27,000 times. The security video was shared on his work's Facebook page and was viewed more than 27,000 times . A woman who had purchased the items from the thief saw the video, recognised him and alerted police. They arrested him after finding his fingerprints at the scene. Mr Hooper said break-ins occurred all over Whanganui, and he believes he has been targeted so often because he lives by himself. 'I just live alone and when my car's not home, I'm not home,' he said. 'All I wanted was a nice quiet life and to live in peace… I'm a bit too scared to go home now.' Mr Hooper said he would love to sell his house but property prices in the area have recently taken a dive, and he would not consider renting it out after bad experiences in the past. 'When I did have it rented they absolutely trashed the house so it's put me off getting tenants,' he said. 'I'm sort of stuck.'","David Hooper from Whanganui, NZ, got footage of a man robbing his house .

"Jonathan Martin has been claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers. Aday after his release from the San Francisco 49ers, the offensive tackle joins his third NFL franchise in three years. Martin was a second round pick for Miami in 2012 and was at the centre of the Dolphins bullying scandal. He was abused by team-mates Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey and left the franchise in October 2013. Jonathan Martin heads to Carolina after drawing a close to his one-year stint with the San Francisco 49ers . Martin joined San Francisco last year and played 15 games at right tackle. The 25-year-old joins Michael Oher, who came to Carolina in free agency after a year with Tennessee, and the returning Mike Remmers on a revamped offensive line. 'Our goal is to build the strongest roster possible and add competition at every position,' Carolina general manager Dave Gettleman said in a team release. ""Jonathan brings quality experience to our offensive line, having started 32 games in his career at both tackle spots.'' Carolina also strengthened their receiving corps with the addition of Jarrett Boykin on a one-year deal.","Martin, a second-round pick by Miami in 2012, heads to his third NFL franchise .

"Real Madrid defender Pepe has revealed he does not miss former boss Jose Mourinho and says he is much happier now that Carlo Ancelotti is in charge of the club. Mourinho managed Madrid between 2010 and 2013, winning the Copa del Rey in 2011 and La Liga in 2012, but his final months in Spain were marred by a series of high-profile fall outs with senior players, including Pepe. The outspoken centre-back told COPE: 'I don't miss Mourinho. It was a different era which is over.'

Jose Mourinho managed Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013, but Pepe says he does not miss him . Current Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has faced criticism in recent weeks for the team's dip in form . Mourinho was replaced at the Santiago Bernabeu by Carlo Ancelotti, who guided Los Blancos to 'La Decima' - the club's 10th European Cup - last season after they beat city rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 in the final. However, with Madrid's recent dip in form - they have lost their last two games - the Italian's stock has fallen among the fans. But Pepe is adamant that Ancelotti is the right man for the job and in his opinion, better than Mourinho. 'Ancelotti is not too lenient with us. He has a very distinguished curriculum and he demands a lot from us. Our training sessions under Ancelotti are much more intensive than they were under Mourinho,' he said. 'I thank God that I've a coach like him, he's really helped me a lot. He tells me: 'Pepe, with your quality, you've got to anticipate play. You're fast and strong and you read the game well. You need to be focused'.' The 32-year-old also took time to defend captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for his performances. Despite a nervy display against Schalke in the Champions League, Pepe insisted that Casillas is the best players in the world in his position. 'Casillas is the best goalkeeper in the world right now. It's strange that someone like him gets whistled.' Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas (right) has come under fire for an unconvincing display against Schalke .

"Casey Stoney believes she is in the form of her life. Now all she has to do is convince England coach Mark Sampson before the women’s World Cup in Canada in June. The former England and GB captain has only played once for her country since Sampson took over from Hope Powell 15 months ago. Stoney, 32, is in the squad for the Cyprus Cup tournament, which starts on Wednesday with a match against Finland. Casey Stoney (centre, pictured in July 2013) is hoping to worm her way back into the England fold . The 32-year-old captained Great Britain during the 2012 Olympic Games in London . The central defender, who has 117 caps, was voted players' player of the year at Arsenal in the last Women's Super League season. She was left out of England's squad for the 3-0 friendly defeat by Germany at Wembley in November and was an unused substitute for the 1-0 defeat by the USA at MK Dons last month. England face four games in just over a week in the annual friendly tournament in Cyprus and Stoney told Fanbookz.com that she feels she merits a recall. ‘My actual form last season was my best since the Women's Super League started,’ she said. ‘When I go away with England I feel I'm competitive and working really hard, so that's all I can keep doing. I'm delighted to be in the England squad and if the opportunity comes, hopefully I can take it. ‘I've played 117 games for England and kept clean sheets against the best teams in the world, so I know that I can do it. It's just a matter of getting the opportunity to show it. Stoney has played just one game for her country under Mark Sampson, who replaced Hope Powell in 2013 . ‘This will be a good chance for the team to try different players and game plans but for me personally, with four matches in just over a week, this is an opportunity to play and show what I can still do.’ Steph Houghton, who succeeded Stoney as captain, and either Lucy Bronze or Laura Bassett have been selected in the centre of defence in recent games. Stoney points to her best fitness results over the lose season, since recovering from a hip injury. ‘You can never lose what you never had and I was never quick in the first place,’ added Stoney. ‘I continue to work hard on trying to read the game well, understanding what's likely to happen. Getting good detail on the opposition allows me to feel one step ahead.’ England play Australia and the Netherlands in their other group games before finishing up with a fourth friendly in Cyprus. At the World Cup in Canada they face France, Mexico and Colombia.","Arsenal defender Casey Stoney is hoping to prove worth to Mark Sampson .

"Police are continuing to make inquiries into an alleged biting incident involving Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie. The 24-year-old, who has been banned for biting before, was accused of sinking his teeth into the hand of Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry during Saturday's League Two fixture at the Lamex Stadium. The pair clashed near the touchline when Henry tried to wrestle the ball out of Labadie's arms after play had been stopped. Henry immediately appeared to signal to the nearby assistant referee that he had been bitten. Stevenage's Ronnie Henry (in the white) has accused Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie of biting him . The duo squared up after this clash on Saturday - and police are continuing to make inquiries . Boro manager Graham Westley revealed after the match that Henry, 31, had suffered 'a nasty injury' and had 'nearly lost his finger'. Dagenham have since said that Labadie denies the accusation. A Hertfordshire Police spokesperson said: 'Hertfordshire Constabulary is aware of an alleged incident that took place between two football players during the Dagenham vs Stevenage match at the Stevenage FC ground on Saturday, March 22. 'Police are making inquiries into the incident.' Labadie was fined £2,000 and banned for 10 games for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks while playing for Torquay in February 2014.

"A grandfather 'used like a football' by hooligans was today in a coma and fighting for life after a matchday pub brawl that police broke up using CS gas. Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people after his side’s match at Southend United in Essex. Football fans have already raised more than £5,000 towards transport and accommodation costs for Mr Dobbin’s family, who are travelling from Mildenhall, Suffolk, to visit him in Southend Hospital. Scroll down for video . Brain damage: Father-of-three Simon Dobbin (left), who is married to Nicole (right), 43, also suffered damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine . Before the trouble: Mr Dobbin (centre) with fellow Cambridge United fans at Roots Hall for the match against Southend United on Saturday. It was attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge . His father-in-law Jim Faley told the Bury Free Press: ‘If Simon doesn’t come around soon, he may never wake up. We are all hoping - but in the back of our minds we are not 100 per cent sure.’ ‘Even if he comes out in a wheelchair, at least he will still be with us. There were 12 to 15 guys who came out of the pub, they were singing and dancing, and then they just jumped them. ‘The doctors aren’t holding out much hope. They [the attackers] just used him like a football. According to some people, if it wasn’t for his friend laying on top of him they would have killed him.’ Father-of-three Mr Dobbin, who is married to Nicole, 43, suffered brain damage, damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine. Terry Waye, manager of the Half Moon pub in Mildenhall, where Mr Dobbin is a regular, told the Cambridge News: ‘The last we have heard is that he may come off the ventilator on Wednesday. 'But he will still be in a coma and he may not pull through. If he does he may never walk again and has suffered brain damage. He is the most gentle man I know and very kind.' Scene: Mr Dobbin was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people outside The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station, and a short walk from Roots Hall . Brawl: Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm . Mr Dobbin's son Liam said on Facebook: ‘I can't explain how much we appreciate all the support. ‘My dad is a well-loved bloke who cares so much for everyone and it's nice to see when times get tough like this everyone pulls together and supports him. Thank you.’ The skirmish followed a League Two match between Southend and Cambridge at Roots Hall stadium, a short walk from The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station. Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first was due to answer bail yesterday, while the latter was bailed to May 27. Witnesses reported seeing about 20 police cars and a helicopter on Saturday night - while one fan claimed to have escorted his father and wife out of the pub's back door when the fighting began. Dan Wilson, a Southend fan who lives near the pub and witnessed the scene from his home, told MailOnline: ‘We heard shouting coming from the pub, and saw about four guys coming out. ‘There were guys inside the pub trying to get out, and then the guys outside the pub started chucking a billboard outside through the door. All you could hear was glass being thrown. ‘Four guys started walking towards Prittlewell station down the hill and about 20 people ran across the road. Someone said “you've just hit my old man”. Then they've all gone into the pub. ‘I saw people running across the road - and two guys punched the window of the pub with their hand, before coppers dragged them away. It happened so quickly.’ Another supporter named Rayleigh Dan, writing on the Southend fans’ forum ShrimperZone, said on Saturday that he heard a window being broken before people in the pub rushed outside. He added: ‘The next thing I knew the police had cordoned off the pub and we weren't allowed to leave for about an hour. Following this they examined everyone thoroughly. ‘We had to give full details of name and address, what we had and hadn't saw - they we're scanning and filming us with some sort of camera. Confrontation: Fans also told of trouble at the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside . Tense scenes: Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to Home Office data, although both figures are relatively low compared to other clubs . ‘I'm not one for trouble so didn't recognise the device. It was horrible to experience and I hope anyone involved is caught and dealt with swiftly.’ A 47-year-old man from Cambridge was also arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage, after the pub’s door was smashed. Earlier, fans told of trouble at the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside. The game - which was billed in advance by Southend as a 'Community Day' - finished 0-0 and was attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge. Cambridge chairman Dave Doggett said: ‘The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Cambridge United are with Simon and his family and friends.’ And a Cambridge club statement said: ‘Simon Dobbin was walking to Prittlewell train station with his friend and a small group of fellow United fans after watching the rugby in a pub following the U's 0-0 draw at Southend on Saturday. Match: Southend United's Barry Corr beats Cambridge United's Richard Tait to the ball during the 0-0 draw . Location: The Railway Tavern (file image) is next to Prittlewell station, on the London Liverpool Street line . ‘The U's fans made the 500m walk to Prittlewell station but were attacked as they made their way down towards the platform. Simon remains in Southend University Hospital in a critical condition.’ A statement on the website raising funds for Mr Dobbin - which had already doubled its £2,500 goal by 9am today – said: ‘A loving gentle giant who is a father, husband, son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law, son-in-law, grandad and a top friend was brutally beaten and left in a coma fighting for his life. ‘He is suffering brain damage. We are asking for your support and donations - however much you can afford - to help towards costs of transport and accommodation and any other general financial needs of Simon, his wife and children. I want to thank you for your donations and support. Please send a prayer to Simon for a full recovery.’ Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to Home Office data, although both figures are relatively low compared to other clubs.","Simon Dobbin, 42, found on ground with serious head injuries after fight .

"If Roy of the Rovers made a comeback as a defender, he would be an all-action Brazilian with electric hair, have 6.5million Instagram followers and call them all ‘geezers’. The new comic book star would score a magnificent booming header against his former team, celebrate with a screaming knee slide, scrap with the evil baddie of the opposition (Diego Costa) and finish the struggle victorious, shaking hands with the ground staff before exiting for his next adventure. The problem for the script writers, if they were to copy the life and times of David Luiz, is that they would have no idea what David Luiz was going to do next, so what chance do the opposition – or his team-mates – have? David Luiz jumps for joy after his bullet header forced the game in to extra-time on Wednesday night . Luiz celebrates victory with team-mates Thiago Motta (right) and Maxwell at the final whistle . When you expect Luiz to be heading it clear, he’s chasing the glory, when you expect him to be chasing the glory, he appears from nowhere to head it clear. Losing 7-0 in a World Cup semi-final, he still thinks he can get a goal back. Maybe a second. Who knows? A hat-trick. On that occasion it finished 7-1 and the one-man reconnaissance mission broke down, leaving gaps behind him for the German team to exploit. Would it change his approach? Of course not. Even on Wednesday night, with Paris Saint-Germain drawing 2-2 at Chelsea with minutes remaining and set to go through with 10 men on away goals, he turned up on the right wing to collect the ball and retain possession. Luiz looks on in disgust as Germany celebrate one of their seven goals in last summer's World Cup semi-final . He’s a defender who sees defending as a part-time job. So concerned was Laurent Blanc, a World Cup-winning centre back with 97 caps, which suggests he knows a bit about defending, that he played Luiz in midfield in the first leg, with two centre backs behind him for cover. He was back in the back four for the second leg and, when it works, it works spectacularly. Who else could have got them through when their talisman, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, had been sent off? Luiz could have been sent off too for his feuding with Costa, but instead he rose majestically in the land of the giants that is Chelsea’s penalty area to send a thunderball of a header into the roof of the net. The defender stumble backwards after one of many confrontations with Diego Costa on Wednesday night . To get ahead of John Terry, Gary Cahill or his marker Branislav Ivanovic takes great skill, movement and courage but to meet the ball with such ferocity… maybe there’s more to Luiz than his Sideshow Bob nickname and carefree style. Then came the celebration. Not just a former player quietly enjoying the moment against the club that sold him, but a full-pelt emotional surge of joy. He said he wouldn’t celebrate on his first return to Stamford Bridge, but who can blame him for loving the moment? It was a goal worth celebrating. Chelsea sold him because they thought the deal was too good to refuse and, presumably, because they thought Terry and Cahill could do the job better. Few can argue with that – Terry, especially, has been magnificent as a defender this season but can he hit a dipping, swerving free kick, Cristiano Ronaldo style, from more than 30 yards, as Luiz did on Wednesday night? Jose Mourinho has a word with Luiz on the touchline as PSG manager Laurent Blanc watches on . Luiz rises to beat Branislav Ivanovic to Thiago Motta's corner and head home PSG's equaliser . Not everyone is a Luiz fan – Jamie Redknapp wrote on this website that ‘whoever struck the deal to sell Luiz for £50m deserves a knighthood’. And, as Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel reported, Jose Mourinho thought Luiz was too much of an optimist as a defender. Samuel wrote: ‘Mourinho wanted miseries at the back. He wanted players who feared the roof was about to fall in, the move was going to break down, a counter attack was only a stray pass away. Luiz wasn’t like that. He roamed, he left gaps, he charged upfield and if that break went wrong he thought it wouldn’t matter. He didn’t check for danger, he was rarely alarmed. Luiz was too much of an optimist to defend properly.’ The optimist will make mistakes. He will raid upfield when he should be focussing on shutting the door, but he had a lot of fun at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night and he’s still in the Champions League. Luiz has a moment of reflection as PSG progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League .","David Luiz starred as PSG knocked Chelsea out of the Champions League .

"Real Madrid will need to play with intensity for 90 minutes and not just the first half if they are to have a chance of beating Barcelona in Sunday's La Liga 'Clasico', according to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Sunday, with two first-half goals .

"Ask Andy Murray about the most memorable victories in his career and quickly revealed are two aspects of his character — the modest and the contrarian. There is no mention of ending Britain’s Wimbledon men’s singles drought, nor the similar emulating of Fred Perry at the US Open, nor the flaying he gave Roger Federer on Centre Court to win the Olympic gold medal. Instead, he refers to a win over an obscure journeyman ranked No 110 in the world, and another at a now-defunct and largely-forgotten tournament in California. Andy Murray warms up for match against Kevin Anderson in Miami on Monday . The subject arises because he has the opportunity to win a 500th professional singles match on Tuesday, when he takes on South Africa’s world No 15 Kevin Anderson in the fourth round of the Miami Open. It comes around nearly 12 years after making his professional debut as a 15-year-old in Manchester. He began with a victory over Wesley Moodie, another South African. Moodie was only just outside the top 100 at the time, so it was a fair indication of his opponent’s outstanding promise. Murray does not mention that one, but recalls two of the matches that set him on his way, and most clearly the period when he was trying to establish himself on the main ATP Tour. ‘I remember certain wins, like the first one I had at Queen’s (at the then Stella Artois Championships in 2005) against Santiago Ventura,’ he says, referring to the then world No 110. ‘It might seem irrelevant now but at the time, for me, that was huge. It was big for my confidence, gave me a sense of belonging. I really remember those first few events on the tour, more than some of those in the last three or four years. Coach Amelie Mauresmo takes a photo of Murray during practice session . ‘I can remember the players I played against around then. I went to Newport (Rhode Island) after my first Wimbledon and then I played in Indianapolis and Cincinnati.’ By the end of that summer, not long after turning 18, he was already knocking on the door of the top 100 and had beaten three players inside the top 30. Early in 2006 comes the other match he picks out, the final of the indoor San Jose Open, where he beat former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt. ‘That was a first ATP title for me and was really important,’ he says. ‘I was without a coach, only 18, and Lleyton was someone I loved watching growing up. To win 7-6 in the third set at that age against someone as good as him, with no coach there, privately meant a lot. ‘I didn’t really feel the pressure — it was, “Here I am, I’m 18 and playing an ex-No 1 in the world, a great player and nothing is expected”. ‘I played (Andy) Roddick in the semis and didn’t feel nervous at all. It definitely changes over the years, you start to feel the expectation but then as you get older it changes again as you start to deal with the expectation and learn how to handle it.’ Murray takes time out to signs autographs for fans in Miami on Monday . Interestingly, ask which win took the most out of him and he instead cites one of his 155 defeats, the near five-hour loss in the 2012 Australian Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic. The Serb subsequently managed probably the most talked about recovery in history, beating Rafael Nadal two days later in nearly six hours to win the title. ‘Against Novak in the Australian Open was the hardest match, I’ve no idea how he managed to recover and win the final. I literally couldn’t walk for four days. That was the match my body hurt the most after finishing. I was extremely sore, stiff, everything hurt.’ Murray is guaranteed to overtake Nadal in next week’s rankings after his defeat on Sunday by Fernando Verdasco. The Spaniard heads to Monte Carlo to begin what is usually a triumphant roll through the European clay courts admitting he is lacking confidence and that he ‘needs to fix again’ the nerves that have affected him this season. The 28-year-old insisted there are no hidden physical issues behind his modest 15-5 record this year. Normally the mere feel of the dirt under his feet imbues Nadal with belief, and with Djokovic targeting Roland Garros above all else this year, he will need all of that.","Andy Murray takes on Kevin Anderson in fourth round at Miami Open .

"The French Press greeted Paris Saint Germain's extraordinary victory over Chelsea with euphoric acclaim on Thursday morning, lauding Laurent Blanc's men as 'heroes' and delivering a withering assessment of the 'cynicism' of Jose Mourinho's team. L'Equipe's match report proclaimed the dramatic 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge as a 'magnificent, incredible, heroic night…' and adding that 'the performance of PSG should take pride of place among the pantheon of the Parisian club's most glorious nights, awakening memories of magical victories against Real Madrid in 1993 and Barcelona in 1995'. For Chelsea, the assessment was damning. The French media believe that Mourinho was responsible for the red card delivered to Zlatan Ibrahmovic after only 31 minutes for a challenge on Oscar. Chelsea have been broadly criticised as nine of their players surrounded the referee in the immediate aftermath of the incident.

L'Equipe write: 'It was an incandescent minute, which saw Mourinho benefit from all that he has grown to embody through his years of experience on the European scene…he flaps his arms, harangues, gesturing frantically in the direction of the referee Kuipers'. Chelsea's lethargic showing was panned by L'Equipe in the ratings, with the respected French daily awarding only 3/10 to Branislav Ivanovic, Oscar and Diego Costa. Only Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois were awarded marks higher than 5/10, with L'Equipe handing sixes to the pair.

The Spanish forward Costa is the centrepiece of the spread, poetically described as a 'demon without wonder'. The newspaper continues: 'Diego Costa wears within him a natural anger which always leaves him on a knife-edge. By looking to wind-up opponents, by constantly confronting them, sometimes head-to-head, he creates an electricity and we await the spark. Last night, it never arrived. As his centre forward, he has been provoked a lot by Mourinho but now he has forgotten to play.' The Portuguese manager's side were criticised for being cynical in the game at Stamford Bridge . Former Chelsea defender David Luiz celebrates wildly after bringing PSG back into the game in normal time . PSG were viewed rather more generously, and their valiant performances were hailed in the match ratings, with the returning David Luiz awarded a 9/10, and L'Equipe described him as the 'perfect example…demonstrating that he can remain concentrated defensively.' Marco Verratti, the brilliant Italian technician, received an 8/10, praised for 'setting the tempo of the match' and his 'huge impact' on the game.

"New Rangers manager Stuart McCall has urged his players to pick themselves up after their recent woes as he targets promotion to the Scottish Premiership. Rangers have only won one of their last five Championship matches and currently sit in third position, 22 points behind leaders Hearts. And while an automatic promotion place looks to be beyond their reach, McCall is hoping to kick-start a run of results which will secure the Glasgow club a play-off place and help return confidence to the camp.

"Stuart McCall admits taking on the challenge of steering Rangers to Premiership promotion was a gamble he couldn’t refuse as he bids to earn a longer stay as Ibrox boss. The 50-year-old was unveiled on Thursday as manager until the end of the current season – following the exit of caretaker Kenny McDowall - and hasn’t received any promises about what could lie beyond that point. However, the former Rangers midfielder insists he didn’t think twice about returning to the club where he won six league titles in seven years during the 1990s. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . McCall, 50, will take charge of the club he used to play for until the end of the season . The new Rangers boss takes his first training session at Murray Park on Thursday afternoon . McCall views it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and is focused on revitalising a play-off push that could convince the new Rangers board he is the man for the future. ‘I know what the expectation levels are at this club,’ he said. ‘It’s a gamble, it’s a massive challenge but it’s an opportunity I never thought I’d get and I had to take it. ‘It’s an honour and a privilege to be asked to come and help out at this club until the end of the season. ‘People have been texting me good luck and asking me if I know what I’m doing. But it’s a wonderful opportunity for me.’ McCall addressed the players and conducted an afternoon training session at Murray Park after cancelling their scheduled day off. He spoke with director John Gilligan and interim chairman Paul Murray to reach an agreement on Wednesday but confirmed no guarantees were given beyond the 11 remaining games of the regular season. The former Motherwell manager has taken charge of the Ibrox club for the rest of the season . The former Bradford player faces the press as he is unveiled on Thursday . McCall said the chance to manage Rangers for just 11 guaranteed games was a 'wonderful opportunity' ‘There’s nothing concrete,’ said the former Motherwell boss, who will again be assisted by Kenny Black. ‘My question to the board was: “What do you see as success?” ‘I don’t want to do as well as I can, turn it around, and then see others coming in. ‘Progress will obviously be an upturn in results and everyone will say success is gaining promotion to the Premiership. But you could get to the second leg of the play-off final, see your goalkeeper sent off and lose on penalty kicks. ‘It can be a thin line between whether you go up or not. We’ve got to improve our performance and it’s about self-belief and regaining confidence. There are no guarantees either way if we go up or have to stay down. ‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle but I will do my best.’ Rangers announced that caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet . McCall (centre right) celebrates the 1992 SPL during his Rangers playing days with the Ibrox club . McCall also confirmed he would not have taken the job had Dave King and his allies not attained boardroom power. ‘I get paid to try and get the best out of a group of players,’ he added. ‘There is no magic formula or a pill you can give them for confidence. It’s about trying to restore self-belief. A couple of results can change things. ‘The supporters are there, willing them to do well. They don’t want to come and boo. The club has had a kicking, but the team have had two promotions in the past two seasons and there is still an opportunity to get another one this year.’ McCall spoke at length with McDowall on Thursday morning, before the latter’s amicable departure was then confirmed later in the day. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those . Stuart McCall (left), who was Scotland assistant under Gordon Strachan, has taken charge at Ibrox . McDowall became caretaker manager after Ally McCoist was placed on garden leave by the old regime just before Christmas. He was, however, always a reluctant conscript to the role and had handed in his own notice in January. ‘It was an honour and privilege to work for Rangers Football Club and I will leave with so many positive memories,’ said McDowall, who originally arrived at Ibrox as first-team coach in 2007. ‘I have worked with so many talented people since I joined and I will forever be in Walter Smith’s debt for bringing me to Rangers. ‘Working with Walter, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Jim Stewart and all the backroom staff plus the staff at Ibrox and Murray Park was a pleasure and I wish the club well for the future. ‘I was delighted to play a part in the club’s history and I wish the supporters and new management team all the very best.’","Stuart McCall was named as the Rangers manager until end of the season .

"For Stuart McCall, the hope is that the sleepless nights that preceded his exit from Motherwell can be replaced by a sweet dream. Visualising the joy of completing the journey back to the top flight is something he wants all now under his command at Rangers to do. The power of positive thinking will be deployed in the fight for promotion McCall took on Thursday evening. The 50-year-old stepped down from his post at Fir Park in November after admitting much soul-searching in a bid to halt a form slump. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . The new Rangers boss takes his first training session at Murray Park on Thursday afternoon . His was surely a classic case of becoming a victim of your own success. Hindsight only makes the prior back-to-back second places finishes he attained on a meagre budget look all the more incredible. Revitalised, refreshed and fully motivated, the lure of resuming his managerial career with a return to Ibrox was simply too great to resist. McCall’s current deal only runs to the end of the season but if his infectious enthusiasm can transform an underachieving, down-in-the mouth squad into play-off victors then his claim for a longer stay will be extremely difficult to ignore. He won six titles and five cups in seven years as a midfielder with Walter Smith’s all-conquering side of the 1990s, but reckons taking Rangers up this season might well be the greatest achievement of his footballing life. ‘It would have to be up there and I have been quite fortunate in my time,’ he mused. ‘Yeah, I suppose it would be. ‘There might still be sleepless nights but it is something to dream about. I want the lads to have a focus about that. Picture yourself running around Ibrox having won promotion. The former Motherwell manager has taken charge of the Ibrox club for the rest of the season . The former Bradford player faces the press as he is unveiled on Thursday . ‘The lads who have been here have done it for two years. Obviously the circumstances were quite different. ‘I would think at this moment in time - and I am not putting the boot into the players because they know this themselves - anyone who has watched Rangers for the last three or four months would say they would struggle. ‘But there are enough good players in the squad I saw as I looked around in our meeting today. ‘They wouldn’t be at Rangers if they weren’t good players. I saw flashes of it today in training. Go and express yourself. All of the players who have come from all these different clubs, I would have signed most of them. ‘It hasn’t sunk in and it won’t sink in for a while. But I’m going to make the most of it.’ McCall believes his new charges still have what it takes and, clearly, he wouldn’t have been getting to grips with a new office in Murray Park if he didn’ t think he could work a little magic alongside trusted assistant Kenny Black. ‘When I got the opportunity, I thought about the whole thing last night,’ said McCall, reflecting on the whirlwind of events that led to him replacing caretaker manager Kenny McDowall, who has made an amicable exit. ‘In an ideal world you will come in for pre-season and have four-six weeks to look at players, try different systems, and look at strengths and weaknesses. That’s obviously not going to happen and I will have to hit the ground running. ‘But just being out on the training ground again gave me a buzz and I’m relishing it. The results have got to be right, of course. ‘There have only been 13 managers in about 123 years so for me to be given the opportunity is beyond belief. ‘I got a nice text from my daughter pointing out that I had played and managed Bradford. I have played for Scotland and worked on the management team and now I’m managing Rangers having played for them. ‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle and I will beat myself up every day but I will do my best.’ Rangers announced that caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet . McCall (centre right) celebrates the 1992 SPL during his Rangers playing days with the Ibrox club . He inherits a squad where a dozen first-team players are coming to the end of their contracts but insists that should only add to the shared motivation to stick around a while longer. ‘This club might not know until May 30 what league they are going to be playing in next season. ‘So regardless of who is manager, I don’t think contracts are going to be handed out at this moment in time. ‘I’m sure Hearts will be handing out contracts to a lot of players, because they know they are going to be in the Premiership next season and they deserve to. ‘So the message to the lads out of contract here is “go and and earn yourself one”. They can still turn it around. ‘If they play well and we do well as a team, is there a possibility I might be here next season? Yes, it’s a possibility. But it’s down to themselves if they are here. It’s still in their hands.’ McCall will open his tenure with tomorrow’s home game against Livingston as he seeks to eat into the five-point lead Hibernian currently have in second place. What, though, if Rangers can battle through to the play-off final and have to meet his old love Motherwell to complete the job? ‘It would make me sick,’ he grimaced. ‘It would. But I honestly hope – and believe – they won’t be in the bottom two. ‘I’ve had a lot of texts from the Motherwell lads. I think the signings of McDonald and Pearson coming back will really help them and I think there is enough there. ‘There is no guarantee we are going to be in there but that is the aim. I want to be playing that 11th team at the end of the season. I just hope it’s not Motherwell and I’m confident they are good enough to get out of it.’ McCall will take a sabbatical from his role in Gordon Strachan’s backroom staff for the matches against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar later this month as he focuses on his short-term challenge. The future beyond that remains unclear – with a longer appointment at Ibrox almost certainly meaning his exit from the national set-up - but he insisted the former Celtic manager had been a source of sage advice. ‘I didn’t make any decision until I spoke to Gordon Strachan,’ he added. ‘I spoke to him about 6.30pm the other night. He had just come off the golf course in Spain and he said: “I take it it’s about the Rangers job?” ‘He was fantastic. I won’t go into what he said, but his advice was terrific. He has really helped since I have been working with Scotland. I didn’t know him until he offered me the post out of the blue. ‘I won’t be involved in the Northern Ireland and Gibraltar games but who knows what might happen in the future.’","Stuart McCall was named as the Rangers manager until end of the season .

"Jerome Sinclair produced a match-winning performance for Liverpool's under 21s on Monday night as they defeated Chelsea 2-0, winning a penalty and scoring an eye-catching individual goal. And his classy display drew high praise from an Anfield legend afterwards. Jamie Carragher, who was summarising the match for Sky Sports, was very impressed by the teenager's abilities. Liverpool's teenage striker Jerome Sinclair chases the ball in a UEFA Youth League match with Real Madrid . Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher, working as a pundit on Sky Sports, praised Sinclair's performance . Talking about Sinclair's second-half strike, his 22nd of the season, Carragher said: 'It was an outstanding finish. 'He got the penalty [converted by Harry Wilson] and was maybe fortunate in the first-half but there he left them for dead. 'Centre-backs don't like being put in that position out wide. He has pace and composure on his weak foot. ' But who is the hotshot winning such high-profile admirers? Sportsmail has everything you need to know. Sinclair breaks beyond the Chelsea defender Fankaty Dabo during Monday night's under 21 match in Chester . Sinclair slams home Liverpool's second goal in the 2-0 win over Chelsea on Monday night . Name: Jerome Sinclair . Age: 18 . Club: Liverpool . Position: Striker . Carragher certainly isn't the first pundit to notice the spectacular season Jerome Sinclair is having in Liverpool's academy teams. Across the under 18, under 19 and under 21 age groups, the England youth international has found the net 22 times this campaign. Chelsea, the defending champions in the under 21 league, were hoping to leapfrog a cluster of clubs and claim top spot as they headed to the Deva Stadium in Chester on Monday night. But Sinclair and Liverpool had other ideas. After just eight minutes, Sinclair used his abundant pace to get in behind the Blues defence and was wrestled to the ground by Fikayo Tomori. Harry Wilson, another highly-rated player, converted the spot-kick. Sinclair's unpredictable movement had been a headache all night and, shortly after half-time, he again burst past Tomori and finished high into the net from an acute angle. Sinclair gets away from the Chelsea back line during Liverpool's 2-0 win on Monday night . Jerome Sinclair scored twice as Liverpool's under 19s beat Ludogorets Razgrad in the UEFA Youth League . It was the assured finish of a player in the best form of his life and someone well on the way to achieving his obvious potential. This was just one example of the many types of goal Sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 18-year-old coaches at Anfield believe can become the next Raheem Sterling. Sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for Liverpool, making his senior debut with a nine-minute cameo in a League Cup tie at West Brom in september 2012. He was a tender 16 years and six days old. Although that remains Sinclair's one and only senior outing, he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level. Born in Birmingham in September 1996, Sinclair was a member of the West Brom academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by former Liverpool club scout Stuart Webber. Sinclair gets beyond Manchester United's Joe Riley in an under 18 Premier League match last season . He spent the 2011-2012 campaign mainly with the under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the under 18 team towards the end. His coach Mike Marsh was impressed by his talent and a 15-year-old Sinclair was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of Carragher and Steven Gerrard at Melwood, something he later described as a 'great learning curve.' It wasn't long before Sinclair found his scoring boots, with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad Rodolfo Borrell was about to lead into the NextGen Series. Sinclair impressed in the first group match away to Inter Milan, winning a penalty that Krisztian Adorjan converted and going close himself on a number of occasions. Liverpool were narrowly beaten 3-2 in that game but went on to advance from the group, Sinclair scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4-1 win over Rosenborg. Sinclair is challenged by Alex Davey of Chelsea in a FA Youth Cup semi-final in April 2013 . These appearances came either side of that first team run-out at The Hawthorns, a moment Sinclair described as a 'dream come true' in a later interview. But things have really taken off for Sinclair this season, with six goals in the group phase of the under 19 UEFA Youth League amongst his haul. The youngster has credited another club legend, Robbie Fowler, as a massive influence on his development with his coaching sessions at the club's Melwood training ground. Sinclair told the Liverpool Echo last week: 'Robbie is a legend at this club so to get a few helpful tips from him and some advice is brilliant for me. Sinclair takes on Ro-Shaun Williams during an under 18 match with Manchester United this season . 'This is a guy who has been there and done it and played at the pinnacle of the game. It's fantastic for me to get the chance to work with him and it can only improve my game. 'He has given me a few little tips on my first touch, and worked with me on different types of finishing. He is always there to help me in any way he can.' Internationally, Sinclair has represented England at under 16 and under 17 level. His debut came in the Victory Shield in October 2011, when Wales were beaten 4-0. His first goals for the Three Lions came at the 2012 Montaigu Tournament in France, helping to secure wins against the hosts and also Morocco. Sinclair breaks through the Italy defence during an under 17s international in Burton back in 2012 . As shown of late, Sinclair is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls. He seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement. At 5ft 8in, Sinclair won't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too, so he fits in with the fluid passing game the Liverpool academy try to foster. And the signs look promising that Sinclair will be the next bright youngster to come through Liverpool's academy ranks.","Sinclair scored and won a penalty in Liverpool U21s win over Chelsea .

Give me a key to the door, I have to go to the bathroom. I really have to go, it's not a joke. I'll take some with me, it's crazy!' Mandel said in a behind-the-scenes video.

"Lewis Hamilton is heading into the new Formula One season as the favourite to seal his third world championship, but the Briton is only the fourth-most marketable driver in the sport. According to a survey released by Repucom on the eve of the curtain raiser in Australia, Hamilton fails to make the top three, which is headed by Fernando Alonso. Alonso has been ruled out of the season opener in Melbourne after he sustained concussion during a testing crash in Barcelona last month. Fernando Alonso, who will miss the season opener in Australia, is the sport's most marketable driver . Defending champion Lewis Hamilton, pictured at the BRITs with singer Ellie Goulding is fourth on the list . Alonso heads the top 10 with his former  team-mate Felipe Massa and four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel completing the podium places . But the McLaren driver’s popularity in his native Spain sees him top the 'most marketable' list ahead of the Williams driver of Felipe Massa, with four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel snatching the final podium spot. ‘Consumer brands will gravitate naturally to where the leading drivers are and with the dominance of Alonso’s profile off the track, a strong first season at McLaren could well see him pull even further from the pack,’ said Nigel Geach, Senior Vice President of Motorsport. ‘However, this season, the one to watch is Lewis Hamilton. With a host of personal endorsements to his name already and being a part of a team everyone was chasing last year, Hamilton has an opportunity to grow his reputation internationally as potentially one of F1’s finest. He has a high profile domestically brands will be watching the performance of this driver in 2015 very closely.’ Felipe Massa, pictured playing Aussie Rules on Wednesday, is third on the list of most-marketable drivers . Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel completes the podium places in the Repucom survey . Hamilton, who is in the final stages of contract discussions with Mercedes over a deal to seal his foreseeable future with the team, is the highest climber in the survey which is based on the perceptions of people from the racers’ native countries. Ninety-three per cent of Britons know of Hamilton, according to the survey. This compares to 98 per cent of Spaniards for Alonso, and a whopping 99 per cent of Brazilians who are aware of the former Ferrari driver. Jenson Button is fifth on the list, with Nico Rosberg, Daniel Ricciardo, Romain Grosjean, 17-year-old Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez completing the top 10.","Fernando Alonso is most marketable driver, according to Repucom survey .

"Alex Song believes West Ham can follow Monaco's example and keep his former club Arsenal subdued at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The Hammers head across London looking to kickstart their Premier League campaign, having plummeted down to 10th place after no wins in the last six and back-to-back defeats. Arsenal, meanwhile, have surged back into the top four and are into the FA Cup semi-finals after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday night. Alex Song believes West Ham can kickstart their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday . Despite Arsenal's formidable run of seven consecutive home victories in the Premier League, Song - who played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012, before joining Barcelona - believes the Irons can repeat Monaco's performance after the unfancied French side stunned the Emirates Stadium with a 3-1 Champions League victory last month. 'I know this stadium very well and I know when you play with Arsenal it's very hard, but I think Monaco is how you want to play when you play in the Emirates,' Song told the West Ham website, www.whufc.com. 'The best thing to do is to try to be together, defend together very well and when you have the opportunity to go on the counter attack, you have to do it very well like Monaco did it. Song played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012 before joining Barcelona . 'If you want to go to Emirates and try to play you will not have any chance to win the game there because this stadium is very hard to play in. 'You have to stay together very compact and not give them any room, then take the opportunity on the counter attack. 'If we do this very well like Monaco did, then we can get a good result there.' Song, the 27-year-old on loan from Barcelona until the end of the season, feels the Irons can raise their game against Arsenal. 'We have shown a lot of things this season as a team, especially when we play against teams at the highest level like Manchester City and Liverpool or Tottenham. We've done very well and we need to continue to improve in this way,' said Song, who stayed in London to work on his fitness while the rest of the squad were away at a warm-weather camp in Dubai. The 27-year-old feels West Ham can raise their game against Arsenal in the same way Monaco did . 'We can play better and hopefully this game on Saturday will be a very good test for us. 'It has been a long time since we won a game in the league, so we must try to come back and try to win or get one point there. 'Everything is possible in football and we just need to keep believing and trying hard on the pitch.' Song maintains there can be no room for sentiment against his former club. 'They are one part of my life and, because I went there when I was 17, I always say it is my family,' the former Cameroon international said. 'I know this is a special game for me, but that is football and I have to take all the emotion out and just try to play my game, to play the best football I can to help the team to win.'","West Ham have plummeted down to 10th place in the Premier League table .

"England have slipped down the FIFA world rankings for a second consecutive month with Roy Hodgson's side now lying in 17th place, behind the likes of Romania and Czech Republic.

"Harry Kane's goalscoring debut came as little surprise to his England team-mates, with Phil Jones expecting nothing less from the 'on fire' striker. A sold-out Wembley witnessed the latest chapter of the 21-year-old's fairytale rise, which has seen him go from Tottenham squad player to the country's most lethal frontman in just a matter of months. Kane was welcomed by a standing ovation when he came on as a second-half substitute and it took just 80 seconds for him to get the fans back on their feet, heading home with one of his first touches to wrap up a 4-0 win against Lithuania.

'He has been doing it in training as well this week. He is on fire and we're delighted for him. 'He has been brilliant this season. He thoroughly deserved his call-up and the lads are delighted for him in the dressing room to score his first goal. He has been lively, he is a great lad and he has been scoring a lot of goals.' Kane connected with the looping ball to nod past keeper Giedrius Arlauskis as his fairytale season continues . Kane was named on the bench but when his chance came he grabbed it with both hands . The victory against Lithuania continued England's 100 per cent start to Group E - a cake walk which makes Tuesday's friendly in Italy an important test.

"It is the game which, ultimately, could define the success or otherwise of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive Republic of Ireland tenure. Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, £1million-per-year O’Neill and his assistant Keane – with a £600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format. Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday, however, would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer’s finals in France. It would be they and Scotland left to do battle for the play-off berth. Aiden McGeady jokes with Ireland assistant Roy Keane during a training session earlier this week . Sunderland defender John O'Shea catches a bib as the side prepare for the crucial qualifier against Poland . The mood here in Dublin is not one of optimism. An inquest, you feel, awaits O’Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders. One newspaper described their manager as ‘bookish and vaguely befuddled’, while the ‘carnage’ which follows Keane was also noted. Certainly, there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press. O’Neill, meanwhile, has kept all talk to football. He has ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since his arrival. He has, though, recognised the magnitude of the outcome against the Poles. ‘The importance of the occasion should not be missed,’ he said. ‘Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win. Martin O'Neill addresses his squad at the training session as they bid to go level with Poland in Group D . The Ireland players are out through their paces in preparation for the Euro 2016 clash . ‘I’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny. This is the first of that group. We have to make them count.’ O’Neill, whose fourth-placed side trail Poland by three points, added: ‘We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance. ‘We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game. ‘We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.’ One criticism of O’Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation. That much was obvious by him talking this week of players winning a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide. O'Neill is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against Poland . One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November. The LA Galaxy striker, 34, was sat next to O’Neill at Saturday's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion. ‘That’s up to the manager (if I play),’ he said. ‘I’ll be ready whether that’s from the bench or starting. I’m the captain, I have to set an example. ‘But I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.’ Keane, sensing the air of negativity in his homeland, added: ‘It’s up to us to make this a turning point for the team. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.’ Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O’Neill before they face Scotland back in Dublin. Win, and that £1m salary would look like a shrewd investment.","Ireland play Poland in a Euro 2016 qualifier at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday .

"Damon Hill fears McLaren will experience a painful start to the upcoming Formula One campaign. The British team arrive in Melbourne for this week's curtain raiser off the back of a troubled winter. Powered by Honda engines for the first time in more than two decades, they managed fewer laps than any other team during pre-season testing. Indeed favourites Mercedes, completed almost 1,000 more laps than McLaren, who were plagued by reliability issues, at the three tests in Jerez and Barcelona. Damon Hill (right) is predicting a miserable start to the Formula 1 season for McLaren . Jenson Button's partnership with Fernando Alonso will be delayed from forming after Alonso's crash . Alonso sustained concussion in a crash and has been ruled out of the first race of the season . 'There is going to be pain, lots of pain,' Hill, the 1996 world champion, gloomily predicted. 'The McLaren-Honda thing has to work at some point, but Formula One is so difficult now. There is so much technology and you are taking on so many strong teams. 'I expect a modest beginning, but from whatever they start at you want to see a trajectory which is pushing to regular top sixes and a podium at the end of the season.' McLaren and Honda forged one of the sport's most successful partnerships as Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost delivered four consecutive drivers' and constructors' championships between 1998 and 1991. And their return to the grid this season was expected to bring a similar change in fortune for the British team who haven't tasted victory at a single race in two lacklustre years. 'Only winning is good enough for McLaren,' added Hill. 'But if they end the season challenging for podiums then they have made a massive step forward.

"Jonny Evans' actions in spitting at Papiss Cisse were 'simply disgusting', a Football Association regulatory commission ruled. The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.' The written report also reveals Manchester United questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any 'truly exceptional' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches.","Jonny Evans was banned for six games for spitting at Papiss Cisse .

Gordon Strachan arrives at Scotland's press conference at Hampden Park ahead of the match . All week he has drilled into his players the need to probe for openings rather than rush balls forward too soon - and he is optimistic the practice will pay off. Speaking just before taking his players for a training session at a wet and windy Hampden, Strachan said: 'We don't want to be panicking and rush into things. We will look forward and try to play forward at every occasion, but that can't happen all the time. 'There are areas where we will have space to go and attack, there are areas where it might be harder. We will have to be patient to get the areas where we think we can work at being successful.'When asked whether he had a message for supporters to replicate that patience, the former Celtic boss said: 'That would be handy if they could. 'But fans come along to lose their inhibitions, shout and scream. They want to see goals. 'If the weather was scorching hot, they would maybe be more patient but I don't think it's going to be like that. I think the fans will be wanting something to warm them up right away.

Strachan has his own cautionary tale from May 1991 when Scotland laboured away to international newcomers San Marino in a European qualifier before the then Leeds midfielder broke the deadlock from the spot in the 63rd minute, on their way to a 2-0 win. 'It wasn't an easy ride, that's for sure,' Strachan said. 'I have taken a lot of penalties in big games but that one was really pressurised because I didn't want to be remembered as the guy that missed a penalty against San Marino. 'We had some good players playing in that team and it took a corner-kick and a penalty.' Strachan's side have made a positive start to the group with a draw in Poland and victory over the Republic of Ireland putting them in a decent position, although their two main rivals for second spot - assuming Germany will win Group D - previously stole a march by taking points off the world champions. Strachan believes Gibraltar, who pick their team from a population of about 30,000, are a more difficult challenge than when they began their competitive international campaign.

Strachan said: 'In the first couple of games of the championship, the excitement was so great, but you could see in the Germany game there was a bit of reality about it. The world champions only scored four goals. 'Four goals is definitely enough to win a game of football, that's for sure, but that's the improvement we have seen from the first couple of games. You get over that initial excitement of just being there and then you want to be hard to beat, and I think that's the stage Gibraltar will be at.' Hull's Allan McGregor was not present at training, although Strachan said earlier that he could pick any one of his three goalkeepers and 'not lose any sleep'.","Scotland face Gibraltar in European Championship qualifier on Sunday .

"Rangi Chase says he would be happy to switch to full-back for Salford, revealing he grew up playing the role in rugby union. The former Castleford and England stand-off won the Man of Steel award in 2011 for his brilliant displays with the number six on his back but an injury crisis has left the Red Devils without three specialist full-backs for Saturday's game against Catalans Dragons in Perpignan. Coach Iesytn Harris has called up youngster Jon Ford in the absence of Kevin Locke, Niall Evalds and Ben Jones-Bishop but admits he is considering moving Chase into the full-back spot. Rangi Chase, pictured in action for England in 2013, could  be set to play at full-back for Salford . 'I'll play wherever,' Chase said. 'I grew up playing full-back in rugby union, so I'm not unfamiliar with it. 'Obviously I've not played there for a while but, if I do get put there, I will have to adjust. 'Obviously when we're attacking it doesn't bother me but defensively you've got to make sure you're in the right spots. I've got to make sure my communication is right if I'm back there.' Chase stepped into the full-back role towards the end of last Saturday's game against Hull after Evalds went off with a pulled hamstring and Harris believes he could perform the role from the start against the Dragons. 'Rangi is a versatile player,' Harris said. 'He can play a little bit of nine if he has to, he can play in the halves, he can play at full-back. He's a natural footballer and he generally creates opportunities wherever he plays on the field. 'And he's very much a team player, he wants to do what's best for the team. The most important thing is Rangi being on the field. It's trying to get the balance right within the team.' Wherever he plays on Saturday, Chase's duel with the Catalans' Australian playmaker Todd Carney promises is a mouthwatering prospect, although the player himself is playing it down. 'I'm not bothered if it's Todd Carney or if it's someone else,' Chase said. 'I'm not worried about him and I'm sure he's not worried about me. At the end of the day, I'll just focus on my own game.' Chase was in masterful form as he steered Salford to their first win of the season against Hull but he admits they will be to take a step up against a Dragons team who are near invincible at the Stade Gilbert Brutus. 'It was a good win in the end,' Chase said. 'We had to dig deep for each other and hopefully we can take some confidence from that. We need to build again. 'It is tough going there. They'are an aggressive side and, when they're at home, they grow even more with their support. 'I think the squad they have is the best they've had since I've been here so I'm looking forward to that.'","Rangi Chase reveals he grew up playing full back in rugby union .

"Queensland Reds player Karmichael Hunt was suspended for six weeks by the Australian Rugby Union, ordered to undergo a drug rehabilitation program and fined A$30,000 (£15,200) after admitting to cocaine possession Thursday. 28-year-old Hunt pleaded guilty in a Gold Coast court to four charges of possessing cocaine after purchasing 12.5 grams (0.4 ounces) of the drug from Sept. 1 to Oct. 3 when he was playing for the Australian Football League's Gold Coast Suns, an Australian rules football team. In court, he was fined $1,950 (£1,500) but had no conviction recorded. Hunt, who has also played in the National Rugby League, bought the drugs from a former professional rugby league player. Karmichael Hunt pleaded guilty in a Gold Coast court to four charges of possessing cocaine . The Reds, who signed Hunt to a three-year Super Rugby contract late last year, suspended the fullback on Feb. 20 when the drug investigation was first announced. The ARU and Queensland Rugby Union said that since Hunt had already missed two weeks of play while awaiting his court case, he will return during Super Rugby's eighth round. He will be allowed to train at the Reds practice facility at Ballymore at times when the rest of the squad is not there. 'We are extremely disappointed in Karmichael's actions as illicit substances have no place in rugby,' ARU chief executive Bill Pulver said. 'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.' The Reds also said Hunt would no longer be a vice-captain of the team. 'I intend to work through the education and rehabilitation program and will return to the game in a way that sends a clear message to sports fans of all ages that the use of illicit substances has no place in sport,' Hunt said in a statement provided by the Reds. Hunt says he was relieved wiht the outcome and admitted it has been difficult for him and his family . Speaking outside court before his ARU suspension was announced, Hunt said he was relieved with the outcome. 'It's been a difficult couple of weeks for me and my family,' he said. 'We're looking forward to putting this process behind us.' In court, Hunt was provided with character references from several sports officials, including seven-time NRL premiership coach Wayne Bennett of the Brisbane Broncos. Hunt's lawyer Alastair McDougall told the court his client had shown remorse by pleading guilty. 'He's suffered enormous economic loss,' McDougall said. 'His two young daughters, with a third on the way, must grow up knowing their father has broken the law.' The same investigation which implicated Hunt also resulted in notices being served to eight current or former members of the Gold Coast Titans NRL team. Two of those players, Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling, also had their cases initially dealt with on Thursday, but they'll return to court at a later date. Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission also issued an arrest warrant for former Titan Steve Michaels, who is playing for Hull in England's Super League.

"Radical new proposals including law changes and possible punishments for team doctors are being drawn up in a bid to halt a shocking 900 per cent increase in reported concussions ahead of this year’s World Cup. High-profile incidents suffered by players during the current Six Nations — including Wales wing George North, England full-back Mike Brown and Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien — have reignited concerns over the extent of concussion in professional rugby and how the potentially fatal injury is handled. A recent RFU audit revealed reported rates of concussion were 59 per cent higher during the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season than the previous year, with 10.5 concussions occurring every 1,000 player hours. Full-back Mike Brown suffered a heavy blow to the head in England's victory over Italy . But figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show the rate of reported concussions for the current Six Nations stand at 25 per 1,000 player hours after three rounds — more than double the RFU’s figure and almost 10 times the number reported a decade ago. ‘It’s a massively high number and it’s causing significant concern across the sport,’ said one insider at the governing body, World Rugby. ‘Something needs to be done because the World Cup is coming up and the eyes of the world will be on rugby. Concussion is unquestionably the biggest issue facing the sport.’ Significant strides have been made by the sport’s governing bodies in recent times, with a compulsory education programme introduced in the Aviva Premiership at the start of this season and a gradual introduction of pitch-side video technology for medics to access. Brown was ruled out of Ireland game after failing stage three of the return to play concussion protocol – a process all players must undergo after suffering head injuries . World Rugby bosses, aware of potentially damaging long-term effects of multiple concussions to players and desperate to avoid potentially crippling legal action seen in the NFL, have also instituted an extensive education programme. And they are in the processes of drawing up a legally binding document to ensure strict player welfare guidelines are adhered to at the World Cup. But there are fears the current measures do not go far enough and The Mail on Sunday understands World Rugby chiefs have agreed the introduction of further medical protocols ahead of the World Cup which include: . Wales admitted George North should have been removed from play after being knocked unconscious . Rugby union has been on high alert since the NFL agreed to pay out close to a billion dollars to more than 4,000 former gridiron stars with neurodegenerative conditions linked to multiple concussions and the latest figures will do little to ease concern. This week, World Rugby’s head of medicine Dr Martin Raftery presented to the world governing body’s executive committee when the proposal to draw up a worldwide group of players, coaches, referees, doctors and medics with a remit to look at law changes to reduce concussion rates was ratified. ‘We are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem,’ said Dr Raftery. ‘If we had started the prevention programmes five years ago, we would have been saying, “We need to get it down from five [concussions per 1,000 hours]. Now we know it’s going to be at least 10.5 if not more and I think we’ll see another increase. We are getting far better compliance around concussion but we don’t believe we have finished this process. We’ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area. If there’s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we’ll investigate it.’ There was widespread criticism of the Wales medical team for failing to spot two incidents in which North appeared to be knocked unconscious but was allowed to play on. A World Rugby concussion panel — comprising Dr Raftery and some of the world’s leading brain injury experts — accepted the Welsh medical team’s explanation that they were unsighted for both incidents, although questions remain as to why no one among the team’s backroom staff, some with access to BBC broadcast footage, alerted the medics. ‘The Welsh didn’t have to co-operate but they were extremely co-operative,’ said Raftery. ‘They were also extremely embarrassed about what happened.’ Concerns also persist that so-called ‘independent’ match-day doctors in the Six Nations are often employees of the home union and therefore highly unlikely to challenge or even over-rule a team doctor if they believe a serious breach in protocol has occurred. ‘They will have to be fully independent match-day doctors at the World Cup,’ said Raftery. ‘Every other match day appointment is independent so why not doctors? Imagine if England were playing Australia and the match-day doctor was English and decided that Israel Folau should come off with 20 minutes left even if the Wallaby team doctors said he was fine. There would be absolute outcry. We have to avoid that scenario. ‘The match day doctor has the ability to over-rule team doctors but I’d hope they would look to work together.’ Exeter Chiefs have announced a new research programme to investigate effects of concussion on their players, while Saracens are also trialling micro-chip technology to assess the extent of forces their players are being exposed to.","Reported concussions for current Six Nations are more than double the rate for the the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season .

"When England crashed out of the last global limited-overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the Netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing World Twenty20. Fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match, this time against Afghanistan, where England have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match. Ashley Giles will not need reminding that a dispirited England lost to Holland in Bangladesh and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage. Peter Moores talks to his players before an England nets session at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday . Moores (centre) chats with captain Eoin Morgan as England prepare for their final Cricket World Cup match . Indications are Peter Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘minnows.’ The fact England turned up early on Wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something, anything, from their worst ever World Cup. England are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an Australian nation who cannot believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their World Cup so soon. Victory against an Afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of Pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an England team who are still coming to terms with what they have done. England's Stuart Broad runs with a rugby ball during the training session on Wednesday . The England team gather round in a huddle as they prepare for the dead rubber against Afghanistan . But for Moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month that will be named on Tuesday. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, when they face Afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot. Both will be assessed when England get home. In their absence it is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup in James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, not least before both could then be making their final one-day international appearances. England's Chris Jordan bowls during the nets session at Sydney Cricket Ground . Morgan warms up ahead of a full training session in Sydney on Wednesday . If England are serious about ever making an impact in one-day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in them persevering in 50-over cricket beyond Friday with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara and the senior trio of Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, who yesterday insisted he wants to play on. A dead rubber against Afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical World Cup record as themselves – just a single victory against Scotland. There was a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team at the SCG on Wednesday in the avuncular form of coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman who has ignored security advice to work in Kabul. Moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated England before – when he coached New Zealand in the Champions Trophy – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland. Moores (left) and England vice-captain Jos Buttler are pictured in discussion on the field . Bangladesh celebrate after sealing an upset victory against England at the Adelaide Oval on Monday . ‘England are not in the best of nick and we still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order,’ said Moles. ‘If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock. ‘I’m obviously sad to see England’s demise but I’m delighted to be here with Afghanistan. We’ve had some great learning experiences, had our first win and gave Sri Lanka a scare. This has been a shop window for Afghan cricket and I think we’ve made friends. We play with a freedom that I’ve tried to enhance.’ It is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in England’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home. Otherwise they will lose as many friends as the Afghans have gained.","England take on Afghanistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday .

"Ross Barkley believes he needs to wise up to recapture his edge after admitting he has fallen below the standards of his dazzling debut season. The Everton midfielder lit up Roberto Martinez’s first campaign in charge and was instrumental in helping his side reclaim a place in Europe; his form was so good that he broke into England’s squad and went to the World Cup in Brazil. This time around, though, things have not been so straightforward. Barkley began the campaign by damaging his medial ligaments and he has struggled to recapture his swagger, playing in unfamiliar roles out on the wing.

But Barkley looked sharper after he came on as a substitute in Sunday’s 3-0 win over Newcastle and he restored some confidence by scoring the final goal. He maintains the education has been beneficial and is determined to have a string finish to the campaign, starting in Kiev on Thursday. ‘It has been a tough season for me,’ said Barkley. ‘I’m still learning and I am still a young lad. Every game is different and because last year was my first full season in the Premier League and then maybe no one really knew about me. ‘Maybe this season they know part of my game and it is up to me to learn and adapt. If people think they know what I am going to do, I have to come up with something different and have other options. ‘Our season hasn’t been the best and everyone else is still learning, but hopefully this season will be a good experience for me. I know I haven’t been at my best but the gaffer will give us confidence in training saying he knows what we are capable of. ‘All the backroom staff and the more vocal lads in the team like Gareth Barry, Sylvain Distin, Jags, Bainesy, Tim Howard – all the older lads in the team, the most experienced ones, they help us because they have all been through similar experiences. Listening to what they say helps.’ Barkley looked sharper after he came on as a substitute in Sunday’s 3-0 win over Newcastle at Goodison Park . Everton manager Roberto Martinez pictured during their 3-0 win against Newcastle . For all that things have not gone as Barkley would have wanted, both from a personal and club perspective, he has never gone into hiding during games and that was shown against Newcastle; before he scored his goal, Barkley had missed a clear chance. ‘I am always going to try and want the ball,’ said Barkley. ‘That is the way I have been brought up through the academy. Even if I make a mistake, I will keep wanting the ball because I know eventually things will click together and I will create chances and the goals will come. ‘I feel like this can be a turning point for me and the team. All the lads were buzzing, we got three points and you could see the crowd were happy as well. Everyone is getting on with each other and we are looking forward to the games coming up, gathering some points and climbing up the table.’ Before Everton’s next Barclays Premier League assignment against Queens Park Rangers, they can book a place in the Europa League quarter-finals if they preserve the 2-1 advantage they secured against Dynamo Kiev last Thursday. ‘We are going to approach it the way we approach every game,’ said Barkley. ‘We did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game. We have to be positive and give our all.’","Ross Barkley lit up Roberto Martinez's first campaign in charge .

"Paris St Germain will NOT be able to appeal Zlatan Ibrahimovic's dismissal during Wednesday night's tempestuous Champions League clash with Chelsea. The Sweden striker was given a straight red for a foul on Oscar in the first half of a 2-2 draw which sent the French side through to the last eight on away goals.

In England, the situation is different.

The Blues were eliminated from the competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals.

"Steve Bruce has brought an end to the uncertainty surrounding his future at Hull City after agreeing a new three-year deal. The Tigers boss was previously on a rolling 12-month contract at the KC Stadium - meaning he always had one year to run – but he will now put pen to paper on a long-term extension.

"This is the sickening moment a youth team footballer knocks out his opponent on the pitch. With the ball long gone, the shocking footage shows the Morecambe U18s striker appearing to launch his right fist into the temple of unaware Oldham Under 18s starlet Jack Tuohy. The sucker punch – creating a disturbing audible moment of impact - sends Tuohy, who had his back turned, crashing to the turf and seemingly unconscious. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the sickening punch that knocks out Oldham youngster . Jack Touhy is struck from behind in the head, apparently with no provocation, by an opponenent . The Oldham youth player is knocked from his feet as he is knocked out by the punch . Tuohy later went to hospital after beginning to feel sick while his opponent was shown the red card for his staggering act of violence. The dramatic clip was taken during the second-half of Oldham's 7-2 victory over Morecambe at the club's Chapel Road Training Ground on Saturday. One witness said: 'It was Morecambe's number nine who lost it. Minutes earlier he had elbowed one of the Oldham lads in the face. The ref didn't see it and Oldham took the player off because he was bleeding and he had lost it. 'Then the ball has gone and the same lad just whacks another Oldham player in the face as he has his back turned and is running away. The striker had reportedly also elbowed an opponent just a few moments before . The Morecambe No 9 keeps running past the young Oldham star as if nothing had happened . 'In years and years of watching football I have never seen anything like it.' The witness added: 'I don't think the ref saw this one either but the Oldham players came running over and the linesman ran onto the pitch. 'He then sent the Morecambe lad off.' Oldham declined to comment on the incident but Sportsmail understands Tuohy was sent home after being checked over at hospital later on Saturday. After the game he tweeted: 'Good 7-2 win good to get a goal and head is killing me now wow.'

"Jenson Button has called for patience from McLaren's fans as the team head into the unknown following a tough winter of pre-season testing. Of the nine teams on display over the three four-day tests these past few weeks, McLaren suffered the ignominy of finishing bottom of the pile in terms of kilometres and laps covered. That was perhaps not too unexpected given the team's switch to Honda power units from this term, with the Japanese manufacturer the new kids on the block and a year behind in development of the complicated system compared to Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault. Jenson Button has called for patience from McLaren fans after a tough winter of pre-season testing . The major surprise was just how few laps McLaren managed overall - just 177, less than half of another surprise team in eighth on the list in Red Bull who chalked up 359. With this weekend's season-opening Australian Grand Prix approaching fast, at present there are doubts as to not only the pace of the McLaren-Honda, but also whether Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen - standing in for Fernando Alonso - will even see the chequered flag. As ever, though, Button's enthusiasm is boundless as he said: 'I'm so excited to be back in Melbourne. 'After the ups and downs of 2014, I feel the challenge of 2015 is a completely new chapter in my career and I'm totally up for it. 'I also love Melbourne. It's a fantastic city with great people and the atmosphere is always buzzing, and Albert Park is the perfect place for the season-opener. 'While we know the city and the circuit well, what is more of an unknown is how we will fare in the MP4-30. Button drives his McLaren car during day two of winter testing in Montmelo last month . 'McLaren-Honda have been working incredibly hard over the winter, and although we would, of course, have liked to cover more miles in Jerez and Barcelona, I can definitely see a difference in the car from the first day to the last. 'The team's commitment to development and improvement, in Woking and in Japan, is astonishing, and despite some tricky days in testing we are seeing definitive progress. 'The car is a solid base which gives me optimism we will get there, we just need patience.' Button appreciates this weekend may be a tough one for all the team, but the 35-year-old will be giving it everything to gain a result. 'Melbourne is always a fascinating spectacle, nobody quite knows where they'll be in comparison to their rivals,' added Button . Button celebrates after winning the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in March 2012 . 'Even though the other teams are in the second year of the turbo era, all of the development from last year has been done very much behind the scenes, so I don't think anyone has quite shown their full hand yet. 'For us, the race at Albert Park will be a huge learning curve, but I'll be working flat-out with my engineers to get the car set up as best we can. 'Together we'll fight right until the last moment to get the most out of the weekend.' The fact there is also no Alonso serves as another blow to the team, with the Spaniard advised by doctors not to compete this weekend in the wake of sustaining concussion from a heavy crash in testing. There are a number of observers who feel not all has been explained as to the reason behind the crash and just why he spent three days in hospital for mild concussion when all tests came back clear. Fernando Alonso waves as he leaves hospital in Sant Cugat, Spain after a crash during testing last month . With Alonso poised to return to the cockpit for the next race later this month in Malaysia, Button said: 'Fernando not being able to race is a real shame. 'I just hope he makes a speedy recovery so that he can get behind the wheel again very soon. 'But it's great to see Kevin back in the car, though, and I know he'll do a great job in Fernando's absence, so I wish him well this weekend.'","McLaren have had a tough winter of pre-season testing .

"Searching for clues to the recent decline of Angel di Maria, the break-in that occurred at his house in January cannot be overlooked. Di Maria’s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. He wasn’t getting hooked at half-time before this event. Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family’s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened. Di Maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new, high-level apartment following their traumatic experience.

"Two weeks of pent-up angst erupted during a full-throttle training game as England prepared to take out their frustration on Scotland. Defeat in Dublin in their last RBS Six Nations outing led to a prolonged post-mortem and fostered collective unrest, which came to a head three days before their next fixture, at Twickenham. The desire to produce a backlash in the Calcutta Cup encounter led to a feisty 15-a-side match at England’s HQ on Wednesday, overseen by Test referee JP Doyle. England head coach Stuart Lancaster instructs his squad during a training session on Wednesday . The England squad played out a fiercely committed training match on Wednesday ahead of facing Scotland . Head coach Stuart Lancaster said afterwards: ‘I had to calm it down, blow the whistle at the end and make sure we didn’t play the game too early.’ He was delighted by the players’ commitment and the calibre of opposition provided to a Test XV featuring two changes — with Mike Brown and Courtney Lawes recalled, as reported by Sportsmail. ‘The (non-starting) pack was Mako (Vunipola), Tom Youngs, Kieran Brookes, Parling, Kruis, Easter, Wood and Kvesic — who came in today as cover,’ said Lancaster. ‘You can see the quality of the players who were training against the starting XV. George Ford runs with the ball during a committed and well fought training match at England HQ . Mike Brown, who suffered concussion against Italy, is back in the starting XV for England on Saturday . Bath's Sam Burgess impressed head coach Stuart Lancaster as he took part in England training . ‘Both sides had an edge about them. The non-XV, if you like, had a point to prove but also wanted to create some intensity in the session, particularly at the breakdown, to make sure we were accurate as a team. ‘They did that and were a huge challenge for us defensively. We had talked in the review of the Ireland game about being accurate at the breakdown and sharp. Those components came into play and it was the type of session you need sometimes in the lead up to a big game.’ Asked if the coaches sought to nurture the needle which was in evidence yesterday, Lancaster added: ‘You look for it, and the players were in the right place for today. I’ve been in training weeks where it’s been like that — and you have to make sure that translates to match day. The England players played out some pent up frustration during a bruising training session . England: M Brown; A Watson, J Joseph, L Burrell, J Nowell; G Ford, B Youngs; J Marler, D Hartley, D Cole, D Attwood, C Lawes, J Haskell, C Robshaw (capt), B Vunipola. Subs: T Youngs, M Vunipola, K Brookes, G Parling, T Wood, R Wigglesworth, D Cipriani, B Twelvetrees. ‘We wanted to put the starting team under pressure so that they get used to making decisions under pressure and the more you can replicate that in training, hopefully when the game comes around, it comes easy.’ Lancaster conceded that England needed to clear the air with a no-holds-barred session. What he also needed was to see some of his fringe squad operating at that intensity, so he paid close attention to Exeter centre Henry Slade and Bath’s cross-code recruit Sam Burgess. Lawes has been reinstated in the second row at the expense of George Kruis and he confirmed that training yesterday had been combative. ‘It was tough,’ said the Northampton lock. ‘The boys were certainly up for it, which is what you want going into a game like this. You need to be on edge. It showed out there that we were certainly up for it at the weekend.’ This is not music to Scottish ears. England have been stewing, they are wound up and desperate to right the wrongs of Dublin. They’ve scrapped it out among themselves, now they’re primed to tear into Vern Cotter’s strugglers.

"Arsene Wenger has chosen Martin Keown's confrontation with Ruud van Nistelrooy as his most memorable moment in Arsenal's rivalry with Manchester United - and admitted he doesn't know where his FA Cup-winners medals are. Arsenal and United have had plenty of heated battles with Wenger referencing the infamous 'Battle of Old Trafford' incident as the one that stands out.

Arsenal and United have enjoyed an intense rivalry in the cup down the years and are only separated by a point in the Barclays Premier League. Ahead of Monday's clash, Wenger admitted he didn't know where his FA Cup medals from previous successes were. 'Medals, I don't even know where there are,' said Wenger. 'That tells you that I don't look back. The human side of the game is more important to me as opposed to the medals. 'I prefer a box of memories. In this job, you have a big influence in people's lives, they have a big influence in your life as well. 'At the top top level, these are special people - that remains longer with you than the medal, it's not the only thing that matters. 'You want to think you can have a positive influence on people lives, the club and the style of play.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger oversees training at the club's base in Colney on Monday . Wenger will attempt to outwit United manager Louis van Gaal, who has been criticised recently, but the Frenchman reserved special praise for the Dutchman. 'I think he's a great manager,' said Wenger. 'If you look at what he's done in his career, its incredible. He's stabilised the club. They've only lost two in 18 games. The job is more demanding now. Every game now is a trial where you judged before and after.' Arsenal's intense rivalry with United was defined for years by Wenger's clashes with Sir Alex Ferguson. 'I'm much happier to see him now than before,' Wenger added. 'In the end, it became more peaceful and respectful. He was not always objective defending his time, nor was I.

And it was the Celtic centre-half who was left bearing the brightest grin as his side clinched Ronny Deila's first trophy as Parkhead boss with a 2-0 win at the National Stadium. Van Dijk said: 'It was quite a tough week. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. 'It would have been very disappointing if I'd not been allowed to play on Sunday, especially with it being my first final ever. 'But you know, justice was served and I was able to play.

But for now the 23-year-old is happy to enjoy Celtic's treble chase. 'It means a lot to have lifted the League Cup,' he said. 'It's my first cup trophy ever.

However, Jackie McNamara's team will go for revenge when the sides meet for part three of their four-game duel with Wednesday's Scottish Cup replay.

"Manu Tuilagi's recovery from a persistent groin injury remains a distant prospect and the wrecking-ball centre is racing to be fit to play any further rugby this season. The 23-year-old has not played since being forced off during Leicester’s Champions Cup tie against Ulster last October. The initial prognosis was that he would be sidelined for six to eight weeks, but that was soon exposed as wishful thinking. A series of target dates for his comeback have come and gone, and now it appears Tuilagi won’t resurface until the last month of the season — if at all. Manu Tuilagi has not featured since injuring his groin playing for Leicester back in October . The England centre is in a race against time to be fit for the World Cup, starting in September . Sportsmail understands he is setting his sights on playing four or five games for the Tigers in late April and May, but only time will tell if that ambition can be realised. England were already resigned to being without their midfield colossus for the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign, but having had Tuilagi in camp to oversee his rehabilitation, the management are aware that he is not close to being match-ready. The latest bulletin represented another setback in an alarmingly drawn-out recovery. ‘He is making good progress and is doing straight line running, but he still has some way to go,’ said head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of another Calcutta Cup encounter which will not feature Tuilagi. ‘I think he’ll come good at the end of the season. Certainly Phil Pask (physio) has done a good job with him, but it’s not in the near future. By the end of the season he’ll be back playing. ‘It is about making sure his groin and the healing around it is strong enough to cope with the forces he puts through it. He is a powerful man and he needs to make sure the groin has healed sufficiently. It is a step-by-step process to make sure he does not re-injure it, so that is why people are very cautious.’ Leicester and England are keen to build their attacking game around Tuilagi’s forceful ball-carrying but the pattern in the last two years has been for longer spells injured than fit. He has made only four appearances for the Tigers this season, following a modest tally of 10 last season in a campaign disrupted by a prolonged recovery from a pectoral injury. Tuilagi is a destructive figure but when he breaks down it takes a long time for his powerful body to heal. In early December, his club’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, predicted an imminent return and outlined just what Leicester and England were missing. ‘Manu should be back by the end of December,’ he said at the time. ‘In the modern game you’ve got to be able to dent the line of the opposition — you need physicality and Manu gives you that. He has been huge for England. The midfield is the biggest problem England have and Manu gives you that one position solved.’ Tuilagi could make a return in the final month of the season but his World Cup place is in jeopardy . Tuilagi has struggled with injury over the past two seasons and has only played nine Tests since 2012 . Worryingly for Lancaster and his assistants, uncertainty over Tuilagi’s ability to withstand the rigours of his profession remains part of the problem. In 2012, he played 10 times for his country, culminating in a devastating contribution to the record win over the All Blacks at Twickenham. Since then he has made only nine Test appearances, four of them as a replacement and one of those for the Lions on a tour where his impact was undermined by yet another injury. Despite attempts to alleviate his condition using prolotherapy — involving injections of a sugar solution into the bone — it is thought that a recent improvement has been brought about by intensive physiotherapy. Leicester will hope his best-case scenario of a return for the business end of the season ignites their Aviva Premiership title challenge, while England will want Tuilagi to join their initial World Cup training squad in June, ready to play a full, active part. England head coach Stuart Lancaster confirmed Tuilagi is no closer to making a return . Lancaster oversees training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England will line up against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . He remains the most potent weapon in the team’s back-line, when available. He can splinter the best defences and has even spooked the All Blacks with his explosive exploits in midfield. That continues to be the primary area of concern for Lancaster despite the advances made by Jonathan Joseph during this championship, to the extent that Henry Slade and Sam Burgess have been under close scrutiny in camp this week. That pair are seen as World Cup contenders. Billy Twelvetrees appears to be running out of chances to prove his Test credentials at 12, Luther Burrell is striving to claim that position and Kyle Eastmond appears to have been tried and discarded. Lancaster has said Tuilagi will be considered at inside centre, if that is the position to fill, while he was even shunted out to the wing in New Zealand last June. Whatever the number on his back, England will surely pick him, but by now they would ideally have spent ample time fine-tuning their centre combination. Instead, if Tuilagi is eventually cleared for a comeback, there will be a maximum of three pre- tournament friendlies to reintegrate him before the main event comes around.","Manu Tuilagi has not played since October after injuring groin for Leicester .

"Leighton Baines may have been an Everton defender for eight years, but it seems he still isn't quite sure who is in charge of what at the club. Baines, who is currently out of the side because of an injury, was a pundit for ITV's coverage of his team's 2-1 win over Dinamo Kiev. But when asked about how his team defend from corners, following Oleg Gusev's first half header, Baines seemed completely stumped over who makes the decisions - even though he has played 63 times under manager Roberto Martinez. Oleg Gusev heads home Dynamo Kiev's first goal, with no player on the near post for Everton . Gusev celebrates, but Leighton Baines was unsure as to why there was no-one defending on the line . 'I'm not too sure,' said Baines, when asked whether it was Tim Howard's decision not to have a man on the near post at corners, or if the orders came from Martinez. 'We get the organisation before the game from the manager and the assistant manager before the game, so I'm not too sure who makes the final call.' What Baines was confident about was that the defending wasn't good enough. 'There's shades of the goal we conceded against Arsenal as well,' he added. Everton bounced back from the early set-back, as goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku saw them take a lead from the first leg. Baines has been at the club for eight years, but still doesn't seem sure who calls the shots at Everton .","Leighton Baines was a pundit for Everton's win over Dynamo Kiev .

Wenger faces the club he first managed in 1987 on Tuesday night when Arsenal try to overturn their 3-1 defeat from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. The Frenchman left Monaco in 1994, six years after winning the Ligue 1 title in his debut season, but Wenger will put sentiment aside as he tries to inflict defeat on the club he still remembers fondly.

Arsenal boss Wenger walks on the pitch at the Stade Louis II on Monday night ahead of his team's match . Wenger, ahead of his first competitive return to Monte Carlo, said: 'For me personally, it’s a very special moment. 'I was a young coach here and was here for seven years. But tomorrow we have a Champions League game and the experience I gained here can help me. 'I am able to separate the importance of the game for my club and the pleasure I have at coming back. 'The best way to enjoy it most is to do well and to turn it around. 'My real pleasure would be to come back here more to see friends when there is not a match. I’m here for work and job is for the club to win. 'I have lots of respect for Monaco and I want to thank the club because they gave me my chance as a young trainer.' Wenger's seven years in Monaco saw him deliver the title in 1988 and the Coupe de France in 1991, but he will have to make history again on Tuesday night if Arsenal are to qualify. No team in the Champions League era have come back from a two-goal home deficit in the first leg and gone through. The last team to do so was Ajax in 1969 when they came from behind against Benfica and went through following a replay. Even worse for Arsenal is Monaco have not conceded three goals at home in a match for three-and-a-half years, and Wenger has his work cut out for him at his former club.

"So Everton continue to fly England’s flag in Europe and there is no sense they are ready for this adventure to end. This has been a hugely frustrating domestic campaign, one in which Everton have lurched to the brink of calamity. But the Europa League has provided excitement and opportunity and did so again, with Everton now 90 minutes away from the last eight. True, it will be difficult to get there. Allowing Dynamo Kiev to score an away goal means Everton will require a performance of strength and discipline in Ukraine next week but at least they can travel with confidence thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s 82nd-minute penalty. Romelu Lukaku celebrates his late penalty which gives Everton a precious lead ahead of next week's return leg in the Ukrainian capital . After a long wait, a nervy Lukaku put the ball to Oleksandr Shovkovskiy's left and his penalty just about beat the keeper to nestle in the net . Steven Naismith celebrates his leveller as the Scot's instinctive finish restored parity before the break after great work from  Lukaku . Naismith coolly slips the ball beyong the onrushing Oleksandr Shovkovsky to raise the roof at an expectant Goodison Park .

MOTM: Jagielka . Ratings by Dominic King . Steven Naismith’s goal had dented Kiev’s hopes of a first win in England in 12 visits but, more importantly, it showed Everton’s appetite to fight. On a filthy night when the rain tumbled relentlessly, it would have been easy for them to buckle. As it was, they kept going. There were excellent performances, not least from captain Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry, and there was also courage, not least from Lukaku. His seventh European goal of the campaign may just be the one Roberto Martinez needs to turn things around. ‘It has to be a turning point,’ said the Everton manager. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team. ‘You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know we have a good side.’ Usually for such contests, there is a crackle of anticipation around Goodison Park but things were markedly different. Everton’s dreadful form through a bleak midwinter has left many fans sceptical and miserable performances have sapped their energy. A positive start would have quelled anxieties but Everton, playing in all blue on orders from UEFA to avoid a clash with Dynamo, were sluggish and horribly short of confidence. No one was prepared to take charge or provide a run to open gaps for others. Sensing they could profit, Dynamo began to venture forward with increased purpose, and after 14 minutes they inflicted the kind of blow that Martinez had spoken of with dread in the build-up, a goal to complicate an already difficult task. In many ways, it highlighted Everton’s current ills. Andriy Yarmolenko flung in a corner, James McCarthy was too slow to react and Oleg Gusev nipped in to direct a volley into the roof of the Gwladys Street net. Standing on the touchline in the downpour, Martinez looked shell-shocked. When Sergei Sydorchuk then tested Tim Howard with a shot from 20 yards that skidded off the greasy surface, the groans were becoming louder and there was a definite sense that rebellion was in the air. Naismith finished off some wonderful work from Lukaku to give Everton a foothold in the game. Check out more from Match Zone .

Romelu Lukaku fires in a free-kick but the big Belgian failed to trouble the scoresheet on this occasion . The Dynamo Kiev wall jumps in unison as Lukaku's fizzing effort sails past the men in white and out for a corner . Then, from nowhere, Everton started to play. ‘We gave a cheap goal away but I could not be more proud of our reaction,’ said Martinez. The momentum shifted when Jagielka charged down a loose ball and surged upfield, passing to Lukaku with Dynamo keeper Olexandr Shovkovskiy stranded outside his area. Had Lukaku returned the pass, Jagielka would have had an open goal to aim at but instead the Belgian shot horribly wide. No matter. Everton had a spark and in the next attack, after 37 minutes, Luke Garbutt’s inswinging corner was met flush by Jagielka but the England defender’s header was cleared from under the bar by Danilo Silva. Antolin Alcaraz then smashed the rebound over the bar. Gareth Barry leapfrogs Sergei Sydorchuk as the veteran midfielder battles for possession in the Everton engine room . Kevin Mirallas  and Silva  battle for the ball during a gritty encounter on Merseyside which leaves Everton neatly poised to progress . Lukaku terrorises three Dynamo Kiev players as the Everton talisman attempts to showcase his attacking prowess . This was a significant improvement and soon Everton were level. Lukaku can infuriate with his ability to make the wrong call but his play to create the equaliser for Naismith was outstanding, bull-dozing his way past three challenges before slipping in the Scot, whose finish was admirably cool. As he wheeled away to celebrate, Naismith made a point of signalling to Jagielka and for good reason. He had played a captain’s role, taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving his team forward. His input was crucial. Half-time came but it did not check Everton’s impetus. They came out of the blocks for the second period with purpose and Lukaku’s hulking presence continually unsettled Silva and forced him to make mistakes. One such error led to a corner from which Naismith almost scored with a header. That Naismith missed was not a problem. The mood around the stadium had completely changed. Everton looked dangerous every time they attacked and the suspicion was that Shovkovskiy would buckle if they kept testing him, as the impressive Garbutt did with a fizzing free-kick.

Suddenly it felt like Everton could pinch a lead and so it proved with eight minutes remaining. When Silva handled substitute Leon Osman’s cross, referee Carlos Carballo had no hesitation pointing to the spot. Lukaku did the rest, firing his penalty straight down the middle. Warsaw on May 27, for the moment, remains an aspiration.Lukaku said: ‘The team reacted well after the first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top-class players. It’s up there with my best performances.

"Winston Bogarde has applied for the vacant manager's job at Oldham Athletic. The former Holland international, infamous for four bench-warming years at Chelsea, is one of 70 people who have registered their interest in becoming Lee Johnson's successor at Boundary Park. Bogarde, 44, won a Champions League with Ajax in 1995 but it is the the centre-back's lucrative stint at Stamford Bridge for which he is most remembered in this country. Winston Bogarde spent four unsuccessful years at Chelsea between 2000 and 2004 . Bogarde in an Ajax shirt during Edwin van der Sar's testimonial at the Amsterdam Arena in 2011 . Bogarde celebrates Champions League glory after Ajax beat AC Milan in Vienna in 1995 with team-mates (left-right) Finidi George, Michael Reiziger, Marc Overmars, Nwankwo Kanu, and captain Danny Blind . Picking up a reported £10m, he started just four games under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri and spent his final season commuting from Amsterdam, catching the early flight into Heathrow and training with the youth team at Harlington before his eventual retirement. In 2011, Sportsmail revealed Bogarde was facing financial ruin after his £3.2m luxury home was repossessed. Oldham say they are in no rush to appoint a new man after Johnson left to join League One rivals Barnsley despite being only five points outside the play-offs with a game in hand on most others. They were hammered 4-0 at home by Preston North End on Saturday and head to Port Vale on Tuesday evening again under the guidance of caretaker boss Dean Holden and playing assistant Adam Lockwood. Lee Johnson left League One side Oldham to become manager of Barnsley last week . Oldham have spoken to lifelong fan Paul Scholes about taking the role but admit any agreement with the United legend is unlikely. Former boss Iain Dowie is a fans' favourite but whether the club could give him the funds he feels he needs to take them to the next level is doubtful. Others in the frame include ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, former player Shefki Kuqi and ex-Manchester City coaches Scott Sellars and Steve Eyre.","Former Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde wants to be Oldham manager .

"Stuart McCall says he hopes to be appointed Rangers boss on a long-term basis – after agreeing to join the club until the end of the season. McCall replaces Kenny McDowall with the remit to get the Ibrox club, rejuvenated off the field following Dave King’s successful ousting of the previous board, out of the Championship. And, while he is urging the dozen out-of-contract players at Rangers to concentrate on winning new deals, he made it very clear that he’d like to stay on beyond the summer. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . The former Motherwell boss said: ‘Yes. Regarding the players playing for their futures and new contracts, I’m in the same boat. ‘We’re here for the short term, we know that. But we’ve got an opportunity to put down a marker. If we can do well, who knows what will happen in the future? ‘I’ve enjoyed being back on the training ground. It’s a big, big challenge. Anyone who has seen the side over the last three or four months will know that. But it’s a massive opportunity, privilege and honour.

But look at quality of squad. They know we’ve underperformed. There is enough quality in there to do better. ‘Football can change so quickly. There is no magic pill for confidence, which has severely lacking. But sometimes a new voice can provide a spark. ‘Their main aim should be turning things around. There are 12 boys out of contract, go win yourself a contract. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those . ‘Be there at end of season, going around a full Ibrox to cheers, rather than hurrying down tunnel being booed off.’ McCall spoke to McDowall on Thursday and intends to make contact with former team-mate Ally McCoist, still technically on gardening leave from Rangers. His reign began with hard work on Wednesday, calling the players in on their day off to go through an afternoon training session, explaining: ‘Our aim is to get out of the league. The quicker we could get down to it, better. Stuart McCall (left), who was Scotland assistant under Gordon Strachan, has taken charge at Ibrox . ‘They got a group text at half eleven to come in for half two, which would have been tricky for some of them. We had meeting, set a few things out, went out and trained in lovely rain. ‘To cap it off, the under-20s beat Ross County 6-1, So we’re off to a good start! It was a great to get back on the coaching field and I look forward to progressing. ‘People say they don’t look fit. If you are playing with confidence, you look a yard quicker. Rangers interim chairman Paul Murray said in a statement that McDowall will 'always be welcome' at the club . ‘Off the park, things look to be going great. I’ve always said it’s important to have Rangers people on the board. ‘You don’t need someone Ranger-minded as manager. But somebody who knows the league, knows players, knows Scottish football was probably right choice. ‘In an ideal world, you would want to come in to a club in pre-season. We’ve got to hit the ground running. ‘The supporters don’t want to boo and criticise, they want to get behind the team.

"Arsene Wenger is still haunted by the game which was the catalyst for Manchester United’s greatest ever achievement. It was in 1999, another FA Cup tie, a semi-final. It was at Villa Park, with 90 minutes of a replay having failed to separate the two teams that then dominated English football in that era. United were down to 10 men and Dennis Bergkamp had missed a penalty for Arsenal in the final minute of normal time with the game locked at 1-1. Arsene Wenger looks on dejectedly after losing the FA Cup semi-final replay to Manchester United in 1999 . Dennis Bergkamp (right) missed a penalty in that game in United's treble winning season . Ryan Giggs (right) struck United's winner with a sensational solo effort to send them through to the final . Then on 109 minutes, Patrick Vieira misplaced a pass, Ryan Giggs picked up the ball in his own half and set off on a run which would end up in him revealing an alarming amount of chest hair after scoring one of the great goals in the history of the tournament. In Wenger’s mind, it tipped the balance in the title race and provided the foundation for United to achieve an unprecedented treble of FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League. ‘I can still hear the shouts of that team, having won,’ said Wenger. ‘They couldn’t believe it because they were down to 10 men. And I think that put them in a state of euphoria. In the same way, they won the title — just. ‘I saw that goal again when Giggs retired. I think that goal won them the treble because, if Bergkamp scores, I think the game is over. It was a trauma for us and a positive for them. That goal was certainly what decided their season.’ Wenger still remembers the details of the title run in, saying: ‘They played at Blackburn and we lost at Leeds in the last minute, when Nigel Winterburn was kicked off [the pitch]. Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink scored at the far post and Kaba Diawara hit the bar twice. After that, they won the Champions League final in the last minutes — 1999 was a miracle year for them.’ Bergkamp recalls missing the penalty in his book and admitted it bothered him for a while after the game . Giggs (second left) will now take on Wenger from the dugout as an assistant to Louis van Gaal . Wenger will be hoping to avenge the defeat by beating United in Monday's FA Cup quarter-final . Bergkamp in his book, Stillness And Speed, said: ‘I still took the odd [penalty] without problems, without hesitation and without missing. But that miss did bother me for quite a while and next season Thierry Henry became our penalty taker.’ Ray Parlour, who was interviewed for the same book, said: ‘In those days it was only us and United. Dennis, if he scores that penalty, we win the double because...their heads would have gone down in the league.’ As for Monday, Wenger said: ‘Let’s not consider Man United. Let’s focus on our performance. They play at home where they feel confident. So, to compensate that we have to put more effort in and produce a really top-level performance.’","Arsenal were beaten 2-1 by 10-man Manchester United in 1999 .

"Gareth Bale's first-half brace against Levante on Sunday helped Real Madrid to their first win in three games and also provided the perfect response for the Welshman to some of the recent individual criticism he has faced. World-record signing Bale had not scored in the nine games preceding the clash with Levante and had been the target of plenty of boos and whistles around the Santiago Bernabeu stadium; and following his opening goal on 18 minutes, the winger made a point of venting his frustration, covering his ears and kicking the corner flag.

Mundo Deportivo's match report of Real Madrid's game, meanwhile, centres in on a sub-plot of Bale's renaissance - the seeming unhappiness of team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.

The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Chelsea's advantage grew when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was harshly sent off after 31 minutes. Gary Cahill's strike nine minutes from the end of normal time was cancelled out by former Chelsea defender David Luiz, but the hosts went ahead for a second time through an Eden Hazard penalty early in extra-time.

David Luiz sinks to his knees after the final whistle  with PSG progressing at the expense of his old club . David Luiz 8.5 . Dramatic falls, play-acting, some solid defending and a superb goal. Thiago Silva 8 . Looking like a man who’d walked out of a bar-room brawl, he was imperious at the back until that moment of madness to give away the penalty. Then redeemed himself with in the most glorious manner possible. Javier Pastore 6.5 . Defended with aplomb, supporting Marquinhos whenever he could. Luiz celebrates after scoring the equaliser against his former club at Stamford Bridge . Marco Verratti 7.5 . Sprung forward whenever he could, passed with intent and defending robustly. Thiago Motta 7.5 . Was the team’s foundation stone, marshalling the space in front of the back four; came into his own after the Ibrahimovic sending off. Blaise Matuidi 6.5 . Quikc on the counter, soild in the tackles. Did the job that was asked of him tirelessly. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is beaten by a header from PSG's Thiago Silva . Zlatan Ibrahimovic 5 . He was unfortunate the ref reached for red rather than yellow – but the red-card tackle was undisciplined and un-necessary and put him at risk. Edinson Cavani 7 .

Lavezzi (for Verratti 83) 6 . Rabiot (for Matuidi 83) 6 . Manager . Laurent Blanc 7 . Even when the game plan went to pot after Ibrahimovic’s sending off, PSG remained a discipline defensive block.

"England head coach Stuart Lancaster believes the 'fantastic potential' of Henry Slade will drive his challenge for a place in the World Cup squad. Slade has been called up as midfield cover ahead of Saturday's RBS 6 Nations clash with Scotland after centre Brad Barritt was ruled out of the remaining two rounds by a sprained ankle. Only a late flurry of injuries would see Slade plunged into action in the Calcutta Cup match at Twickenham, but that has not stopped Lancaster looking to the looming World Cup and its warm-up games as the right time to blood the 21-year-old centre and fly-half.

Superb game management, accomplished kicking skills and solid defence have established Slade's reputation in the Aviva Premiership with the Exeter Chiefs and the wait for full international honours may soon be over. 'The more I see him, the more I think he's got fantastic potential. I've always known it having seen him come through the age-group teams,' Lancaster said. 'We have a lot of competition at fly-half, but he's also adept in the centres. That's one of the options I'd like to look at for him in the future. For definite he'll be a part of our World Cup camp. 'In your World Cup squad of 31, you absolutely have to have players who can play in different positions like Henry. You need that flexibility, it's crucial. 'We will have to generate training time before we throw him into a game at international level. Lancaster believes Henry's versatility could be crucial during the World Cup . Lancaster will start his camp for the World Cup, held in England, on June 21 . 'In the very short term we have a chance to do that on Tuesday and Wednesday, which we've done anyway when he's been in camp. 'This Six Nations programme is going to finish in 12 day's time and then our World Cup camp starts on June 21. Then we've got all of June, July and August until we have to make a decision.

"Former Liverpool defender John-Arne Riise has picked his #one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club. It is no surprise that Riise's team is dominated by Liverpool players past and present, as the left back played in the side that won the 2005 Champions League. But World Cup winner and Roma's long-standing captain Francesco Totti gets a worthwhile mention with team-mate Daniele De Rossi, and Fulham's Kieran Richardson also gets a look in too. Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. John-Arne Riise said his former Liverpool team-mate Pepe Reina (centre) was 'always trying to make jokes' GOALKEEPER: Pepe Reina . 'He's the funny one. He's always trying to make jokes and has so much confidence in himself, which to be a goalkeeper you really need to have.' RIGHT-BACK: Steve Finnan . 'The most calm person I've ever seen; never stressed. Not the most defensive right back but I really enjoyed playing with him and never seemed to make any big mistakes.' The quartet of (left to right) Sami Hyypia, Jamie Carragher, Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard were all included . DEFENDER: Jamie Carragher . 'I remember one game against Blackburn [in 2003] and he broke his leg. He didn't want to get carried off, he wanted to walk off. He wanted to carry on playing. He's a proper, proper defender. He's an easy choice. Best defender I've ever played with. DEFENDER: Sami Hyypia . 'Great right foot. Great left foot. Good in the air because he's 2 metres tall. Read the game perfectly. One of the nicest guys I've ever met in football.' Ex-Fulham team-mate Kieran Richardson took up a place as left back as Javier Mascherano also featured . LEFT BACK: Kieran Richardson . 'He was a machine. Very quick, strong, powerful, offensive, defensive. Even if you pass him he was so quick at turning he'd catch you up again. He gave me a big fight [for my position].' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Javier Mascherano . 'He's a dog. I know the opposition hated playing him because he's always on your toes and always tackling you.' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Daniele De Rossi . 'Sees openings and passes that maybe not many other players could see. He will go down as one of Roma's greatest players.' Riise (second right) described his 2005 Champions League winning skipper Gerrard as 'the perfect captain' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Xabi Alonso . 'Probably the pass master. Nobody can pass the ball like him. I remember on his debut at Anfield, it probably took him about 39 minutes before he misplaced a pass. Unbelievable player.' MIDFIELD: Steven Gerrard . 'Best player I've played with without a doubt. I'm really privileged to have played with him because Stevie will go down as the greatest of all time. He's an amazing person also and for me he was the perfect captain.' Roma legend Francesco Totti (left) was one of three non-Liverpool players to be named in Riise's dream team . STRIKER: Francesco Totti . 'The God of Rome. I've never seen anything like it. As a football player he's not quick and he's 38-years old now but he has his technique and ambition, and a touch that's God's gift.' STRIKER: Fernando Torres . 'He has got a bit of stick since he left Liverpool and still has to come back to his best form, but while I was there he was a scoring machine. I think the pressure was too much for him at Chelsea. I think it got to him a little bit and it was too much to handle. I think he's back where he belongs [at Atletico Madrid].'","John-Arne Riise named his #one2eleven XI on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports .

"The soothing tones of Bob Marley drifted through the air at Stamford Bridge as the teams prepared for extra-time. Some were down on their haunches, receiving pellets of information, others flat on their backs receiving muscle rubs. 'Don't Worry 'bout a Thing,' sang Bob. Then Didier Drogba came on. If this were T20 cricket it might have been his theme tune, a special request on his 37th birthday. Why worry? This was all under control. Never in doubt. Someone seemed to be guiding Chelsea on a celestial path into the last eight. Was it Eden Hazard? Thibaut Courtois? Bjorn Kuipers? Bob Marley and the Wailers? Jose Mourinho and the Wailers? Or another other-worldly force. Chelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the Champions League at home to PSG . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho looks furious on the touchline after watching his team twice concede a lead . Turned out it was none of them. Turned out there was something to worry about. That something was Paris Saint-Germain, a team with bottle to match their talent. A team which took everything Mourinho could throw their way, scored twice from set-pieces and emerged triumphant. It leaves Chelsea to focus on the Barclays Premier League title. Roman Abramovich looked down from his seat in the West Stand. The Champions League will have to wait for another year. And it leaves English football to contemplate the prospect of no teams in the last eight for the second time in three years. Chelsea can have no complaints. Almost every decision went their way. Still Mourinho had the audacity to shake his head when the fourth official declared two added minutes at the end of extra time. Roman Abramovich looks down from his seat in the West Stand as Chelsea crashed out of Europe . His players left the pitch in scenes reminiscent to the defeat against Barcelona, only this time they would not blame the referee. And it all seemed to be going to plan, When the chaos first descended before half-time, Mourinho snuggled back into his seat alongside Rui Faria in the Chelsea dug-out. A few yards to his right, Laurent Blanc was flapping his arms in despair. On the pitch, David Luiz was in danger of losing control. Story of the game: minute 31, minute 43, minute 58, minute 96, minute 114 as is the fashion at Stamford Bridge. At least, that's how it went on the previous outing, an equally frenzied draw against Burnley, the fall-out of which was still falling out days later. PSG manager Laurent Blanc holds his arms out in the direction of the fourth official as Mourinho looks on . Former Chelsea man David Luiz gestures towards Blues striker Diego Costa during Wednesday's encounter . Here was Mourinho's chaos theory unfolding again. Traps set were stumbled into by PSG, a club still naive to the injustices of this competition in the closing stages, when the teams are so tightly matched, tactics cautious and the importance of decisions by the officials magnified beyond belief. Chelsea learned the hard way over the years but are now among the most seasoned. They break up play, they milk the contact, they circulate the tacklers, they over-react and pressurise the officials. On the side, Jose and the Wailers do their bit. It does not guarantee anything, of course. Not against this calibre of opposition. But every little helps, and their manager understands this better than most. Hence his pre-match posturing and the clear mind to react when the tie tilts and blurs. Edinson Cavani took the ball around Thibaut Courtois (right) but rattled the post with the goal exposed . PSG frontman Cavani reacts after missing the chance to put the Ligue 1 side ahead in the 58th minute . As the first half ended in manic scenes, Mourinho made his decisions. Here was the theory amid the chaos. Off came Oscar, to prevent a second yellow card, to tighten the centre of the pitch with Ramires and to add the fizz of Willian. Cards played, the manager was tenser and prowled his technical area during the second half, his hands sunk into his coat pockets, until it was time to remonstrate and demand more his players. Tighter, faster, they could not allow the tempo to slip against PSG. Edinson Cavani rattled the woodwork. That was minute 58. Perhaps he should have scored. His team-mates threw themselves to the turf in despair. Minute 43 was a penalty Chelsea might have had. Minute 31 was the red card for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was harsh and it might have killed off weaker teams. Not so Paris. They have bottle to go with their ability. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is shown the red card after a collision with Chelsea's Oscar . The 33-year-old heads into this challenge with Oscar (left) in the first-half which got him sent off . The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridg . Chelsea had work to do. They had to stop football breaking out, for one thing, because when it did, the French were better at it. As in Paris, Courtois came under fire as those in front of him started to wilt. It has been an intense campaign and, despite his fears about the relentless intensity of the English game and the way some training sessions are more competitive than the games in French football, Mourinho has been low on rotation. He has relied instead on the rotation enforced by various suspensions. On Thursday night he lost Matic, and the decision to send on Kurt Zouma backfired when they conceded almost immediately. Minute 81 they liked at the Bridge. Minute 86, not so much. When Gary Cahill scored, the first thing Mourinho did was to turn to the crowd and urged calm. Then he sent on Zouma. When Luiz equalised, again he called for calm. This time the message was aimed at his players. Take it into extra-time if necessary, with the extra man. That was the idea. No-one had Minute 114 on their Burnley bingo card. This time the chaos theory did not work. PSG defender  Luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at Stamford Bridge .

"Claims that Tiger Woods is serving a one-month suspension - rebutted by the player's agent and the PGA Tour - have been withdrawn. Woods is taking an indefinite break from golf as he attempts to get his game 'tournament ready' after a poor run of form and injuries. Former Tour player Dan Olsen, who played in 35 Tour events between 1989 and 2011 - missing 22 cuts - alleged in an interview on US radio station 730AM The Game on Friday that Woods was serving a drugs ban, but on Monday retracted his claims and issued an apology to the 14-time major winner. Dan Olsen had alleged in a radio interview that Tiger Woods (pictured) was serving a one month suspension . Olsen has since apologised to Woods and to the PGA Tour for the comments he made . 'I retract the entire interview,' Olsen said in a statement on the radio station's website. 'My comments were ill-advised. I want to apologise to Nike, the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and (Tour commissioner) Tim Finchem.' The allegations had brought a strong denial from the PGA, with PGA Tour executive vice-president and chief marketing officer Ty Votaw issuing a statement. 'There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,' it read. 'We categorically deny these allegations.' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg also quashed the allegations, labelling them 'unequivocally and completely false'. 14-time major championship winner Woods, pictured here in June 2013 at Merion Golf Club, hopes to reclaim his world No 1 status from Rory McIlory when he returns to the sport . 'These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,' he said. 'They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. 'The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.' Woods has not played since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open at the start of February, less than a week after firing a career-worst round of 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.

"At 100-plus kilometres per hour, Molly Taylor's car goes into a sideways slide that has it teetering on the brink of flipping over into an uncontrolled roll. No problem for Ms Taylor. She adjusts the steering wheel, shift's down a gear, and slams her foot on the accelerator to power out of the turn. Meet the young Australian driver who is smashing through the glass ceiling of motorsports. Not literally, of course. Australian Molly Taylor is the only woman competing in the World Rally Championships . Motorsports has always traditionally been a macho industry, but two women are breaking through the glass ceiling with fearless grit and determination . Ms Taylor, 26, is the only woman competing on the World Rally Championship circuit - a competition in which 19 drivers have been killed since it began in the earlier 1970s. She has joined Brit Susie Wolff, the only female Formula One test driver in the world, as women at the top of their chosen sports, both traditionally dominate by men. Both women were born with racing pumping through their veins - their parents worked in the motorsports arena. Although it wasn't expected that they follow in their footsteps - they were certainly never discouraged to take up the male-dominated sport because they were female. Susie Wolff, who now lives in Switzerland, is the only female F1 test driver in the world . Susie Wolff poses with fans before the first practice session at the Formula One Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne . The 32-year-old (right) grew up in the rugged highlands on the west coast of Scotland and rode her first motorbike at the wee age of just two years old . Born and bred in Sydney, both Ms Taylor's parents were competitors in rally car driving but it was her mother who had the most prominent career as a co-driver for Toyota. 'As we were growing up she was the high profile person, even more than my father, so I didn't think that was weird,' she said. 'Dad was at home making our lunches for school while my mum was competing around the country, so I didn't really think that was anything abnormal - I just thought everyone's mums did that. 'So if you have that mindset from the start and then find what you love doing that's what you base it on and everything else happens around you.' Ms Taylor's first taste of being behind the wheel of a rally car was when she was learning to drive and her parents tested out her skills purely for safety purposes. Molly Taylor, 26, (left) and Susie Wolff, 32. (right) have accelerated to the top of their respective motorsports and don't plan on taking the foot of the pedal anytime soon . What a rush: Born and bred in Sydney, both of Ms Taylor's parents were competitors in rally car driving but it was her mother who had the most prominent career . 'I couldn't believe the adrenalin rush and how much fun it was,' she said. 'When you start to enjoy something you get competitive, and when you get competitive you want to win, and then once you win in that category you want to move up - and then you're hooked.' Daily Mail Australia was given exclusive access to Ms Taylor and Ms Wolff in the lead up to the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne - including a heart-stopping ride in the navigator's seat of Ms Taylor's rally car. The most impressive thing to witness was Ms Taylor's unflinching concentration and precisely honed skills, even with the car racing around the track at high speed, with dust flying and the engine screaming. Hundreds of thousands of hard-core rev heads gearing up for the Grand Prix in Melbourne this weekend . Endearingly unassuming about their success, these two know that they have excelled in their fields because they have worked hard - and not because they are just the token females in a man's world . Wolff, who now lives in Switzerland with her husband who heads the Mercedes Benz F1 team, started her love for all things fast not long before she could walk. The 32-year-old grew up in the rugged highlands on the west coast of Scotland and rode her first motorbike at the wee age of just two years old. 'My brother is only 18 months older so I was always of the belief that I could do anything he could do,' she said. Her father owned a motorbike shop and he met his wife-to-be when she walked into buy a set of wheels. Taylor's (right) first taste of being behind the wheel of a rally car was when she was learning to drive and her parents tested out her skills purely for safety purposes . 'When you start to enjoy something you get competitive, and when you get competitive you want to win, and then once you win in that category you want to move up - and then you're hooked,' the 26-year-old (right) said . Now she's a test driver for Williams Martini Racing team and the only woman on the F1 circuit. Ms Wolff said her parents never pressured her into following any particular - her brother, for example, became a film maker. 'I have so much respect for my parents that they allowed us to chase our dreams because we both dropped out of uni to follow our own path and I'll always be thankful for that,' she said. 'There is so much pressure to go along that standard path of go to university and get a job.' Taylor's parents had a similar attitude when their children were growing up. 'My parents would have been exactly the same if I wanted to be a rally driver or a pilot' she said. 'They were just always supportive of whatever my passion was - which happened to be the same as them.' It is believed many more women will climb the motorsport ladder over the years until it eventually becomes the norm . Both women have no doubt that being born with that competitive streak and instilled with a great determination and belief that they can do whatever they put their minds to has helped get them to where they are today. A sense of fearlessness is also very important as both women insist you can't allow that emotion to enter your head if you want to succeed. Taylor has only ever come away with a few scratches and bruises despite facing tough terrain for up to an entire day. 'The car gets hurt more than me - and my wallet hurts too,' Taylor said. 'The moment you are scared you are not thinking about the job.' Wolff echoed those words saying you can't afford to have fear when you are in control of the car. 'I respect that cars go fast and can be dangerous but if you get scared, it's time to stop because you are not concentrating,' she said. Both women have no doubt that being born with that competitive streak and instilled with a great determination and belief that they can do whatever they put their minds to has helped get them to where they are today . Endearingly unassuming about their success, they know that they have excelled in their fields because they have worked hard - and not because they are just the token females in a man's world. Taylor said she has only ever been supported in her career over the past decade. 'I think when I started I was just focused on what I wanted to do and if you come across and act professional and serious about what you do then there's no resistance and you get the same respect back and then you're treated as just one of the boys,' she said. Wolff believes that they are in their roles because they are simply the best people for the job. 'Racing is a very performance-based environment on and off the track,' she said. However, she admits the attention that females attract in the sport is a double-edged sword because the more the word gets out there, the more young girls will be inspired to jump on board. 'It's good that it has been brought across in a positive way but I'm not in racing to prove a point - I'm in racing because I found my passion and I love it.' They have watched the industry evolve over time and believe many more women will climb the motorsport ladder over the years until it eventually becomes the norm. Wolff said it takes generations to see that kind of change but it is happening. 'There are no clear role models - the little girls watching F1 don't see many women so there are not enough girls starting at a young age, she said. 'But I see it changing a lot in F1 - nobody came and said we need more women - the women just came in to do the best possible job,' she said. 'Now there's a lot more women in the paddock which means they were the best for the job.' Taylor is also seeing a significant shift in rally car driving. 'It's certainly something that's changing because it such a difficult sport - you have so many people that start out at the grassroots level and then that filters out as you get higher in the levels - so it's just a matter of time before we see more women progressing all the way up,' she said.","Motorsports have traditionally been male dominated, but not any more .

"Jamaican Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt cruised to victory in his first individual race of the season, clocking 46.37 seconds over 400 metres at the GC Foster Classic in Kingston on Saturday. Bolt, the world record holder at 100 and 200 metres, used the race as part of his build-up for the upcoming season, where he plans to defend his sprint titles at the IAAF world championships in Beijing in August. 'Give thanks for an injury free 400m run,' Bolt, who was slowed by injuries last year, said on his Twitter account. Usain Bolt is looking forward to an injury free season after winning his first race of the year comfortably .

"Thierry Henry has claimed he was unfairly hounded for the infamous handball that cost the Republic of Ireland a place at the 2010 World Cup while Lionel Messi was labelled a 'genius' after a similar incident. The France striker used his hand to control a cross before setting up William Gallas to score the 103rd-minute goal that took France to the finals in South Africa at Ireland's expense. Henry, then a Barcelona player, was heavily criticised for his actions at the time but has pointed out the contrasting reaction when his former Nou Camp team-mate Messi scored with his hand against Espanyol in 2007. Thierry Henry controls the ball with his hand to set up a goal for William Gallas in France's World Cup 2010 play-off with the Republic of Ireland in November 2009 . Henry claims he was vilified after the incident, claiming the reaction was as if he'd 'killed someone' Henry, who now works as a pundit for Sky Sports, claims he was unfairly criticised over his handball . The Arsenal legend told Canal Plus: 'You are talking about people I spent so many times on the pitch with. 'I just said to them, 'Yes, it was hand, I'm sorry.' And you know what? They told me: 'We don't blame you.' 'I saw Liam Brady, the Arsenal legend, and he asked me: 'Did you touch it with your hand?' And I answered, 'Yes, it was my hand.' I spoke to the press that night. I could have ignored them but I didn't. 'I spoke honestly - it was a reflex. A reflex by a competitor, just like when you reach out for the ball on the line when your goalkeeper is beaten. 'When I see Messi scoring against Espanyol, diving to touch the ball with his hand, people say, 'What a genius, now he is closer than ever to Maradona.' But when it was me, it was like I had killed someone.' Lionel Messi scored a goal with his hand in Barcelona's league match with Espanyol back in June 2007 . Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' moment against England at the 1986 World Cup . The 37-year-old, who is now a pundit on Sky Sports, left Barcelona for New York Red Bulls shortly after the handball controversy, which occurred in a qualification play-off, second leg at the Stade de France in Paris. But Henry denies that the storm of criticism following the handball was behind his move. 'I have always wanted to go there,' he said. 'Anyone who knows me would tell you that. Also, to escape what? To escape who? I wanted to go as soon as 2009, but I didn't because I kept playing with the national team. That is total rubblish.'","Arsenal legend believes he was unfairly criticised over handball .

"Unless your name is Rebecca Adlington, Victoria Pendleton or Mo Farah, sport is probably nothing more than an enjoyable hobby. Now a new study has revealed that your choice of sport says more about you than you could possibly have imagined. According researchers, cyclists are more likely to be emotionally stable, runners the most extrovert and swimmers the happiest, while walkers are the least materialistic. Scroll down for video . Happiest: Swimmers such as Rebecca Adlington are happier - and tidier - than most . Best for romance: According to the research, swimmers make the best lovers . The psychological study, which was carried out by experts Mindlab, also revealed that sport can also offer clues to a person's attitude to charity, reading habits and even their voting intentions. Cyclists, for instance, are most likely to vote Liberal Democrat and tend to be laid back and calm, if keen on acquiring material possessions. Meanwhile runners tend to be Labour-voting extroverts who love being the centre of attention and have a penchant for upbeat dance music. Those who swim tend to make the best lovers, are tidy and are also the most charitable, although according to Mindlab, 61 per cent of adults are fond of charity regardless of their choice of sport. Walkers, a category that includes those who enjoy rambling, orienteering and trekking, are least concerned about material possessions and like their own company. 'It has long been known that exercise is not only good for your body, but also your mind,' comments neuropsychologist, Dr David Lewis. Extrovert: Runners such as Mo Farah tend to be extroverts with a taste for upbeat music . The research claims cyclists love shopping and vote Liberal Democrat . 'Past research has shown that exercising can act as a mood-enhancer, can be used to treat and possibly even prevent anxiety and generally has a positive effect on mental health. 'The results from this study show that no matter what kind of person you are, there is the right kind of exercise for everyone.' The study, which was commissioned by the British Heart Foundation to mark the launch of its 2015 series of events, also found that favourite sports vary by area. Thus in Birmingham and London, cycling is the sport of choice for most while running wins the race in Leeds and Newcastle. Swimming was most popular in Cardiff, Dublin and Manchester, while walking was most loved in Bristol, Glasgow, Norwich and Nottingham. Peaceful: Those who love walking tend to enjoy their own company and are least materialistic . Supporters: Pippa Middleton (left) and heptathlete Louise Hazel (right) are high profile BHF supporters . The British Heart Foundation is famous for its sporty fundraisers and will once again stage the London to Brighton bike race this June. Pippa Middleton, one of the charity's best-known supporters, is set to take part, as will Olympic heptathlete Louise Hazel. 'Whatever your sports personality or level of fitness, I would encourage everyone to sign up to a BHF event,' said Hazel. 'Heart disease devastates too many lives, killing around 80,000 people every year. I lost my father to heart disease, he was just 50 years old. This is why I’m taking on a cycling challenge for BHF. 'Taking on a challenge can help you to get fit, enjoy the sport you love and also help to raise funds for vital research which could help save more people like my dad.' CYCLISTS... WALKERS... RUNNERS... SWIMMERS...","Swimmers are tidy, happy and good in bed according to new research .

"Usain Bolt is putting in the hard yards ahead of a busy summer on the track as he builds up to the world championships in Beijing, as shown in his latest post of his training regime on social media. Six-time Olympic champion Bolt posted a glimpse of his training progress at his base in Jamaica on Instagram on Thursday with footage of a block start in slow motion. Bolt explodes out of the blocks in the baking sun and drives a few steps before slowing up in the post accompanied by an inspiration quote from one of his heroes Mohammad Ali. Usain Bolt gets primed for a starting drill during training in Jamaica ahead of a busy summer of competition . 'I hated every minute of training, but I said, “Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion”,' Bolt’s social media profile said with the vine video. After missing the majority of last season due to injury, the 100 and 200 metre world record holder is leaving nothing to chance in 2015. He’s locked in dates in Paris where he’ll run in the 100m on July 4 and the following week at the Athletissima Diamond League in Switzerland where he’ll compete in the 200m. The later event is one which hold special significance for Bolt who has said he’s keen to attack the elusive 19 second mark – his world mark stands at 19.19. The six-time Olympic gold medalist explodes out of the blocks in this Instagram post on Thursday . Bolt posted the video on social media with a quote he could relate to from boxing great Muhammed Ali . In an interview with Sportsmail’s Matt Lawton last month Bolt outlined his aim to become the ‘greatest sportsman ever’ and emulate his heroes including Ali, Michael Jordan and Michael Johnson, whose 200m mark he overtook. His major target in the short-term is the world championships in Beijing in in August. But Rio de Janeiro and his bid to win a third consecutive treble in the 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay is the holy grail. Just – and in Bolt’s case it is just – winning a third 100m title would put him in the history books.","Sprint superstar Usain Bolt posted short video on social media .

However, after a string of disciplinary problems and a struggle to adapt to the English game, he was loaned out to Juventus during the following January transfer window. For the 2014-15 season, Osvaldo was loaned to Inter Milan as part of an exchange deal for Saphir Taider. At Inter, Osvaldo's form improved and he scored seven goals in 18 appearances, but his poor disciplinary record persisted, as the striker was suspended for failing to turn up to training two days in a row. This led to the early termination of his contract with the club. Osvaldo joined current club Boca in February this year and so far has three goals in four appearances.

"Venus Williams has suggested she is likely to follow her sister Serena and end her 14-year boycott of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament next year. The 34 year-old American gave her clearest indication yet that she would return before the end of her career following a 6-3 7-6 victory over Caroline Wozniacki that took her into the quarter finals. Venus has not played in March's high profile WTA event in the Californian desert since 2001 when, as has been well-documented, she made a late withdrawal from a semi-final match against her sister with a knee injury. Serena subsequently got a hostile reception when she played in the final. Venus Williams has suggested she will return to Indian Wells doe the first time since 2001 . The elder Williams sibling reached the quarter finals of the Miami Open on Monday . Williams shakes hands after defeating Carloine Wozniacki in straight sets at the event in Key Biscayne . Rory McIlroy's former fiancee could not contend with Williams' game, going down 6-3 7-6 . The younger sibling ended the family boycott this year, and now it looks like both of them may well be back as well in 2016. Asked what she thought of Serena's warm reception at Indian Wells earlier this month Venus responded: 'It was wonderful to see. I definitely watched every moment, and it was great to see her and my family there. Next year will be a big year for us being an Olympic year. I can't exactly say what my schedule will be, but it was wonderful to see her reception.' Did that mean she had softened her own stance? 'Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Venus said that she had not fully discussed the matter with Serena but went on: ' I think really what Serena did and how she went about it was just awesome for me as a big sister to see, because I feel like usually I'm the big sister. I feel like in this instance she took the role of big sister. 'It was really nice. I love how, you know, we continue to protect each other no matter what. She did a fantastic job out there, even though she wasn't feeling her best. So like I said, I think the tournament's amazing. I also said next year is an Olympic year, so my whole focus is on trying to get to the Olympics. 'So I don't know what tournaments I'm going to play as long as I'm at the Olympics.

"Paul Scholes says Manchester United look a worse team despite spending £220million in 18 months as he accused Louis van Gaal of lacking ambition. The Reds legend turned pundit slammed the Dutchman for being 'really happy to be fourth' and criticised his style of play after Wednesday night's 1-0 win over Newcastle United.

'He's not obsessed with possession but it is a very possession based game and what we've been used to over the years is not what are getting - and we probably won't get that. It's not great to watch but you have to say they are winning games. 'Not finishing fourth is not good, but to me not challenging for the league is not good enough. But we have to give him time. They can't keep on sacking managers.' Scholes, who was speaking on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, said United must be patient with the Dutchman but stressed that questions would have to be asked  if the club were not challenging for the title next season. 'Maybe the coach does need time to settle in too, but the one thing he has got is (Ryan Giggs, United’s assistant manager) to help him settle and get him used to what to expect from Liverpool and from Newcastle,' he said.

"He may be less of an influence on the pitch than in previous years, but Didier Drogba is determined to do his bit to help his Chelsea win the Premier League.

Hamilton said he would be ‘very interested to hear’ the FIA’s findings. But the FIA have decided not to publish their investigation, although senior figures within the organisation have privately said that McLaren’s own 37-page explanation of the accident, which gave their car a clean bill of heath, was scrupulously accurate in every detail.

"Multi-million plan investment: US Tycoon Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Links, Scotland . US tycoon Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a new multi-million pound investment in his Scottish golf resort - despite previously vowing to halt all developments on the 200-acre site. The billionaire will be submitting a proposal for a number of additions to Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, including staff accommodation, a banquet hall and 400-capacity ballroom. The move comes two years after he threatened not to invest 'another penny' in the project over plans to build an offshore wind farm off the Aberdeen coast, which he said would spoil scenic views. In a statement released on the planning proposals, The Trump Organization claimed Swedish utility firm Vattenfall, the primary developers behind the farm, could no longer finance the project. It also said the technology 'is now widely regarded to be obsolete and outdated'. The company said that this, combined with other stakeholders withdrawing from the project, had led to confidence being restored that the 'shoreline will not be blighted' by the 'industrial energy plant'. Despite this, Mr Trump will continue his legal challenge to the decision to grant the farm planning permission off the Aberdeen coast. A spokesman denied this claim on behalf of Vattenfall, and its project partners, Aberdeen Renewable Energy group, stating that they 'want to see the scheme to come to fruition'. Mr Trump called Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, which opened in July 2012, 'one of his greatest achievements' and said his commitment to develop the site 'was stronger than ever'. The businessman is now pushing ahead with expanding the site, known collectively as the Menie Estate, with further applications for private houses and hotel rooms tabled for later in the year. His current application includes public notifications for a second gold course and additional hotel accommodation and facilities at the five-star MacLeod House and Lodge, named after his mother. George Sorial, executive vice-president of the Trump Organisation, said: 'This will be a substantial investment - it really will allow us to carry out the original vision that Mr Trump had for the entire site. Our work there is not done.' The billionaire has submitted a proposal for a number of additions to the Aberdeenshire estate including staff accommodation, a banquet hall and more rooms in MacLeod House, illustrated with an artist's impression . The move comes two years after he threatened not to invest 'another penny' in the project over plans to build an offshore wind farm nearby, which he said would spoil scenic coastal views, pictured above . News that the organization would be re-investing in the site was welcomed by business leaders. Ian Armstrong, regional director for the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, said: 'At a time when there are some economic clouds on the horizon, the announcement of the plans by the Trump Organisation for further substantial investment in their site at Menie is a great boost to the region. 'The significance of a major international investor looking beyond short-term issues and adopting a long-term view should not be underestimated in terms of the fillip it provides to the north-east of Scotland and its economy.' Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, added: 'The business community in the north-east will be pleased to welcome the continued investment in Trump International Golf Links.' The claims made by Trump Organizations were denied by Vattenfall and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group. A spokesman said: 'Widely accepted as a much-needed centre of significant European importance, the EOWDC is pivotal to helping the Scottish and UK Governments meet their ambitious renewable energy targets and is planned to test and demonstrate innovation and next generation technologies. 'It would also be an integral, flagship project for Aberdeen City and Shire’s enterprising Energetica initiative, further positioning the region at the forefront of the sustainable energy evolution as well as supporting the diversification of its energy-based economy.'","Proposed builds include banquet hall, ballroom and staff accommodation .

"Adam Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland after his arrest on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl. The 27-year-old former England winger, who earns £50,000 a week, was arrested by Durham police at his £1.85million mansion on Monday morning and later bailed. Sunderland have confirmed that Johnson, who recently became a father, will not be available for selection pending the outcome of the investigation, beginning with Tuesday’s Premier League clash at Hull. The Black Cats signed the Sunderland-born midfielder for £10m from Manchester City in 2012. Adam Johnson has been arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl .

The gates at Johnson's property were shut on Monday evening following his arrest . Peterlee Police Station in County Durham where  Johnson was taken after he was arrested . Johnson was released on bail on Monday night and will continue to help police with their inquiries . He has scored 20 times in 105 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby. However, he has struggled to rediscover the form which won him an England call-up in 2010. His last cap for the Three Lions came three years ago. Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before joining City in 2010, where he won a Premier League title and the FA Cup. The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger who has represented his country 12 times, although he failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year. Johnson gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo’s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. ‘He liked the attention of being a well-known footballer and attracting women was not a problem,’ said one local, who did not wish to be named. ‘He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home.’ Johnson pictured with his girlfriend Stacey Flounders in 2012 after Manchester City won the Premier League . Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland pending the outcome of the police investigation . But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Stacey Flounders. Miss Flounders recently posted photographs of the couple’s first child, Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if she and her daughter were at home at the time of the player’s arrest. And speaking from Miss Flounders' family home, her mother told the Daily Mirror that her daughter and Johnson were still 'very close' and 'absolutely still together'. She added: 'He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situtation.' Friends say Johnson opted to live near the quiet hamlet of Castle Eden to get away from the ‘bright lights’ of city life. Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. Johnson’s stunning gated property boasts six bedrooms and a sweeping gravel drive and is set in more than two acres of mature woodland. The house is a typical Footballers’ Wives-style property with Italian stone flooring, and a spiral staircase to a mezzanine level. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, dressing room and balconies at the front and rear while the other five bedrooms are all en-suite. Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday . Johnson speaks to the Duchess of Cambridge at St George's Park with England team-mate Frank Lampard in 2012 . It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City before being signed three years ago by Sunderland. On Monday night a Durham Police spokesman said: ‘A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. ‘A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.’ Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England  at senior level 12 times . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year.

"Lewis Hamilton hailed his crew of mechanics following a difficult day at the office that he claims left him 'heavily compromised' ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. Fresh from an Australian Grand Prix 'triple crown' of pole position, fastest lap and race win, Hamilton was forced to pull his Mercedes to one side after just four installation laps in the first practice session at the Sepang International Circuit. Mercedes mechanics fix Lewis Hamilton's car at the team's garage after its engine failure on Friday . After the car was hauled back to the garage there were initial fears an engine change may be required, only for the fault to lie within the power unit inlet system. The depth of the issue within the system, however, meant Hamilton did not return to the track until 38 minutes into the 90 of FP2. But the 30-year-old wasted no time in getting up to speed as he went on to set the fastest lap, being the only driver to dip under 100 seconds with a time of one minute 39.790secs. 'It was an amazing job done by my guys to rebuild the car, get the engine and gearbox back on and to get back out,' said Hamilton. 'I am very grateful for that. Especially here where it is so hot and so difficult for the tyres, so it was really important get back out.' Hamilton overcame the engine problems in the morning practice session to set the fastest time . Losing too much time, however, may yet prove costly as Hamilton added: 'It affects you quite a bit. 'Fortunately I got a few laps in with a longer run at the end, but in terms of my set-up, I have not made any changes and it is quite a bit off from where we need it. 'Overall, my preparations have been heavily compromised. Whenever you lose a session, and most of the second session too, that definitely doesn't help. 'In the end, just to get some laps was crucial. If I had missed all of today then Sunday would be hard. 'Right now I have some improvements to make to the balance and the settings, so I am sure we will tweak and improve it because we have not got the car dialled in.' But the British world champion says his Malaysian Grand Prix preparations have been 'heavily compromised' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was second quickest in both sessions, the Finn finishing 0.373secs adrift of Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg in FP1, and remarkably exactly the same time off the Briton in FP2. Although Ferrari are showing signs of closing in on Mercedes, Raikkonen said: ""The car is still not perfect, but I'm sure we can improve for tomorrow. 'We have some work to do on the set up to make everything easier, but we'll do our best and we'll see where we end up in qualifying.' Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen during practice for the Malaysian Formula One Grand Prix on Friday . Rosberg had to settle for third best, just over four tenths of a second behind Hamilton, followed by Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat and Williams duo Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. As for ailing McLaren, the returning Fernando Alonso was down in 16th, 2.7secs off the pace, closely followed by team-mate Jenson Button. Alonso, who sat out the first race Down Under as he recovered from concussion suffered in a crash in testing, claims McLaren have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in Melbourne. The double world champion said: ""It felt great in the car. 'After the gym, the simulator, whatever you do it is not the same as the car, so I enjoyed so much driving here. Fernando Alonso returns to the track after recovering from concussion he suffered in Australia crash . 'It was really the second day of testing for me because I had one good day in Barcelona with 63 laps and then today with 45 laps. 'And the car was much better than expected. The experience we had in winter we had a lot of problems after four or five laps. 'But today we ran 45 laps with zero problems, everything went as we predicted. 'We will see in qualifying where we are, but I think we were 4.6 seconds behind pole position in Australia. 'Here, maybe we could be 3.5 seconds down, so that is a one second or 1.5 second gain in two weeks, so a big step forward.' Alonso claims McLaren have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in Melbourne . Manor also hit the track for the first time this season after months of uncertainty and missing Australia due to technical issues despite being present at the Albert Park circuit. Rookie duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi completed 34 laps between them, with the Briton 5.9secs down and the Spaniard 7.4secs adrift, with the latter's day cut short by a spin into the gravel.","Lewis Hamilton missed Friday's first session and some of the second .

"Bump on the head or not, Fernando Alonso is the same wily maverick he always was. This most brilliant yet political of drivers, who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun ‘I’, delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly, courteously and devastatingly. A steering problem, he told a press conference before Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix, was the cause of the McLaren driver’s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in Barcelona last month. Just one thing: McLaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car. Calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry, they compiled a 37-page report, which they presented to the FIA, substantiating that view. Fernando Alonso stands in front of the world's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of Sunday's race . The Spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona . ‘The steering problem came in the middle of turn three,’ elaborated Alonso, who missed the opening race in Melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career. ‘It locked into the right and when I approached the wall I braked at the last moment, I downshifted from fifth to third, and unfortunately we are still missing some data.’ How routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers, including a host of former drivers. ‘I’ve listened to Alonso’s very clear explanation of the incident,’ said broadcaster Martin Brundle, who drove in 158 grands prix. ‘Now I’m really confused.’ One of the FIA’s most senior technical officials commended McLaren’s report as honest and robust. Why, then, would the Spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence? Alonso is set for his second McLaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign . The Spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in Sepang after being declared fit to race . The two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error, or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall (even though he was changing gears, he may have been semi-conscious as he did so). It appears he did not mention any steering problem to McLaren until last week - three weeks after the accident. They then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on Monday, perhaps to appease him. What they did not expect was Alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the Sepang paddock. That left McLaren snookered. They could not disregard their meticulous data, nor could they publicly argue with their £25million-a-year driver - relations between the team and Alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. Alonso barely speaks to Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. His relationship with the de facto team principal Eric Boullier, who was not at McLaren during Alonso’s first spell there, is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to Andrea Stella, an Italian who moved with him from Ferrari to remain his race engineer. These scenes echoed 2007, when Alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about Dennis to the FIA during the Spygate scandal. Alonso arrives in the Sepang paddock for the Malaysian Grand Prix; the second round of the championship . The double world champion in the paddock with compatriot Carlos Sainz prior to Thursday's media briefing . Back then, the team were split in two. Alonso and his manager Luis Garcia Abad would brief Spanish journalists in one corner. The same procedure happened at the team’s hospitality area here on Thursday. Alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - Abad and his deputy Alberto Fernandez, and physiotherapist Edoardo Bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called ‘boys’ lunch’ ... the meal provided for the team’s mechanics and engineers. By this point, Alonso, who arrived at the track at 9.45am, had been cleared by the FIA’s doctors to compete on Sunday, a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three Cambridge University doctors at the weekend. Yet still the mystery goes on. Alonso said he was ‘perfectly conscious at the time’ of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with McLaren’s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene. Alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on Friday . Alonso smiles in his car in the garage at Sepang, home of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix . ‘I lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital,’ he said. ‘There is a time I don’t remember from two o’clock to six o’clock, but that was normal on the medication.’ Alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in Spain that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go-karter. He said he could remember everything the following day, but then said it took him ‘three or four days’ to gather his memory. Baffling. But not for his team-mate Jenson Button, who said: ‘I’ve seen every single bit of data many times. Nothing has changed. It all says that the car is OK.’ It was Button’s polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of Alonso’s testimony.","Fernando Alonso has spoken out for first time since crash in Barcelona .

"The wonderful thing with horses is that they know so little. Coneygree didn’t know he was a novice, didn’t know he was fragile, didn’t know he wasn’t worth anything at all. He didn’t know a first-timer hadn’t won the Gold Cup since 1974, or that winners of blue riband races are rarely so gauche that they lead from start to finish. And what he didn’t know couldn’t hurt him. It is different for humans. Sara Bradstock, wife of winning trainer Mark, and daughter of racing legend Lord Oaksey, who bred Coneygree, remembers every doubt, every raised eyebrow, every cruel remark on the road to one of the most remarkable victories in the history of this race. And one in particular. Nico de Boinville kisses the Cheltenham Gold Cup following Coneygree's length-and-a-half victory . De Boinville and trainer Mark Bradstock are all smiles with the 2015 trophy . On November 17, after two years out with injury, Coneygree was withdrawn by a vet at the start of the SIS Live Novices’ Chase at Plumpton. After 660 days off the track injured, the veterinary professional inspecting horses before the race decided Coneygree showed signs of lameness. ‘I said to him, “It’s not just any horse that you’re f****** me about with here”,’ said Mrs Bradstock, with a countryside earthiness that contrived to sound jolly, sporty and bloody furious at the same time. ‘And do you know what he said to me? He said, “He’s had two years off, he’s not worth anything anyway”.’ No doubt there is a vet in the South Downs area of Sussex who is feeling a little sheepish this morning. The diagnosis aside — Mrs Bradstock felt so angry about it she threatened to get her brother, a QC, to sue — Coneygree was worth something after all. He was the horse that could, overcoming newness, shyness and an ability to pick up the strangest injuries to beat a field that included Tony McCoy on his last Gold Cup ride, Carlingford Lough. To be fair, not even the love of the common people was present for McCoy’s horse, which went off at 14-1 and never contested, and some will say that Coneygree’s victory was evidence of a poor field. Mark Bradstock insisted there was no such thing — just the odd Gold Cup that was more open than in other years, and either way, the manner in which Coneygree came home made him one of the bravest, if not the best, Cheltenham has seen. There is something so marvellous about a front-runner. It is the honesty, for a start. Everything is out there. It is why the public warmed to Paula Radcliffe. By the time Coneygree came up the hill, any onlooker not financially involved will have been yearning for him to hold on. Doubly so if they knew his history . Coneygree clears the last hurdle to set up a grandstand finish at the Cheltenham showpiece . De Boinville and Coneygree clear a fence on their way to victory at the Cheltenham Gold Cup . ‘This little mare that only cost £3,000,’ said Mrs Bradstock of Coneygree’s mum, Plaid Maid. She had been bought to give her father, who suffered from Alzheimer’s late in life, a little interest in his retirement. He bred Coneygree from her, and another horse of note, Carruthers, which won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in 2011. ‘All of the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses,’ Mrs Bradstock added. ‘People quoted statistics at us, but this shows anyone can do it. I always said, when we win the Gold Cup we’ll win the lottery — it feels that amazing. Dad isn’t here, but he is looking down on us today, I know. ‘Before the race I spoke to Nico (de Boinville, the jockey). I was reminded of what David Elsworth said about Desert Orchid. Nobody thought he could step up from two miles to three for the Gold Cup but David said, “If you go 20 yards clear, go 30”. That’s what I told Nico. If he wants to go clear, let him go clear.’ And he went clear. Not by much, nothing like 20 lengths. The winning margin was one and a half lengths and Coneygree was made to fight by Djakadam and Road To Riches. De Boinville was told he did it the hard way. He said he did it the easy way. ‘He could go again,’ he said, admiringly. In the distance, Coneygree steamed happily. They are proper horsey people, the Bradstocks, and not just because Sara’s father was a rider and later a brilliant journalist and broadcaster. It is a small stable, no more than 10 horses, and whatever Mark spends the proceeds on, it isn’t a stylist. His hair looked like he had been dragged through a hurdle backwards. He said he wasn’t good at watching races and had spent Coneygree’s three miles, two furlongs and 110 yards pacing and smoking. Bradstock had the air of a man who could have given Alex Higgins a run for his money in a smoke-off. His wife said he had nearly been arrested by security when his horse won. De Boinville celebrates following his 2015 Gold Cup triumph at Cheltenham . Coneygree became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup . De Boinville is overcome with emotion on his way to the parade ring following Coneygree's thrilling victory . De Boinville is congratulated by the Cheltenham faithful as he makes his way to the winner's enclosure . Coneygree had been led up by the Bradstocks’ daughter Lily, whose junior riding career was curtailed by a neurological problem in her left leg following a kick from a horse. She wouldn’t have been able to walk two years ago, said Sara. Their son Alfie, who has a showjumping background, is credited with a lot of work, too. Coneygree jumped beautifully, testament to the effort Alfie has put in, along with rider De Boinville. Sara said they had sent the horse over hurdles four times this week to prepare him for the Gold Cup. One imagines Sara is the real driving force in the family. ‘I’m drinking champagne and Sara will be washing him down in his box,’ Mark said. ‘She does most of the work behind the scenes. She’s magical.’ For there to be 41 years between novice victories at the Gold Cup — the last one was Captain Christy —suggests this was a win steeped in horse sense. The Bradstocks knew Coneygree’s injuries made it more experienced than the average novice, and chose to run it here rather than in Wednesday’s RSA Chase. The wet weather, and the result it helped produce, vindicated the call. Captain Christy was seven when he outran The Dikler in 1974. Coneygree is a year older. Mrs Bradstock talked about his perceived fragility — the ‘ridiculous’ long legs and a feisty temperament she believes can be expressed at the Wantage stable, but would make him shrink in a big yard. ‘He’s different,’ she explained. ‘He got an injury to a small muscle at the top of one of his legs. The vet said he had never seen a horse hurt that muscle before.’ She smiled. This was a different memory, without the sneer of that afternoon at Plumpton. That vet said Coneygree had been nodding his head. ‘Of course he was, he was excited to be on a course again,’ Mrs Bradstock explained. Coneygree steamed on. He didn’t know he had won the Gold Cup. But whatever the hell had just happened, it definitely seemed like fun . The 2015 Gold Cup champion punches the air as he is led past the grandstand .

"Emmanuel Adebayor has promised to try and win back the Tottenham fans after ending his first team exile with a return at Manchester United. Adebayor admits he has come through a 'dark moment' and has fallen from favour at a club where he was a goal hero this time last year. He understands how quickly things change in football and issued a warning to Harry Kane on this score, but vowed to join forces as they attempt to salvage Spurs' top four aspirations. Emmanuel Adebayor made his first appearance since January as Tottenham lost 3-0 to Manchester United . The Togo international has vowed to win back the supporters after going through a 'dark moment' Leicester (home) - March 21 . Burnley (away) - April 5 . Aston Villa (home) - April 11 . Newcastle (away) - April 19 . Southampton (away) - April 25 . Manchester City (home) - May 2 . Stoke (away) - May 9 . Hull (home) - May 16 . Everton (away) - May 24 . 'I went through a little bit of a dark moment in my career but now I am back training hard and that's it,' said the Togo international. 'A lot of things went wrong. We are all human beings. We all go through a lot at certain time of our lives. I think I have learned from it. I went through a lot of family issues. As I said earlier on, now it is behind me and I am back on the football pitch. I am very glad to be back.' Adebayor, 31, returned as a late substitute at Old Trafford on Sunday, his first appearance for nearly two months, during which he returned to Africa to address family problems. While he was out 21-year-old Kane has reinforced his position as Tottenham's first-choice striker. Adebayor said: 'I'm very happy and pleased for Harry Kane, who has been doing fantastic. In football, we all have our moments. He is a young lad that came out and at the moment, I think he is the only one that can save our season, like I did the last season. 'Two years ago, it was Gareth Bale. So you know, football is always changing. I am very happy for him, very pleased for him. He is a young lad. He is learning through his difficult moment as well but he is fantastic player. VIDEO Top four still possible - Pochettino . Adebayor has fallen out of favour with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino and had been criticised by fans . Adebayor had not featured for Tottenham since the end of January in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Leicester . Tottenham's defeat by United left them six points adrift of the top four places . 'If he keeps scoring two goals every weekend, he can help us into the top four. But don't get me wrong, now people are starting to get to know him and what he can do and what he cannot do, his positives and negatives on the pitch. 'But he is an intelligent lad and he just has to find his way again and bounce back. We all have a huge faith and believe in him. Hopefully, he will drag us out of the top seven and put us in the top four. 'And for me, sitting on the bench, as a player, I have been there before. I just have to work hard on the pitch and come back and play football. Football is a fun game. Today, you are zero. Tomorrow, you are a hero and the most important thing is you, what makes you happy, keep believing, keep doing your thing on the pitch.' Adebayor was in demand on transfer deadline day in January, when he rejected a move to QPR but almost joined West Ham before Spurs chairman Daniel Levy blocked the loan transfer. 'That is already behind me,' said Adebayor. 'I am still at Tottenham so for me, the most important thing is now Tottenham and help the team achieve our target which is to finish in the top four. Don't get me wrong, it's going to be hard but at the moment, just let me focus on my game and how I can help the team. Adebayor was given the captain's armband for the second leg of the Captial One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United in January . Adebayor posted this picture to Instagram days before the United match, with a message saying it is not important what people think of you, but who you are . 'Why not? I am part of the squad. I am very happy. And for me, the most important thing … I'm not 21 years old any more. I am 31 and I look at things differently. As I said, I am available. We have a lot of fantastic players in the squad and the manager has a choice to make. 'If I am in, like when I came in for ten minutes I run around, I did what I can do and whenever I am selected, I just have to help my team and show respect for them and show respect for the club. 'The summer is a long way to go. We've got what, nine games to go? Which is almost two months. So we've got plenty of time. At the moment, I'm a footballer, I'm a professional... keep doing my work, keep doing my job as professional as I can. At the beginning of the last season, everyone wanted me out; at the end of the season, they wanted me to stay. I just have to keep believing in myself, keeping doing my thing. 'I travelled to Europe to be a footballer and today, I am a footballer. Already, I am very glad because obviously in my country, only God knows how many people would love to wear the Tottenham shirt today and play for Tottenham. So whenever I have a chance to wake up and be alive, I always thank God for that and for me, all the rest is a bonus. Keep enjoying my life, keep enjoying myself.' Adebayor was booed onto the pitch at Old Trafford by travelling Spurs fans, upset with what they consider a casual attitude and comments made earlier in the season that the team would rather play away than at White Hart Lane. Adebayor came close to leaving Spurs in January but chairman Daniel Levy blocked a move to West Ham . The striker returned to favour under Tim Sherwood last season and scored 11 goals after January . He added: 'I don't know if I have been punished or not but what I know is, I'm me, I'm being me, and if I have to say it and correct the future for the club, I will do it. Don't get me wrong, this club has given me the chance to play again in London and I'm so grateful. 'If Tottenham won the cup a few weeks ago, I'm part of the club that won the Capital One Cup in 2015. Tottenham didn't win it. Me and the fans are in the same boat. So today, obviously, I am very disappointed and I think the fans are disappointed as well. At the end of the day, somebody will say something that people will misunderstand and take the wrong way but I have nothing against the fans, I always love the fans. 'I don't want to get involved in that any more. It's behind and for me now, it's just play football and enjoy my life again. As a Togolese boy, who has suffered a lot and today he's in Europe. As I tell you before, my junior brother, my senior brother, my uncle, I think they would love to be in my position today, being a footballer, being a striker for Tottenham, trust me. Even just travelling with the team, a lot of my family members, a lot of my countrymen, would love to do that. For me, let me just enjoy it and embrace it.'","Tottenham lost 3-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .

Ronnie O'Sullivan was in no mood to pat himself on the back after beating Graeme Dott . Neither man made a break of three figures and O'Sullivan missed a handful of easy-looking shots, but Dott was unable to punish him, most notably in the fourth when he missed a green off the spot as he tried to clear to level at 2-2. O'Sullivan made him pay, but was in no mood to pat himself on the back. 'Graeme has had a good tournament, been consistent and is always a tough match,' O'Sullivan told ITV4. 'We both played poorly, I felt nervous for some reason and couldn't see the wood for the trees. It was strange, one of those evenings and it was lucky Graeme played as badly as me. 'I was sitting there thinking of how good Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis were and they started twitching, and thought 'is this my time?'. I missed so many balls, it was diabolical. Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon 4-2 to book a place in the last four in Llandudno . 'I'm just relieved, tomorrow is another day, but you want to build momentum as this stage of a tournament.' Earlier in the day, Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon to ensure O'Sullivan would avoid a collision course with his old nemesis. He called the veteran, a man who has tormented him in the past, 'Peter f****** Ebdon' in a newspaper interview this week, but Ebdon was dispatched 4-2. O'Sullivan will face Stuart Bingham in the last four after he beat Mark Davis 4-0 in a low-scoring affair.","Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Graeme Dott 4-1 to progress to the semi-finals .

"A fashion label that used a bare-breasted nun as part of an advertising campaign is at the centre of a row over blasphemy in Naples, as Pope Francis prepares to visit the port city. The giant billboard shows an image of a woman dressed in a nun's habit and jeans, with naked breasts. The campaign by fashion label Rosso di Sera has caused controversy in the southern Italian city, ahead of a scheduled papal visit next weekend. 'Obscene': Locals have expressed horror at fashion label Rosso di Sera's new billboard erected in Naples just one week ahead of the Pope's visit to the city . Locals have denounced the image as 'obscene' and 'ugly' . One Franciscan Facebook user said: 'I am an atheist but I find it offensive to intelligence, to women, to good taste and to faith.' Other saw the 20 x30ft image in the city centre as a cynical marketing move. But the company Rosso di Sera denied the billboard had been deliberately timed to cause a fuss. Apology: The clothing firm has insisted 'there was no intent to blaspheme' adding that the company 'strongly regrets being accused of things extremely far from our values and our culture' 'We recognise that we have made a strong marketing choice but there was no intent to blaspheme,' the company said in a statement. 'Trivialising the act of prayer was not the intention in any way,' Rosso di Sera said, adding that the company 'strongly regrets being accused of things extremely far from our values and our culture.'

"Willie Mullins has described his historic achievement of having the first three home in the Stan James Champion Hurdle as his greatest ever training achievement. The dominant nine-time champion Irish trainer has become used to swatting aside the opposition in his homeland and bruising the home defence with his increasingly potent Festival raids. But the feat of the Ruby Walsh-ridden 4-5 favourite Faugheen leading home stablemates Arctic Fire and dual champion Hurricane Fly will take some surpassing even for a man who has won a Grand National. The nearest any other trainer has come to matching what this modern-day racing William the Conqueror achieved was Irish colleague Aidan O’Brien, who sent out Istabraq and Theatreworld to be first and second in both the 1998 and 1999 Champion Hurdles. A jubilant Walsh enters the winners enclosure on board the Champions Hurdle winner Faugheen . It is the most outstanding feat since Michael Dickinson trained the first five in the 1983 Gold Cup. Mullins said: ‘A one-two-three is a dream. On paper it is my best training feat, certainly. To get three horses in that condition is good for anyone but then to get the luck in running is vital.’ And it is even more remarkable given what else Mullins managed on the first day of the Festival with three other winners — Douvan (2-1 favourite) beating stablemate Shaneshill in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, Un De Sceaux (4-6) in the Arkle Challenge Trophy and Paul Townend-ridden Glens Melody (6-1) in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle. Punters jumping on the Mullins bandwagon cost the bookmaking industry an estimated £10million as they linked them in accumulator bets. But it could have been worse. Walsh-ridden Annie Power, 1-2 favourite and the horse Mullins had regarded as his certainty of the day, was clear at the last in the Mares’ Hurdle when taking a crashing fall. Walsh celebrates on Faugheen after the seven-yeatr-old won the Champion Hurdle Challenge Trophy . Mullins said: ‘Annie Power got a horrible fall and she will have a sore neck and shoulder in the morning but she will be OK. It’s rare to have four runners on a day like this, let alone four winners. I keep saying to myself, “enjoy it while it lasts”. ‘You couldn’t write a script like that, but I just knew that all the horses were doing everything right. It was going scarily well and I thought coming here it was either going to be a great success or a blow-out.’ The latter does not happen very often for Mullins. The man who has now trained 37 Festival winners and has been top trainer at the meeting for three of the last four years might as well pop the trophy in his suitcase for the flight home. Faugheen was imperious as he led home a Willie Mullins-trained one-two-three at the Cheltenham Festival . Douvan, like Faugheen owned by former Barclays Investment banker Rich Ricci, had been decribed as one of the best Mullins had brought to the Festival. He jumped with efficiency to set the ball rolling with a four and a half length win in the Supreme. Front-running Un De Sceaux proved fears about his headstrong nature were unfounded with a performance of total control in the Arkle Chase. And there was Faugheen, the horse who has developed from an ugly duckling into a fully-fledged hurdling swan unbeaten in nine races. After he had made the running before sprinting clear off the home turn, Mullins revealed Walsh had formulated the battle plan months ago, even though he had only confirmed he would ride the seven-year-old on Saturday. Walsh glides over the fence on his way to winning the Champions Hurdle at Cheltenham Festival 2015 . Mullins said: ‘I didn’t think he would win that impressively. I was wondering like punters, the media and the bookmakers, could he take on the Grade One horses and beat them because we picked races for him that did not have top Grade One horses in. It paid off and he learned his trade. Ruby rode him with huge confidence and he showed that he was the good horse Ruby and everybody else thought he was.’ His next run is likely to be at the Punchestown Festival and he is 6-4 to win next year’s Champion Hurdle. But he still has somewhere to go to usurp dual champion Hurricane Fly in Mullins’ affections. ‘He is a very good horse and probably over hurdles the second best I’ve trained.’ Some second best. Walsh made his intentions clear as he took Faugheen to the head of the line before the tapes went up .","Faugheen dictated the tempo and romped home the 4/5 winner .

"Olympic champion and world record holder Usain Bolt will make his first appearance in the United States in five years when he competes in the Adidas Grand Prix Diamond League meeting in New York City on June 13, organisers said on Wednesday. The Jamaican sprinter set his first 100 metres world record at the meeting in 2008 when he clocked 9.72 seconds. His only other appearance in the U.S. since then was to anchor a Jamaican 4x100 metres team at the 2010 Penn Relays. 'No one could ever forget their first world record, and I will never forget the crowd in New York that night,' Bolt said in a statement. Usain Bolt broke his first world record in New York in 2008, running a remarkable 9.72 seconds . Bolt (right) beat Tyson Gay (centre) and Leroy Dixon to the line in 2008, but has not run in New York since then . 'They had to wait for an hour during a thunderstorm delay before our race, and I don't think a single person left the stadium. 'They deserved a great performance, and I'm glad I was able to give it to them. I'm looking forward to running in New York again.' Organisers did not announce whether Bolt would run over 100 or 200 metres in the meeting at New York's Icahn Stadium. Bolt is the current world record holder and Olympic champion, after success at the London Olympics in 2012 . Bolt says he is excited to return to New York, a place that holds fine memories after his previous success . He holds the world record in both, having run 9.58 seconds in the 100 and 19.19 in the 200 in 2009. Bolt, who won Olympic gold in both sprints and the 4x100 relay in the Beijing and London Games, will begin his 2015 sprint season with a 100 metres in Rio on April 19. The 28-year-old Bolt also has announced races for Paris on July 4 (100 metres) and Lausanne on July 9 (200) as he prepares for August's world championships in Beijing.","Usain Bolt broke his first world record in New York, running 9.72 seconds .

"England Women got back to winning ways with a 42-13 Six Nations victory over Scotland on Friday night. After defeat to Ireland two weeks ago in Ashbourne, the world champions were in more convincing form and Ruth Laybourn led them to an eight-try victory with a hat-trick. England were ahead inside a minute with Katy McLean, Ceri Large, Fiona Pocock and Lydia Thompson all combining to allow Laybourn to touch down. Ruth Laybourn touches down for one of her three tries as England thrashed Scotland in Darlington . Lydia Thompson dives in for a score, one of eight that England managed on the night, in an impressive display . Katy McLean directs proceedings from behind the scrum as England bounced back from defeat to Ireland . McLean missed the conversion and a Nuala Deans penalty cut the deficit before Tamara Taylor barged her way over after a nicely floated McLean pass. Lisa Martin booted another Scottish penalty but two further tries before the break from Justine Lucas and Rochelle Clark put England in control with a 14-point lead. Bianca Blackburn and Harriet Millar-Mills put Pocock over in the second half but Eilidh Sinclair replied for Scotland, with Deans adding the conversion. That was as good as it got for the Scots, though, with Laybourn adding her second on 56 minutes before Thompson went over with Amber Reed adding the extras. Laybourn then crossed over for her hat-trick to seal a comfortable England win. Fiona Pocock dives over for a second-half score before Eilidh Sinclair hit back for Scotland's only try .

"There is upset within the rugby fraternity about the RFU, the richest rugby union in the world, charging for disabled access to England matches at Twickenham for the first time this season. The proceeds from Saturday's full house for the Six Nations title decider against France includes money from wheelchair users having to pay £41 for entry when the RFU policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities — and their carers, if needed. One RFU mandarin said: ‘It’s quite appalling such a charge should be brought in when the wheelchair-bound have been allowed in free at Twickenham from time immemorial. It’s not as if the RFU need the money and is just another example of their rampant commercialism to squeeze extra cash from everywhere, even the disabled. It’s a scandalous state of affairs that needs to be quickly revoked.’ The RFU are charging wheelchair users £41 to watch England play France at Twickenham on Saturday . RFU policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities . The RFU, who have 2,318 wheelchair enclosure spaces and a terrace with lift access for 112, say their executive staff brought in the charges following an audit of disabled access by Level Playing Field with the new pricing package being deemed industry standard. LPF said in their report that charging the same price as for able-bodied spectators in the same seating category promotes equality. A RFU spokesman said: ‘We are committed to investing all additional ticket revenue raised from the new charging policy to the upgrading of disabled facilities within Twickenham and we have had a lot of positive feedback. We do not charge for tickets issued to charities nor for tickets to those injured playing rugby.’ England play France on Saturday still in with a chance of being crowned Six Nations champions . The England cricket team’s apparent over-reliance on data during their hapless World Cup campaign led to huge criticism aimed at head coach Peter Moores. And England team analyst Nathan Leamon, a Cambridge maths graduate and former Eton schoolmaster, badly hurt his foot after kicking out in anger in his hotel room in Wellington after a late-night debate with some media pundits about the importance — or not — of cricket stats. The unnecessary comment that had Leamon steaming was from the obnoxious Paul Allott, Lancashire director and peripheral figure on Sky Sports, who asked the numbers expert: ‘Have you ever played the game?’ England's apparent over-reliance on data at the World Cup led to criticism aimed at Peter Moores . The proposed 2016 Olympics men’s Team GB football side, mischievously relayed to the other home nations by former FA general secretary Alex Horne on his last day in office, has been kiboshed, not only by the FIFA ExCo in Zurich last Thursday, but at the FA board meeting on the same day. The three other countries were strongly opposed and the issue has also raised questions as to why England have had a monopoly on the GB football seat on the British Olympic Association. However there are still plans to send a GB women’s side to Rio. There will be no 2016 Olympics men’s Team GB football side in Rio next summer . Adam Johnson is set to receive a tough reception if, as expected, he returns for Sunderland at West Ham on Saturday following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old. Upton Park chants aimed at the England winger will be brutal. The match is live on Sky and talkSport and both will have sound engineers on their outside broadcast teams to monitor the volume of crowd obscenities. Adam Johnson is set to return to the Sunderland team after his suspension by the club was lifted . Champagne’s puzzle . Former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne’s fanciful bid for the FIFA presidency — which failed to get the necessary backing from five countries — seemed from the start to be at Sepp Blatter’s bidding. And Champagne wouldn’t comment yesterday on speculation he has written Blatter’s mission statement ahead of the election. Blatter said: ‘My manifesto is the work I have done in FIFA.’ UEFA president Michel Platini snubbed the official FIFA ExCo dinner in Zurich on Thursday night — preferring pasta with his entourage to celebrate the Champions League progress of his former club Juventus. Jerome Champagne’s bid for the FIFA presidency failed to get the necessary backing from five countries . Simon Clegg, chief operating officer of the inaugural European Games in Baku this year, has ambitions to become chairman of the British Olympic Association if Lord Coe is elected president of the IAAF. But Clegg needs the Azerbaijani-bankrolled Games to go well first and he’s just lost his second communications chief in quick succession — both leaving suddenly for personal reasons.","Disabled fans must pay for Twickenham tickets for first time this season .

"Britain's fittest grandmother has set a new world record in weightlifting just one year after she took up the sport because her local swimming pool was closed as result of council cuts. All-action Lindsey Gowland, 57, played basketball to a national level as a teenager and then took to the water after turning 40. She won a European gold and World silver medal at Masters level but was forced to give up competing when two of her local pools were shut down in 2009. Super-gran! Sports-mad Lindsey Gowland shows off her muscles with this deadlift . The lecturer won three weightlifting golds at the British Championships in Stafford last month . Lindsey Gowland, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, discovered weights when her swimming pool closed . The mum-of-four - who works as a sports lecturer and lives in Kingswinford, West Midlands - was then introduced to dumbbells by her colleague Martin Beastall at the end of 2013. Lindsey initially lifted the weights to keep fit but soon realised she was good enough to enter the Midlands Championships in Worcester in October last year. After qualifying with ease she then went on to win three gold medals in her first ever British Championships in Stafford in February. Lindsey took home first place in the deadlift, squat and bench press categories when she competed in the 63kg weight class and 55 to 59 age grouping. Incredibly, she set a world record of 121kg in the deadlift as well as a European best in the 60kg squat and a new British record with 43kg in the bench press. Lindsey, who lives with her PE teacher husband Ian, 58,  admitted she doesn't look like a typical weightlifter. Mum-of-four and grandmother-of-three Lindsey weighs 9st 9lb and was introduced to weights by a colleague . Lindsey during her qualifying event for the British Championships in Worcester in October 2014 . Lindsey with her colleague and personal trainer Martin Beastall, who first introduced her to dumbbells in 2013 . The 5ft 7in grandmother-of-three, who weighs 9st 9lb, said: 'I used to swim three or four times a week with a club but they closed down the one pool and a couple of years later they closed down the pool we moved to because of council cuts. 'Martin got me into weights. He has had a go at it in the past and he looked at what I was lifting for swimming training and said I had a good chance of competing. 'He asked if I fancied giving it a go and I just thought, ""why not?"" 'When I first started training I was doing sessions at Dudley College, where the gym is mostly used by students. 'Lots of them used to look at me and think 'I bet you're not going to lift much' and I think they were quite surprised to see I could pull the weights I can pull. 'I never thought of myself as someone who would be able to lift heavy weights. It has really been so unexpected. 'I am reasonably tall but I am not a big person. I certainly don't look like the stereotypical weightlifter. Lindsey, centre, won gold at her last swimming championship in 2009 but gave up when two local pools closed . 'But had it not been for the pool closing I think swimming would still be my main sport.' Lindsey has now got her sights set on beating her global competitors when she enters the World Single Lift Championships in Telford, Shrops., in June this year. The sports lecturer - who has four grown-up children Ian, 34, Emma, 33, Amy, 26, and Kelly, 25 - is also targeting the world record for the squat which stands at 65kg. Lindsey often cycles as part of her fitness routine . She added: 'I had lifted weights in the past but only for conditioning to support swimming. 'I virtually had to re-learn my technique because when you weight train for fun you can get away with slightly less technique but when you compete it's very strict. 'I couldn't believe it when I broke the world record, I think there was a Russian woman who held it before me. I have lifted 125kg in qualifying but I just couldn't quite hang on to it in the finals. 'I want to work towards the squat world record. I need to get another 5kg on to the 60kg (European record) which I think I can achieve by June. 'I won't know who is turning up until the day of the world championships but there could be people from all over the world in my age group so it will be a challenge.' Lindsey grew up in Lancashire before moving to the West Midlands in 1976, where she met her husband, Ian. All four of her children have caught the fitness bug and her only son Ian is the captain of the Swedish national rugby union team after he emigrated there with his wife. The fitness fanatic only weight trains once a week but also plays netball and swims an average of 3,000m every week. And Lindsey hopes her success will show other people that they can keep active and strong as they get older. She added: 'When you look at others lifting big weights who are older than myself it shows that you do not have to get weaker with age,' she said. 'Just because someone gets older it does not mean they can't do lots and lots of different things.

"Zenit St Petersburg took a giant stride towards the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday night after overcoming 10-man Torino in the first leg of their round of 16 tie. Axel Witsel and Domenico Criscito were on target for Andre Villas-Boas' side at the Stadion Petrovskij as Marco Benassi was dismissed in the first half for the visitors.

The Russians returned from a two-and-a-half month break in competitive football at the end of February and came into Thursday's match with three straight wins without conceding a goal. Zenit controlled the early exchanges, dominating possession as Torino defended deep. The Italian's already difficult task became harder when, on just 28 minutes Benassi walked. The midfielder was cautioned as early as the 12th minute when he pulled back Hulk as the Brazilian attempted to spring a counter-attack, before naively challenging Witsel to earn a second booking. The hosts eventually took the lead in the 38th minute. Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel pounced inside the penalty area when Torino failed to clear after Daniele Padelli could only parry an Igor Smolnikov effort. Salomon Rondon thought he had doubled the advantage before the break when he turned Witsel's pass into the net, but it was correctly ruled out for offside.

"Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse were at the centre of a spitting storm as Manchester United grabbed a last-gasp victory at Newcastle - and the pair could now be banned for six games each. Ashley Young’s 89th-minute winner stole three points for Louis Van Gaal’s men following a gaffe from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul, but it was a clash between United defender Evans and his rival Cisse that produced the main talking point of the night. The pair tangled during the first half at St James’ Park and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury. Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored Newcastle striker . Papiss Cisse subsequently retaliates, and appears to aim spit of his own back at the United man . Evans (left) and Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant set-to . The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. As Cisse climbed to his feet, TV footage appeared to show Evans spitting down on the floor in the direction of his opponent. Cisse reacted by putting his head towards Evans and seemed to spit back at him, although it is not clear if it landed on the Northern Ireland international. The referee missed the incident meaning the FA, who are waiting for Anthony Taylor's report, can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each. Last season Hull City striker George Boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new FIFA guidelines, which state that any player 'dismissed from the Field of Play for spitting at an opponent or any other person' will be suspended 'following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his Club has completed its next six matches in approved Competitions.' If found guilty, Cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman. Afterwards, Van Gaal defended Evans. ‘I did not see that (incident) from the bench, but I cannot imagine he would do that,’ said the Dutchman. Newcastle head coach John Carver said: ‘You can't do it can you? It's one of the worst things in football. But I can't comment on it, I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and I need to have a look at it.’ Neither player was booked at the time by referee Anthony Taylor, who awarded a free-kick to Newcastle for the original tangle, but if the official missed the spitting incident the pair could face retrospective action from the FA. The Senegalese striker points the finger at Manchester United's defender after the incident . Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, covering the match as a pundit for BT Sport, slammed Cisse while suggesting Evans wasn’t a guilty party. ‘I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. I know Jonny, he’s not that type of person,’ he said. ‘If he wants to do that then it’s not hard to miss, is it? He’s only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.’ Scholes’ colleague, ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid star Steve McManaman, said: ‘I’d like to think he (Evans) is spitting at the floor and not at Cisse. But then Papiss Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans’ neck from about six inches. It’s absolutely disgusting.’ Van Gaal, meanwhile, was relieved to see Young steal three points on a night when all of the top four won. ‘I was very pleased with the win, especially here,’ he said. ‘I lost here as a coach of Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar. I knew it was difficult and Ryan Giggs said there is a lot of pressure from the crowd. But we made the crowd quiet. The players share heated moments at St James' Park as they exchange points of view . ‘But we don’t reward ourselves (with goals). If you don’t reward yourselves you can get negative results and David de Gea had to make two fantastic saves. ‘It was important to win after you see all of the results of our competitors in our rat race. ‘Everyone is now full of confidence going into the FA Cup game with Arsenal.’ As for Carver, he was furious that Newcastle were denied an early penalty when Chris Smalling fouled Emmanuel Riviere. ‘It’s frustrating and I’m so disappointed for the guys,’ he said. ‘For 89 minutes we were outstanding but we don’t have world-class players like they do. ‘To concede like we did is disappointing but what is more disappointing is the blatant penalty in the first half which was not given. Anthony Taylor is a human-being and he’s missed it. That would have set us up nicely.’","The pair collided near half-way line and Evans appeared to spit at Cisse .

"Sunderland midfielder Sebastian Larsson has blasted his side's 'embarrassing' and 'shocking' performance against Aston Villa that had supporters heading for the exits even before half-time.

Fans showed their outrage as the Black Cats slumped to a record of one win in 12 Premier League games . Poyet, who accepted responsibility for the defeat after the match, was sacked following talks with the club's hierarchy on Monday. But Larsson insists it is the players who are to blame for the 4-0 drubbing at the hands of relegation rivals Villa. 'It's a shocker of a performance in the first half after a good start,' Larsson told the Sunderland Echo. 'All of us 11 players out there have to take the blame. Sunderland fans attempt to storm Gus Poyet's dugout as the home side fell behind to Aston Villa . Midfielder Larsson insists it was the players that were to blame for the performance . 'The goals we conceded in that first half were so avoidable, every single one. 'It's just a ridiculous amount of mistakes from all of us out there. Look at all four goals and none of them should be going in. 'That's the very, very frustrating thing. 'It's just embarrassing.

"The build-up to Manchester United’s FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal has inevitably rekindled memories of their epic encounter in 1999; Roy Keane’s sending-off, Peter Schmeichel’s penalty save and Ryan Giggs’ mazy, mesmerising winner followed by a shirt-stripping celebration. United’s semi-final victory at Villa Park that night came to epitomise Sir Alex Ferguson’s Treble-winning team. The penchant for high drama. The never-say-die spirit that he instilled in his players. And a ‘we’ll score more goals than you’ attitude in going toe-to-toe with any opponent, be it Barcelona or Blackburn Rovers. So as United prepare to face the Gunners again for a place at Wembley on Monday night, it’s perhaps understandable if their supporters are growing disillusioned by the brand of football being offered up by Louis van Gaal’s team. Ryan Giggs (right) scored arguably the greatest FA Cup goal in Manchester United's 1999 win over Arsenal . Giggs watches his left-foot strike fly past David Seaman as defender Toy Adams slides in too late . Giggs' semi-final winner was followed by a shirt-stripping celebration in an iconic moment at Villa Park . United won the Treble with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's late Champions League strike against Bayern Munich . It doesn’t seem to matter what tactics the Dutchman employs, the result seems to be the same. Whether it’s down to a three-man defence, a midfield diamond, or simply a case of launching high balls up to Marouane Fellaini, United simply haven’t been very entertaining this season. There is a caution, a lethargy, to Van Gaal’s side at odds with the traditions of the club. The Manchester United way. Giggs espoused it when he was installed as caretaker manager for the final four games of last season. ‘It’s going to be my philosophy, Manchester United’s philosophy,’ said Giggs at the time. ‘I want players to play with passion, speed, tempo and be brave with imagination – all the things that are expected of a Manchester United player. United’s philosophy is to attack.’ No wonder the Old Trafford legend seemed a little underwhelmed as Van Gaal turned to him to celebrate a late 1-0 win over Newcastle last week. Current Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has been criticised for his brand of football this season . Van Gaal's philosophy this season is different to United's trademark cavalier style of play . Juan Mata (right) leads the way as United's current crop prepare to face Arsenal in the FA Cup . David de Gea, Marouane Fellaini and Luke Shaw (L-R) could all start against the Gunners at Old Trafford . Paul Scholes, Giggs’s former team-mate who joined him on the coaching staff for that brief stint last year, has described United’s football as ‘miserable’. ‘United’s history was built on attacking football, which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances,’ says Scholes. ‘To beat opposing teams you have to attack, and to attack you have to take risks. Too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks.’ Ferguson’s teams did not always dazzle on the big stage, of course. The goalless 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal ranks as one of the worst in recent memory, though largely due to the negative tactics employed by Arsene Wenger before his side won on a penalty shootout. Equally, United’s 1979 final against the Gunners is lauded as one of the classics by those who sometimes forget that the first 85 minutes were pretty turgid. Sir Alex Ferguson guided United to 13 Premier League titles during his 1,500 games in charge of the club . Eric Cantona (left) led United to four Premier League titles  during the 1990s . Cristiano Ronaldo (right) was the epitome of United's pleasing-on-the-eye style during his time at the club . Dave Sexton was in charge of United that day. His sacking two years later in 1981 was attributed to the fact that his team were just too boring even though United had just ended the season with seven straight wins, typically six of them by a one-goal margin. It is a reminder that results are not always everything at Old Trafford as Van Gaal continues to build on an impressive record of just two defeats in 22 games. Sexton paid the price for failing to play the United way; a cavalier style built on width and speed and a commitment to attack and entertain the fans. ‘All those lads you see going to the factory in Trafford Park, they come to watch you on Saturday,’ Sir Matt Busby told a teenage Bobby Charlton on his arrival at the club. ‘They have boring jobs, so you have to give them something they will enjoy.’ Dave Sexton (centre) was sacked as United manager in 1981 after failing to play the United way . United supporters displayed a banner demanding the sacking of Ferguson during the late 1980's . Tommy Docherty embraced Busby’s philosophy. Ron Atkinson too, though neither with the greatest success. When home attendances dropped to 33,000 during Ferguson’s darkest period in late 1989, it was largely down to a dreadful run of results that left United hovering above the relegation zone. One could argue that United are not much worse to watch under Van Gaal than they were under David Moyes, with better results. But fans expect more from the £150million spent last summer and the names on the team sheet. They find it hard to take when Wayne Rooney is dropped into midfield, Fellaini goes up front, and Sam Allardyce of all people gets to label their team ‘Long Ball United’. In recent weeks, they have taken to urging their team to ‘attack, attack, attack’ and booed when the ball is passed back to David de Gea. Van Gaal is understandably proud of the fact that he has won a trophy in his first season at each of his clubs. But as United aim to move a step closer to lifting the FA Cup for a record 12th time, he would do well to remember that style counts every bit as much as silverware at Old Trafford. Angel di Maria's form has dropped alarmingly after a bright start at Old Trafford following his summer move . Di Maria (centre) was substituted at half-time during United's 2-0 win at home to Sunderland last month . Deploying Marouane Fellaini (right) as a makeshift forward has also received negative feedback this term .","Manchester United face Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth round on Monday night .

Guardiola took charge of the German powerhouses in June 2013 and has led them to success in the Bundesliga and in domestic and European cup competition.

"Porto cruised into the last eight of the Champions League after a comprehensive victory against Basle at the Estadio do Dragao on Tuesday night. The teams drew 1-1 in Switzerland three weeks ago but goals by Yacine Brahimi, Miguel Herrera, Casemiro and Vincent Aboubakar settled the tie to send the Portuguese side into their first quarter-final since 2009. The one sour note on an otherwise perfect night for Porto was that captain Danilo had to be carried off on a stretcher with his neck in a brace, but it was later confirmed he had suffered no serious injury. Casemiro slides to his knees in celebration after finding the top corner with a stunning free-kick . Casemiro points the sky in celebration after firing Porto into a 3-0 lead on the night sealing the victory . Tomas Vaclik dives in vain as Casemiro's unstoppable strike flies into the top corner in Porto on Tuesday .

Booked: Gashi, Gonzalez, Safari . Sent off: Samuel . Manager: Paulo Sousa . Referee: Jonas Eriksson . Basle were reduced to 10 men in injury time after experienced defender Walter Samuel was dismissed for a second bookable offence for an off-the-ball incident with Aboubakar. Algerian midfielder Brahimi opened the scoring for the home side in the 14th minute with a superbly executed free kick after on-loan Barcelona forward Cristian Tello was clumsily felled right on the edge of the penalty area by former Inter Milan defender Samuel. Brahimi placed the ball with purpose before the 25-year-old sent a bending effort over the wall and into the top corner, leaving Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik rooted to the spot. Porto were then dealt a major blow as captain and Real Madrid  target Danilo was involved in a sickening collision with his own keeper Fabiano. The clash left both men in a heap but it was the Brazilian right back that came off worst. Danilo crashed to the floor, visibly knocked following contact with Fabiano's shoulder. The 23-year-old left the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace before being placed in an ambulance and taken to hospital, where tests revealed no lasting damage.

Cameroon striker Aboubakar falls to his knees as he celebrates his goal in front of the fans . After a lengthy stoppage in play Porto could have added to their lead in the first half as the Portuguese side controlled the game. First Casmeiro and then Aboubakar went close as the home side had to settle for a one-goal lead at half-time. But Porto did extend their advantage just minutes after the restart. Goalscorer Brahimi turned provider this time as he teed up Hector Herrera after a fine run down the left flank. Brahimi twisted and turned before cutting back to the Mexican on the edge of the area, who beat Vaclik with a perfectly placed curling effort from 18 yards. Algerian Brahimi lifted the ball over the Basle wall from the the edge of the box leaving the keeper rooted . It got even better for Porto as on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro produced a stunning free kick, a cut above even  his team-mate's in the opening 45. The 23-year-old struck a dipping effort from more than 30 yards that left poor old Vaclik picking the ball out the net again to put the tie beyond any doubt. The fourth goal, coming with 15 minutes to play, was just as good as the three that preceded it. Basle defenders backed off  Aboubakar as he marauded forward before the Cameroon international unleashed a ferocious strike from 20 yards that nestled in the top corner. Frustration boiled over for Samuel in the final moments of the match as he was involved in an altercation with Aboubakar off the ball. The Argentine defender was shown a second yellow card for his troubles as Porto marched into the last eight. Vincent Aboubakar completed the scoring with another brilliant strike from 20 yards to make it 5-1 overall .

"Winning three Champions League titles proves that Carlo Ancelotti can be a tough operator and is no pushover when it comes to coaching, the Real Madrid coach said on Friday. Despite Real holding a two-point lead at the top of La Liga, Ancelotti has been criticised for their lull in form since the Christmas break and he has also been accused of being too soft on the players.

I have full confidence in the team and I will repeat that I would make the same substitution again.' Ancelotti admitted though that the team needs regain its potency in attack.

"Defending champions Sevilla have one foot in the Europa league quarter-finals after they scored three away goals against La Liga rivals Villarreal in their round of 16 tie on Thursday night. Vitolo opened the scoring for the visitors after just 13 seconds - the fastest goal in Europa League history - before former QPR midfielder Stephane M'bia doubled the advantage to hand Sevilla a commanding first-half lead at El Madrigal. In-form Villarreal forward Luciano Vietto pulled a goal back for the home side just minutes after the restart but Sevilla's two-goal advantage was almost instantly restored through Kevin Gameiro. Kevin Gameiro netted the third for Sevilla moments after Villarreal had pulled a goal back . In-form 21-year-old striker Luciano Vietto reduced the deficit for the home side shortly after half-time . Villarreal had only lost once in their last 14 matches at home in all competitions but Marcelino's side got off to the worst possible start. With the very first attack of the game former PSG striker Gameiro flicked on a hopeful ball forward into the path of the breaking Vitolo who coolly slotted the ball past Sergio Asenjo in the Villarreal goal. Cameroon international M'bia gave the away side a two-goal advantage after 26 minutes.

Vietto halved the deficit moments after half-time when Denis Cheryshev's strike fell kindly to the Argentine youngster via the arm of M'Bia before he finished past Sergio Rico - his sixth goal in the competition this season. There was some confusion about whether the goal had stood as Sevilla defenders seemed to think the officials had awarded a penalty for handball, but the goal stood. Any fears of a Villarreal comeback were quelled as the two-goal advantage was immediately restored.

"New York City head coach Jason Kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding Frank Lampard's delayed move to the club and says his arrival midway through the season could actually provide a well-timed boost. Former Chelsea midfielder Lampard agreed to sign for the new Major League Soccer franchise last July and was set to join up with his new team-mates in January ahead of the new season, which starts on Sunday. The 36-year-old then joined New York's sister club Manchester City - both part of the City Football Group - on what was initially reported to be a short-term loan deal. Frank Lampard agreed to join New York City when he left Chelsea last summer . Former England international delayed move to the MLS franchise until the end of the Premier League season . Lampard joined Manchester City at the start of the season on a short-term deal . Head coach Jason Kreis says Lampard's late arrival can provide the team with a boost during the season . As it transpired, the deal at City was in fact a standalone one which, after a number of impressive performances for Manuel Pellegrini's side, was extended beyond January until the end of the Premier League season. Lampard's decision to remain in Manchester and miss the start of New York's debut MLS campaign riled supporters of the franchise, but Kreis appears to have taken the potentially exacerbating episode in his stride. 'You know, I think we could look at that from a very negative point of view and say this is going to be really difficult and we had him pencilled in one way or another,'Kreis said in an interview with Bleacher Report. Frank Lampard (wearing black, third right) poses for a picture with his New York City team-mates in February . The deal was extended until the summer after a number of impressive displays for City . Lampard will now join up with his new club in JUly, missing the first four months of the season . 'Or we can look at it from a positive point of view and say, OK, well, this means that some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities to make significant contributions in his position for the first four or five months of the season, and you need that in our league. 'When you get to the end of the season and there's some real fatigue, injuries and suspensions, you need guys to be able to step in and not miss a beat. I think this affords us that opportunity. 'We're going to be having a player that's going to be at the top of his game, extremely fit, coming right out of a Premiership season, which hopefully will he will have another medal to put in his pocket, and we can have a really significant, positive boost in the middle of the season.'

"Roberto Soldado has warned his Tottenham team-mates they face another 12 finals just days after suffering Wembley heartache as the striker wishes team-mate Erik Lamela a happy birthday. Tottenham saw the dream of winning their first silverware in seven years crushed by Chelsea on Sunday as Jose Mourinho's side handed them a 2-0 defeat in the Capital One Cup final. Mauricio Pochettino's side were also dumped out the Europa League by Fiorentina three days before the League Cup disappointment leaving an assault on the Premier League top four their only ambition for the rest of the season.

Former Valencia forward Soldado has, in typically cliched fashion, slammed home the importance of the remaining 12 league fixtures, starting with the White Hart Lane clash with Swansea on Wednesday night. 'It only remains to look ahead and to be focus on the Premier League,' the out-of-favour striker tweeted on Tuesday. '12 matches, 12 finals. We need to be in the top 4.COYS!!' Meanwhile, Lamela was celebrating his birthday on Wednesday and Soldado took to social media to wish his team-mate many happy returns ahead of the match against Garry Monk's side.

Tottenham have failed to win any of their last five games since beating Arsenal 2-1 back at the start of February.

"Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez returned to training this week as he stepped up his recovery from a fractured metatarsal that has kept him sidelined since the start of February.

The Brazil international's contract with the Catalan club is due to expire at the end of the season and he will be free to leave for nothing.

"Footage of a four-year-old boy firing a gun into the air has caused outrage in Mexico after video showing him firing wildly in the middle of the street was posted online. While Mexican laws allow residents to keep guns within their own homes, the boy can be seen firing the pistol repeatedly above his head while several adults stand around apparently unconcerned. Despite the fact that the gun recoils after each bullet, he is clearly well versed in using it and fires off several rounds. The boy can be seen standing in the middle of the street with the gun poised above his head . He then begins firing off rounds, while adults standing nearby appear completely unconcerned . The video caused outrage across Mexico after it was posted online and went viral . Police are now being urged to investigate both the child and the adults who appear in the video . The video has now gone viral with authorities being urged to track down the boy and adults, and take legal action. It is a common misconception that guns are illegal in Mexico but ownership is strictly controlled, with only licensed firearms allowed to be kept at home for reasons of personal protection. A police spokesman confirmed to local media that a child standing in the middle of the street firing a gun indiscriminately into the air was definitely not legal under any circumstances. He said: 'We have heard about the case including the allegation that happened in Mexico, but at the moment we have no more details.' He added that if anybody knew any more details including the location and the names of the three adults who also appeared in the video then they should contact police and pass it on. The video shocked many in a country that is used to gun violence. Virgo Tierra wrote: 'How awful, those are the values that children are taught it seems.' And another, Alfredo Taquillo, said: 'I guess in a few years when he has killed somebody his parents will say he must have got in with bad company.'","Footage of a four-year-old firing a gun in Mexico street provokes outrage .

"Yaya Toure has snubbed his Manchester City team-mates by failing to name any of them in his dream team. The midfielder has chosen to omit the likes of Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany but has named former colleagues Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Lionel Messi in his ideal XI. To add insult to injury, Toure has revealed he would call on the services of four players from his former side's arch-rivals - Real Madrid. Manchester City star Yaya Toure failed to name a single Premier League star in his current dream XI . The 31-year-old decided to omit the likes of Vincent Kompany (above) and Sergio Aguero . Toure is likely to start against Barcelona on Wednesday after missing the first leg through suspension . 3-5-2: Casillas; Ramos, Pique, Hummels; Dani Alves, Iniesta, Xavi, Schweinsteiger, James Rodriguez; Ronaldo, Messi . Real Madrid quartet Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez are included in Toure's side, while Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund complete the team. The 31-year-old has not named a single player from the Barclays Premier League despite playing in England for just under five years. There were no stipulations when picking his side which makes his choice to not include any of his Manchester City team-mates even more bizarre. Frank Lampard took part in the same exercise back in September and he named current City team-mate Kompany in his dream XI. Premier League stars Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry and Didier Drogba were also included in Lampard's selection. The only stipulation was that he could only select players who are still 'playing today'. Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas got the nod to start in goal despite his recent dip in form . Gerard Pique (centre) and Sergio Ramos (top right) were selected in a back three with Mats Hummels . Andres Iniesta (centre) was chosen to play in midfield with Dani Alves, Xavi and Bastian Schweinsteiger . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi are named in the forward positions with James Rodriguez behind . Frank Lampard named Manchester City captain Kompany in his dream team back in September . Toure is expected to feature against his former side on Wednesday as Manchester City travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona. The Ivory Coast international, who missed the first leg through suspension, will be hoping he can help his current side mount a comeback after losing 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Luis Suarez struck twice during the match in late February before Aguero pulled one back to keep Manchester City's dreams of winning their first ever Champions League alive. Meanwhile, City playmaker Silva has warned his team-mates that they must not concede a goal at the Nou Camp if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals. David Silva insists City have to stop Barcelona scoring to have a chance of progressing to the next round . Silva and his City team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie . 'We need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against Roma and Bayern Munich in the group stages,' said Silva. 'The most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult. 'Strange things can happen. Everybody wrote Schalke off before they played Real Madrid but they won 4-3 and could have scored again which would have put them through. Nobody predicted that. 'Not many thought PSG could beat Chelsea, especially with only 10 men for so long, so I know that anything can happen, not only in the Champions League but in every game. 'Everyone is expecting Barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we don't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away.'

"For years, Nicklas Bendtner has unofficially held the title of Lord, albeit mostly in jest. But now, the former Arsenal striker can legitimately claim to be Lord Bendtner, after Danish magazine SE Og HOR are said to have bought him one square foot of land in Glencoe Wood, Scotland. After hundreds of tweets and even a twitter account in his name - @LordBendtner - the wolf of Wolfsburg has finally been rewarded with the title his many legions of fans believe he is worthy of. Nicklas Bendtner, now at Wolfsburg, has been made a Lord after a Danish magazine bought him a plot of land . The former Arsenal striker, who left the club last summer, thinks 'it's a fun gimmick', according to his agent . And Bendtner is said to be delighted with the news, according to his agent Elisa Lykke. She said: 'We have seen it, and Nicklas thinks it's a fun gimmick. 'We have asked to be sent a receipt and we are pleased that it supports a nature conservation area.' Bendtner was previously made aware of the nickname, and spoke of his confusion during an interview with a German magazine. The Danish striker has currently scored one goal for Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga this season . For years, Bendtner has held the title of 'Lord' among his fans on social media site Twitter . 'The problem with this [nickname] is that I do not know where it comes from and understand if it is funny,' he told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. 'Am I being ridiculed? Is it serious? I think it is a phenomenon of the youth [on social media]. They think that sounds good.' Bendtner left Arsenal for good in the summer, joining Bundesliga club Wolfsburg on a three-year-deal. Unfortunately for the Danish striker, it hasn't worked out quite as planned and he has only managed one league goal this season. A brace in the Europa League has been the highlight of his short career in Germany, but perhaps his new-found title will improve his fortunes on the pitch, too. A 'certificate of sale', posted on Twitter, reveals the full details of the purchase by the Danish magazine .","Nicklas Bendtner has held the nickname of 'Lord' for a number of years .

"Common sense would suggest that when molten lava meets a sheet of ice it will simply melt through. But geologist Professor Jeff Karson and artist Professor Bob Wysocki from Syracuse University in New York found that the results can be far more spectacular. Using a lava furnace to heat gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100°C (2,000°F) they were able to pour it onto a slab of ice to produce a seething, bubbling mass of molten rock. Lava turns ice directly into steam which bubbles up through the molten rock to form bizarre glass bubbles . Professor Karson, who has been pouring lava in a series of experiments to better understand how it behaves and forms geological formations, described it as 'scrambled eggs from hell'. Rather than melting straight through the ice, the lava instead flows rapidly on top of it on a cushion of steam. Steam from the ice below bubbles up through the molten rock as it tries to escape, forming a layer of glassy bubbles. Professor Karson said: 'The first guess is that it is going to explode or it is tunnel down and make a hole in the ice. Of course it didn't do any of those things. 'It did things we just didn't really expect.' Professor Karson and Professor Wysocki have together set up the Lava Project at Syracuse University's department of Earth Sciences to study how lava behaves in different situations. They create lava by melting basalt gravel in a giant gas fired furnace and then pouring it over sand, ice and through water. According to Alistair Linsell, a nuclear chemist working with EDF Energy and a science presenter with the Science Channel, the extreme heat of the lava is what causes the strange formations to form when it hits the ice. He said: 'The lava is so hot that when it is poured on to the ice, the ice turns not into water but straight into steam. 'The formation of all of this steam helps the lava to flow. It is sitting on top of a blanket of steam rather than the ice itself, this means the friction between the lava and the ice surface is very low. The lava flows rapidly across the surface of the ice on a cushion of escaping steam it creates as it moves . 'As the lava cools we start to get a thick black layer forming on top and that starts to trap those bubbles of superheated steam inside the rock. 'It is kind of like a natural form of glass blowing.' The team used a specially created lava furnace to heat basaltic gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100°C . Professor Jeff Karson (left) and Professor Bob Wysocki (right) have been studying how lava flows behave .","Lava heated to 1,100°C turn ice straight into steam which then bubbles up through the molten rock to form a seething sheet of bubbles .

"For a player that has yet to regularly score at club level, Nicklas Bendtner certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a Denmark shirt. The former Arsenal striker became an outcast at the Gunners and is now struggling for game time at Wolfsburg. But a hat-trick against the USA on Wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level. Here Sportsmail looks at the Dane's international scoring record as well as nine other hot-shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs. Ali Daei (International caps 149, goals 109) Ali Daei is in a league of his own. As the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country. Ali Daei celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich against Hamburg during his short stay with the German giants . Daei was prolific for Iran and featured in the 1998 World Cup where he played against the USA (above) But the striker found banging goals in for Iran was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in Germany. Bayern Munich signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at Hertha Berlin, who offloaded him to Dubai in 2002 following just six league goals. Stern John (Trinidad & Tobago - International caps 115, goals 70) With an international strike rate better than Luis Suarez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robin van Persie, you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the Premier League. Birmingham's Stern John (right) goes down under pressure from Bolton's Jay-Jay Okocha in 2002 . England's John Terry clears the ball off the line in front of John and Rio Ferdinand during the Three Lions' 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago at the group stages of the 2006 World Cup . But Stern John never stood out during his two years at Birmingham between 2002 and 2004, while Sunderland also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight. It certainly doesn't reflect well on the international opponents Trinidad & Tobago must have been playing. Lukas Podolski (Germany - International caps 122, goals 48) Since making his international debut over 11 years ago, Lukas Podolski has gone on to become a regular for Germany, winning over 120 caps and of course the World Cup last year. Arsenal's Lukas Podolski (right) fends off Bayern Munich's Javi Martinez during a Champions League game . Podolski has over 120 caps for Germany and took a selfie with Bastian Schweinsteiger after winning the 2014 World Cup in Brazil last summer following a 1-0 victory over Argentina in the final . His international breakthrough came while starring for Cologne but since moving to Bayern Munich in 2006, his club form never again hit the same consistent heights. A flop at Bayern and frozen out at Arsenal, he is now toiling on loan at Inter Milan from the Gunners. Milan Baros (Czech Republic - International caps 93, goals 41) Between 2002 and 2008, Milan Baros failed to establish himself as a Premier League striker following an average spell at Liverpool, a poor two years at Aston Villa and a very brief loan spell at Portsmouth. Manchester United's Roy Keane slides in on Liverpool's Milan Baros during a Premier League game in 2005 as United's Darren Fletcher looks on . Milan Baros was the top scorer at Euro 2004 as he celebrates one of his five goals against Latvia . Czech Republic reached the semi-finals thanks to Baros' two goals in a 3-0 quarter-final win over Denmark . So it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at Euro 2004, scoring five goals as Czech Republic reached the semi-finals. David Healy (Northern Ireland - International caps 95, goals 36) Now David Healy wasn't a bad player, but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a European qualifying campaign  (13 for Euro 2008), you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the Premier League. Ashley Cole can only look on as David Healy fires home the winning goal for Northern Ireland in a famous 1-0 victory over England in a World Cup qualifier back in 2005 at Windsor Park . David Healy celebrates scoring for Fulham against Middlesbrough in 2007 before seeing the goal ruled out . But just five league goals for Fulham and Sunderland between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise. Still, Northern Ireland fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against England in 2005. Nicklas Bendtner (Denmark - International caps 65, goals 29) Much maligned during his Arsenal spell, and even loan spell at Sunderland and Juventus failed to land him permanent moves. Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner (right) and Chelsea's Michael Essien compete for the ball during a fourth round Capital One Cup match in 2013 at the Emirates Stadium . Nicklas Bendtner has a fine scoring record for Denmark, here he celebrates a Euro 2012 goal against Portugal . Even now at Wolfsburg, Bendtner can hardly get a kick. For Denmark though he is a totally different prospect. His hat-trick against USA on Wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at Arsenal in 43 fewer games. Helder Postiga (Portugal - International caps 71, goals 27) It seems incredible to think that a striker who couldn't even get into one of Tottenham's worst ever Premier League teams during the 2003-04 season is still mixing it with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo at the highest level.. Helder Postiga scored his only league goal for Tottenham against Liverpool in January 2004 . But Postiga would later haunt England after equalising against the Three Lions in a Euro 2004 quarter-final . Postiga scored just one league goal at Spurs, but he had the last laugh on England. Postiga scored for Portugal against the Three Lions in Euro 2004, while also featuring in the team that dumped out Sven Goran Eriksson's side at the World Cup two years later. Jozy Altidore (USA - International caps 79, goals 27) It was no surprise earlier in his career that not just Hull but Sunderland decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the Premier League. Jozy Altidore fends off Chelsea's David Luiz in a 2014 Capital One Cup quarter-final . Altidore (second right) celebrates scoring against Denmark in an international friendly on Wednesday . But just one league goal in 42 appearances for the Black Cats though soon had the North East outfit packing him off to Toronto in a swap deal for Jermain Defoe. Despite this, Altidore still holds his own in the starting XI of a respectable United States outfit.

El Hadji Diouf is sent off for Liverpool in a Premier League match at Chelsea as John Terry looks on in 2004 . Diouf celebrates after Senegal beat Sweden to progress to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals . So it was seen as quite a coup for Liverpool when they signed the forward for £10m. Just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining Bolton, he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile Reds move. Danny Welbeck (England - International caps 32, goals 12) Frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at Manchester United, Danny Welbeck is finding a similar problem now at Arsenal in that he cannot get a start as a striker in front of Olivier Giroud. Danny Welbeck struck for Arsenal recently in their 2-1 win at Manchester United in the FA Cup . Welbeck's clever back-heel goal helped England beat Sweden 3-2 during the group stages at Euro 2012 . Welbeck has impressed when playing as a striker for England. Here he celebrates a goal against San Marino . Stick the 24-year-old in an England shirt though and he comes to life. His cheeky back heel against Sweden at Euro 2012 underlined his ability, and his recent addition to the side in partnering Wayne Rooney seems to have also improved the form of the England captain.","Nicklas Bendtner scored a hat-trick for Denmark in 3-2 win over USA .

"Ronda Rousey recorded the fastest-ever finish in a UFC title fight as she submitted Cat Zingano after just 14 seconds in Los Angeles.

Rousey had landed on her head but the champion gracefully flipped Zingano on to her back, got up and manoeuvred swiftly into position to wrench Zingano's arm grotesquely. Rousey forced the challenger to tap out. 'We were expecting that she might come out and do something flying at me right away,' Rousey said. 'That's not usually how you land an armbar at that angle, but it works. It was a lot like judo transitions, where you scramble the second you hit the ground. 'I made that up on the fly, to be honest. But it was kind of funny: We were going toward the ground, and I kind of reverted back to judo mode and was thinking, 'Don't touch your back. It's a point.' 'That's where the acrobatic thing came from, was thinking about not touching your back in judo.' It was hard to work out who was more stunned, Zingano or the sell-out 17,000-crowd at the Staples Center. 'She's really good ... but that wouldn't happen again,' the beaten challenger said. 'It was a knee and then a throw and then a scramble, and then she was wrapped around my arm. I got caught. I was ready to do a million different things. I planned on getting in a fist fight tonight.'

"Anthony Pettis is expecting a tough night as he defends his lightweight title against Rafael dos Anjos.

And although he is predicting a knockout, the American knows he won't have it all his own way. Anthony Pettis (left) goes face-to-face with Rafael dos Anjos at Friday night's weigh-in in Dallas .

He’s got a solid, well-rounded game, he’s a great kickboxer, amazing jujitsu, I just feel like his biggest strength is his heart. He doesn’t quit, he just keeps coming.. 'His biggest weakness is that he’s never fought a guy like me. I feel like my angles and the things I throw in the Octagon are second to none. My prediction - knockout. I need a knockout, it’s been a long time since my last knockout and I’m not going past the first round. 'He's a good fighter, but I'm a great fighter.' Dos Anjos has won his last three bouts, including a stunning first-round knockout of Henderson last August. And he has no fear about being the underdog once again. 'I am going to go in there and take my belt,' he said. 'I do not know how the fight is going to go, but I know it will not go to the judges. I will not allow the judges to decide and it will not go five rounds. 'I will pressure him like I pressure all my fights. I will be ready for his style and he will not be ready for my power. I am going in there to take my belt. That is all I want from him. 'I am very excited to be the first lightweight champion from Brazil. The belt has a date to be mine and that will be Saturday.

"Construction workers  have been forced to build a £10 million road project around two apartment blocks in China after several families refused to move. The embarrassing rebuke by the ten households has forced developers to curve the major new route around the properties in the city of Yongjia, in eastern China's Zhejiang province, The People's Daily reports. Officials launched the multi-million pound blueprint to much fanfare, saying the new 10-mile provincial road would provide a fast and efficient route between the city and 19 surrounding villages. In the way: The two building are in the direct path of the £10 million road project in Yongjia, eastern China . But although work started in December 2011, construction was forced to stop when 10 families refused to accept the compensation offered to allow their properties to be demolished. This year local council officials lost their patience and ordered the road builders to go around the properties. The four-lane highway opened last month with many drivers arguing the bizarre layout is dangerous. Won't budge: Ten families have refused to leave their homes, that are in the path of a new road, until they are offered a fair price . Road rage: Officials ordered the new thoroughfare to be built around the two buildings 10 families have refused to leave in Yongjia . In China, it is common practice to ask people to move out of their homes to make way for important public sector developments. People who refuse are known as 'nail homeowners' - a term which comes from the nuisance a nail causes when stuck in a fence post. The homeowners say they are happy to move but only if they are offered a fair price so they can afford a new property and be compensated for the inconvenience of leaving homes where they were perfectly happy. Around the houses: Drivers have complained the revised road layout is dangerous after the No.41 provincial route opened last month . Jun Lo, 40, who lives in one of the properties with his wife and parents said they would not be bullied into leaving. He said: 'They tried all sorts of mean tricks to get other people to move out, but me and the others won't budge now because we don't want to be bullied. 'If they want us to go, then they need to pay a decent price otherwise we are just going to sit here.'","10 families get in the way of £10 million road project in China .

"Mexican cockfighting promoters on Friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen. The annual Texcoco Horse Fair, which takes places on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals. Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition despite demands to ban the 'disgusting' sport. Scroll down for video . Injured birds are given only 15 seconds to recover, even if they are incapable of fighting back, in the brutal cockfights staged nightly during the month-long Texcoco Horse Fair . Razorblades are attached to the birds' left leg to make the fights 'more interesting' for gamblers and trainers . Trainers often spit on a rooster's head in a common technique used to anger the bird before it fights . Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition - even though the 'sport' has been met with furious protests . 'Cockfighting is deeply embedded in Mexico's rural culture', Texcoco tourism spokeswoman Rosalinda Benitez told MailOnline on the opening night of the month-long bloodsport bonanza. 'We want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors'. The event, which includes fairground attractions and one of Mexico's biggest horse auctions, expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month. 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', said Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year. 'This year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights'. While cockfighting is banned in all 50 US states and Europe (it was banned in England in 1835), it nevertheless draws big crowds in Mexico, where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning. Male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers . 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later' The dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent . Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another . A cock struts proudly in the ring, though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down . The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights . Cockfighting is also banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country. Indeed the cockfighting arenas, known as palenques, are often the social hubs of many Mexican towns. 'Cockfighting is a family business', said Gregory Castillo, a gamecock trainer from Ranchito Gaby, one of the eight gamecock-producing ranches competing on the fair's opening night. 'We get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle. It always produces a good party atmosphere'. Gregory had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening, and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of Mexican cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird. 'The razorblades make for more interesting fights', he told the MailOnline as he spat on the rooster's head, a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle. 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later'. The cuurved weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena . Spatters of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring, surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks . The cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena, which is covered in blood from previous fights . 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', according to Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year . The cockfighting areana, known as a palenque, in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration . The weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena. 'It's a disgusting practice and there's no reason that it should continue simply because it's seen as tradition', said Leonora Esquivel, a leader of the AnimaNaturalis animal rights organisation, in a telephone interview with the MailOnline. Leonora's organisation, which works closely with Mexico's  Ecologist Green Party, is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country. The group focuses particularly on bullfights, cockfighting and illegal dogfights which occur periodically around the capital. Each cockfight runs for a maximum of 15 minutes, though most are over within two. Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws is rapid and furious. The male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers. Even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer, it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws, when it comes, is rapid and furious and fights are always to-the-death . The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome . 'Sometimes it comes down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over' A fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor. The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome. The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena, before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ('monkey') gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions. 'The more aggressively they peck, scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona, the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter', said Mauricio Alvarez, an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights. 'But sometimes it comes completely down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over'. Bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress. The high-rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets. The month-long Texcoco Horse Fair also features bullfighting and attracts more than 600,000 visitors a year . The facade of the main cathedral building in Texcoco (left). Mexico's national sport, charreria, is a kind of rodeo made up of different equestrian competitions and is also practiced at the fair (right) Cockfighting is banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but is permitted in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital . For people further back in the stands, tennis balls with slits in them are thrown back and forth between gamblers and bookmakers: stuffed with stakes, winnings and losses. The palenque in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration. Following 16 cockfights, each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket, one of Mexico's most famous bands 'Los Angeles Azules' (The Blue Angels) took the animals' place to play to a packed house. The fair will culminate with three shows by Luis Miguel, one of Latin America's most famous artists and a Michael Bublé-esque crooner, from April 9 to 11. All the shows will follow directly on from the cockfights. In December of last year animal rights activists achieved a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, imposing fines of up to £180,000 on organisations which cannot prove the domestic origins of any animals which are used in their performances. The Mexican government is currently engaged in the struggle to find homes for more than 2,000 repossessed tigers, lions, elephants and other such animals which have been freed as a result of the law. International supermarket chain WalMart was in trouble late last year as shoppers complained that a store in Veracruz state hosted a cockfight in order to promote a soft drinks company.","Annual Texcoco Horse Fair takes places on eastern fringes of Mexico City .

Manchester City must score at least two goals at the Nou Camp if they are to have any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. One man who believes they can do just that is right back Pablo Zabaleta - despite the Argentina international admitting Barcelona are 'one of the best teams in the world'. 'We are going to play against one of the best teams in the world. It's not going to be easy, but nothing is impossible in football,' Zabaleta told Four Four Two. 'You have to be ready for these moments. Things can change on games like this. 'You just have to move on to the next game and try to win it. That's what football is. 'It's good that the game [comes after] just three days. We need to recover well, go to Barcelona and see what we can do. Hopefully we can do it.'

"Seth Lane has made a heartbreaking plea for people to wear yellow to support him as he waits for a bone marrow transplant, confined to his hospital bed . Five-year-old Seth Lane has one wish - for the world to wear his favourite colour, yellow. The brave youngster lives in a 'bubble' and can only dream of life outside the confines of his hospital room. He is bound to his bed by a rare immune disorder, which has made the outside, germ-infested world his enemy. Seth was born without an immune system and has lived in a sterile environment for more than half of his short life. Following an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant, his immune system turned on him once again. Since January the five-year-old has been forced to live in his hospital room. As he waits for a life-changing second bone marrow transplant Seth has made a heartbreaking video, watched by more than two million people, in which he appeals for people to show their support. Using speech boards the adorable youngster asks people to wear yellow on March 27, and post a picture on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #WearyellowforSeth. Seth's parents, Leanne and Nik Lane, from Corby in Northamptonshire, said they have been astonished when the video went viral, with more than 2.5 million views in a matter of days. Hundreds of thousands of strangers have already pledged to wear yellow to show Seth they are thinking of him. The video features a smiling Seth perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support. He said: 'Hello I'm Seth. I'm five-years-old and I love Fireman Sam, Paw Patrol and yellow. 'I'm in hospital, I was born with no immune system, and I need a second bone marrow transplant. 'On March 27 lots of people are going to wear yellow to show me how much support I have. Are you going to join in? 'Post a picture of you wearing yellow to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with #wearyellowforseth.' Mrs Lane, a full-time mother-of-two, said: 'We never meant to start any sort of campaign, and only expected friends and family to join in. 'I can't believe it has taken off like this. It is overwhelming. Scroll down for video . The five-year-old was born without an immune system, leaving him vulnerable to picking up life-threatening infections. The condition, known as 'bubble disease' requires sufferers to live in a sterile 'bubble' 'I don't think there is a single country in the world that hasn't got someone who has got involved. 'It all helps show Seth that people are thinking of him. I told him about the views and he asked, ""Is it more than 20?' I said ""yes it is"" and he said ""wowee"".' Seth was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection. His parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency. Known as 'bubble boy disease' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body's antibodies cannot respond to infections, leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs. He was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells. But he was kept in a 'bubble' - unable to interact with children, go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger. Mrs Lane, who has a five-month-old son Hugo with her husband, Nik, 31, said: 'He had no contact with other children until he was two-and-a-half. 'We would go out in the pram and I would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought I was mad.' But after just a couple of years of normality - after Seth had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in October. When he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them. A first bone marrow transplant failed, when his immune system turned on him. It means Seth is now confined to his hospital room once more, waiting for a second transplant . His father Nik Lane is set to be Seth's donor, and doctors are waiting until the five-year-old is well enough before performing the operation . Seth's parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards, appealing for people to wear his favourite colour, yellow, to show their support. It has so far been viewed by more than two million people . Initially, it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in October it turned on his own bone marrow, once again wiping out his entire immune system. Seth returned to his 'bubble' - an ultra-hygienic single room at Newcastle's Great North Children's Hospital - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections, in January. 'If I'm a bit run down and have a coldsore I can't touch him,' said Mrs Lane. 'And if we have a cold we can't go in at all. 'Everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air. The staff are scrupulous with cleaning. 'Nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned, his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day. 'Nik is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and Seth has never been out the room.' His father - who will be a donor for Seth once he is well enough - recorded the video of Seth last week. In just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged Mrs Lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow. It is thought Seth will have his transplant in around six weeks, but will probably have to remain in near-isolation for around a year after the operation. 'It's hard for him, and he is getting bored, but he never complains and he understands,' said Mrs Lane. After his operation and around a year in a sterile environment, Seth's parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again .","Seth Lane, five, from Corby, was born without an immune system .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger returns to familiar surroundings on Tuesday night although it's a long, long time since he was in the Stade Louis II. Wenger managed Monaco between 1987 and 1994 - landing the Ligue 1 title in his first season and adding the French Cup a few years later - and his old club stand between the Gunners and a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

"The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday . Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system . Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench . Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder – was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool’s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool’s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea’s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool’s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville’s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson’s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection . But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea’s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side’s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does. VIDEO Monk rues missed chances . Mamadou Sahko (right) puts in a challenge on Jonjo Shelvey as he again impressed for Liverpool . Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence . Yes, the defenders look more assured. Yes, Skrtel is proving himself a leader in the Liverpool defence. Against Swansea he was outstanding, even producing the initial pass that led to Henderson’s goal. And yes, Sakho and Can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of Liverpool defenders. But they are working as a team, and playing with more composure after Rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were terrorising defenders just wasn’t working this season. The statistics make interesting reading. Only five Premier League goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year. But it’s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of Rodgers. And while the deployment of Gerrard as a holding midfielder, and with it a slight change to a diamond formation, gave Henderson the freedom to get further forward last night, it was the mere fact that Henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of Sturridge’s flick-on that earned Liverpool their goal. Seriously motivated, Liverpool are on the move again.","Brendan Rodgers changed Liverpool's formation to 3-4-3 to much success .

"Arsene Wenger’s Champions League record is as phenomenal as it is deeply disappointing. The paradox is apparent is Wenger’s own mantra, oft repeated, that the club’s record of qualifying for the tournament for 17 consecutive years and having reached the equivalent of knock-out stages for the last 15 years is extraordinary. Yet having contested the Champions League and its predecessor the European Cup 18 times now (including twice at Monaco), he has never won it. Perhaps more damningly he has been in the final just once and the semi-finals three times, once with Monaco and twice with Arsenal. Arsene Wenger is undoubtedly one of the managerial greats but his European record is a blot on his CV . Wenger leads his Arsenal side against Monaco on Tuesday night hoping to turn around a 3-1 deficit . Wenger looks towards the Champions League trophy after losing the 2006 final to Barcelona in Paris . Progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League would require Arsenal to do what no other side has done in the Champions League - overturn a two-goal home leg deficit. So to inspire the team, Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter and created the hashtag #MiracleInMonaco in the hope of inspiring their side to a famous victory, with the topic now trending worldwide. Supporters will hope Mesut Ozil and co can live up to their alter-egos from Arsenal's Christmas party in 2013 where the squad dressed up as superheroes. For a manager of such iconic status who for most of those years has overseen one of Europe’s biggest and best-resourced clubs, that is a poor record, which points to his limitations. Just to be clear, before the debate immediately descends into a pro- or anti-Wenger polemic, there are shades of grey in this argument. Wenger is undoubtedly one of the great managers and will always be revered as such. But his failure to win any European trophy and to have contested just three finals in 22 years of qualifying for various European tournaments, is a glaring omission in his career. It is why the game against Monaco is so poignant. It is not just that he is returning to where his European pedigree began. It is the fact that this tie should have been the perfect platform for Wenger to have another go at building a European success. It hasn’t turned out that way after that awful, shambolic 3-1 defeat in the first leg at The Emirates. Of course, should Arsenal pull off the most unlikely of comebacks, it will rank as one of his greatest moments in the tournament. More significantly, with Real Madrid faltering, Wenger will feel his team, coming nicely into form, has a genuine chance of finally winning it. Few will agree with him though on analysing his record. The failure clearly irks Arsenal. Freddie Ljungberg admitted as much last year, when interviewed about Wenger. For all the plaudits of the incredible Invincible team, they themselves sense a gap in their CV. ‘When we meet up, the old players, we are very disappointed we haven't won the Champions League,’ said Ljungberg. ‘We felt we had a good enough team to win it. Personally that's where I have my biggest regrets, because that was a few years that it happened, and internally, the team thought we had a great chance of winning.’ The closest Wenger came to realising his dream was the Champions League final in 2006, when ten-man Arsenal led until the 76th minute against Barcelona. Who is to say that Arsenal wouldn’t have won that day had Jens Lehmann not been sent off? This is thrust of Wenger’s argument when questioned on his record: that the fine margins and necessary luck which plays its part in football is to blame for him not having achieved his goal. VIDEO Monaco are favourite to progress . Freddie Ljungberg admitted that it was one of the biggest regrets for Wenger's great side to not win in Europe . Ashley Cole reacts after Arsenal lose out in Paris, courtesy of goals from Samuel Eto'o and Juliano Belletti . Thierry Henry could not inspire Arsenal to victory in Wenger's only European Cup final back in 2006 . It is compelling up to a point. Clearly Wenger is an infinitely better coach than Roberto Di Matteo and Tony Barton, both of whom have won the trophy. But judged against his peers, the managerial greats of the modern era, Wenger’s record is lacking. Leave aside for now the fact that Bob Paisley won the trophy three times in six attempts and Brian Clough won it twice in four attempts, in the modern era Wenger’s does not rank among the elite group of coaches. Carlo Ancelotti has won the trophy three times in twelve attempts; Jose Mourinho has won it twice in eleven (counting this season, as he is already out); Pep Guardiola has won in twice in five attempts. And even Guardiola can’t match Jupp Heynckes record of two wins and four finals in five attempts. Heynckes Champions League ‘nadir’ was going out in the semi-final to eventual winners Red Star Belgrade in 1991. Wenger looks on as Barcelona lift the trophy - and he is still without a European trophy in his long career . Jens Lehmann was sent off early in the game and Barcelona's pressure eventually told as they beat Arsenal . A persistent critique of Sir Alex Ferguson’s ability as a coach (as opposed to manager) was that, given his resources he ‘only’ won the trophy twice in 21 years. He also qualified for the competition three times with Aberdeen, but left them to join United midway through the 1985-86 competition. Monaco tonight is the reminder that Wenger is the consummate qualifier in Europe but never the victor. In his six years here at the club, the team qualified for European competition every season, losing in the final of the Cup-Winners’ Cup in 1992 to Werder Bremen. Remarkably, given the relative size of the club, they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1994, losing 3-0 to AC Milan. No disgrace in that, however; that was Fabio Capello’s team which proceeded to take apart Barcelona 4-0 in the final. Carlo Ancelotti has won the Champions League three times, including last year, in twelve attempts . Jose Mourinho has won the big trophy twice in eleven entries (counting this season, as he is already out) Jupp Heynckes has a hugely impressive record of two wins and four finals in five Champions League attempts . Wenger’s gifts are undeniable. But an 18-year sample should take account of bad luck and the statistical vagaries of football. There is a missing link in Wenger’s tactical psyche. It is as evident in the defensive displays against Chelsea and Liverpool last season as it was against Monaco two weeks ago. It has always been there and it holds him back from being the very best. The year he perhaps should have done it but didn’t was not so much 2006, when that team was beginning to decline, but the Invincible year of 2003-04, when a late Wayne Bridge goal at Highbury knocked Arsenal out in the quarter-finals in the days when Wenger’s teams were considerably stronger than Chelsea. It is a difficult to remember a night when Wenger has looked more disconsolate. He seemed so full of fury that he was on the point of bursting into tears. For all the professonial stereotypes, he is a deeply emotional man. Wayne Bridge fired in a late Chelsea winner at Highbury in 2004 in one of Arsenal's best chances of winning . Bridge's goal defeated an Arsenal side that were superior to Chelsea and went on to win the Premier League . Wenger cannot hide his disappointment as then-Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri celebrates a rare win . Nothing would give English football lovers greater pleasure that to see Arsenal execute a remarkable comeback tonight and for Wenger to go on and finally lift the trophy ‘with the big ears,’ as Patrick Vieira always called it. Or, at some stage in these, surely the final few years of his career, for him to achieve that goal. His reputation demands it and on a sentimental level, having achieved so much, he’s earned it. But the Champions League is an unforgiving beast. It may not be a perfect barometer of coaching ability, but it is quite a good, crude measure of how well you pit your wits against the best minds in football. And Wenger, for all his accolades, comes up short. Wenger is back at his former club Monaco on Tuesday night with the hope of reaching European glory .","Arsene Wenger has qualified for the Champions League for last 17 seasons .

"Jordan Henderson required a slice of luck  after an uninspiring first half against Swansea, Jordi Amat’s sliding tackle sending the ball ricocheting on to his shin and ultimately looping beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski. But there has been nothing fortuitous about the manner of his improvement over the past two years. He has blossomed from a player talked about in the same breath as Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam  - as examples of how Liverpool wasted the money from the sale of Fernando Torres - to England’s best midfielder. Liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games where their vice-captain has worn the armband this season, winning 12 and drawing three, proving himself in the dressing room and on the pitch a worthy successor to the departing Steven Gerrard. Jordan Henderson celebrates scoring against Swansea, the latest high point in his huge improvement . Henderson was almost sold to Fulham by Brendan Rodgers but is now England's best midfield option . The former Sunderland man was spoken about as a waste of money but is Steven Gerrard's successor now . An incredible unbeaten run in the league stretching back to December has put Liverpool just two points behind Manchester United in fourth and Henderson has been the key to their revival. Even when he is not playing well, as was the case against Swansea, the 24-year-old is a hub of industry, harrying the opposition and straining every sinew and devoting every ounce of energy to the cause. He also keeps popping up at the crucial moments - this was his third goal in as many games and a vital one which keeps the momentum going for his side. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher speaks of him as one of the best midfielders in the Barclays Premier League. Not bad for a bloke from Wearside who runs funny. Henderson was not even playing particularly well against Swansea but he made the difference for Liverpool . Liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games played by Henderson as captain in Gerrard's absence . Legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned down the opportunity to sign Henderson . That was the assessment of none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, who wrote in his autobiography that Steve Bruce, then Henderson’s manager at Sunderland, recommended United sign the youngster. Ferguson declined citing Henderson’s gait ‘might cause him injuries later in his career'. Of course now he is just the sort of player Manchester United would want marshalling their midfield when the sides meet on Sunday in what could transpire to be pivotal in the race for the final Champions League spot. Henderson laughed off Ferguson’s mean observation, even taking it as a compliment that the pair were discussing him. Over his career so far, he has demonstrated an enviable resilience and a thick skin. When he first arrived at Anfield for £16million and failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown for boyhood club Sunderland he was widely, and understandably, maligned. Even Brendan Rodgers wanted to sell him to Fulham at one point. When he first arrived at Anfield, Henderson failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown at Sunderland . Ferguson turned down Henderson while he was at Sunderland but Manchester United could do with him now . Rodgers considered selling Henderson to Fulham but has been won round by the player's ambition . But Henderson won the Northern Irishman round with his desire and ambition and the two have struck up a good relationship. Henderson credits Rodgers' insistence that he work on his tactical nouse with his improvement. Gary Neville, who works closely with Henderson in the England set-up, has observed a big change in him in the last 12 months and praised his fanatical approach to working on set-pieces. ‘He has a massive conscience in terms of caring about his game and practising on the training ground,’ Neville said on Sky’s Monday Night Football. ‘I remember last year seeing a big change in him in terms of training and practising free-kicks and set pieces. Henderson poses with Charlie Adam, Kenny Dalglish, Alexander Doni and Stewart Downing (left to right) upon signing but in his early days at the club he was viewed as an example of Liverpool wasting money . Henderson is a leader in the dressing room at Liverpool, and with England, according to Gary Neville . The midfielder accepts the congratulations of his team-mates after a hard-fought win in Wales on Monday . ‘You saw him taking set-pieces with Steven Gerrard in the middle. Who would have thought that would happen two years ago? He is not frightened to pull people out and talk, that is why he has the captain’s armband. He is one of the leaders in the dressing room at Liverpool and he is the same with England.’ There may have been moments of luck along the way for Henderson but his story is one of perseverance and boundless improvement. Liverpool and England will hope there is even more to come. Henderson initially struggled to meet expectations at Liverpool but is now valuable  for club and country . Jordi Amat slides in to clear for Swansea but the clearance rebounded off Henderson and into the net .","Jordan Henderson scores fortuitous winner as Liverpool beat Swansea 1-0 .

"Next time you drag yourself out of bed and think it's an effort to shower and grumpily start struggling to put on your clothes and do your make-up, spare a thought for Manon Slomkowski. The 20-year-old partially paralysed French woman has released a video revealing how she manages to get ready every day with the use of just one arm. Ms Slaomkowski suffered a horrific motorcycle accident in the tunnel of Nanterre near Paris in March 2014 and as a result is unable to move her left arm due to brachial plexus palsy and the nerve damage it has caused.

'I am teaching myself every day how to support myself, how to find solutions,' she told the HuffingtonPost. 'I live with neuropathic pain (unbearable) which also suffer amputees. My suffering is physical as well as moral, my body is heavily damaged and tired faster than normal.

'At first, I had a hard time doing things by myself and everything felt painful, every movement or gesture. I couldn't find pleasure in doing anything.' She adds that whilst she looks to the bright side, there are moments of uncertainty: 'I am deprived of my passion but also a lot of activities, my family is worried about me and my future.' 'What's been the most difficult, and still is today - all people who have paralyzed or amputated limbs will back me up on this -- is how to bear the neuropathic pain, also known as ""phantom limb pain"".

"Reading's dream run in the FA Cup has been soured after video emerged of a supporter hurling a flare towards Bradford City supporters at the Madejski Stadium. The Royals were clinical in beating Bradford 3-0 in Monday night's quarter-final replay to reach their first FA Cup semi-final in 88 years - they face Arsenal on April 18 or 19 - but their joy has been tempered by several unsavoury off-field incidents. During the game a Bradford fan was arrested after allegedly racially abusing Reading's Garath McCleary, while one home fan invaded the pitch and goaded Bradford supporters. There was also a mass pitch invasion by home fans after the final whistle and the new video clearly shows that a flare was hurled into the South Stand where the travelling support were. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the incident . Blue smoke can be seen billowing from a flare carried onto the Madejski Stadium pitch on Monday night . The flare leaves a trail of smoke as it is hurled into the crowd during the pitch invasion . The trail of smoke shows the flare's path into the South Stand, where Bradford's support was sat . The flare was spouting smoke which matches Reading's signature royal blue kit colour. Thames Valley Police confirmed on Tuesday that an 18-year-old man from Bradford had been arrested and cautioned for carrying a flare - but this occurred outside the ground before the match. No further arrests have been made concerning the incident after the game. A  spokesman said: 'An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firework while trying to enter a designated sports ground. 'He was given a caution.' The video attracted angry and dismayed comments from fans as it was widely shared on Twitter. One user, Chris Hilton, who describes himself as a Bradford season ticket-holder, said: 'A flare getting chucked into the #bcafc end from the Reading fans #StayClassy' A man is pictured holding a flare while on the pitch at the Madejski Stadium after the full-time whistle . The man's arm is soon pictured raised and the gaze of other nearby fans suggest he has thrown the flare . It is unclear whether this is the fan who threw the flare into the Bradford supporters' end at the Madejski . The pitch invasion was just one of several unsavoury incidents which marred the match . A man raises a flare above his head while on the pitch after the FA Cup quarter-final replay . An eyewitness told MailOnline: 'Celebrating your team’s victory is one thing, goading the opposition fans with sick taunts is another. 'There were kids showing off lighters and mouthing the words ""fire, fire, fire"" which we all knew was a reference to what happened at Bradford in 1985. 'One youth quite clearly launched the flare into the crowd, while, as they had done all game,  the stewards sat back and allowed it to happen.' Gary Lineker, who hosted the BBC's live coverage of the match from a studio at the Madejski Stadium, had described the pitch invasion as 'lovely scenes' in the immediate aftermath of the match. Lineker's comment was surprising considering the obvious safety concerns raised by a pitch invasion. The invasion sparked angry exchanges between both sets of supporters as stewards prevented furious Bradford fans from entering the pitch to confront jubilant Reading supporters. Twitter users expressed their dismay at the video, which was widely shared on social media . Reading comfortably strolled into the FA Cup semi-finals with a 3-0 win. Click here to read the full match report . Supporters proceeded to throw missiles, including bottle of waters, on to the pitch. Earlier, a pitch invader goaded travelling supporters which caused Bradford fans to throw more missiles onto the pitch. Police confirmed that a 20-year-old man from Wokingham is still in custody after being arrested on suspicion of 'going on to playing area at a football match' at around 9pm. Two other arrests were made on the night, one 24-year-old from Bradford on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug and a 27-year-old man from Bradford on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place before the match. Reading keeper Adam Federici was seen handing a coin to a steward guarding Bradford fans. The pitch invasion also follows the ugly scenes at Villa Park earlier this month, when there was chaos as thousands of Aston Villa supporters piled on to the pitch following victory over rivals West Bromwich Albion in their FA Cup quarter-final. Fabian Delph claimed he was bitten, while Boaz Myhill, Craig Dawson, James Morrison and Callum McManaman all appeared to be barged aggressively. And video footage appeared to show further player altercations with on-rushing fans. Concerning the alleged racial abuse of McCleary, a spokesman said: 'A 36-year-old man from Bradford was arrested. We had reports of indecent or racist chanting.' The man was freed on bail until next month. Reading's celebrations were marred by an allegation of racist abuse towards winger Garath McCleary .

The incident occurred five minutes before half-time when McCleary tried to retrieve the ball from the Bradford end. McCleary, a Jamaica international who scored the second goal after his shot took a big deflection, was shocked by something a fan said to him. The winger immediately informed the referee's assistant, who subsequently told fourth official Andre Marriner. Marriner relayed the information to a senior Reading security chief, who is understood to have promptly ensured the fan in question was ejected from the stadium. The supporter was then arrested. In confirming the incident, a Reading statement read: 'An incident was reported to the match officials just before half-time, who in turn told Reading staff. A man was then arrested and ejected during the half-time interval. The FA will wait for referee Mike Jones' report before deciding on what course of action to take, if any, this morning.'

The man arrested faces a lifetime ban from City games if found guilty, according to chairman Mark Lawn. 'I heard about that and when we find out who it was we will take action,' said Lawn. 'I understand the police are prosecuting so we can't do anything at this stage, but if that person is found guilty we will take action. 'There is no place for that in the game, it is unacceptable. 'I would think we're looking at a lifetime ban if he's found guilty but that decision can only be made after consultation with the club's board.'","Video emerges showing flare being hurled into Madejski Stadium stands .

"Liverpool have become the Premier League's best side on the road having claimed their seventh clean sheet away from home in Monday night's 1-0 win at Swansea. Brendan Rodgers' side also equalled Bill Shankly's club record of six consecutive clean sheets on the road having not lost a Premier League game in 2015. The Reds have conceded just 16 goals in 14 away games having faced the fewest shots - 169 - along with Manchester City. Scroll down for the full rundown of the Premier League's defensive stats away from home . Steven Gerrard congratulates Simon Mignolet after Liverpool earned their seventh clean sheet of the season . Mignolet dives to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson during Monday night's 1-0 win at the Liberty Stadium . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers smiles after his side's win sees them keep up their pursuit of the top four . Liverpool have enjoyed a fine run of form since the turn of the year and are in the running for a Champions League spot with the Merseysiders  just four points off second-place. Manchester United and rivals City have conceded the same number of away goals as Liverpool while leaders Chelsea have conceded 17. Southampton's miserly defence have the best record for goals conceded though - letting in  just 11 goals away from home - while goalkeeper Fraser Forster has managed to keep four clean sheets. The Saints' impressive displays at the back sees Ronald Koeman's side - tipped for relegation at the start of the season following a summer of upheaval - in the running for a place in the top four with nine games remaining. Southampton stopper Fraser Forster has kept four clean sheets for high-flying Southampton this campaign . Meanwhile, West Brom, currently 13th in the table,  have managed six clean sheets away from The Hawthorns this term. However, the big shock is perhaps the fact new manager Tony Pulis - who took over from Alan Irvine at the start of the year and is famed for tightening his teams up at the back - is responsible for just two of the six occasions the Baggies defence has not been breached. At the other end of the stats table,  relegation battlers QPR, Burnley and Leicester - along with Newcastle - have conceded the most goals on their travels. West Brom have kept six clean sheets this season - the second-highest total in the Premier League this term . The trio of sides promoted to the Premier League last season have managed just four cleans sheets between them. West Ham, meanwhile, also have a poor record on their travels in terms of goals conceded having kept just one clean sheet away from home - against Southampton in February. Leicester have conceded a huge 273 shots at goal away from home this season - the most in the division - with 87 of those on target. Arsenal's defence have made an impressive 310 interceptions away from the Emirates this campaign, Crystal Palace have completed the most tackles with 334 challenges while Hull City have made 82 blocks - the highest number in the Premier League this term.","Liverpool claimed their seventh Premier League clean sheet on Monday .

"A 28-year-old Italian tourist was killed when he was crushed by a large piece of ice that broke from a glacier, Alaska state troopers say. Troopers say Alexander Hellweger died on Sunday shortly after 5pm at the head of Lake George Glacier, north of Anchorage. Hellweger, from Bruneck, Italy, was on a week-long vacation in Alaska with seven friends from Italy and Belgium. Alexander Hellweger, pictured above two days ago, from Bruneck, Italy, was on a trip with friends when a large piece of ice from a glacier fell and crushed him . The body of the 28-year-old, pictured above last year, was not immediately retrieved because of diminishing light and the danger of more ice breaking . Hellweger (third from the right), pictured last week, was on a week-long vacation in Alaska with seven friends from Belgium and Italy . Guides had transported seven members of the party by helicopter to the backcountry to do heliskiing, or off-trail skiing and snowboarding accessed by helicopter as opposed to ski lift. The party was later transported to the glacier site. While the group was viewing the glacier up close, a piece of ice calved off the glacier and crushed Hellweger, according to Alaska Dispatch News. The eight friends were visiting the head of Lake George Glacier, north of Anchorage, when Hellweger was crushed .

"As well as fancying himself as a boxer, Wayne Rooney believes he is the finest singer at Manchester United. Rooney was subjected to an unwanted set of headlines on Sunday after apparently being knocked out by Phil Bardsley during a sparring session in the kitchen of his Cheshire mansion. The England and United captain did not seem unsettled by the episode, scoring a fine goal in a 3-0 rout of Tottenham and then engaging in some celebratory shadow boxing. Rooney took part in a 'Chevrolet FC hosts Man Utd in Google+ Hangout' on Monday, which was full of light-hearted exchanges and made no mention of his boxing. When Rooney, who was sitting between Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera and apparently at Old Trafford, was asked who the best singer is at the club, he replied: 'Probably me. 'Over Christmas a few of the players got up and did a few songs. Quite good some of them. Michael's not bad.' Herrera said of Carrick: 'He's humble, but he's the best.' Wayne Rooney mocked recent headlines with a 'knockout' celebration at Old Trafford on Sunday . Paul Gascoigne, scoring at Euro 96, was Rooney's favourite English footballer and hero growing up . The host then asked Rooney what songs he liked to sing. 'Opera,' Rooney said, before adding: 'Only joking. I like to sing a bit of indie rock.' There was a slight sneer when it was suggested, tongue in cheek, that Rooney would be asked to sing later in the Hangout, something which did not materialise. Rooney was asked who his favourite English footballer and hero was growing up. His answer was Paul Gascoigne, a player who also attracted tabloid attention for his off-field antics as much as his on-field displays. Rooney added: 'I think he's probably still to this day the greatest English player. For excitement and goals, he was my favourite player.' Michael Carrick (second left) heads Manchester United 2-0 up against Tottenham on Sunday . Carrick is congratulated on his goal by his United team-mates during the 3-0 win at Old Trafford . Asked what it was specifically about Gascoigne that Rooney liked, he said: 'His ability to turn games round on their head and produce magical moments. He was a perfect entertainer on the pitch.' A number of other questions were Rooney related. Told only one player had scored more penalties for United than Rooney, the skipper conferred with Carrick and Herrera before saying: 'We think it's Dennis Irwin.' Asked how confident they were in their answer on a scale of one to 10? Rooney replied '11'. Wayne Rooney applauds the Old Trafford crowd after his side consolidated their place in the league top four . But they were wrong. The correct answer was Ruud van Nistelrooy with 28 penalties. Asked how many he had scored, Rooney said: 'I've no idea.' The next Rooney related question was about the percentage of his 229 United goals scored at Old Trafford. 'We think 58 (per cent),' Rooney said. The correct answer was 54 per cent. Rapid fire questions followed for Dwight Yorke, co-hosting the event in London in front of a live audience. Ander Herrera (left) has impressed in midfield for United since signing from Athletic Bilbao in the summer . Rooney asked: 'What was the score on your Manchester United debut?' Yorke was correct in answering a 0-0 draw at West Ham. Rooney's next question was, 'Can you spell Januzaj backwards?' Yorke was right, with Rooney saying, 'Yes, well done.' Asked if it surprised him that Yorke was correct, Rooney said: 'Knowing Dwight the way I do, it actually did surprise me.'","Manchester United captain scored in win at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"Mixed Martial Arts is the biggest growing sport in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a buzzing story. Their five-star Mobile App “Team Stream” helps you follow the MMA 24-7: DOWNLOAD NOW . UFC title shots don't come around all too often. They are rarely earned without sacrifice and can serve as a fighter's career-defining accomplishment. But as difficult as it is to cement a shot at promotional gold, it's even tougher to take advantage of the opportunity. And for those challengers who taste defeat only to feel their time in the spotlight slip away, forging a divisional comeback is the only way to patch the wound. Here are three recently vanquished title threats who may be close to earning another shot at gold. Joseph Benavidez . Team Alpha Male standout Joseph Benavidez resides in a division dictated by arguably the most dominant champion around in Demetrious Johnson. But considering Benavidez is the flyweight version of Urijah Faber, meaning he doesn't lose outside of a title fight, the two men should cross paths once more. Joseph Benavidez (right) kicks Dustin Ortiz in their flyweight bout during the UFC  event in November . Ortiz (right) punches Benavidez in their flyweight bout during the UFC Fight Night event . Expected to take on fellow Mighty Mouse leftover John Moraga at UFC 187, the 30-year-old has a chance to extend his current win streak to three. And in a weight class as shallow as a glass of water, Benavidez could once again find himself fighting for a title by the end of 2015 (if not early next year). He's a premier draw at 125 pounds, and one of only a few contenders who can actually instil some doubt about the champ's unheralded reign. Benson Henderson . Despite a recent jump up to welterweight and an impressive finish over rising contender Brandon Thatch, former lightweight champ Benson Henderson is still in the mix at 155 pounds. Add in the fact that Anthony Pettis just handed his title over to Rafael Dos Anjos at UFC 185, and Henderson should have an easier track back to contention considering Showtime had beaten him twice. Benson Henderson (left) lands a kick to the body of Brandon Thatch in their welterweight fight . Henderson attempts a submission against Thatch in their welterweight fight last month . While RDA also defeated Smooth via knockout less than one year ago, it was a close contest before the Brazilian landed on unforeseen uppercut that shortly put Henderson on another planet. Needless to say, the 31-year-old is still in the pinnacle of his career and remains one of the most dangerous entities in the deepest division in MMA. He'll be able to log two more Octagon appearances by the end of the year and will have enough momentum to earn a shot should he win both outings. Ricardo Lamas . With an epic showdown between featherweight kingpin Jose Aldo and Irish sensation Conor McGregor looming in the distance, guys like Ricardo Lamas are being drastically overlooked. While Aldo swiftly defended his title opposite The Bully at UFC 169, Lamas did enough in the championships rounds to suggest an upset could happen should he dominate early. Ricardo Lamas punches Dennis Bermudez in their featherweight bout in Mexico City last November . Lamas knocks Bermudez to the mat with a kick in their featherweight fight . But in order to get back into the mix in a division ruled by two international dynamos, the 32-year-old Chicagoan must debunk the evolving arsenal of former title contender Chad ""Money"" Mendes when the two collide at UFC Fight Night 63. Mendes is another name that could easily make this list, but he is at least two impressive victories away from a trilogy fight with the champion. Of course, if McGregor captures the title from Aldo in July at UFC 189, then all slates will be wiped clean.","Joseph Benavidez could soon be set for another shot at a UFC title .

"BBC Sport's determination to retain their coverage of the Six Nations has been significantly helped by their record-breaking viewing figures for the tournament and the positive feedback from the organisers.

"The men expected to carry the can for England’s World Cup humiliation will attempt to ride the storm swirling around their embarrassing exit and plough on into an Ashes summer. Paul Downton, the managing director who has endured a torrid first 14 months in office, gave his full backing to beleaguered coach Peter Moores on Tuesday while making it clear he expects the full support of the ECB. Downton has had to make some momentous decisions since replacing Hugh Morris in the wake of England’s 5-0 Ashes debacle and it was his call to bring back Moores for a second spell as coach that is most under the spotlight now. Peter Moores' place as England coach is safe in the short-term, says ECB managing director Paul Downton . England crashed out of the World Cup at the first hurdle on Monday after defeat by Bangladesh . Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place . Moores is fighting for his credibility at international level after England failed to live up to any expectations at the World Cup by crashing to a first-round exit sealed by defeat against Bangladesh. Yet Downton, who called Moores the ‘outstanding coach of his generation’ when preferring him to Ashley Giles, was adamant that nothing had changed when he addressed England’s worst World Cup of all from London on Tuesday. ‘Peter is an outstanding coach and I don’t think 10 months is a fair amount of time for him to prove that, particularly when we have spent the last six of those playing one-day cricket and trying to catch up,’ said Downton. ‘Clearly as head coach he feels responsible for what has happened but we all feel responsible frankly, because we feel we’ve let the country down and nobody wants to do that. ‘Everybody’s still raw but no decisions are going to be made in the short-term. In less than a month we will be playing in the West Indies so I don’t expect anything to change before then. ‘I’m not saying everybody’s job is safe and I’m not saying everybody’s going to get sacked. It feels as though, from your perspective, there needs to be a scapegoat or a target. ‘We’re in a transitional period and it will take time. It’s too early to talk of definites in terms of “he’s going or staying”.’ Bangladesh players celebrates after their victory over England that eliminated Morgan's side from the Cup . England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim . The question now is whether English cricket’s two new bosses agree with Downton because if they do not, incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves and new chief executive Tom Harrison will have a big call to make. England are due to name their Test party to tour the Caribbean next Tuesday and if they want to get rid of Moores, they have to move quickly. ‘I’ve worked with Colin Graves over the last year and he’s been extremely supportive,’ said Downton, whose position would be untenable if his superiors moved to replace Moores. ‘We spoke yesterday and had a meeting through most of the game. ‘Tom has been with us two months and we’ve spent a lot of time together. They want English cricket to improve as I do but let’s not fudge around it. We’re trying desperately hard to drive the team forward. There are no quick fixes.’ So does Downton expect himself and Moores to still be in place come the first Ashes Test in July, before which England have to play a revitalised New Zealand in Test and one-day series after returning home from the Caribbean? It’s imperative England begin again in one-day cricket with a young, vibrant side in tune with the modern 50-over game and give them as much experience as possible before the next World Cup in 2019. WHO SHOULD GO? So the group of senior players who have failed to produce the goods at this World Cup must all go now — that means Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad should all concentrate on Test cricket. Captain Eoin Morgan needs to regain his form if he is to prove that he may yet have a future with England in limited-overs cricket. It should now also be the end of the road for Ravi Bopara and James Tredwell. WHO SHOULD STAY? England need to build a new one-day team around the core of Joe Root, who should be the new captain, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali. They can be supplemented by Chris Woakes, James Taylor and Chris Jordan while Gary Ballance may yet grow into the modern one-day batsman familiar to Yorkshire, and Steven Finn remains an enigma who should not be discarded in any form just yet. WHO SHOULD COME IN? England need players who can carry them forward now. Step forward Alex Hales, who has to be given a proper run in 50-over cricket, Surrey’s Jason Roy, Kent’s exciting batsman-keeper Sam Billings, Yorkshire’s Adil Rashid to spin the ball away from the right-handers, Hampshire’s classy batsman James Vince and Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes. It is crucial for England to find a left-arm quick bowler — and Essex’s Reece Topley may be the best bet for our 2019 squad. Moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target . Downton says incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who did not appoint him, has been supportive . ‘That’s the plan. Absolutely,’ said Downton.’ The problem for England is the dearth of quality alternatives to Moores, particularly as some of the leading coaches in the world in Gary Kirsten, Stephen Fleming and the man the ECB would most like — Jason Gillespie — do not want the year-round slog of international cricket. Downton made some valid points on Tuesday about the volume of cricket and the need for England to create as different a one-day team from the Test side as possible. But he knows he can only call England a team in transition for so long. This summer’s Ashes will determine the validity of much of what Downton has done over the last 14 months and there was yet another reminder yesterday of the first of his seismic decisions, sacking Kevin Pietersen. Bowler  Ahmed (right) celebrates with team-mate Sarkar Soumya after dismissing England batsman Taylor . Did Graves give Pietersen a glimmer of hope when he told the BBC last week that the exiled star might be considered again if he played county cricket? ‘The position hasn’t changed,’ said Downton. ‘What Colin said was right. To be picked by England you have to be scoring an awful lot of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors to be a positive influence.’ Downton was lost for words when asked if he would meet Pietersen to discuss his situation. ‘He hasn’t asked for a meeting,’ said Downton. Then, after a pause: ‘I don’t know what to say to that. It’s not at the forefront of the selectors’ minds — nothing has changed with regards to Kevin in the last year.’ Yet until England start winning regularly the Pietersen question will go on being asked of Downton, not to mention those questions over the ability of Moores to finally prove he belongs with England. l England have injury concerns over Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali ahead of their dead-rubber final World Cup match against Afghanistan on Friday. THE HISTORY: Afghanistan played their first ODI in 2009 but their record is not as bad as you might expect. They have won 25 of their 50 ODIs, but most of those came against the likes of Scotland, Holland and Canada. THE FORM: Not good. But then neither is England’s. Afghanistan have lost four of their five World Cup matches. They won the other by one wicket with three balls to go against Scotland. THE PLAYERS: Samiullah Shenwari could cause some damage. He has scored 247 runs this tournament at an average of 49.40. That’s more runs and a better average than any England batsman has managed. With the ball, left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran (right) has been the pick of the bunch, taking 10 wickets at an average of 24. HEAD TO HEAD: England have never played Afghanistan in a one-day game, but they did meet at the ICC World Twenty20 in 2012 in Colombo. An England side featuring Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler hit 196 before skittling Afghanistan for 80.","England were embarrassingly dumped out of the World Cup on Monday .

"2,000-year-old  artefacts looted from ancient sites in Iraq and Syria by ISIS are being sold on eBay as jihadis cash in on relics dating back millennia. Jewellery, ceramics and coins plundered from museums within ISIS territory are known to pass between criminal gangs before turning up in Gulf States and later appearing on trading websites. Two coins from Apamea, in western Syria, which date back to Ancient Greece have appeared on eBay with price tags of £57 and £90. Scroll down for video . Selling on eBay: Historical artefacts believed to have been looted by ISIS, such as this coin of Apamea dating back to the time of Ancient Greece, are beginning to appear on eBay . This comes after entire Roman mosaics were ripped up by a bulldozer from the ancient site. The trade in antiquities is a profitable business for the terror group and is thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds, The Times reports. As well as looting ancient artefacts, ISIS is known to levy a 'tax on valuable and historical items found in its territory to ensure the group's central administration benefits financially from raids on museums. The number of artefacts flowing from the war zone is so great that their market price has actually fallen. Spoils of war: Small coins such as these are easy to smuggle across borders to criminal gangs in neighbouring countries. Above, the artefact is advertised on eBay . It is believed that ISIS takes orders from dealers in neighbouring countries, with small items such as coins easy to smuggle across borders due to the number of people being displaced. Using smuggling routes and links to criminal gangs in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the ancient treasures can be packed in with cargoes of oil, drugs and weapons as they move across borders. eBay insist that they pay attention to the authorities. A spokesman for the company told The Times: 'We remove items from sale based on their advice, support law enforcement investigations and are always prepared to investigate listings causing concern.' Axel Plathe, director of Unesco's Iraq office, told The Times: 'We are seeing a more systematic approach to looting under ISIS, linked to generating revenue. Also selling: Another Greek coin advertised as 'Coin of Apamea 'Turreted Tyche & Nike' Era of Pompey Year 16 VF recently sold on eBay for the equivalent of £90 . This coin, which came from the ancient city of Apamea in western Syria, sold for $135 on eBay - the equivalent of around £91 . 'Excavations at the sites have increased and we believe trafficking is on the rise but without access to the sites we still don't know the true scale.' It is thought that increased pressure from the Iraqi army is encouraging jihadis to loot anything of value in the territory while they can. They have also desecrated countless Assyrian treasures treasures at Mosul, Nimrud and Dur-Sharrukin. In Nimrud, northern Iraq, militants even smashed up 3,000 year-old winged statues that are placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. Erasing history: Two weeks ago ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage . Desecration: An ISIS fanatic uses a power tool to destroy a winged-bull Assyrian protective deity at a museum in Mosul two weeks ago . The attack came just days after extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage. A statement last week from Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities didn't elaborate on the extent of the damage. However, they added that ISIS 'continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity.' The ancient city of Nimrud was the second capital of Assyria, an ancient kingdom that began in 900BC, partially in present day Iraq, and became a great regional power. The city, which was destroyed in 612 BC, is located on the Tigris River, just south of Mosul, which was captured by ISIS last June.","ISIS have raided countless historical heritage sites since rising to power .

"Stuart Lancaster might be inclined to spend the last two weeks of May hiding behind his sofa, hoping against hope that his World Cup plans are not wrecked by the business end of the club season. England’s head coach will name a preliminary training squad of around 45 players in the middle of that month, before the semi-finals of the Aviva Premiership. Clubs such as Northampton, Saracens and Bath — who provide large contingents to the national squad — are bound to be involved in those blood-and-thunder matches and there is a significant risk of untimely injuries as the league campaign reaches its anticipated explosive climax. Stuart Lancaster will name his 45-man preliminary World Cup squad before the Premiership semi-finals . Lancaster must then reduce his squad to 31 players by for the World Cup on August 31 . England will have a final World Cup warm up match against Ireland at Twickenham . A day after the Premiership final at Twickenham on May 30, an England XV made up of emerging rookies will face the Barbarians at HQ. The senior players will reconvene to begin their summer training camp in Surrey on June 22, and the two weeks from July 13 will be spent at altitude in Denver — Colorado’s ‘Mile-High City’. A week off upon their return from the States will be followed by a return to camp as England prepare for one experimental encounter with France at home, followed by a return fixture in Paris which they intend to treat as a more full-on Test. Lancaster must announce his final World Cup squad of 31 on August 31, before a final warm-up match, against Ireland at Twickenham. Explaining the schedule of events as the tournament countdown intensifies, Lancaster said: ‘The training camp will start on June 22 and the wider squad will be about 45. It will be announced mid-May, before the Barbarians game, which is the same weekend as the Premiership final. ‘The side to play the Barbarians will probably be made up of younger players. No-one in the squad will play in that, though one or two who have had injuries might come back into the equation. ‘From a selection point of view, we will use the first warm-up match to look at wider options. As you narrow down to the second game, the World Cup squad and the Ireland game, they will be proper games then.’ However, England will not wait for their encounters with France and Ireland to assess their players’ credentials in match conditions. The plan is to host in-house matches of their own. Lancaster explained: ‘We’ll spend a lot of time with proper 15-on-15 games internally anyway. ‘We’ll make sure the players are put under that sort of Test-match pressure. England will also play France twice in the build up to the 2015 World Cup . Courtney Lawes was cited for his challenge on Jules Bisson but no further action will be taken . Lancaster's side beat France 55-35 in the Six Nations on Saturday but did not secure the title . ‘We have two high-quality teams now and you can replicate the intensity on training alone. They will vary in intensity as we go through June and July. ‘When we go to Denver, we were thinking of bringing in opposition, but actually we’re probably better off having a bash against each other.’ One man who certainly ‘had a bash’ against France on Saturday was Courtney Lawes. The Northampton lock was reportedly cited by the visitors after his monster hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson, but the match commissioner has seen no need to take the matter any further.","Stuart Lancaster will name a 45-man England World Cup squad in mid-May .

"Romania fans complained the country had been made to look stupid after two men armed with  car sponges battled hopelessly to soak up water from a rain-drenched pitch ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against the Faroe Islands. Footage of the groundsmen desperately sponging the surface and squeezing minimal amounts of water into buckets ahead of Sunday's match caused a stir with fans taking to social media to label organisers a laughing stock.

"While Manchester United and Arsenal meet at Old Trafford on Monday, the match-winning hero of the 1979 FA Cup final between the clubs will be watching in solitude two thousand miles away in Malta. Former Gunners striker Alan Sunderland emigrated there 20 years ago after his life in England turned sour but he still follows Arsenal’s fortunes and returns two or three times a year as a guest of the club. ‘When Arsenal play a big game, I have to watch on my own, I’m nervous if I am around fans of the other teams,’ he said. Yet he showed no sign of nerves in 1979 when he slid in to win the Cup for Arsenal. Alan Sunderland celebrates scoring the winning goal for Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final at Wembley . Sunderland's 89th minute goal handed Arsenal a 3-2 victory over Manchester United at Wembley . Sunderland, 61, said: ‘The night before the final, an Arsenal fan at our hotel gave all the players a silver dollar as a lucky token — I’ve still got mine!’ But his luck ran out after he retired through injury at the age of 36 having played for Wolves, Arsenal and Ipswich. He went through a divorce, was given a driving ban that hindered coaching opportunities and drifted from jobs in insurance, pubs and letting. Then, despite having three children in England, he decided on a radical change. He had an apartment in Malta as a holiday home and 20 years ago decided to stay. He said: ‘It’s an easy life, the island is small and you’ve got the sea.’ Arsenal hero Sunderland pictured outside of the modern day Wembley stadium .

"A same-sex couple in Ohio were left flabbergasted when a local videographer refused to film their wedding citing religious reasons. Jenn Moffitt and her partner Jerra Kincely had sent an email to video production business Next Door Stories in Bexley, about filming their upcoming wedding. 'Unfortunately at this time I do not offer services for same-sex weddings,' replied owner Courtney Schmackers. Jenn Moffitt and Jerra Kincely contacts Next Door Stories in Bexley, Ohio, last month but owner Courtney Schackers replied that she doesn't do same-sex weddings for religious reasons . Courtney Schmackers has refused to comment publicly on the issue but posted her version of events on Facebook and said: 'I made a business decision based on my spiritual beliefs and the biblical definition of a marriage because I thought I had a right to that' 'I couldn't believe it,' Moffitt told CNN. 'It is a small business, and I thought this was a tight knit community. We wanted to support local commerce and to get that kind of response was astounding.' Schmackers has refused to comment publicly on the issue but posted her version of events on Facebook. 'I made a business decision based on my spiritual beliefs and the biblical definition of a marriage because I thought I had a right to that. Unfortunately I gave the wrong answer to the wrong person, who decided to make a private issue into a public platform,' she wrote. Angered by their treatment, the couple filed a complaint against the business with the Bexley Area Chamber of Commerce. In a statement, Bexley Mayor Ben Kessler said: 'Understandably, the community is concerned about a recent internet post regarding a query to a Bexley based business, in which the private business in question has reportedly denied a service based on sexual orientation. 'The City is concerned as well. We are proud of our community's welcoming environment and encourage mutual respect and inclusivity. Jerra Kincely shared both the reply from Schmackers and the videographer's explanation for refusing to film the couple's upcoming wedding . 'Bexley, Ohio is a community that embraces diversity and welcomes businesses, families and individuals of ALL sexual orientation, race, religion, age, nationality, ethnicity, disabilities, socio-economic levels, etc. As an employer and a provider of services to our residents, we extend that same openness and inclusivity.' The city is currently one of the municipalities in Ohio that doesn't prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Moffitt hopes the attention from officials will lead to legislation that protects Ohio's LGBT community. 'The outpouring from strangers has been absolutely amazing,' she said. Ohio is one of 13 states that currently does not allow same-sex marriage. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to make a decision on whether the state's same-sex marriage ban is constitutional come spring.","Jenn Moffitt and Jerra Kincely contacted Next Door Stories in Bexley, Ohio, last month .
