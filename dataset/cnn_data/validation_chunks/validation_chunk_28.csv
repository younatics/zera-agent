"A stag party in Las Vegas is usually the cue to go a little crazy. But the groom, my mate Justin Jacob, was adamant he didn't want 'crazy'. On this trip, we were determined to do things differently. After all, we are all older and wiser now… . Vegas wasn't the first choice among our party - we had originally planned to go to Thailand. There were going to be just five of us, so we thought we would head somewhere with some nightlife and a good spa so that we could relax too. The famous Las Vegas casinos are definitely worth a punt if you're feeling flush . But then the number who wanted to travel grew to ten, so Justin suddenly announced: 'We're going to Vegas. I don't care if it's been done before – we're going to go and do our best out there.' As Justin's best man, it was my job to organise the stag party - and I discovered what a nightmare that can be. First of all, it was impossible to get everyone to pay the money at the right time. And then those who had said they were coming suddenly decided that they couldn't make it, and people who had said 'no' then announced they were available. We planned a three-night trip. Going on past experience, I knew it would be intense - nobody gets much sleep because there is always something going on. You plan to go to bed, for example, and then you get sucked into going to a pool party. Las Vegas is home to many stag and hen parties - but the groom on Jeff's trip said he didn't want 'crazy' We stayed at The Cosmopolitan, one of the newer hotels in Vegas. It's vast - just walking from one end to the other takes about half an hour. It has great shops and 14 different restaurants, including STK, a steakhouse which also has branches in New York and LA. Like most of the hotels in Vegas, The Cosmopolitan is very skilfully laid out so that it doesn't matter where you are going to or coming from, at some point on your journey through the hotel you will find yourself passing the slot machines and the gaming tables. Nobody gets much sleep in Las Vegas because there is always something going on. You plan to go to bed, for example, and then you get sucked into going to a pool party . When you get to your room at the end of the day, you're unlikely to have any change in your pockets - it will all have been eaten by the 'slots'. I'm not really a gambler, so I think I probably came home with a little bit more in my pocket than the others. I had to be the sensible one, after all, because I saw it as my duty to look after the groom. You're there to make sure he's having a great time - within the limits, of course. As the best man, Jeff (left) was 'Mr Sensible' on the trip, and looked after the groom-to-be Justin Jacob (right) We didn't start off with a carefully drafted plan about how we spend our days in Vegas - instead, we decided that we would all meet up at certain points. We would all get together at dinner, for example, and then we would all head out to a club afterwards. It wasn't that difficult to arrange. We had three rooms between us, so it was usually just a case of picking up the phone and saying: 'Right, we're meeting in 15 minutes.' We looked at going on a Grand Canyon tour, but in the end we never really escaped the hotel scene – Vegas really sucked us in, chewed us up and spat us out! Half the time you're not sure whether it's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out . While we had planned to take it easy, in the end we partied like we did when we were in our 20s. The problem is that when you're down in the gaming rooms, there is no natural light, so you have no idea whether it's night or day. Half the time you're not sure whether it's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out. But we all agreed the trip was a huge success. We didn't get much sleep but we had plenty of fun. And on a stag trip, that's all you can ask for. Getting there . Virgin Holidays offers three nights in Las Vegas from £1,379 per person for departures in June. This includes return flights from Gatwick to Las Vegas and accommodation at The Cosmopolitan. Prices for the v-room at Gatwick costs from £24.50 per adult and £14 for children aged from two to 11.","Jeff and the groom-to-be hadn't planned to go 'crazy' on the stag do .

"Kaitlin Taylor went to the Syracuse University health center in hopes of getting treated for flu symptoms but instead was sent to a psychiatric ward . A New Jersey student with a bad cold was locked in a hospital psych ward for six days after going to her university's heath center for a medication to treat flu-like symptoms, she alleges in a lawsuit. Kaitlin Taylor, of Union County, New Jersey, went to the campus health center at Syracuse  - a school she's since left - when she was a sophomore in September 2013 complaining of flu-like symptoms. But the six-day stay in the nearby St Joseph's Hospital was not what she was expecting when she told the center's staff that she was suffering from a fever, cough, phlegm and chest congestion. While waiting for care, Taylor said she told a counselor that she wanted to change her arts major and take a leave of absence from the school but missed the semester's deadline because her computer was stolen. When she was told no one could write her a prescription at the center, she was driven to St Joseph's and dropped in front the the emergency room, according to the New York Post. While waiting in the ER, Taylor said she felt as though she was getting sicker. 'I was getting stressed by the circumstances and the surroundings,' she told the Post. 'I thought I'd only be there for an hour or two.' She was then taken to a psychiatrist's office, where she spent 15 minutes explaining that she was sick, had not been sleeping well, was struggling in her classes and feared she might lose her scholarship. Taylor was then told that she would  have to stay overnight and was sent to an 'observation room' with four other patients. The psychiatrist's notes said that Taylor was in for 'involuntary treatment,' for 'insomnia, pressured speech, disorganized, declining grades'. The patients in the room were separated by low walls while staff watched over them, Taylor said. She still didn't receive medication or treatment. She wanted to call her mom, but her cellphone had died and she said the hospital wouldn't recharge it. Taylor was sent to St Joseph's Hospital (pictured) where she was put into 'involuntary treatment' and observed for six days after she had only gone to the health center for medication for her flu-like symptoms . Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her. Her hospital horror started at her university's health center (pictured), where she went to get medication . 'They hadn't done anything for me or my cold. They didn't take my blood pressure or even my temperature,' she told the Post. A nurse told her that if she cooperated and took the medication they gave her, she would be out in a shorter time period. She said she was given Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Klonopin, used to treat panic disorder. Taylor told the post that they had to line up and take their pills, 'just like in the movie Cuckoo's Nest'. She was finally able to reach her mom, who came to the hospital to get her out of the ward. Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her, negligent and harmful use of medication and failure to get informed consent, among other reasons, the lawsuit states, according to the Daily Orange. Marc Held, Taylor's lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, said her treatment was 'unfathomable'. The lawsuit claims that the 'unlawful, negligent and otherwise improper confinement', caused Taylor to suffer 'personal indignities'. Taylor has since left Syracuse and transferred to Rutgers University. Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz, senior vice president and dean of student affairs, said in a statement to the Daily Orange that the university 'strongly support the medical professionals and staff in the center'. In November 2014 the university announced they were in the process of searching for a new psychiatric provider and since has hired additional staff. Syracuse's attorney Matthew Larkin, however, told the Post that the university 'denies that it acted inappropriately in any way'. A St Joseph's spokesman wouldn't comment due to patient privacy and pending litigation.","Kaitlin Taylor went to the Syracuse University health center as a sophomore in September 2013 .

"The family of a cable fitter who died after taking an accidental overdose of a drug he bought online to fight the pain caused by a work accident has been awarded a five-figure compensation deal. Father-of-one Daniel Batchelor, 36, was forced to have his lower right leg amputated after falling off a ladder while working as an engineer and breaking his limb in two places. He bought a drug online to help him deal with the pain, but was found unconscious in bed at his home in Weymouth, Dorset, in January last year after taking an accidental overdose of the medication. The family of Daniel Batchelor, pictured with son Alfie, has been awarded compensation after he died taking an accidental overdose of a drug he bought online to fight the pain caused by a work accident . Mr Batchelor had been working for Wifigear Ltd as a wireless installation engineer when, in 2011, his ladder collapsed underneath him, sending him plunging 12ft through the air, before hitting the concrete ground below. He broke his right leg in two places and fractured his right wrist in the fall. Despite multiple operations, he was unable to return to work and he went on to develop compartment syndrome in his leg - when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels, causing paralysis and infection. Struggling to deal with the pain, Mr Batchelor decided to buy a drug online because he was allergic to opiate-based medicines that are usually prescribed. But he was found unconscious in his bed by his long-term partner of five years, Shari Newman, on 22 January, 2014. The father-of-one was forced to have his lower right leg amputated after falling off a ladder  and breaking his limb in two places . He died after choking on his own vomit, which caused his brain to be starved of oxygen. An inquest found he had died as a result of an accidental overdose, taken with the intent to relieve himself from pain. The hearing at Dorset Coroner's Court also heard how he had suffered short-term memory problems after the accident and, as a result, took too much of the painkiller. Coroner Sheriff Payne said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Batchelor had taken the drugs with the intention of ending his life and said it was another episode of the father trying to get pain relief and misjudging the amount he was taking. His former employer has now admitted he had been given a ladder to carry out his work, despite it being inappropriate and dangerous for the task he was trying to do. And his family, including three-year-old son Alfie, has been awarded an undisclosed five-figure settlement. Anna Pask, from the Irwin Mitchell law firm, described it as 'a heartbreaking case'. She said: 'Daniel was working so hard to get his life back on track after his accident and he was looking forward to marrying his fiancee, Shari, in September 2014. 'His recovery and rehabilitation were very painful, but he showed remarkable courage and strength. 'We are pleased that Daniel's employers accepted liability for the accident and we have secured a settlement for Daniel's family which will provide Shari and Alfie with some financial security for the future. 'The last few years have been incredibly traumatic for the family and the conclusion of the legal case means they can now start to rebuild their lives. ' Ms Newman, 35, said: 'Our family are still desperately struggling to come to terms with what has happened to Daniel and the most heartbreaking thing is knowing Alfie will have to grow up without a father. Mr Batchelor's former employer has now admitted he had been given a ladder to carry out his work, despite it being inappropriate and dangerous for the task he was trying to do, and his family, including Alfie, has been awarded a five-figure payout . 'Daniel knew he was lucky to be alive after the fall. He wanted to be able to provide for me and Alfie and he was desperate to be able to return to work - even after his amputation, Daniel talked about training to become a postman. 'But Daniel struggled to manage his pain and it was very hard watching him suffer.' Ms Newman, who was engaged to marry Mr Batchelor, also called for a change in the law to prevent people from buying certain drugs over the Internet. She added: 'Daniel felt completely helpless and he thought the only way he could cope with the pain was to purchase his own medication. 'The drugs Daniel bought should not be available over the internet and more should be done to raise awareness of the huge risks that come with taking them. 'It is heartbreaking to think what we have been put through as a family, all as a result of an accident which was completely avoidable. 'Companies have a duty to provide appropriate work equipment and if Daniel's employers had done this, he would still be here today. 'I am relieved that the legal process has come to a conclusion and I can now try and focus on mine and Alfie's future.'","Daniel Batchelor, 36, bought painkiller after falling from ladder at work .

"Coalition ministers are at war over Tory plans to ban hate preachers from English universities. David Cameron wants a total campus ban on extremists whose twisted views risk radicalising impressionable youngsters. Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable says only those who directly incite violence and terrorism should be prevented from exercising free speech. The row follows the unmasking of Islamic State murderer Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi who is believed to have been radicalised while studying at Westminster University. Home Secretary Theresa May wants tougher rules on campuses but Business Secretary Vince Cable warns it could force debates 'underground', where extreme views will go unchallenged . Security experts believe the freedom of extremists to operate at college campuses is a significant factor in the radicalisation of some young people. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday said Mr Cable, who has responsibility for universities, was wrong to resist the move. ‘Vince Cable doesn’t want to do what the Conservatives want to do, which is to make sure that on campus we do not have radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people,’ he told Sky News. ‘We have to put proper, decent, tough rules in place which don’t ban free speech, but do prevent people from preaching death.’ Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey said it was ‘easy to demolish’ the views of hate preachers if they were debated in public and warned that driving them underground would only increase their appeal. ‘If these preachers are inciting violence, if they are saying it is OK to be a terrorist, if they are saying you can cut off people’s heads, they can and should be arrested,’ he said. 'Jihadi john' killer Mohammed Emwazi graduated from the University of Westminster (pictured) in 2009 with a degree in computing. The university has been described as a 'hotbed' for radicalism in the past but denies inciting extremism in any form . ‘What the Conservatives seem to be wanting to do is to introduce, against British values of free speech, a new type of rule that says that the state will know what “extremism” is. The phrase “extremism” they are talking about is nebulous, it is unclear, and there is a danger the Conservatives will clamp down on free speech and that will be giving in to the terrorists.’ The clash centres on new guidance for universities on the hosting of events that give a platform to hate preachers. Under the Prime Minister’s plans, universities would have a duty to take a ‘precautionary approach’ to events featuring extremists. Vice-chancellors would be expected to cancel any event where there was a ‘risk that the content will potentially draw people into terrorism’. Home Secretary Theresa May said ministers were ‘not talking about regulating legitimate debate – we’re saying they [universities] need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus’. The row means no action is likely before the election.","Home Secretary Theresa May wants tougher rules on campus speakers .

"The Federal Drug Administration has revealed a readily-available weight loss supplement that can be obtained without a prescription contains Prozac. OxyELITE Pro Super Thermogenic, which is manufactured by USPlabs, contains the prescription drug, according to a letter released yesterday by the FDA. The government agency is advising consumers not to purchase or use the product. Scroll down for video . The FDA revealed OxyELITE Pro Super Thermogenic, which is manufactured by USPlabs, contains Prozac . An FDA laboratory analysis confirmed OxyELITE contains fluoxetine, also known under the brand name Prozac. The FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use the product (right) after finding it contains Prozac (left) A laboratory analysis performed by the FDA confirmed OxyELITE contains fluoxetine, also known under the brand name Prozac. Fuoxetine is in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They are used for treating depression, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphonic disorder. SSIRs are approved by the FDA. According to the agency: 'Uses of SSRIs have been associated with serious side effects including suicidal thinking, abnormal bleeding, and seizures. 'In patients on other medications for common conditions ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death can occur.' The average price for a bottle of the supplement is $35.99, according to its website. Benefits of the product include sustained weight loss, suppressed appetite, sharper mental focus and a 'strong yet smooth' boost in energy. Fuoxetine is in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the FDA (file photo) The FDA has had issues with USPlabs in the past. In 2013, the company was linked 'to dozens of cases of acute liver failure and hepatitis, including one death and illnesses so severe that several patients required liver transplants'. After the FDA, Centers for Disease Control Prevention and other agencies were able to link the health problems with use of an OxyElite Pro supplement, USPlabs eventually recalled the product. Warehouse supplies of the supplement with a retail value of about $22million were destroyed. Earlier that year, another version of OxyElite Pro was destroyed after it was found to contain DMAA, or dimethylamylamine, according to the FDA. The director of the FDA's Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, Daniel Fabricant, said: 'Twice in a short period, this company has added new dietary ingredients to supplements without notifying the FDA and providing a reasonable expectation of safety, as required by law. 'Losses to the company should also serve as a reminder that FDA's laws and regulations serve a purpose and must be followed.' The FDA said it is 'unable to test and identify all products marketed as dietary supplements that have potentially harmful hidden ingredients.' USPlabs claims the supplement which was tested by the FDA was a counterfeit. After the FDA's report, the company 'immediately conducted an investigation and determined that the product shown in the Public Notification and tested by FDA was not manufactured or distributed by or for the Company. 'It is a counterfeit. 'Neither USPlabs nor its contract manufacturers has ever ordered or in any way handled fluoxetine for any purpose of any kind. 'The Company has encountered counterfeit versions of its dietary supplement products in the past, and has reported these problems to FDA as well as to State and other Federal officials. 'USPlabs has offered to work with the FDA to help prevent the distribution of counterfeit versions of its dietary supplement products.'","OxyELITE Pro Super Thermogenic is available without a prescription .

"A teenager has been told she will not be allowed to compete to become Miss England because she is a single mother. Dhakirah Salim decided to enter local auditions for the competition in Birmingham only to be told this would not be possible because in the small print it says mothers and married women cannot enter. The 19-year-old had gone to support her Latifah, 22, who was entering the contest but then decided she would also put herself forward. Dhakirah Salim, 19, was told she could not compete for a place in the Miss England competition in the local heats in Birmingham because the rules of the contest ban mothers and married women from taking part . However the mother-of-one was disappointed when her older sister got to the next round round and she did not. She was told this was because she has a daughter Sapphire, three, and there are rules banning mothers taking part. 'This rule sends out the message that there's no beauty in women after birth and that young mums can't be good role models,' said Miss Salim. 'I think that's discrimination towards women with babies.' The Miss England beauty pageant claims the rule is in place to protect young families because the busy schedule for contest winners is not compatible with having a settled home life. But critics say it is a choice for each individual candidate to make on whether they feel they have enough time to commit to the role and have blasted the regulations as 'old fashioned and discriminatory.' Dhakirah Salim (right) accompanied her older sister Latifah to the contest and decided to enter herself . Dhakirah is currently studying business administration with the intention of running her own entertainment business. She also works part time. 'I'm attending college, I do extra-curricular courses and I do a part-time job that I travel around Birmingham and the UK for,' she added. 'I don't think it's fair that because I have a baby I shouldn't be able to enter the Miss Birmingham contest. 'I do get a lot of negativity about young mothers, and especially the perception of single mothers, but I hope to prove everyone wrong. 'If Sapphire wasn't here right now, I think I would be a different person. 'She makes me feel more positive and gives me the confidence to go out and do things. 'It's a new day and age, but the organisers of the competition don't seem to recognise that. 'They're trying to say women with children can only be housewives. Women should be able to go out there, seize opportunities and create a better life. 'That's the example I want to set my daughter. 'Latifah and I are still very close and if she wins I will be happy for her. We do argue but just about silly things. This hasn't caused any arguments.' Her older sister Latifah works at Tesco and juggles life as a full-time university student and part-time carer for her mother. She failed her first year while she was getting trained to use dialysis machines. The sisters, who have five other siblings, were among 637 applicants for the Miss Birmingham crown and 80 were selected for interviews at the Burlington Hotel in the city centre in January. Angie Beasley, Director of Miss England, said the controversial rule was in place to protect the 'family unit' because of the winner's demanding schedule. The sisters both competed in the regional heats for Miss England in Birmingham but Latifah Salim (left) got in to the next round of the competition while Dhakirah, 19, was rejected because she is a mother . Miss Salim is currently studying business administration and hopes to run her own entertainment business . Miss Salim said she believes the rules banning mothers competing are old fashioned and should be changed . She said: 'I don't think it's old-fashioned. It's to protect families. 'We don't want to be responsible for splitting a mother up from her children.' Ms Beasley, who is a mother, added: 'There are other competitions that are less demanding, where ladies who have children should enter. 'I couldn't enter a baby contest because I'm not a baby. I don't fit into those rules. People have challenged this rule before but we are not changing it.' The rule has led to criticism from previous winners. Last year Kris’ina Jagpal, who wore the coveted sash in 2012, urged organisers to ditch the rules banning mothers and married women.","Dhakirah Salim, 19, decided to enter a Miss England contest with her sister .

"America's Next Top Model host and mentor Tyra Banks said she was 'deeply saddened' about the death of one of her former contestants last week, but plenty of others have had similarly tragic fates after the cameras stopped rolling. From rehab to felonies, several contestants fell into lives of crime after being dismissed from the show. While some picked themselves back up, others weren't as lucky. Cycle 21 contestant Mirjana Puhar, 19, was shot dead last week after she opened the door to two robbers who also killed  two men inside the house. Scroll down for video . Mirjana Puhar was an America's Next Top Model contestant during Cycle 21. She was shot dead last week as she opened up her door to two robbers who went on to shoot two men in her house in a triple homicide . Mirjana's boyfriend, Jonathan Alvarado, 23, and his roommate, Jusmar Gonzaga-Garcia, 21, were also killed in the shooting. It is believed that the homicide was 'drug related' Her boyfriend, Jonathan Alvarado, 23, and his roommate, Jusmar Gonzaga-Garcia, 21, were the other two victims of the triple homicide. Police arrested and charged Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, with three counts of first-degree murder. Authorities recovered seven rounds of 9mm ammunition, two knives, drugs, a safety deposit box and several cell phones which has led police to believe the house may have been a drug den. The police report, seen by Daily Mail Online, shows they also found a marijuana-like substance. Detectives confirmed the triple homicide was 'drug related' and are looking into the backgrounds of the two male victims. Renee Alway, pictured in 2007 on left and 2013 on right, was a finalist on the show's eighth cycle. She was arrested in 2013 after a spree of robberies . Alway, pictured in 2013, was sentenced in December for 12 years in prison. She had given up custody of her three kids before she was arrested . Cycle eight finalist Renee Alway - known as Renee DeWitt on the show - was arrested in Palm Springs, California, in June 2013 after a six-hour standoff with the police and SWAT team following a robbery spree, according to AOL. Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said. Alway, who was 20 when she was on the show, reached the final three contestants before taking part in Tyra Banks' show 'Modelville' and appearing in ads and magazines. But in the months afterwards, she found 'closed door, after closed door, after closed door, and it was just really hard to take', she said in an interview. After the 2013 incident, she was as sentenced to 12 years in prison for four felony burglary counts and one count each of vehicle theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm. She was also ordered to pay $58,679.58 in damages to her victims. Alway, now 28, gave up custody of her three children before the arrest. Angelea Preston, pictured in 2010 on left and 2013 on right,  was a contest on Cycle 14 of the show. She later returned for the All Star season, and made it to the finale. She was kicked off before the winner was announced, however, after producers found out she worked as a paid escort prior to filming the season . Cycle 14 contestant Angelea Preston returned for an all-stars season for the show in Cycle 17, but was kicked off after making the final three. Show producers revealed that she had been working as a paid escort prior to filming the 17th season. In December, however, it was Preston announced she was suing Tyra Banks for $3million, claiming she was improperly denied a top prize. City News Service says Preston filed the breach-of-contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. Preston said she should have won and that she was wrongly disqualified because she had worked as an escort before taking part in the show. Jael Strauss, pictured in 2007 on left and 2012 on right, was a contestant on the eighth season alongside Renee Alway. After the show she spent six years homeless and struggling with drug addictions to methamphetamine and cocaine . In an attempt to help her get her life back together, Dr Phil convinced Strauss to enter a rehab facility in 2012 . Now Strauss, pictured here in 2014, works at a rehab facility in Texas, according to her Facebook . Another cycle eight contestant, Jael Strauss, spent six years after appearing on the show desperate and homeless struggling with a drug addiction. In 2012 she agreed to go to rehab. Then 28, she was battling a life-threatening addiction to methamphetamine, an addiction to cocaine and painkiller abuse. She was stripping to make money. Close to losing her battle with addiction, Dr Phil staged an intervention with Strauss in what was a last-ditch effort to help the once aspiring model save her own life. After 'the full blown meth addict' initially resisted all help, running off the stage and out onto the Paramount lot in tears, Dr Phil finally convinced her to seek the treatment she needed. Now, according to Strauss's Facebook page, she's working at a rehab facility in Texas. Lisa D'Amato, pictured in 2005 on left and 2013 on right, entered Dr Drew's Celebrity Rehab in 2010. She later went on to get married and have a baby boy . D'Amato won the All Stars season of America's Next Top Model in 2011 and is now focusing on a career in music and performing . Cycle five contested Lisa D'Amato also spent time in rehab. She checked into the third season of Dr Drew's rehab reality show in 2010 for alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and mushroom addictions. Dr Drew called D'Amato an 'addict in denial', but she has since cleaned up her act. She declined sober living after treatment, but agreed to meetings and won America's Next Top Model All Stars season, cycle 17 in 2011. She got married and had a baby boy in September 2013, who the couple named Daxel Vaughn. D'Amato is now focusing on a career in music and performing, according to her Facebook.","Former contestant Mirjana Puhar was killed in a triple homicide last week .

"Human rights lawyers smeared British soldiers with false accusations of the torture and murder or innocent Iraqis, a government dossier claims. A report drawn up on the Prime Minister's orders claims Public Interest Lawyers (PIL) pursued claims against soldiers despite realising the allegations of abuse might have been 'untrue'. It comes after a public inquiry spent £31million exonerating British soldiers of claims they went they went on a killing and torture spree following a fierce battle in southern Iraq in 2004. Scroll down for video . 'False claims': The government may take legal action against Public Interest Lawyers and its chief lawyer, Phil Shiner, left, over allegations the firm smeared British soldiers with false allegations of torture and murder. Right is a picture of the aftermath of the Battle of Danny Boy shown to the five-year Al-Sweady inquiry . After five years of investigations, the Al-Sweady inquiry in December concluded there were some breaches of the Geneva convention following the battle. But it also ruled allegations of murder and torture were based on 'deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility'. Now the government is gearing up to sue law firms for millions of pounds in legal costs and calling for the PIL's chief lawyer, Phil Shiner, to be struck off. The MoD's dossier, seen by at least two Sunday newspapers, accuses PIL and another law firm, Leigh Day, of continuing to pursue the case even after evidence emerged that the allegations may be untrue. It suggests PIL had doubts about the credibility of its clients' evidence as early as March 2013 but failed to withdraw the allegations for another 12 months, Tim Ross of the Sunday Telegraph reported. That led investigators to take evidence from around 100 further witnesses, costing taxpayers an extra £780,000, the paper reported the Government's dossier as saying. It is also alleged that PIL used a local 'agent' to trawl Basra for potential victims, a breach of a ban on solicitors touting for business that brought hundreds of extra claims against the Army. The Birmingham-based law firm even continued to represent one claimant in a separate judicial review after he admitted to Al-Sweady investigators he had lied about his sister dying on the battlefield, the dossier alleges. Leigh Day are accused of failing to disclose a key document for six years, according to the Sun on Sunday. Thorough investigation: British soldiers with an Iraqi detainee following the Battle of Danny Boy in May 2004. Claims troops rounded up civilians for a killing and torture spree following the battle were dismissed . The claims came after the Battle of Danny Boy on May 14 2004, a fierce firefight which erupted when insurgents from the Mahdi Army ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Their reinforcements, the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, were also ambushed and after three hours of fighting 28 Iraqi fighters had been killed. Claims which subsequently emerged that enraged British soldiers had tortured and executed innocent local people in the aftermath of the battle were dismissed by the Al-Sweady inquiry, which was named for an alleged teenage victim. Former 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment corporal Brian Wood has previously told the Daily Mail he felt he and his colleagues who fought in thad 'done the right thing'. Mr Wood, 34, who was awarded the Military Cross for his role in the battle, according to the paper, said: 'We have been dragged through five years of hell. That in my view is a betrayal of our service. 'We did what we had to do as soldiers and we did the right thing.' Ann Hoolin, 50, the mother of soldier Scott Hoolin, told the paper her son was 'upset and disturbed' following the inquiry. 'To be accused of wrongdoing in the aftermath of what happened is disgraceful,' she said. Battlegroud: The Danny Boy checkpoint, near where insurgents from the Mahdi Army ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, then their reinforcements, leading to a fierce firefight . Sir Thayne Forbes, the retired judge who led the Al-Sweady inquiry, did find that there had been instances of ill-treatment during 'tactical questioning' of the detainees at Camp Abu Naji, near Majar-al-Kabir in southern Iraq, on the night of May 14/15. These included depriving the prisoners of sight, food and sleep, and using threatening interrogation techniques contrary to the Geneva Convention. It amounted to ill-treatment and fell below the high standard to be expected of the British Army, Sir Thayne said. After Sir Thayne's report, Public Interest Lawyers insisted the inquiry had been 'legally necessary, morally justified and politically required'. Responding to a request for comment on the allegations against PIL and Leigh Day, an MoD spokesman told MailOnline: 'The MoD is assisting the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which is investigating issues that came to light as a result of the Al-Sweady Inquiry.' PIL said last night in a statement seen by the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Al-Sweady inquiry thoroughly investigated the subject of these matters during which no criticisms were made of Public Interest Lawyers or Phil Shiner by the chair.' 'It is not appropriate to comment any further while SRA proceedings are ongoing. 'PIL and Mr Shiner are confident that they have acted in accordance with their professional obligations.'","Al-Sweady inquiry spent £31million probing the claims against soldiers .

"A shameless shoplifter says she has made almost £2million from a 44-year crime spree while enjoying designer clothes, plastic surgery and exotic holidays. But despite her illegal earnings which have seen her jailed seven times, Kim Farry, 54, still reportedly lives in a rent-free council house in south west London, and takes home £556 in benefits every month. In an interview, the mother-of-six described shoplifting as her 'job' and says at her peak she was taking home almost £50,000 a year through stealing, but  she is now going straight for the sake of her youngest daughter, 14-year-old Paris. Scroll down for video . Shameless shoplifter Kim Farry, 54, pictured with stolen items including a £500 pair of YSL shoes, says she has made almost £2million from a 44-year crime spree while enjoying designer clothes and exotic holidays . Ms Farry says she has not stolen anything for two months, but is refusing to surrender her luxury lifestyle - and adds that as her benefits are not enough to live on she may be forced to return to a life of crime. 'I will try but I'm going from ­riches to rags. Why would I give up living like an A-lister for this? This is the longest I've been without shoplifting since I was a child and it's unbelievably hard,' she told the Sunday People's Vikki White and Gemma Aldridge. Ms Farry says she first stole aged just nine, when she saw her single mother struggle to bring her up, as well as her eight siblings. After she went unchallenged as she took a haul of groceries from a supermarket, she says she began stealing food and toys on a weekly basis. Ms Farry says she has not stolen anything for two months, but is refusing to surrender her luxury lifestyle - and says as her benefits are not enough to live on she may be forced to return to a life of crime . The mother-of-six described shoplifting as her 'job' and says at her peak she was taking home almost £50,000 a year through stealing, but she is now going straight for the sake of her youngest daughter, 14-year-old Paris . She was arrested aged ten for stealing a badge, but no action was taken against her, the People reports. At 14 she was expelled from school and despite two youth detention sentences she decided at 16 to make shoplifting her full-time job - disguising her self with wigs or make-up to avoid being caught. 'I used to nick a load of stuff then go and have a cuppa with the security guards, that's how good I was. When I had been doing it for a few years I realised it was more about attitude than anything else. I could steal anything,' she said. On one occasion she says she even managed to steal a cooker with the help of an accomplice and a van, but reportedly made much of her money by stealing from designer clothing shops and having other women return the items for vouchers or credit notes. She then sold these on for half the price, but would also make money by shoplifting to order. After she married in her 20s and started a family of her own, Ms Farry even trained up her three eldest children to help her once they turned 12, she told the newspaper. She says she was stealing items worth as much as £7,000 a month, taking home nearly £50,000 a year after paying her accomplices. Ms Farry says she was unable to find work once she had a criminal record, and currently receives £120 every two weeks in disability living allowance for stress, £20 a week for child benefit and £58 in child tax credits . But although Ms Farry said she turned to crime to support her family, it also caused the break-down of her marriage and when she was sentenced to one of her jail terms her three eldest children were sent to live with her father. According to the People, Ms Farry has more than 50 shoplifting charges to her name, but she says this accounts for only around one per cent of her exploits. She was last jailed when Paris was six weeks old, but told the newspaper that on the day she was released from the six-week sentence she went on a stealing spree. She says she is now hoping to change her ways for Paris, but does not want to give up the perks of her lifestyle, which has seen her undergo three breast augmentations as well as enjoying luxury holidays, designer outfits, regular beauty treatments and meals out. Ms Farry says she was unable to find work once she had a criminal record, and currently receives £120 every two weeks in disability living allowance for stress, £20 a week for child benefit and £58 in child tax credits. She says she does want to find legal employment, but adds that if she is unable to get a job she may resort to stealing - and says the Government should give out more in handouts to prevent others from turning to crime. She said: 'There's no way I can maintain my lifestyle or anything close to it. The Government is living in denial if it thinks people are going to live on benefits and not do everything they can to top it up, illegal or not.' MailOnline has contacted the Metropolitan Police for comment.","Kim Farry, 54, started stealing to help her family when she was just nine .

"A student is fundraising for children with cancer after he defied medical odds by beating a brain tumour three times. Chandos Green, a student at Chichester University, West Sussex, must still have annual MRI scans after he endured three risky surgeries merely to survive to the age of 19. And now, just months after his last operation, he is already training for the 2015 London Marathon in the hope he can raise thousands for the charity Children With Cancer UK. Survivor: Chandos Green, 19, who has battled a life-threatening tumour three times. Right shows the scar on his head from his most-recent operation to remove the tumour at Southampton General Hospital . Fighter: Despite surviving his last brush with death less than a year ago, Chichester University student Mr Green is now training to run the London Marathon this year to raise money for a cancer charity . Speaking of his latest brush with death - only averted when surgeons removed a golf ball-sized tumour - Mr Green said: 'I remember asking the surgeon if I was going to die and I broke down when I was going under the anaesthetic. 'Luckily I was fine and managed to beat the tumour once again. But the operation made me realise that life can be short.' Mr Green, from Bournemouth, Dorset, appeared to be a healthy toddler until, at the age of three, he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over unexpectedly. After his worried mother took him to see their family doctor, her son was referred to Poole hospital where specialists diagnosed a brain tumour. Brain surgeons at Southampton General Hospital were able to remove most of the tumour, but were unable to take out parts that were close to Mr Green's motor neurons - the essential circuits that connect the brain to the muscles. Mr Green remembered: 'When they discovered the tumour I was still really young but I remember being in the hospital and being confused by it all. 'I recovered quickly from the operation and managed to start school but that's when the problems started. 'Initially people didn't say anything about my scars but then people kept coming up to me and asking what happened to my head. 'They began to notice the tumour had given me a limp and I had lost movement in my left wrist.' Fighting for his life: A picture of Mr Green aged three recovering from the first of his operations to remove the tumour in his brain. It was diagnosed after he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over . Tests: Mr Green aged five. Despite the success of Mr Green's first operation, his symptoms soon returned and he was forced to undergo a second operation at the age of six to again remove his brain tumour . Recovery: Mr Green aged six, following his second operation. He remained cancer free for the next 13 years until he enrolled at Chichester University, when the familiar symptoms began to reappear . With the same symptoms reappearing just a couple of years after his first fight with the tumour, a new MRI scan showed Mr Green's tumour had regrown. Aged just six, he was once again forced to go under the surgeon's knife for a risky operation to remove the growth and save his life. Again he recovered and returned to school. But this time he fell victim to cruel classroom bullies who dubbed him 'tumour boy'. Despite the taunts, Mr Green rebuilt his life, enjoying a normal adolescence and completing his GCSEs and A-levels. But when he enrolled at Chichester to begin his degree, all-too-familiar symptoms began to return. 'I started studying social work and the beginning of it was great until I started to get headaches. 'One day when I woke up early to go on a trip and I fainted in my room and woke up three hours later. 'It was then that I realised that something wasn't right and I went to the hospital to get some checks done.' Just a day after his 19th birthday, Chandos received the devastating news he would have to battle the life-threatening disease for a third time. 'I was now old enough to fully understand what was going on and I was so scared going into the operation,' he said. Steve Clifford, a Professor of Molecular Paediatric Oncology at Newcastle University, said: 'It is possible that some brain tumours may return some time after they were first treated. 'However it is rare for a brain tumour return three times, especially when the individual's lay dormant for 12 years.'","Chandos Green survived brain surgery at three, six and 19 years old .

"Hundreds of people were targeted by the scam with fraudsters posing as TalkTalk employees on the phone (file image) A major security breach has left thousands of TalkTalk customers at the mercy of fraudsters. Criminals have stolen account numbers, addresses and phone numbers from the phone and broadband firm’s computers. The details have been used in attempts to scam hundreds of customers so far, with one man having £2,800 stolen from his bank account. Masquerading as TalkTalk staff, the fraudsters phone their victims and try to make them disclose their bank details. It is not known how many of these customers were successfully tricked and had money stolen from them. The company, which has four million customers in all, has now sent an email to every one to warn them of the ruse. One of the techniques used by the fraudsters is to offer their victims a credit in return for their bank details. The customer then finds that their account has been emptied. The fraudulent callers are convincing because they have the customer’s details to hand. TalkTalk claims only a few thousand account details have gone astray. The data theft came to light when the company investigated a sudden rise in complaints about scam calls between October and December. TalkTalk insisted it had not been hacked and that the leak came instead from a third party contractor which had legitimate access to customer accounts. Customers have taken to the company’s internet forum to air their grievances. One, who received a call from a suspected scammer, said a more prominent warning about the hacking incident should have been given earlier and ‘not hidden away at the bottom of a lengthy marketing email’. ‘Hacking is a worldwide problem – it happens and you have to let us know immediately, not hide it away,’ he wrote. ‘My 85-year-old mother who is a TT customer could well have been taken in when the guy quoted all the correct info.’ Another angry customer wrote: ‘After months and months of being lied to by TalkTalk you are now finally admitting that you have had a security breach and that our details were accessed from your database.’ He said several members of staff had denied there was a problem, adding: ‘You should be ashamed of yourselves as it is your customers who have suffered and in some cases like my own, have suffered financially.’ Another wrote on the forum: ‘This internet provider must have the worst security and data protection for its customers in the business.’ The company says it was not hacked but that the details were stolen by a third party. It investigated following a new wave of complaints last year . A further disgruntled customer accused TalkTalk of conducting a damage limitation exercise: ‘It’s only taken them months to decide to come out and let customers know, or should I say forced to come out and let them know, as they had no option as word spread.’ Others highlighted problems of dealing with call centres in India. In a statement, TalkTalk said: ‘We have become aware that some limited, non-sensitive information about some customers could have been illegally accessed in violation of our security procedures. ‘We are aware of a small, but nonetheless significant, number of customers who have been directly targeted by these criminals and we have been supporting them directly.’ The firm said the problem had also been reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Graeme Smith had £2,800 stolen from him but claim neither his bank nor TalkTalk will reimburse him . Graeme Smith told yesterday how his bank and TalkTalk have refused to refund him £2,815 stolen from his current account. The 61-year-old HR expert was fooled by ‘extremely slick and believable’ fraudsters who claimed to be from a TalkTalk fraud department probing computer hacking. He was kept on the phone for hours by the team of three criminals and tricked into allowing them access to his computer to remove a bug supposedly left by a hacker. They told him he would receive a £250 credit for his trouble. When he later checked his account at a cash machine the £2,815 had gone. ‘I feel like a fool – I’m not naive, but they completely took me in,’ said Mr Smith, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham. ‘I’m extremely fed up and frustrated with TalkTalk and will be leaving them in future. 'They have not provided me with any support at all and I’ve been forced to wait for days for anyone to contact me.","Thieves stole addresses and phone and account numbers from company .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been thrown a lifeline by Australian voters just as his internal opponents appeared ready to dump him, with the latest opinion poll confirming a pro-government shift is under way. The Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday puts the coalition almost neck-and-neck with Labor in two-party terms at 49-51. That's the best result since October and a big improvement on the 54-46 split recorded in January. Scroll down for video . As speculation about Tony Abbott's leadership rumbles on, a Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday puts the coalition almost neck-and-neck with Labor in two-party terms at 49-51 . Labor's primary vote dropped four points to sit at 36 per cent, while the Coalition gained four points to hit 42 per cent, according to the poll of 1,406 voters. The results confirm a surge in government support suggested last week by Newspoll, which found primary support for the government rising three points. Yet Mr Abbott continues to lag behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull as preferred leader of the Liberal Party, with the latter scoring highter in all of 10 leadership attributes voters were surveyed about. Just one fifth of those polled believe Mr Abbott enjoys the confidence of his party. Half think Mr Turnbull does. Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten remains the preferred prime minister compared to Mr Abbott, but his margin has been slashed from 16 points to five since the previous poll to sit at 44-39. On sunday, Mr Abbott laughed off the latest round of leadership talk as recycled rubbish, saying the matter was settled by the failure of a spill motion in the Liberals' party room three weeks ago. The latest opinion poll is the best result for the Liberal party since October and a big improvement on the 54-46 split recorded in January .

'This is Clean Up Australia Day, and I'm just not going to do anything but recycle the rubbish,' he joked. 'And that's what's happening, we're just recycling rubbish today.' A party room spill motion three weeks ago was defeated 61-39, and the coalition was getting on with governing, Mr Abbott said.

"A woman who had her phone stolen will be reunited with it after the selfie of the man who handed it into police that appeared on her Facebook wall went viral. Nicola Shelton, 33, was partying with friends at Lala Land in Byron Bay, on the New South Wales' north coast, on Valentine's Day when her bag was stolen with her phone, wallet and cards inside. She thought she would never see her iPhone again, but then on Wednesday someone posted a selfie of themselves at Byron Bay on her Facebook wall. Nicola Shelton got a shock when a man taking a selfie appeared on her Facebook wall without her knowledge . Earlier in February her phone had been stolen in Byron Bay and she started sharing the selfie to get her phone back . Ms Shelton's boyfriend alerted the Melbourne woman to the post while she at work. 'It was an awful feeling [seeing the photo]. My boyfriend asked ""why are you posting photos of these boys on your Facebook page?""' she told Daily Mail Australia. The photo shows a picture of man smiling at the camera while another climbs over rocks at the beach in the background. At first, Ms Shelton thought the man in the picture was the one who stole her phone and re-posted the photo in an attempt to get her phone back. Almost two weeks later, the selfie appeared on her Facebook wall and Ms Shelton thought the man in it stole her phone, but he later apologised - saying he had bought the phone off someone else . 'Straight after I saw it I re-shared it and changed the subject to ""This is the person who has my iPhone"" and it started gaining momentum,' she said. So far, the post has been shared on social media almost 20,000 times. 'I was absolutely dumbfounded. At first when I re-shared photo I didn't think anything would come from it,' Ms Shelton said. 'But people were messaging me and wishing me luck, people I didn't know, it was bizarre.' After the post started to gain traction, the man in the photo messaged Ms Shelton on Facebook and apologised. He said he saw her sharing his photo and had bought her phone off someone else. The man told Ms Shelton he was going to hand the phone over to the police. To her relief, she got a call from Byron Bay police and the phone will soon be returned to its owner. 'I’m just amazed by the help from people I don't even know. I'm happy to get my phone back,' Ms Shelton told Daily Mail Australia.","Nicola Shelton, 33, lost her phone on Valentine's Day at Byron Bay, NSW .

"Sierra Leone's Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana has voluntarily decided to quarantine himself . The vice president of Sierra Leone has put himself in voluntary quarantine after one of his security guards died of Ebola. Samuel Sam-Sumana's security staff died last Tuesday, and the Vice President is now set to remain in quarantine for three weeks. Despite his quarantine, Sam-Sumana is set to become acting president later Sunday when President Ernest Bai Koroma leaves Sierra Leone to attend a EU conference on Ebola in Belgium. The Vice President will carry out his duties as president from his home, the government has said. Sam-Sumana is the highest ranking African official to be in quarantine in this Ebola outbreak, which is fast approaching a death toll of 10,000. Sam-Sumana voluntarily decided to quarantine himself for 21 days following the death from Ebola last Tuesday of one of his security personnel, according to the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation. Sam-Sumana called on all those who have been in contact with the dead man to also put themselves in quarantine, said the report. 'The Vice President opted to quarantine himself because he wants to lead by example,' Sierra Leone's Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Theo Nicol said. Sam-Sumana's dramatic quarantine comes as Sierra Leone is experiencing a rise in new Ebola cases which prompted President Ernest Bai Koroma to reinstate restrictions on Saturday. Sierra Leone recorded 18 new cases of Ebola in the week ending Saturday, up from 16 new cases last week. Despite his quarantine, Sam-Sumana,right,  is set to become acting president later Sunday when President Ernest Bai Koroma, centre, leaves Sierra Leone to attend a EU conference on Ebola . This breaks the trend of declining cases in Sierra Leone. Many of the new clusters of cases are related to the capital's fishing industry. The measures re-imposed include a nighttime ban on all boats launching from shore and from commercial vehicles off-loading goods in western market areas. Naval vessels will patrol the shore and wharves. In addition there will be restrictions on ferries and health checkpoints by the police will be strengthened. Public transportation will be reinstated which limit the numbers of passengers in taxis to two in cars and four at the back of large taxi vans to reduce physical contact between passengers.","Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana has voluntarily entered quarantine .

"Victim: William Haring, pictured, was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio . A 60-year-old man was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio where he had worked for 38 years. The victim has been identified locally as longtime employee William Haring. The shop where the fatal accident took place, Logan Machine Company, was previously found to be in violation of  numerous serious safety and health regulations. An Akron police spokesman said the accident occurred sometime between 10 p.m. Friday and around 4:45 a.m. Saturday, when co-workers found him. Co-workers used a crane to lift a large metal frame off the victim. The spokesman would not identify the man but said he lived in the Akron suburb of Green. Lt. Rick Edwards told WKYC the victim was William Haring, and that he was stuck in the middle of a workbench and a steel part. The causes of death were 'blunt force trauma' and 'crushing injuries to the torso,' the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office told the NBC affiliate. Ohio.com reported that Haring had been a  foreman at Logan Machine Company. He was a company employee for 38 years, the website reported. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration proposed $66,000 in penalties against Logan Machine Company in 2012 for eight serious safety violations and seven serious health violations.

"A ski resort has issued the University of Michigan with a bill for half a million dollars after six fraternities and sororities staged a huge party that tore apart the hotel in an Animal House-style melee. Originally, it was estimated the college students caused around $75,000 damage at Treetops Resort during a ski trip in January. But a full assessment of the 45 rooms and connecting hallway - which was stripped of its ceiling - plus the loss of revenue, and damage to the brand's reputation has seen that figure multiply by six. And according to Barry Owens, general manager of Treetops in Gaylord, the fraternity that originally apologized for the damage - Sigma Alpha Mu - is refusing to pay up. Scroll down for video . Wrecked: The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau sorority are being accused of causing $50,000 in damage to the Treetops Resort in Gaylord, Michigan earlier this month . Destroyed: It has since been revealed that another disastrous party happened at another ski resort about an hour away, involving four other fraternities and sororities from the University of Michigan. However the Boyne Highlands resort is not revealing pictures of the damage. Above, a wrecked room at the Treetops Resort where members of Sigma Alpha Mu and Sigma Delta Tau stayed the weekend of January 17 . Legal action: It's estimated that both parties resulted in a combined $75,000 worth of damage. Both resorts are looking into pressing charges . Owens told MLive: 'The destruction done to Treetops Resort by University of Michigan fraternity and sorority students in mid-January is now near or beyond $430,000. 'While an investigation is ongoing, the university has stated that they expect the students who are responsible to make full restitution to Treetops for the damages. 'It also has become evident that the fraternity representatives have suggested that they are unwilling to pay for the damage that they caused the resort.' He also called on Sigma Delta Tau to contribute to the payment, which includes cleaning fees. Shocking pictures of a ski resort wrecked by members of a University of Michigan fraternity earlier this month are only half the story. It turns out, members of several other Greek life organizations from the Ann Arbor, Michigan school held a similarly debauched rager at a another hotel that same weekend. Combined, the damage done to Boyne Highlands resort from January 16 -18 is also estimated to be worth tens of thousands. Since then, the six fraternities and sororities implicated in the two parties have been suspended by their national organizations while the university and police investigate the incidents. Video from Local 4 Click on Detroit . Punishment: All of the fraternities and sororities implicated in the parties have been put on suspension by their national organizations which means they won't be allowed to host parties or represent their groups on campus . Historic: Barry Owens, the manager of the Treetops Resort, says the 45 rooms be rented to the groups were left in 'the worst condition' he's ever seen in his 30 years in hospitality . Scene: Above, the Sigma Alpha Mu (left) and Sigma Delta Tau (right) houses at the University of Michigan. The fraternity and sorority are accused of wrecking their rooms at the Treetops Resort in Gaylord . Sigma Alpha Mu chapter President Joshua Kaplan previously said his members 'are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior' of some members. He said that his fraternity 'accepts full responsibility' and 'will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs'. 'This behavior is inconsistent with the values, policies, and practices of this organization,' Kaplan said. 'We will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions.' Similar charges may also be brought up by the Boyne Highlands Resort here members of Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternities held another party that same weekend in conjunction with the Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi sororities. Resorts spokesman Erin Ernst said that the group booked rooms in two blocks, and caused an estimated $25,000 in damage by breaking furniture and doors, soiling carpet and upholstery, punching holes in walls and smoking in non-smoking room. Ernst said they are not releasing images of the damage, since the management company does not own the building and publishing the pictures would be a violation of their landlord's privacy. Ruined: Above, the Boyne Highlands resort where members of the Chi Psi and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternities held a similarly destructive party with the Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi sororities . A spokesman for Boyne Highlands says one block of rooms was more destroyed than the other. Above, the Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternity houses at University of Michigan . Chi Psi and Pi Kappa Alpha allegedly rented out two blocks of rooms at Boyne Highlands with members of the Delta Gamma (left) and Alpha Phi (right) sororites . 'One of the group's units was far worse than the other,' Ernst told The Ann Arbor News. 'Obviously our owners are not pleased. Showing this level of extreme disregard to our properties is ridiculous. We will be looking at implementing new policies when it comes to young people booking at our properties.' In addition to possible criminal charges, Ernst says they will be looking into getting payment for the time they couldn't rent out the damaged condos. It's believed that members of even more University of Michigan fraternities and sororities may have been involved in both parties. Suspension by their national organization means the members of the six fraternities and sororities involved may continue to live in their campuses houses but can not participate in social activities, including holding parties or representing their organizations at university functions .They also won't be able to vote in Greek life councils. University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald says the suspension gives the university and authorities time to investigate the incident and determine appropriate action. 'It's more important to make sure we get the right information and move forward following our established processes than to do it by a specific deadline,' Mr Fitzgerald said. The university community has expressed scorn at the way the fraternity and sorority members represented their institution - ranked one of the top public colleges in the nation - during the out-of-control weekend ski trip. 'These incidents simply do not reflect the University of Michigan's values or its expectations,' said E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life. 'The behaviors are a contradiction of what it means to be in and of a community, and we do not believe that being away from campus is a license to act in destructive and irresponsible ways.' Three student body leaders also reacted to the incident this week. The joint letter from Student body president Bobby Dishell, Interfraternity Council president Alex Krupiak and Panhellenic Association president Maddy Walsh wrote that the parties were 'an act of shocking disrespect'. 'We, as leaders and Greeks at the University of Michigan, do not tolerate these kinds of acts, nor do we let such behavior fall under the radar. We intend to handle this situation with the utmost efficiency, and we will ensure that those responsible for the damage to the properties will be held accountable throughout this process,' the statement reads.","University of Michigan fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu was the first to be blamed for a destructive party at Treetops Resort earlier this month .
It has since been revealed that the party was co-hosted by members of the Sigma Delta Tau sorority .
Meanwhile, four other Michigan fraternities and sororities have been accused of exacting $25,000 in damage to another resort in Harbor Springs .
The owner of Treetops Resort is looking into suing for damages ."
"A celebrity neighbour row has taken a new twist after Jimmy Page hired architects and engineers to say how Robbie Williams' basement pool could destroy his 'irreplaceable' home. Led Zeppelin veteran Mr Page, 71, has sounded the fears for his Grade I listed house in Holland Park, West London - a stone's throw from the Take That star Mr Williams' £17.5million mansion. The pop star, who bought Michael Winner's former 46-room home in 2013, first sparked Mr Page's ire last month with plans for an extension including a lift and recording studio. Not a whole lotta love: Former Take That singer Robbie Williams wants to extend his London mansion (left) - which allegedly could harm the Grade I lsited home (right) of his neighbour, Led Zeppelin veteran Jimmy Page . Take that, Robbie! The singer (left) has received a fresh complaint from his neighbour Jimmy Page (right) Then Mr Wiliams submitted plans for a two-storey basement with a swimming pool - prompting drastic action from Mr Page, who has been in his house for 43 years. The Led Zeppelin guitarist hired three firms - architects, structural engineers and town planners - to prepare three separate reports on why the development should be blocked. His biggest fear is that vibrations from the building works could harm his 1870s home, which he describes as a 'masterpiece'. Over the years he has conserved the house as a 'custodian' and claims his restorative works have been labelled 'exemplary' by English Heritage. Described as one of the most important homes in the borough, the red-brick tower house was saved from demolition in the 1960s following a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh. In his latest objection to Kensington and Chelsea Council, Mr Page wrote: 'Similar schemes have been carried out on other properties in the area locally and each time the level of vibration cause during the works has caused concern about the effect on decorative finishes of [my] house. Stairway to bedlam: Robbie Williams's latest plans include a basement complete with a swimming pool, right . Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013 . 'The work now proposed is much nearer than other major excavations carried out so far and the consequences for the building fabric and decorative finishes... may well be catastrophic if this project is allowed to proceed.' Mr Page's concerns have been supported by a report carried out on his behalf by historical building consultants Andrew Townsend Architects. Mr Townsend, who has been practising as an architect for nearly 30 years, described Mr Page's house as 'one of the most important houses built in this country in the nineteenth century'. 'Excessive vibration from building works to the adjoining property could have disastrous effects on these decorative finishes', he wrote. His report added that it was possible the 'hand-made brickwork' boundary wall between the two stars' houses would collapse. Surveyors from civil engineering firm Clive Hudson Associates wrote that the home was 'designed by William Burges, one of the greatest architects of the 19th century, as his home and contains original and irreplaceable interiors.' Mr Williams' house's main bedroom, pictured during the time the late Michael Winner lived at the property . Williams bought the house in 2013, after the director's death, and is now keen to renovate the property . The west London mansion, pictured in 2011 when Winner tried to sell it, includes a swimming pool room . They added: 'These unparalleled interiors are of national significance and, we believe, are at serious risk if the applicant's proposals (as they currently stand) are accepted.' And the Led Zeppelin guitarist included a lengthy report from town planners Bell Cornwell, which detailed how the plans allegedly fail to meet council recommendations. The 41-year-old pop singer has said he is simply trying to turn his mansion into a modern family home. But his plans have also upset another wealthy neighbour, Marks & Spencer heir Jonathan Sieff. Mr Sieff wrote to Kensington and Chelsea Council to complain about Mr Williams’s request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden, which backs onto Mr Sieff’s property. Plans on the local council's website show the extent to which Williams plans to re-tile his home's roof . The great-great grandson of Mr Marks is worried the machines’ noise will detract from his quality of life. He wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of 43.5dB, ‘which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking’. Another complaint has come to the council despite being 10,000 miles away in Melbourne, Australia. Despite the strongly-worded objections, one person sent a letter of support to the council. Alan Dargue, from Yorkshire, wrote: 'As the custodian of several listed buildings and a scheduled ancient monument, it is my firm belief that heritage assets are best preserved by their continued use even if this means altering them significantly in order to meet their occupier's needs.' The council is expected to make its decision on the initial plans by the end of this month. Mr Williams and Mr Page have previously declined to comment.","Take That star bought £17.5m mansion in London's Holland Park in 2013 .

"This well-heeled hamlet north of New York City is embroiled in an increasingly nasty debate that seems oddly out of place amid the stately homes and tony boutiques: What should be done about coyotes? Self-styled coyote spotters in and around Chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets. That's been enough to stir animal passions among residents over the question of when and if a coyote deserves to be killed. Email and social media have swirled with such teeth-baring terms as 'coyote jihad' and 'death map.' And members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue 'in the interest of our personal safety.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Pet owner Ann Styles Brochstein holds her Havanese dog Samson near where Samson was attacked by a coyote outside her home in Chappaqua, New York . Sighting: The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force is arguing for more frequent use of 'lethal solutions' against coyotes. A Facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen November 16, 2014 . Wounded: The anti-coyote New Castle Coyote Management Task Force included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation . 'I envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me,' said task force member Joyce Stansell-Wong, who has since resigned. Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a playground for coyotes. But wildlife officials say the demise of such predators as wolves and cougars over the last few decades has led to a spread of coyotes into more populated areas across the East Coast, including suburbs. Instagram and Facebook are replete with pictures of the canines scampering across sidewalks and among backyard playsets. Coyotes have even been spotted in New York City's Central Park and the Bronx. Robert Greenstein, supervisor of the Town of New Castle, which has about 18,000 residents in Chappaqua, Millwood and unincorporated areas, said that in general, the debate is between two camps: 'One group is concerned with protecting the coyotes and the other group is more concerned with protecting our pets.' The pet-protection camp, represented by the New Castle Coyote Management Task Force, argues for quicker use of 'lethal solutions.' Even though there have been no attacks on humans, they fear the skulking canines may start to attack small children. 'A menacing coyote, circling the playground, stalking children, that coyote has to go,' said task force member Ann Styles Brochstein, whose Havanese dog Samson was attacked by a coyote in their yard. Famous residents: Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a coyote playground (file photo) 'Residents have had to alter their lifestyle significantly,' she said. 'Taking out the garbage, grilling in backyards, walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes. They appear on porches and decks, looking through doors at children and pets.' A separate group, represented by the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, is advocating more tolerance, noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education — and keeping pets on leashes — can help limit close encounters. In general, they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets. 'We must encourage responsible pet ownership and not penalize a coyote for taking a small dog when such an act is only doing what comes naturally,' said Victoria Alzapiedi, chairwoman of the advisory committee. In the public meeting on the issue Feb. 10, the advisory committee gave its presentation. The absent task force submitted its presentation online. Both groups did extensive research, spoke with experts and appear to agree that coexistence is inevitable. They differ, however, on the current effectiveness of 'hazing' coyotes, or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted. The task force says some coyotes have gotten used to such displays and pay scant attention. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation would have to approve any shooting or trapping. Coyotes that are trapped are then euthanized rather than taken to another area. The department's guidelines offer some perspective, noting that 650 New Yorkers are hospitalized every year for dog bites and that while coyotes kill cats, 'so do foxes, dogs, bobcats, vehicles and even great horned owls.' Dan Bogan, a coyote expert who consults for the DEC, said, 'We're never going to get rid of coyotes. They're not going anywhere. People aren't going anywhere either. Coexistence is the solution.' Greenstein said town board members are studying the proposals and will hold a public work session in the next month or two to discuss them. His prediction: 'That'll be Round 2 of the fireworks.' Battle: Two groups are now fighting in Westchester County, New York, over the fate of the coyotes. The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force also posted to Facebook this photo of a November 16, 2014 sighting .","Coyote spotters in and around Chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets and at least 10 recent attacks on pets .

"In the middle of a soldier's deployment to Qatar, he decided fly home to surprise his daughters  just in time for his youngest's second birthday. Army National Guard Sgt First Class Joseph Kern flew home to Cherry Hill, New Jersey during his fifth deployment on Thursday and will be with his family for five days. His first stop after he touched down on American soil was his two-year-old daughter Pearl's classroom, where he had the chance to surprise her and his other daughter, three-year-old Estelle. Scroll down for video . Army National Guard Sgt First Class Joseph Kern flew home from his deployment in Qatar to surprise his two daughters, Estelle, three, and Pearl, two . He surprised the girls in Pearl's  (front) classroom on her second birthday on Thursday. He'll be home for five days . Kern's wife, Sarah Woldoff, a neuro-psychologist in Princeton, said that the military no longer offers leave, so the couple had to pay out of pocket for him to come home, according to ABC. He left for Qatar in June and had already missed Estelle's birthday, so Woldoff said her husband's plane ticket was 'worth every dollar'. She added that seeing Kern reunite with their daughters was 'breathtaking'. Estelle was 'a little bit confused and in shock' when she saw her dad, according to Woldoff. Kern and his wife Sarah Woldoff (left, holding Estelle) said that Pearl didn't immediately recognize him, but Woldoff said the reunion was still 'breathtaking' Woldoff said that the couple was 'disappointed' with Pearl's response, but they hope having the video will help her remember the reunion when she gets older . Unfortunately, Pearl didn't seem to recognize her dad when he walked in, and instead when to hug her grandpa. 'We were both slightly disappointed with Pearl's response,' Woldoff told ABC. 'You never realize that they're so young, they don't have as much memory of him as we anticipated.' But the mom-of-two hopes that having the reunion on video will help her daughter remember it when she get older. 'In hindsight, I'm really glad we did it the way we did. Pearl's too little to have the memory of it, but I think Estelle will remember,' she said. 'And it'll ease the transition. Everyone forgets he has to go back on Tuesday, and it's really confusing for her on why he has to leave again.' Woldoff said that the National Guard does not give leave anymore, so the couple paid out of pocket for Kern's visit . Kern missed Estelle's (right) birthday while he was away, so this trip was 'worth every dollar', according to Woldoff . His daughters weren't the only ones he had the chance to surprise during his time home, however. Kern surprised his mom at a restaurant by dressing up like a waiter and walking around the dining room as she ate. 'My mother-in-law didn't even realize it was him. We had to point it out,' Woldoff said. 'She lost it. She was in utter shock and just hysterical.' Kern will likely be in Qatar until June, making it a year-long deployment, according to NorthJersey.com. Kern left for Qatar last June and will likely stay until this upcoming June, making it a year-long trip. Here his is pictured with Pearl (left) and Estelle (right) in June 2014, right before his deployment . Estelle and Pearl apparently have a pillow with their dad's picture on it.

"An intensive care unit nurse who survived her fight against Ebola has claimed the treatment has made her hair fall out, causes insomnia and has damaged her social life. Nina Pham was diagnosed with the deadly disease along with co-worker Amber Vinson after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient to die from the illness in October. The 26-year-old was given the all-clear, but has revealed this week she is suing Texas Presbyterian Hospital, claiming she became the 'symbol of corporate neglect', as senior officials failed to adequately prepare for the crisis. She said her training in treating those with the virus was on a single piece of paper found by her supervisor online. Concerns: Nina Pham, who was diagnosed with the deadly disease in October, says the experimental drugs used in her treatment is causing her hair to fall out and makes her suffer aches, pains and fatigue . Miss Pham also fears that her health will be constantly affected by the experimental drugs she was given and is already suffering aches, pains and fatigue. If she has a glass of wine at dinner, she will always feel sick, and she constantly has nightmares about her ordeal. Doctors have also warned her to check for signs of vision loss as well as sensory and organ failure. She split up with her boyfriend, who was  quarantined as a precaution, after she was released from hospital and struggles to interact with friends because 'Ebola always comes up'. A representative for her attorney . 'I wanted to believe that they would have my back and take care of me, but they just haven't risen to the occasion,' she told The Dallas Morning News. 'I was the last person besides Mr. Duncan to find out he was positive' she said. 'You'd think the primary nurse would be the first to know.I broke down and cried, not because I thought I had it but just because it was a big 'whoa, this is really happening' moment. Pham said she considered not going back to care for Duncan after his diagnosis, with her colleagues insisting they would back up her decision. But she felt she had to. Criticizing how the hospital prepared for the crisis, she said the extent of her training was a single piece of paper one of her superiors found online. Privacy issues: A doctor wearing a video camera came into her room, claiming he was making an educational video. She did not give permission for the video, which was subsuqently released to the media . Smiling: After Miss Pham was given the all-clear, she was invited to the Oval Office where she met President Obama. The intensive care nurse is now suing Texas Presbyterian Hospital, claiming she became a symbol of 'corporate neglect' Sufferer: Miss Pham was diagnosed with the deadly disease along with co-worker Amber Vinson after treating Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured) the first patient to die from the illness in October . The day after Duncan died, Pham  met with someone from the CDC and the hospital's employee health manager to review Duncan's care. They also deemed her 'no risk' in terms of contracting the Ebola virus. When tests confirmed she had the virus, she broke down crying, and asked medical staff that her name be released as 'Jane Doe' to protect her privacy.  The request was refused and from then on Miss Pham became the face of the fight against Ebola in the United States. She said: 'Just knowing the whole world's watching but you're so isolated and the people that are coming [in to care for me] are risking their lives.'Touching me is life-threatening. It's very lonely.' Before she was transferred to Maryland, a doctor wearing a video camera came into her room, claiming he was making an educational video. Miss Pham said she did not give permission for the video, which was subsuqently released to the media. She told the Morning News: 'They had just a PR nightmare with what happened with Mr. Duncan … and then us being infected with Ebola. Not just one nurse, but two. People lost faith in them, especially after we got sick. Texas Health Resources gave the paper a statement saying: 'Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.' However her attorney Charla Aldous said she was simply used as a 'PR pawn'. Protective: Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case . During an interview in December, just six weeks after she was declared Ebola-free, the modest nurse insists she is not a hero and was 'just doing [her] job'. She was among the Ebola fighters recognized by Time magazine as their 'Person of the Year'. Miss Pham recalled a CDC doctor and her chief nursing officer approaching her in hazmat suits - and she knew from their faces the news was bad. Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case. She adds people have been afraid of her, including not wanting to shake her hand in church, even after health officials declared her free of the virus. President Barack Obama tried to calm hysteria in the United States over how Ebola is contracted by welcoming survivors to the White House. After surviving her ordeal, Ms Pham was welcomed to the Oval Office in October and hugged by the President. The worst ever Ebola outbreak has left more than 6,300 people dead worldwide, nearly all in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

"Hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year - including some weighing more than a stone. As many as 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese since 2011, according to shocking figures from a series of Freedom of Information requests. At just one trust nearly 400 babies born in the last four years weighed 9lb 15oz or more - the marker for an obese baby. Hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year including some weighing more than a stone, Freedom of Information requests have revealed (stock image) Peterborough and Stamford ­Hospitals Trust also recorded 280 exceptionally large babies and another 265 arrived at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Warwickshire. There has also been an increase in the number of babies weighing 12lb or more. Seven clinics reported births of so-called 'sumo babies' in 2013 - including two where the babies weighed more than a stone. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing. 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight. 'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is  a continuous upwards spiral. Danica Slavin (second from right) gave birth to two babies, Eva (right) and Jack (left), who both weighed over 10lbs. They had to be delivered via caesarean at Jessop Wing maternity unit in Sheffield but are now happy and healthy . Eva (above) was born in 2013 and weighed 12lb 6oz - 5lb more than the average baby girl . One mother has given birth to two big babies in the last 18 months. Danica Slavin had her first daughter Eva Lily Margerrison in 2013 and was shocked when she weighed in at 12lb 6oz. But she was even more surprised when three weeks ago she gave birth to her son Jack, who, at 10lb 3oz, was nearly just as big. Both babies had to be delivered via caesarean at Jessop Wing maternity unit. The 21-year-old mother, from Sheffield, met her partner Sam Margerrison four years ago when they worked at fast-food chain Burger King. She said: 'I don't know why Eva and Jack were so big because me and my partner Sam weren't big babies. 'I was tested for gestational diabetes with both babies but that was ruled out. 'I just had big babies.' She explained that Jack was currently on formula and Eva enjoyed her fruit and vegetables. She also dismissed claims that the size of a baby at birth related to its parents. 'You obviously don't expect a baby of that size,' she said. 'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies. He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally. 'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' Toddlers are also being hospitalised for being obese, with 28 two-year-olds and 33 three-year-olds admitted since 2011, Laura Connor revealed in her Sunday Mirror investigation. Freedom of Information requests were sent to 153 hospital trusts in the country and received 110 replies. Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust - 372 . Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals Trust - 280 . George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust - 265 . Bedford Hospital NHS Trust - 220 . London North West Healthcare NHS Trust - 165 . The average weight of a baby boy is 7lb 8oz and for a girl it is 7lb 4oz. Childhood obesity can lead to a number of medical problems including diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer. A Royal College of Midwives spokesman said: 'It starts pre-conceptually. If a woman is trying to get pregnant then she should already be eating healthily and not drinking or smoking. 'It is a common myth that the woman should eat for two. Really, she should be just taking in lots of vegetables and a balanced diet. 'Long walks and gentle jogs can also help.'

"Trolled: Nick Robinson has been attacked by online trolls after revealing he has lung cancer . Veteran broadcaster Nick Robinson has been abused online after announcing he is battling cancer. The BBC said at the weekend that its political editor is to take time off to have a tumour removed from his lung. But he was immediately the subject of vile abuse online from Twitter trolls who accused him of both pro-Tory bias and anti-SNP sentiment. Stephen Smyth, whose Twitter ‘handle’ – his online name – includes an SNP logo, sent a message reading ‘karma’ direct to Mr Robinson, 51, and the BBC. Other Twitter users described Mr Smyth as an SNP member and urged the party to expel him. Last night, the SNP had not confirmed or denied if he was a member. Phoenix45blog – the 45 seemingly a reference to the percentage who voted Yes – wrote: ‘A bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good.’ This prompted widespread condemnation on the site, with posters calling it ‘vile’ and ‘disgusting’. One, Alex, tweeted: ‘You are one sad individual.’ Initially, phoenix45blog replied: ‘Nope, I’m quite happy about this news.’ But he later changed his mind, tweeting: ‘I apologise unreservedly for the prior tweet. It was tasteless. I wish you a speedy recovery Nick. #contrite.’ Jimmy James – whose Twitter profile sports the number 45 – said that ‘diagnosis aside’ Mr Robinson was an “****hole”. It was not just cybernats who were guilty of abuse. Maenad Nanna tweeted from Wales: ‘Self-respecting lung tumour wants removing from mendacious @BBCNews Tory shill Nick Robinson.’ When Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted he wished Mr Robinson well, one individual replied that he was a ‘little Englander scumbag like that **** Cameron’. A second tweet responding to the same message said: ‘Looks like @DavidCameron’s director of communications is off sick, poor man.’ Sick: Two of the vile messages sent to the BBC political editor after he announced he has cancer . The comments were widely condemned – including by the SNP. Former Labour First Minister Lord McConnell said they were ‘sick’. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her support, wishing Mr Robinson a speedy recovery. The presenter became a hate figure among some Nationalists during the referendum campaign, with protesters outside BBC Scotland’s Glasgow headquarters calling for him to be sacked for what they saw as biased coverage. At the time, Alex Salmond refused to condemn them, calling the demonstrations ‘joyous’. During the referendum campaign, the SNP was constantly embarrassed by the online army of cybernats. JK Rowling and David Bowie were two of many who earned their wrath for speaking out in favour of the Union. Dispute: The SNP had a public spat with Robinson, 51, during the campaign, with dozens of members making official complaints and some even calling him a 'liar' in banners as they paraded through Glasgow's streets . Last night, Scottish politicians warned such abuse threatened to silence democratic debate in the run-up to May’s General Election. A Scottish Labour spokesman said: ‘These tweets are beneath contempt. There is no place in Scottish life for this kind of bile. ‘Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP must immediately distance themselves from these vile comments and call on their more extreme supporters to stop polluting social media with vicious personal attacks. ‘This online bullying is in danger of destroying public debate.’ A Scottish Tory spokesman said: ‘These comments are despicable, but won’t surprise anyone who saw the depths some people stooped to during the referendum campaign. ‘It’s important all political parties lead by example and condemn this sort of behaviour.’ An SNP spokesman said: ‘We deplore all internet abuse, as we have made consistently clear, and the First Minister has wished Nick Robinson well for a speedy recovery.’ When Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted he wished Mr Robinson well, one individual replied that he was a ‘little Englander scumbag like that **** Cameron’ Mr Robinson hopes the operation to remove a bronchial carcinoid tumour from his lung will take place within the next month so he can return to work before the General Election. He remarked of his illness and its proximity to the election: ‘Timing lousy. Prognosis good.’ Both the broadcaster’s parents smoked, but while he has admitted to the ‘odd drag on cannabis at university’, he has said he has always been so anti-nicotine that he ‘was the sort of irritating child who used primary school art classes to make anti-smoking propaganda’.","Journalist recently announced diagnosis and will take leave for treatment .

"It's a key question to consider when making a hotel booking - do you want a lot of everything or the best of a few things? As Every Hotels launched its first venue in Piccadilly, London last week, it was clear that this kind of question provides the thinking behind its brand. To find out what guests really want, London-based hotel group glh conducted research over the last two years, most recently asking 4,000 adults globally what matters most when staying in a hotel. Each room at Every Hotels' new location in Piccadilly boasts a Hypnos bed and a complimentary mini-bar . Top three were a great night's sleep (86 per cent), no hidden extras (81 per cent) and fast and efficient check-in (67 per cent). Turning its back on the traditional hotel rating system, Every Hotels is striving to meet the demands of guests looking for fully-equipped bedrooms in hotels without meeting rooms, spas or a plethora of restaurants and bars. The company has stripped back all the non-room features usually found in four-star hotels, and instead focuses on quality rooms and a personal service. The Piccadilly venture is the first to open in London, with sites in Hyde Park, Leicester Square and Bloomsbury next on the agenda. Every Hotels has opened its first London location in Piccadilly, with three others planned . MailOnline Travel stayed the night to see whether they'd got the balance just right. Every Hotel Piccadilly offers modern, well-equipped rooms with Hypnos beds, Nespresso machines, complimentary mini-bar, free wifi, a great location, hosts genuinely knowledgeable about the local area and the opportunity to choose your room before you arrive. What strikes me is that senior executives involved with the project are very realistic; in the sense that they recognise there are many restaurants and bars to choose from in central London, that tourists will spend most of their time walking around, and that most businessmen will have office meetings in offices. And so the focus is on the accommodation, the comfort, and having facilities that don't force themselves onto guests. The company's research showed them that 52 per cent of Brits wanted a Nespresso machine in the room . My deluxe room is spacious and bright with a clean and sharp finish. The complimentary mini-bar is a nice touch. With stunning views of the heart of London, yet with soundproofing giving a great night's sleep, the rooms provide that well-deserved luxury after a day out traipsing the streets. The company's research showed them that 52 per cent of Brits wanted a Nespresso machine in the room, and 41 per cent demanded a Smart TV - so these are standard throughout. Richard Sofer, CEO Every Hotels, said: 'What came out loud and clear was that guests wanted a great room with great tech, in a great location. 'What is really important to today's guests, regardless of whether they are travelling for business or pleasure, is they don't want any hidden surprises. 'So, not only is our wifi complimentary, but so are our mini-bars, Nespresso machines, printing facilities and in room entertainment.' Rooms offer views of the heart of London, with soundproofing to ensure a great night's sleep . You won't find just one person at the reception having to handle a queue of customers.

"A driver with what looked to be a child in his minivan stopped his car and spewed profanities at a bicyclist who slapped the car when he claimed the driver cut him off. The bicyclist was wearing a helmet camera while cycling through San Francisco and caught the whole thing on film. At the beginning of the video the bicyclist and silver Toyota minivan traveling side by side at first. A driver with a child in his minivan stopped his car and spewed profanities at a bicyclist who slapped the car when he claimed the driver cut him off . Then the minivan pulls up in front of the bike, its blinker on, in preparation to turn into the parking lot. 'Hey, watch it. What the f***?' the driver can be heard saying as the car pulls up right in front of him. The bicyclist posted the video on Reddit and explained that the driver had 'plenty of time' to see that they were going at about 'the same speed' but still decided to make the turn. 'I made impact before we even came to a complete stop,' the bicyclist wrote. 'Then I slapped the rear window in an emotionally charged outburst after we had come to a complete stop. The bicyclist said the tire of his bike hit the rear of the minivan during the impact. 'I had thought the guy saw me, since he was right next to me for awhile, and was slowing down to let me go past,' the bicyclist wrote.'Then he slammed on his brakes and got right in front of me . Bicylist said he hit his front brake as hard as he could and went over the handlebars 'a bit'. He said he then slapped the rear window 'in an emotionally charged outburst' The driver pulls up in front of the entrance to the parking lot and stops his car, yelling profanities the second he gets out of his vehicle. 'What the hell motherf***er, what's your goddamn problem?' he said. The bicyclist can be heard responding 'you saw me the whole way, you were right next to me it's all on camera.' The driver replies: 'I don't give a s***, you saw me making a f***ing signal, I didn't run into you I passed your f***ing a**. You were way back there, bullshit motherf***er'. When the bicyclist tells the driver to calm down and step away from his property, the driver responds 'then don't be hitting my car, you hit my f***ing car jacka**'. He then asks the bicyclist 'how do you like this?' and kicks his bike twice. On Reddit the bicyclist said the driver was 'ready to start throwing fists' before he pointed at his helmet camera. The driver yelled at the bicyclist: 'You saw me making a f***ing signal, I didn't run into you I passed your f***ing a**. You were way back there, bullshit motherf***er' The bicyclist told the driver to calm down and step away from his property. The driver responded 'you hit my f***ing car jacka**' and then asks the bicyclist 'how do you like this?' before kicking his bike twice . The bicyclist, who went by the username agentx85b, said he originally got the camera because of the disregard he felt other drivers had for his safety on the road. When commenters on the site said it looked as though the bicyclist was farther away then he first implied, he said it was because of the wide lens angle and the slowed down speed. 'I had thought the guy saw me, since he was right next to me for awhile, and was slowing down to let me go past,' the bicyclist wrote. 'Then he slammed on his brakes and got right in front of me. I hit my front brake as hard as I could and actually went over the handlebars a bit.' The bicyclist also pointed out that he was able to slap the car with his forearm, proving that the vehicle was not the legally required distance of three feet away from the bike. California law states that a you cannot turn into the bike lane if there is a bicyclist currently in the lane, according to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. It also states that the width required for 'safe bicycle passage' is three to four feet.","Bicyclist was wearing a helmet camera while cycling through San Francisco and caught the whole thing on film .

"First it was smoked salmon and caviar, followed by champagne and lobster. Now Lidl, the bargain supermarket chain the middle class love, is trying the luxury-on-the-cheap approach with something rather different: lingerie. The collection, entitled See You In Venice, is part of the Esmara clothing range, and consists of four bra designs in cup sizes 34B, 36B, 38B and 38C. The bras are available in polka-dot, slate grey, black trimmed with pink or nude and black, and cost £3.99. The matching briefs come in small, medium and large, which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20, and a pack of two costs £3.99 — a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls. All the lingerie is made in China from polyester, Lycra and nylon, and is available in Lidl stores while stocks last. If the range proves popular, more sizes will follow, says Sophie Lambert Russell, from the Lidl fashion team. While the undies are certainly cheap, as any woman knows, it can sometimes be a mistake to scrimp on the basics. So, can these supermarket smalls compete with our High Street favourites? To find out if the See You In Venice collection is catwalk chic or bargain bucket, we asked independent lingerie expert Becky John and the Mail’s senior stylist Amy Kester to cast their critical eyes over them, checking for size, fit and comfort. Here’s what they found … . DARK AND CHIC . BECKY SAYS: ‘This dark colour is flattering, and it looks classy on nearly every skin tone. There is no seam up the middle of the cup, so it won’t be visible through a tight T-shirt. The briefs are ultra-thin and I do hope they maintain their shape when they are washed. There are seams up the middle of the briefs on the front and back, which might be uncomfortable under tight jeans due to chafing. ‘However, they are pretty, grown-up looking and great value.’ AMY SAYS: ‘Wow, this set looks really chic. The underwiring gives good support and the brief-style knickers have good coverage as well as looking glamorous.’ BEST FOR: Date-night. Slate grey padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 5/5 . EVERYDAY ESSENTIAL . BECKY SAYS: ‘This is probably the most versatile of all the bras and could be worn everyday because of its neutral colour — it’s just a shame the whole set isn’t completely nude-toned. The black lace trim just looks like a cheap, last-minute add-on. It is only sewn on to the bra at the top and bottom rather than all the way round. I can actually put my finger under it, and I’m worried it might become detached or pucker when washed. The briefs are a good size — not too grannyish but not too skimpy either.’ AMY SAYS: ‘I don’t like this one on. The colour reminds me of shapewear and the black lace makes it look cheap. It would have been better in ivory.’ BEST FOR: Everyday wear. Nude with lace trim padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 2.5/5 . GO-GETTING GLAMOUR . BECKY SAYS: ‘This colour combination reminds me of Agent Provocateur and this set has a lovely diamante detail along with the bows. ‘The briefs have no centre seams, which will ensure a smooth contour. I like the fact all the Lidl bras have three fastenings on the back. Some cheap sets have only two, or one, which means you can’t adjust them easily. This set looks beautiful and it smacks of luxury.’ AMY SAYS: ‘Pink on black can look cheap but the satiny fabric makes it look classy. It reminds me of a set Rosie Huntington-Whiteley designed for M&S.’ BEST FOR: A pretty gift. Black padded push-up bra with pink lace trim, matching briefs. 4/5 . POLKA PUSH-UP . BECKY SAYS: ‘Thin straps look more attractive, but aren’t always strong enough to support a bigger bust and I’m not sure I’d want such a delicate strap if I was wearing the 38C. ‘The underwiring doesn’t sit flush to the model’s skin and that’s because the sizes are so limited. ‘And the half-seam up the front of the bra cup might show under a T-shirt. ‘But the cut of the cups makes Lauren’s cleavage look really good and there is no unattractive gathering on the knickers. ’ AMY SAYS: ‘I love the bow details, and the lace edging gives it an expensive feel.’ BEST FOR: Teenagers. Cream and black polka-dot padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 3/5 . THE VERDICT OF OUR EXPERTS . BECKY SAYS: ‘These four styles will give pricier ranges such as La Senza and Boux Avenue a run for their money. But the reason they can retail at such a low price is that the manufacturers need only a few templates as the bra sizes on offer are so limited. I’d be a bit fed up if I’d driven across town to buy a set, only to find that the sizes available are too small for me. ‘A survey conducted by Debenhams in 2014 found the average bra size of women in England and Ireland is 34C, while in Scotland it’s 34DD. Only Welsh consumers — whose average size is 34B — would fit into the Lidl range.’ AMY SAYS: ‘I’ve inspected the stitching and everything looks finished properly. On the whole, I think they’re well made. I’m impressed by the attention to detail at such low prices.’","The collection is called See You In Venice and is part of the Esmara range .

"A third child has died after being found in an Ohio home with high levels of carbon monoxide. Jakia Jones, 13, died Sunday after a relative found her unresponsive at her western Ohio home. The teenager was at home with her cousins Dionanna Bishop, 14, and Dejah Bishop, 13, who died Friday after they were rushed to an emergency room, according to The Dayton Daily News. Death: Sisters Dionanna Bishop, left, 14, and Dejah Bishop, 13, died of possible carbon monoxide poisoning . But as the family come to terms with their tragic loss, Jones' eight-year-old brother, Jahari Jones, remains on life support at Dayton Children's Hospital. According to police, a furnace caused the leak of carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas created when some fuels are burned. The children lived with their grandmother, Jean Bishop who was hospitalized with pneumonia Friday. A relative of the dead children reported to police that the kids had been sick for days. All of the children were thought to be home alone when they became ill. Firefighters who initially responded to the home were also treated and released at Upper Valley Medical Center for possible carbon monoxide exposure, said Assistant Fire Chief Matthew Simmons. However, James T. Ambrose, an attorney for Joseph and Kathy Caldwell, a couple who own the home said they weren't aware of furnace problems and didn't know children lived there. They have owned the property for about 20 years and had no indication the furnace may have had a problem. House: Emergency personnel carry a person out on a stretcher from the home in the 100 block of South Elm Street, Troy, Friday afternoon . 'Every time there was a problem in the home, whether it was a leaky faucet of whatever, they attended to it,' Ambrose said. 'Whenever they were informed of anything, they addressed it appropriately and promptly.' He added that the Caldwells were devastated over what happened. But police said there will be a thorough review of the case  to determine whether any charges should be filed. Preliminary autopsy results on two of the deceased children — sisters Dionanna and Dejah - showed that they died of exposure to carbon monoxide, according to Miami County coroners. Meanwhile the children's distraught uncle Leon Bishop Sr., said he'd spent all-night praying at Dayton Children's Hospital before losing Jones. 'I'm numb,' he said. 'We're all pulling for the kids in the hospital. We're all praying. I'm getting a lot of support from friends and family.' Shane Carter, director of the Lincoln Community Center told The Dayton Daily News that the children participated in after-school tutoring and recreational programs at the center. He has now planned a candlelight vigil in their memory at 6 p.m. Sunday. Additionally, the center is establishing a fund at Wright-Patt Credit Union to help the family with funeral expenses. 'My hope and prayer is that we can just be able to get the support and the resources needed to send them off the proper way,' Carter said.","Jakia Jones, 13, died after being found unresponsive in the Ohio home .

"Before getting behind the wheel of a £200,000, 200mph sports car, you might at least spare a few months of your precious life learning how to drive. But police were unable to ascertain whether the driver of this Ferrari supercar had bothered with that small precaution, after they found he didn't have a valid driving licence. The grey Ferrari 458 was stopped on the M40 near Bicester, Oxfordshire, after a member of the public reported a sports car driving over the speed limit. Seized by police: A £200,000 Ferrari 458 sits by the side of the road after it was stopped by traffic police investigating reports of a speeding sports car racing along the M40 near Bicester, Oxfordshire . After a traffic officers discovered the driver - who was using a German number plate - did not have a licence, he was reported to Thames Valley police and taken to the 'nearest point of safety'. First officially unveiled in 2009, the Ferrari 458 packs a direct fuel-injection V8 engine capable of producing 458 horsepower, taking it from 0-62mph in less than three seconds. The car, which has a top speed of 202mph, was decorated with a novelty bumper sticker pronouncing it an 'official speed camera testing vehicle'. It was last spotted being loaded onto a flatbed truck for the long, slow journey to the car pound. Cheeky: The rear of the vehicle is dedicated with a bumper sticking describing it as an 'official speed camera testing vehicle.

'The driver had no licence so the car was seized and he was reported for driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. 'We used a recovery vehicle and he was dropped off at the nearest point of safety. I believe it was a Ferrari 458 with a German number plate. 'It was pulled over after a report that a sports car was driving quite quickly. We do not know if this was the same vehicle that was reported for speeding.' Officers will now carry out a background check on the driver before deciding on their next course of action.","Driver of the supercar was reported to police before being dropped off .

"A teenage girl has been beaten to death and set on fire in a Nigerian market after being accused of being a suicide bomber. Police officers said a second suspected teenage girl was also accused of being a suicide bomber and was arrested at the Muda Lawal market, the biggest market in Bauchi city in north east Nigeria. A yam vendor said  people  discovered one of the girls had two bottles strapped to her body so they clubbed her to death, put a tyre doused in fuel over her head and set it on fire. Scroll down for video . Police said the girl was accused of being a suicide bomber and clubbed to death before being set on fire by the crowd at the market in Bauchi, Nigeria - pictured are the schoolgirls Boko Haram kidnapped last year . Market trader Mohd Adamu said the girls refused to be searched at the gate of the vegetable market, arousing suspicion from the people who attacked them. But police spokesman Mohammad Haruna said it seemed doubtful the girl was a bomber and described her as the victim of 'mob action carried out by an irate crowd'. A spate of such attacks has been blamed on Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram extremist group, which wants to enforce strict Islamic law across Nigeria. Last year the terror group kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls from the town of Chibok - sparking fears they are being used to carry out the suicide bombings. A vehicle used by Boko Haram set ablaze by Nigerian troops near the town of Baga, north-eastern Nigeria . Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan (pictured right) shakes hand with a military officer on his arrival at the town of Baga, which was the scene of Boko Haram's worst massacre to date . Boko Haram carried out its first suicide bombing in 2011 - it's a relatively new tactic for the terror group. The first female suicide bombing was reported in June 2014 when a middle-aged woman blew herself up at army barracks in Gombe, northeast Nigeria. This incident was the first in a wave of suicide attacks by women and girls in Nigeria. There were then six such attacks in six weeks. Since November there have been several attacks by female suicide bombers each month. In total, 27 women and girls have reportedly been involved in suicide attacks in the country. In 2014, Nigeria saw around 85 percent of all female suicide bombings around the world. The group has increased the number of suicide attacks over the last year, particularly those involving girls and women. Recently girls as young as 10 have been used to carry explosives which were then detonated in busy markets and bus stations. It is unclear whether the girls detonate explosions themselves or whether the bombs are controlled remotely. President Goodluck Jonathan last week condemned Boko Haram for choosing soft targets and said the series of bombings are a response to the Nigerian military's recent success in seizing back towns that had been in the hands of the extremists for months. The group has threatened to disrupt Nigeria's March 28 presidential and legislative elections, saying democracy 'is a corrupt Western concept'. Several thousand people took to the streets of Cameroon's capital yesterday to denounce Boko Haram's bloody insurgency and to call for the killing of the group's leader Abubakar Shekau. Several thousand people protested in Yaounde, Cameroon to denounce Boko Haram's bloody insurgency . Cameroonian people gather to protest against Boko Haram in Yaounde, Cameroon, yesterday .

The march in Yaounde was aimed at informing the public, especially in the southern regions, about the threat posed by Boko Haram, which has carried out regular cross-border raids in the far north . 'This march symbolises Cameroon's unity against Boko Haram,' the country's Labour Minister Gregoire Owona told marchers in Yaounde, before shouting 'Shekau!' In response, the crowd of 15,000, chanted: 'You are dead, you are a coward.' Over the past seven months Cameroonian soldiers have been battling the Nigerian Islamists, which are now locked in a regional fight that also includes soldiers from Nigeria and Chad. Boko Haram's six-year insurgency, which has left 13,000 dead and forced over a million from their homes, has increasingly spilled over into neighbouring nations. Several ministers led the vocal, but peaceful march, which saw protesters waving the flags of Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria.","Teenage girl was clubbed to death and set on fire by an angry mob .

"These kaleidoscopic photographs show the inside of the colourful Crayola factory which produces around 12million crayons every day. Photographer Bryan Derballa, 32, captured the incredible crayon-making process during a visit to the factory in Easton, Pennsylvania. Crayola, which was founded in 1885, uses a complicated production line to make the iconic colouring sticks. Mr Derballa's pictures provide a fascinating glimpse into the creation of the crayons which certainly take many of us back to our childhoods. Scroll down for video .

'That doesn't even include the storage and shipping departments that we saw but didn't really cover. His pictures show a silo, which contains 100,000lbs of uncoloured paraffin wax and is heated and moved to mixing kettles. Powdered pigment is then added to create a colour. The coloured liquid is then pumped into a water-cooled mould, before it is ejected through crayon-shaped cavities and sent for labelling.

"The head of the Catholic church in England today said he was 'dismayed' that immigration is a major concern for voters ahead of the general election. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' without immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution'. David Cameron's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was left in tatters last week when it emerged the figure reached almost 300,000 in the year to September. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' with immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution' Mr Cameron has admitted that his failure to fulfil his pledge has fuelled public concern about the numbers of people moving to the UK. In a letter sent to Catholic churches across the country, the Church's bishops warn: 'There is a great danger of blaming immigrants for the ills of society.' Cardinal Nichols told BBC One's Andrew Marr show that 'every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration'. 'No government in the last three decades has solved the problem of immigration, so it is a really difficult issue.' Asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election, he replied: 'Well I am because I do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us? 'Do we see ourselves genuinely as a player, as a contributor wanting to build something that is better for everybody?' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Mr Cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue . Polling data shows the level of public concern about immigration is higher when the numbers coming to Britain have risen. Cardinal Nichols added: 'What I want to keep saying is these are people we're talking about – the people who drown in the Mediterranean trying to get into Europe, the people who are caged in Calais because they're desperate. 'We have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city, for example, would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who've come to this country. Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach . 'The vast majority of immigrants come here and work hard and make a very positive contribution. That's the tone in which we should be having this debate.' A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months. Of these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on year, after work restrictions were lifted in January 2014. Despite the humiliation of his broken promise, the Prime Minister has vowed to stick to his target of cutting net migration below 100,000. Mr Cameron said last month: 'Back in the 1980s when we had an open economy, we had migration in the tens of thousands, and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country.' He added: 'I believe that we would be a better, stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' Today Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach. The shadow home secretary said her party would focus on illegal immigration and short term student visas in an effort to bring net migration down. Asked whether immigration was too high, Ms Cooper told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'Yes and we have said that before and we would like to see it come down.' Pressed on whether Labour would set a target for net migration, she said: 'He (Mr Cameron) failed in that approach. 'I think that is the wrong approach to take because what he's done is he set a target for net migration, he said no ifs no buts he was going to meet it, and in fact the actual level is three times the target that he set. 'And also a net migration target puts all immigration in together, so it treats students, alongside people coming to work alongside people who are looking for work alongside people who might have come for family reasons, alongside refugees. 'It puts all of those different kinds of immigration together. I think that is the wrong approach.'","Letter to 500,000 parishes warns of blaming immigrants for ills of society .

"As fans continue to mourn the passing of their favorite Vulcan, Leonard Nimoy's passion  for photography - and the women he put in front of the lens - is also being recognized. Nimoy, called the 'Conscience of Star Trek' by the show's creator, once said he used photography to express the idea of feminine power. After eight years of taking photographs of plus-sized women, Nimoy published a collection titled The Full Body Project in 2007, which featured obese women photographed in the nude. It was when Nimoy was doing an exhibit for a different photography collection that he was turned to the idea of shooting fuller-figured women. After eight years of taking photographs of plus-sized women, Leonard Nimoy published a collection titled The Full Body Project in 2007, which featured obese women photographed in the nude . For The Full Body Project, Nimoy found new subjects in the plus-size burlesque group The Fat-Bottom Revue . He was inspired by their late founder Heather MacAllister, who he recalled once told him 'whenever a fat person steps on stage to perform, and it's not the butt of a joke, that's a political statement' He said a 250-pound woman approached him after a presentation and told Nimoy he only worked with models that had a certain body type, according to the New York Times. She then asked Nimoy if he would be interested in working with her despite her different shape, and he said yes. Nimoy was nervous the day of the shoot, afraid he wouldn't do his new subject justice, he told NPR. 'I think that's a reflection of something that's prevalent in our culture,' he said. 'We are sort of conditioned to see a different body type as acceptable and maybe look away when the other body type arrives.' But Nimoy did not look away, instead he pointed his camera right at her. And his pictures immediately sparked an interest and a response from the public. And a new passion had sparked inside Nimoy. The pictures feature the women dancing, laughing and proudly staring straight into the camera. Nimoy said the pictures show the women's strong self-esteem . 'These women are projecting an image that is their own,' he said. 'And one that also stems from their own story rather than mine' For The Full Body Project, Nimoy found new subjects in the plus-size burlesque group The Fat-Bottom Revue. He was inspired by their late founder Heather MacAllister, who he recalled once told him 'whenever a fat person steps on stage to perform, and it's not the butt of a joke, that's a political statement'. And with that Nimoy became an unlikely, but passionate, size-acceptance advocate. He told the New York Times the book was a 'direct response to the pressure women face to conform to a size two'. The pictures feature the women dancing, laughing and proudly staring straight into the camera - often times fully nude. Nimoy said the pictures show the women's strong self-esteem, he wrote for R.Michelson Galleries, where the pictures were featured in. 'These women are projecting an image that is their own,' he said. 'And one that also stems from their own story rather than mine.' It wasn't a far step for Nimoy, who has a history of championing women.

Nimoy said the book was a 'direct response to the pressure women face to conform to a size two' In the 1960s while he was filming Star Trek, Nimoy found out that Nichelle Nichols was not getting paid the same amount as her male co-stars. Nimoy approached the managers of the show and immediately had her pay equalized, he confirmed to TrekMovie.com . And in the 1970s he fought for Nichols again, telling producers he refused to do Spock's voice in the animated Star Trek series if Nichols, who had yet to receive the offer, was hired as well. Tributes to the star have been pouring in since news broke he had died on Friday morning following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His Star Trek co-star William Shatner, who has recently come under fire for missing Nimoy's funeral to attend a charity event, said: 'I loved him like a brother. 'We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.'","Nimoy's collection The Full Body Project from 2007 featured obese women photographed in the nude .

"Police say a 21-year-old man suspected of participating in an illegal street race that killed two spectators in Southern California has been booked on suspicion of murder. Henry Gevorgyan turned himself in on Saturday night accompanied by his lawyer. Jail records show he’s being held on $2 million bail. The Los Angeles Police Department said Gevorgyan fled the scene of the deadly accident in the San Fernando Valley last week. Authorities said he was driving a souped-up Ford Mustang that veered out of control and crashed into a crowd on the sidewalk. Henry Gevorgyan, 21, turned himself into the Los Angeles police after they suspected him of driving his Mustang into a crowd of onlookers, allegedly killing two . A souped-up car that was illegally street racing lost control and veered on to a sidewalk, killing two spectators and critically injuring another before the driver ran away at about 2.15am on Thursday, police said . Two cars were reportedly involved in the accident, police said. This is one of the two cars that was crushed after the planned early-morning race . Spectators Eric Siguenza, 26, and Wilson Wong, 50, were killed, according to ABC 7. A third man was hospitalized with serious injuries. Police said Gevorgyan could face murder charges. 'We are pursuing murder charges against the driver of one of the vehicles and continue to investigate the role and responsibility of the other,' McMahon told the Los Angeles Daily News on Thursday. The motorist of a second vehicle also allegedly fled the scene. Police did not have immediate information as to whether the driver had been identified or apprehended, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The street where the incident happened, in a commercial and office area that is mainly deserted after dark, has long been the scene for illegal nighttime street races. City Councilman Mitch Englander told the Daily News that he'll introduce an ordinance allowing police to seize cars involved in street racing or reckless driving resulting in serious injury or death. McMahon told CNN that people should be aware that street racing is a dangerous activity. 'Many view this as an entertainment, glamorous activity. I think it's important for the public to know that this is illegal, dangerous and an all too deadly activity,' he said.

"The NHS has been forced to ask British doctors in Australia to come home due to a major shortfall in numbers. Around 1,000 more GPs are urgently needed in England, according to new figures released by the House of Commons library. It is thought that nearly 1,500 doctors - who cost the taxpayer up to £610,000 to train - move to Australia every year. To bridge the gap they have been offered a place on a 'fully funded' programme, which they can choose to be either full or part time, if they return. Around 1,000 more GPs are needed in England. An advert has been placed in two medical magazines asking doctors in Australia to come home to bridge the gap (stock picture) An advert was placed in the Australian Doctor and the Medical Observer by NHS England's Shropshire and Staffordshire area team and Health Education Midlands earlier this month. It said: 'This scheme will help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return, or start to practise in the UK. 'It's fully funded, so you will be supported whilst you complete the programme.' The NHS has simultaneously announced a £10million strategy to further tempt graduates and experienced medical staff. Under a quarter of trainees chose to go into general practice last year - with just over 5,000 applicants in total. But cash will now be offered if they work in an under-staffed area for three years. Andy Burnham (above), shadow minister for health, said the figures prove the NHS is suffering from a GP recruitment crisis . Andy Burnham, shadow minister for health, said the figures prove the NHS is suffering from a GP recruitment crisis. 'GP services have gone into freefall under this government. David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS, but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis,' he told the Observer. But GP leaders have said that the advertisements will not  solve the staffing crisis. Dr Ken Deacon, medical director of the North Midlands at NHS England, said that the problem was newly qualified GPs being outnumbered by those nearing retirement. The advert promised doctors currently working in Australia (Sydney Opera House above) that the scheme would 'help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return' A female-heavy workforce has also been blamed for the gap. The 'feminisation' of surgeries has led to the UK needing more trainees because women are more likely to work shorter hours than men, a report released by the Migration Advisory Committee last week claimed. This has contributed to an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs, the committee warned. It suggested that more needed to be done to recruit family doctors - including hiring extra foreign doctors from across the EU. A spokesperson for NHS England said that the central team had not previously been aware of the advertisement, but described it as a ‘positive scheme’.","Advert placed in two magazines promises 'fully funded' scheme on return .

"Two New Jersey drug addicts who were arrested last year after the woman's baby nearly died after eating heroin have avoided prison time. Mark Tomat, 26, this week admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff on Valentine's Day 2014. Last month, Bradbury - who comes from an upper-middle class New Jersey community - gave birth to a second child while she was being treated at an intensive program - to ensure she didn't take any more drugs to harm her unborn son. Mark Tomat, 26, admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff last February. Bradbury's nine-month-old baby accidentally ingested the drug . Tomat said he left the narcotic lying around the house and learned Bradbury's baby had ingested the drug about an hour after he left  that night. Police found text messages between the two in which they talked about a plan to deny that they knew the baby had eaten heroin - so as not to incriminate themselves. Paramedics responding to a 911 call found the infant unresponsive and with a bruised forehead. The baby recovered after it was administered Narcan, an antidote for heroin overdose. Bradbury, who is from the upper-middle-class community Indian Hills, was sentenced to drug court, which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment in an intensely supervised drug treatment program. On February 27 she delivered the couple's first child together - her second. Bradbury voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date, according to her attorney Joseph Rem. Bradbury, pictured here in 2013, was sentenced to drug court,which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment while being supervised and randomly drug tested. She recently delivered her first child with Tomat . Bradbury, pictured in 2013, voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date . Her stay would also protect Bradbury from doing anything that could potentially hurt the fetus, Rem told the Cliffview Pilot. Tomat will be sentenced to probation in exchange for his plea. His attorney Warren Sutnick said Tomat has made 'enormous strides' since the incident and that he believes his client will be 'very successful'. When Wyckoff Police Department officers searched Bradbury's home last year, they discovered Suboxone, which is used to treat narcotic addiction, and other drug paraphernalia, according to prosecutor John L. Molinelli. Molinelli said investigators also found deleted text messages from Bradbury and Tomat's cell phones in which the couple allegedly planned to deny that they knew the baby had ingested heroin. The infant is now in the care of relatives. Bradbury's attorney said her stay would also protect Bradbury from doing anything that could potentially hurt the fetus .

"A luxury private jet that used to belong to Osama bin Laden's family has been impounded by police in Florida amid accusations of theft and fraud. The 22-seater Gulfstream II plane, valued at $4.5million, is stuck on the tarmac at Miami Executive airport while its new owners do battle in court. Jose Avelino Goncalves, 49, a Venezuelan, has been accused making off with the plane after holding back more than $3million of what he agreed to pay a business partner for it. Bin grounded: This plane, which used to belong to Osama bin Laden's family, has been grounded in Miami amid a legal dispute between subsequent owners . Suspect: Jose Goncalves, 45, is accused of agreeing to buy the plane then not paying up. It was owned by the family of Osama bin Laden (right) until 1980 . Officers in Miami-Dade county have taken custody of the corporate vehicle, the Miami Herald reported. The Gulfstream II is a staple of international luxury travel, which rich businessmen often kit out with lavish interiors. Ownership records show that the plane belonged to the billionaire Bin Laden clan until 1980. At that point, Osama is thought to have just graduated from university in Saudi Arabia, and was still years away from founding al-Qaeda. His elder half-brother, Salem bin Laden, was then head of the family, which made its fortune from oil. It has changed owners more than a dozen times since then - complicated by the fact that foreigners are not allowed to own U.S. planes directly, so often register them under companies. The jet was recently owned by Luis Enrique Nuñez-Villanueva, a former business partner of Goncalves, who is now suing him over it. State prosecutors, who are also trying Goncalves on fraud and theft charges, say he agreed to buy the plane from Nuñez-Villanueva for $4.5million. Goncalves allegedly agreed to pay $1.5million up-front for it, and make monthly payments of $500,000 until the balance was covered. But it is claimed he only ever paid $829,196. Goncalves's lawyers, however, have characterized the spat as a 'misunderstanding' and say Nuñez- Villanueva took the $829,196 unlawfully to buy himself a helicopter. Goncalves is being held in Miami on a $4.5million bond during the trial, as prosecutors fear he could flee the country is left to go free. He is also wanted in Venezuela.","The 22-seater Gulfstream II luxury jet being held at Miami Executive airport .

"The mother of a Down Syndrome child who she was accused of abandoning by the father of the baby has reconciled with her estranged husband. Samuel Forrest, from New Zealand, made international headlines in February after he started fundraising to help raise baby Leo. Mr Forrest's Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan filed for divorce a week after Leo was born in her home country - where a disability like Down Syndrome is considered shameful - on January 21. Scroll down for video . New Zealand's Samuel Forrest and his Armenia wife, Ruzan Badalyan, have reportedly reconciled . The story of Mr Forrest, Ms Badalyan and their son, Leo, has made international headlines after it emerged she filed for divorce a week after the birth of the baby who has Down Syndrome . So far, the Bring Leo Home campaign has raised more than $600,000 after celebrities such as U.S. actor Ashton Kutcher lent his fame to the single dad's cause. In a new twist in the story, it has now emerged Ms Badalyan is applying for permanent residency in New Zealand to give her relationship with Mr Forrest another shot, stuff.co.nz reported. The couple - who are not officially divorced under Armenian law - have their sights sets on moving to Auckland with Leo. 'They want to raise him in New Zealand but it all depends on whether New Zealand Immigration will find it legitimate,' a person close to the couple told the New Zealand news website. 'Despite all the negative media and emotional struggle, she wanted to go against the cultural norm and embrace the son. But there is a lot of money involved now.' Since the story of baby Leo emerged, Ms Badalyan has faced harsh criticisms from the public who have slammed her for abandoning her Down Syndrome child. Mr Forrest took up fundraising to try and get his son to New Zealand, and so far the campaign has raised more than $600,000 . In the weeks following the intense media scrutiny, Mr Forrest has come to her defence, saying she is one of the 'victims of the social norms in Armenia'. The couple had been married for 18 months . At the time, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because in her culture a child with a condition like Leo's brings shame on the entire family. Neither Mr Forrest nor New Zealand's Department of Immigration were unable to confirm to stuff.co.nz that Ms Badalyan was seeking residency. When the NZ news outlet spoke to Mr Forrest, he did not want to talk about he and his wife reunited. He said he was 'focussing my efforts on giving my son Leo the best chance possible at life'. Mr Forrest requested privacy and did not wish to comment further on the matter. In Armenian culture, Leo's condition is thought to bring shame to the family . Ms Badalyan's abandonment of her child has drawn worldwide criticism and backlash . It is now thought she is applying for residency in New Zealand, where her husband was born . Earlier this month, it was also revealed Mr Forrest was part of religious group, the Exclusive Brethren, while he was married to his first wife, Kylie Forrest. He claimed he was then ex-communicated from the church and banned from seeing his four children with Ms Forrest. Reports claimed one of these children had Down Syndrome as well. But Ms Forrest has since come out and denied these allegations, saying their youngest child had suffered complications due to a premature birth, the New Zealand Herald reported. A former neighbour said Mr Forrest, who is still in Armenia, had also been fined $530 for assaulting his first father-in-law. It has also emerged Ms Badalyan's husband also has four other children from his first marriage .

"This is the heartbreaking moment a father cradled his newborn quadruplets in his arms - just hours after his wife died giving birth to them. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 15. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 15. Their mother would never get to meet them . The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss. Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms. Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through. 'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.' In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met. 'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.' He then gave her his phone number, only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out. Loving father: The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later . However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away. They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high. Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said 'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.' 'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up. A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead. Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone. 'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.' The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. Paisley and Erica are still in the hospital where Mr Morales goes every day, while his mother-in-law cares for Carlos Jr. and Tracey at home. Heartbreaking: Mr Morales and his wife (pictured during pregnancy) started discussing names before she went into labor. She then told they would decide after they were born . During his visits he is taking classes to make sure he gives his children the best care possible. He told the magazine 'I'm learning everything from how to give them a bath, CPR, feeding, and how to manage their sleep schedule. I need to be prepared.' When he was looking on his wife's iPad, Mr Morales found a note she had written. It described how she wanted her children to go to college, speak both Spanish and English, and get good jobs. Since Mrs Morales' death, family, friends and strangers have clubbed together to support the widower, who faces bringing the children up on his own. A GoFundMe page set up by Nicole Todman as raised alomost $250,000. Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90. On that day she wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late. 'He will keep me and he ordered some labs. 'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. 'He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure. I'm sure I won't but he looking at how to finish things.'

"One has straight ginger hair, a fair complexion and deep blue eyes. The other has masses of curls, far darker skin and her eyes are a sparkling brown. With such opposing looks it’s hard to believe this striking pair are sisters. But they are much more than that – they are twins. The girls were born with radically different colouring thanks to a quirk of their mixed-race parentage. Scroll down for video . Same same, but different:  Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . Lucy and Maria Aylmer’s mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. The girls were born in January 1997. Their mother was astonished when she first saw the twins, as nothing on the scans had prepared her for their different skin tones. Fair-haired Lucy, who lives with her family in Gloucester, said: ‘It was such a shock for her because things like skin colour don’t show up on scans before birth. 'So she had no idea that we were so different. When the midwife handed us both to her she was just speechless.’ Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester, were born in January 1997 . Different strokes:  'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy' Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy said: ‘Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls’ half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. ‘But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.’ She added: ‘No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don’t look like sisters, let alone twins. Friends have even made us produce our birth certificates to prove it.’ Certainly at school there were no problems mistaking the twins for one another – and no way of playing tricks to confuse their classmates. Lucy said: ‘We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. ‘Most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we couldn’t look more different if we tried. We don’t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.’ The twins’ interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: ‘Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and I’m very proud of having a black twin.’","Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .

"Aston Martin will lead the British supercar charge at the Geneva Motor Show next week — just in time for the new UK '15' plate change. If you have a spare £1.8million tucked away, then the Vulcan, a storming two-seater 'hypercar', could be just the job to blow it on. And you'll even get special lessons on how to drive it from a professional racer at a bespoke track day. The new two-seater 'hypercar', the Aston Martin Vulcan (pictured), will set you back  £1.8million . The name smacks of Star Trek and the delta-winged bomber that once carried Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent. Indeed Aston Martin's HQ at Gaydon, Warwickshire, was formerly an RAF V-bomber base. Just 24 Vulcans will be built, each exclusively for track use. Powered by a massive sevenlitre, V12 engine tweaked to produce 800bhp — equivalent to eight Ford Fiestas — expect a top speed in excess of 200mph and 0-60mph in three seconds. Aston Martin says it is 'almost infinitely flexible' in terms of colour and trim options. The car will be sold through the firm's VIP sales programme and Q by Aston Martin bespoke personalisation service. Chief executive Dr Andy Palmer says: 'The Vulcan is a rare and thrilling supercar. We have already received strong interest from customers.' ? McLaren's Geneva debut will be its new 675LT variant — a more powerful version of the 650S. The 666 bhp, twin turbo, V8-engined supercar, which accelerates from rest to 62mph in less than three seconds, will have a price tag of around £260,000. A long-lost TV interview with Soviet spy Guy Burgess, which emerged this week, yields a hitherto unknown and fascinating fact about this louche member of the Cambridge Circle of British traitors, which includes Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt. Exiled in Moscow after his flight from Britain, Burgess talks about his passion for cars, and subscribing to Autocar magazine since the age of nine — even while in Russia. His choice of car? Any colour as long as it's red, no doubt. The '15' plate, out tomorrow, is predicted to be good news for the ordinary car buyer, with discounts of up to a third being predicted. Traditionally, March is the month with most car sales, with around one in five new registrations. Manufacturers and industry experts are predicting lots of bargains. Motoring website HonestJohn.co.uk says consumers could save thousands as the cost of a new car falls to a four-year low spurred by lower finance, petrol and insurance costs. Typical interest rates for car finance have dropped by more than 3 per cent over the past four years, deals from High Street lenders have increased dramatically and the cost of borrowing is at an historic low, with the base rate of 0.5 per cent filtering down to car buyers. Daniel Powell, managing editor of HonestJohn, says: 'March is the best time to buy a new car. But consumers should shop around for the best deals. 'Some dealers will offer as much as 30 per cent off list prices.' Highlights include new models from Ford, Skoda and Volkswagen. This month will also see sales of sports utility vehicles boom with the new Fiat 500X, Land Rover Discovery Sport and Honda CR-V making their debuts. BMW's stunning i8 plug-in hybrid sports car has been crowned UK Car of the Year for 2015. The nearest challenger was the Citroen C4 Cactus, followed by the Renault Twingo in third. Competition organiser John Challen says: 'The automotive industry has seen many hybrid models in recent years, but nothing quite like the i8. 'The term game-changer is sometimes over-used when talking about new cars, but in the case of the i8, is totally justified.' A sleek new 200mph baby Bentley fit for a 21st-century James Bond is roaring this way. The wraps are set to come off the company's two-seater Aston Martin rival on Monday on the eve of next week's Geneva Motor Show. But details of the top-secret prototype coupe — with an estimated £130,000 price tag when it goes on sale within three years — have been leaked out. Bosses believe it's just the job to tempt 007 to defect from his five decade big-screen affair with Aston Martin — and go back to his first love from the original Ian Fleming books, in which he drove a supercharged 'blowers' Bentley. Motoring magazine Autocar has produced images of how the Crewe-built car will look. The sleek new 200mph Bentley coupe is on its way. Motoring magazine Autocar has produced images of how the Crewe-built car will look (pictured) It comes as Bentley also prepares to launch its first 4x4 SUV, the Bentayga. Autocar editor-in-chief Steve Cropley says in the latest edition of the world's longest-running motoring magazine that Bentley is out to 'steal Aston Martin's lunch'. The new car is likely to be powered initially by a specially tweaked 500bhp, four-litre, twinturbo, V8 engine introduced recently into other Bentley models. But higher-powered options are likely to match the 200mph top speed of other cars in the firm's range. Bentley sales director Kevin Rose says: 'The advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against Aston Martin or Maserati.'","The new two-seater Aston Martin Vulcan will set you back £1.8million .

"Grim details have emerged about how death row inmates are executed by firing squad at Indonesia's 'Death Island' of Nusa Kambangan. The revelations paint a vivid picture of the likely fate of Australian convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are due at any time to be sent to the island to be executed along with nine others. Four of the most recently executed prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres. A fifth inmate, an Indonesian woman, opted not to be attached to a board as she was 'ready' to die, News Corp reported. Scroll down for video . Grim details have emerged about how death row inmates are executed by firing squad at Indonesia's 'Death Island' of Nusa Kambangan . Four of the most recently executed prisoner were strapped to wooden planks with rubber that is used to make the inside of car tyres . Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo and Malawi's Namaona Denis were all put on hardwood teak planks, which were two metres tall and 40 centimetres wide. The planks were not fixed to the ground so the prisoners could move around or fall when they were shot. Indonesia's Rani Adriani was the quickest one to die when she was shot on 'Death Island'. She was declared dead by the medical examiner after six minutes compared to the others who took a lot longer to die when they were shot on the left side of their chest, according to an unnamed source. The 38-year-old forewent all options that were given to her fellow inmates - including wearing a hood, cuffing their hands and binding their legs together. Her Muslic cleric, Ustad Hasan Makarim, told News Corp Adriani - who was convicted of smuggling 3.5kg of heroin in 2000 - was 'mentally strong' and had resigned herself to death. Indonesian special police hold a drill ahead of a planned transfer of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from Kerobokan Prison to Nusakambangan Prison . Indonesian authorities put on a show of force in Bali on Friday, demonstrating how the Australian drug smugglers will be taken from Kerobokan jail to the penal island Nusakambangan . 'On the day she died, she was ready. She had given herself to God,' he said. Vietnamese woman Tran Bich Hanh was also executed on the same day as the five others but her death happened elsewhere in central Java. She was granted her last wish not to be handcuffed when she was shot dead. These details come after it emerged more than 20 heavily-armed officers will escort the handcuffed Australian Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan on to the military plane that takes them to their execution. Indonesian authorities put on a show of force in Bali last month, demonstrating how the convicted drug smugglers would be taken from Kerobokan jail to Nusa Kambangan. Police mobile brigade (Brimob) commander Rudy Harianto, who invited the media to a simulation of their transfer from jail to the airport in armoured vehicles, told The Sydney Morning Herald they 'are ready at any given time' and is confident that prisoners 'will not be able to escape'.

A Brimob water cannon is on stand-by and the military has Sukhoi jets available to escort the plane in flight. Central Java Provincial Law and Human Rights Office head Mirza Zulkarnaen said new isolation cells were now ready, although other arrangements were not complete. Authorities plan to hold the Australians and eight others in Besi prison before they meet their end in front of a firing squad. Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not named all 10 prisoners to face the firing squad, but 10 drug offenders are on death row, with the confirmation that another Nigerian man, Okwudili Oyatanze, has been denied presidential clemency.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to Mr Joko by phone last Wednesday night regarding the condemned Australians, and described the conversation as positive. Mr Joko has also spoken with leaders of France, Brazil and the Netherlands about their citizens facing the death penalty, but has maintained his country has a sovereign right to carry out its laws. Jakarta responded hotly earlier this month when Mr Abbott brought up the $1 billion donation Australia made following the 2004 tsunami. Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have urged Indonesia to look at their clients' cases without the distractions of arguments about sovereignty. They plan a legal appeal and argue it would be unjust to execute them in the meantime.","In January, doomed inmates were strapped to two-metre hardwood planks .

"Budget supermarket chain Aldi is stepping it up a notch by launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear. The company reckons its £80 jacket and £60 trousers, made from 'high-standard' textile designed to protect against abrasion, are the cheapest in Britain. And they are certainly a bargain compared to the prices of brand leader Weise Avance, whose motorcycle jacket and jeans retail for £1,219.98 altogether - the jacket for £639.99 and trousers for £579.99. Aldi is launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear, with this whole outfit costing just £180 . The range of clothes that includes a trousers, boots for £29.99, motorcycle tank bags at a bargain £12.99 and gloves at £19.99,  is sure to be snapped up in minutes when it's released on March 8. The store will also sell thermal under layers including a long-sleeved top and long johns. And not only are the clothes a much more affordable option for motorbiking enthusiasts, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. The pass zone for the Level 2 impact abrasion test is seven seconds of abrasion resistance in body zones 1 and 2, which include the shoulders and elbows. Aldi's jacket and trousers exceed these requirements, achieving over 13 seconds of abrasion resistance across all four zones of the garment. John Chatterton-Ross, of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), the governing body for motorcycle racing, said: 'This is the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices. Not only are the clothes an affordable option, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. Pictured: High-standard textile jacket, £80 . 'The protection offered by Aldi's products exceeds the requirements for impact abrasion and impact cut resistance demanded by the European standard for zones 1 and 2 in all zones. 'Few products on the market can match this. Often, even in premium brands, it is only the protectors that are certified, not the rest of the garment. 'It is great to see that with Aldi's motorcycling jacket and trousers, safety does not have to come with a high price tag.' The motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from Equestrian and fishing gear, to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories. And just last June, the chain even brought the world's most expensive beef, Wagyu, to its aisles at £6.99 for a sirloin steak. John Chatterton-Ross, of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme it's 'the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices.' Pictured: Gloves, £19.99 . Tony Baines of Aldi said of the new range: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone'. Pictured: Touring boots, £29.99 . Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo - putting it out of reach for most families. The move to offer luxury food and clothing at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the 'big four' - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Tony Baines of Aldi said: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone - giving our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality. 'The motorcycling range is of no exception and we're proud of the level of safety we've achieved at this unbeatable price point.'","Aldi is launching super-cheap line of motorcycle gear on 8 March .

But big sister Sarah Wheeler promised she would do 'everything in her power' to make Susan a mother. Susan Hughes (left) who was born without a uterus, has become a mother for the first time to baby Dougie (pictured centre with Susan's husband Mike) after her sister Sarah Wheeler (right) agreed to carry her children . And just 15 months ago, Sarah, now 38, gave birth to her nephew Dougie with Susan the first person to hold her newborn son. Susan, 33, and her husband Mike, 36, said they were ecstatic to finally be able to complete their family and would be forever grateful for her sister's precious gift. 'Big sisters are supposed to look after their younger siblings, but mine went above and beyond,' said the new mother, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire.

"Actor Vince Vaughn and pop star Lady Gaga mustered up the courage to dive into freezing cold water for the Special Olympics charity the day after cities across the country broke cold records for last month. The Chicago-native Wedding Crashers star was the celebrity guest of honor at his hometown's annual Polar Plunge, in which brave swimmers raise money for athletes with special needs by plunging into Lake Michigan. Vaughn, wearing a Blackhawks hockey jersey and jeans, led the way into a patch of frigid, slushy 33 degree water near Lincoln Park that had been cleared of snow, which has accumulated in the city and much of the US. Scroll down for videos . Icy dip: Actor Vince Vaughn was the Special Olympic Polar Plunge celebrity guest on Sunday, when the water was right around the freezing point . Hometown hero: Vaughn, a Chicago native, wore a jersey from the city's Blackhawks hockey team and jeans to take the icy dip and warmed up with a towel after the trying ordeal . Taking the plunge: Lady Gaga joined her new fiance, Chicago Fire actor Taylor Kinney, at the event with his co-stars on the show . Poker face: Celebrities such as Vince Vaughn and Lady Gaga found it difficult not to grimace in the freezing patch of Lake Michigan . The star of upcoming movie Unfinished Business  first went in up to his knees before lowering himself into the water backwards. Gaga attended the event with shirtless fiance Taylor Kinney, who was wearing a baseball cap and shorts, and his costars from the show Chicago Fire. The singer rode piggyback-style with Kinney into the water before they fully immersed themselves into the lake. The couple then played with each other in the frozen surf and retreated to the warmth of the shore. 'Taylor gave me his hat I thought my wig was gonna freeze into and become one with the lake,' said the songstress, who will take different sort of plunge with her beau after becoming engaged last month.. Lake Michigan was estimated to be right at freezing when the event began at 10.30am Central Time. Staying warm with love: Lady Gaga attended the charity event with her fiance after getting engaged to the television actor last month . Before and after: Gaga and Kinney looked comfortable while posing for photos (left) before their plunge left them in varied states of bedraggled . California love: A shirtless Kinney wore a baseball cap reminiscent of the warm-weather West Coast when he carried his future wife into the waters of Lake Michigan . Splashing in the snow: Gaga grits her teeth as she finds the energy to play in the lake despite a winter of record-breaking cold weather . Paparazzi: Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, lost the glamour she often displays on stage and the red carpet when emerging from Lake Michigan . Organizers say that 5,000 people were expected to attend the plunge, and that they had already made more than $1million during the morning, according to ABC7. The plunge came at the end of a February that had seen cold records shattered across much of the US, which has seen snow in almost every state this winter. Chicago, which has seen weeks of freezing temperatures in the past month, tied a 140-year-old record for its coldest February with an average temperature of 14.6. Temperatures at O'Hare Airport hit minus 10 degrees Saturday morning, according to the Chicago Tribune. Mission accomplished: Special Olympics Chicago's annual Polar Plunge event regularly raises more than $1million for special needs athletes . The Fame: The event draws thousands of participants and spectators to the water each year along with celebrities such as Gaga. Above, the singer poses with a fan on the beach . Fire and ice: The Chicago Fire Department had to clear snow and ice from a patch of water for the Special Olympics plungers to wade into . The Windy City also received a combined 27 inches of snow in February, the city's third highest level ever for the month. New York City had its coldest February in 81 years with an average of 19.9. The last time February was this cold in the metropolis was 1934, according to The New York Times. That month it averaged 19.9 and saw a reading of 15 degrees below zero on February 9, the coldest day ever seen in the city. The only other February on record that was cold than this past month was in 1885 - when the average daily temperature was 22.7 degrees . Coast Guard icebreakers are being used to break up East Coast rivers such as the Hudson and Delaware. Cities in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Maine also broke records for their coldest Februaries. And meteorologists say that the winter weather isn't quite over yet. Many already knew in their bones it was true - but official figures have now confirmed that for some parts of the country, February was the coldest month in history. In New York, the cities of Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton and Ithaca all scored their lowest ever averages in more than a lifetime. In Buffalo the February average was 10.9°F, beating the 1934 record of 11.4°F. Syracuse was colder still, with an average of just 9°F. Hartford, Connecitcut, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Portland, Maine also set records. Caribou in Maine had an average of just 2.5°F. While Boston has been colder in February before, it has never been snowier. Its 64.8 inches in February smashed the old record of 41.6. If it managers just another 5.6 inches, the winter will officially be the snowiest ever. Total snowfall for the season is way above normal across the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. As of Febreuary 26, Worcester, Massachusetts had 108.6 inches, compared to a normal snowfall of 49.9 inches. However, meteorologists at the Northeast Regional Climate Center said the record winter is just down to luck. One said: 'We can't point to anything specific... It's just the way the jet stream bulged and set up. It's random, like a deal of cards. Sometimes you're dealt a royal flush, sometimes you get nothing.' Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the ice on the Hudson River on Friday. The Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes during the long stretch of winter weather . Record-breaking: Ice chunks form underneath the snow-covered Brooklyn Bridge in New York City at the end of the coldest February in more than 80 years - and two more snow storms are expected to hit the region over the next few days . Texas has already seen six inches of snow as a result of the most recent storm, with Oklahoma - seven inches - and New Mexico - one foot - also receiving additional portions of the fluffy white stuff. Weather forecasters in Colorado issued blizzard and avalanche warnings as Pacific moisture continued to bring snow and strong winds to the Continental Divide on Sunday. The storm was expected to last through Monday, with another storm expected Tuesday. Snow, sleet and ice from Winter Storm Sparta spread  eastward across the Plains, Midwest and Northeast, and Illinois and Indiana each got 8 inches or more of snow Sunday. Heartland states have already seen tragic weather-related deaths and hospitalizations as cold continues to blow across the middle of the country. Two people were killed when a driver lost control on a snow-covered highway in Lebanon, Missouri, on Saturday when the car skidded into a tractor-trailer stopped because of an earlier crash on Interstate 44. In Nevada, Missouri, a boy died after falling through an ice-covered farm pond. Two other boys who fell in were able to be rescued. A 3-year-old Lansing, Michigan, girl was hospitalized in critical condition after getting stuck overnight outside her family's apartment during frigid weather that marked the end of one of the coldest Februaries on record in Michigan. Say it ain't snow: Winter Storm Sparta brought snow and freezing rain to the East Coast on Sunday after leaving a string of cold temperatures and weather-related deaths in the Midwest . Winter warmup: Temperatures on Monday are expected to rebound above freezing, with sunshine across most of the northern US . She was treated for hypothermia. The storm reached the East Coast on Sunday, with up to three inches of snow possible in New York. Winter storm warnings have been issued for Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia through Monday morning, with up to quarter-inch ice accumulations from northern Virginia through central New Jersey. After cold and snow that set February records, southern New England is entering March with another round that could push Boston over its 20-year-old snowfall record. With 102 inches, Boston needs 5.7 more to break the 1995-1996 record of 107.6. Snowfall of 4 to 6 inches was expected by early Monday across the area, with up to 8 inches in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 'We have come this far, we might as well break the record,' said William Babcock, National Weather Service meteorologist in the Taunton, Massachusetts office. 'We have a couple of storms to push us over the record. Once that is done we won't complain if we don't get any more snow.' Less snow is expected in northern Massachusetts and New York state, and on Cape Cod. Winter Storm Thor, which began forming in California on Saturday, is expected to follow Sparta across the continent, according to the Weather Channel. Thor's hammer: A winter storm named after the Norse god of thunder has begun forming in western states and will follow Sparta with more snow . Winter of two Americas: Climate figures showed that this winter has seen western states experience unseasonable warmth, while the east shivered.

"Suzette Davenport said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls, sending texts and checking emails while driving . DRIVERS who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads, Britain’s top traffic officer said yesterday. Suzette Davenport insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits. But she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in May’s election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day. The Gloucestershire chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving. The offence of using a hand-held mobile at the wheel currently attracts only a £100 fine with three penalty points. Miss Davenport said: ‘If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. ‘If we don’t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. 'I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn’t like my proposal.’ Asked why ministers had rejected her call, she told the BBC: ‘Probably timing’s not great. I don’t think it would be popular with lots of people. 'An election is not too far away so I’m sure they’re not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election.’ Miss Davenport, who speaks on road issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer. Her intervention follows the release of figures last week showing that mobile offending has risen despite numerous crackdowns. Robert Goodwill, Tory transport minister, rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009 . He insisted the Government was reviewing the introduction of a six-point penalty, two instances of which would trigger a ban. And he turned his fire on the police, saying chief constables were too quick to take the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers. ‘One of the reasons people do these things is because they think they can get away with it,’ he said. ‘It is important that police and crime commissioners and chief constables look at the resources they put into this as opposed to other more easy offences to detect like speeding where cameras can catch people on an industrial scale. ‘There is no point increasing the penalties if we are not actually catching people.’ Research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs. But the penalties are far lower – unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving. And official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices has fallen 26 per cent while offending – as observed in spot checks by transport officials – has risen 14 per cent since 2009. Edmund King of the AA said: ‘Basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys. ‘Most drivers would welcome harsher penalties but we still need the perceived risk of being caught to increase before more drivers hang up behind the wheel.’ The row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of ‘drug driving’ laws. Drivers face prosecution if they are caught exceeding new limits which have, for the first time, been laid down for eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs. The levels for the illegal drugs, which include heroin, cocaine and cannabis, virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers caught with these substances in their system. Police will be able to use ‘drugalysers’ to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside. Officers will also be able to test for these and other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check. Under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving, even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. If caught, a driver faces an automatic fixed penalty notice worth £100 and 3 penalty points on their licence. Only if it goes to court do they risk being disqualified, but the maximum fine is only £1,000. By comparison, drink-drivers face 6 months in jail, a fine of up to £5,000 fine and a driving ban for at least a year, rising to three years if convicted twice in a decade. The research revealed that using a handheld device is more distracting than alcohol or drugs, with drivers twice as likely to have their head down and eyes off the road while texting or using the internet. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009. Two thirds of those observed breaking the law (1.1 per cent) last year had the phone in their hand rather than held to their ear – suggesting that they were using it to text or check the internet. The figures prompted Mr Clegg to call for tougher penalties. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, he said: 'I just don’t think we should beat about the bush here. It might seem like someone, “Oh I’m going to make a quick call home saying I’m doing to be late because I’m stuck in traffic"". 'it is really dangerous. The evidence is overwhelming. You cannot call and devote the same attention as you should to keep yourself safe and others whilst driving a vehicle. 'That’s why in this government we’ve actually increased the penalty, we’ve dramatically increased the penalties, just I think a couple of years ago. 'I personally would be prepared to go further until we send out a clear and unambiguous message that this is dangerous and it should not be done.'","Suzette Davenport calls for prison terms for using a phone while driving .

"Orlando police used a department training exercise Friday to search for a mother of three who went missing the same day she appeared  in an episode of The People's Court in 2011. Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando was last seen November 17 dropping her three-year-old twins off at the home of ex-fiancé Dale Smith, whose legal quarrel over a $5,000 engagement ring featured in an episode of the show recorded earlier that year. WOFL reported about 100 officers searched an area of Belle Isle about two miles south of Orlando International Airport without finding any trace of Parker, whose cell phone last pinged nearby. Disappeared: Michelle Parker (left), who disappeared in 2011 at age 33, was seen the same day on an episode of The People's Court, where she was sued by ex-fiance Dale Smith (right) over a $5000 engagement ring . Police have searched the area before, and though the three-hour investigation of the grounds did not turn up any new evidence, it was heartening for Parker's parents. 'I don’t like it. It makes me angry that we have to go through this all the type because it’s really painful and hard but I’m happy,' Parker's mother Yvonne Stewart said according to News 13. Parker's Hummer had been found the day after she disappeared at an apartment complex in Orlando with the decals for her tanning business peeled from the windows. Her family has continuously pushed for answers about her disappearance. 'It's agony not knowing what happened to your child,' Stewart told ABC. 'They thought they should go back and take a look at these woods.' Stewart says authorities told her one piece of evidence police hoped to find was the missing decal that might have been taken from the Hummer. Training exercise: Police searched a wooded area near the Orlando International Airport for any clues as to the disappearance of Parker . Investigation continues: Though the family still harbors hope that authorities will uncover new evidence about Parker's disappearance, the case has cooled over the past few years . No leads: Smith, pictured during the show, is the only person of interest in his ex-fiancee's disappearance, but has never been charged . Distraught: Parker's mother and other family members have pushed hard for investigations to continue in spite of little evidence noting Parker's whereabouts . 'I don't want to find her dead. I want to find her alive,' said Parker's father, Brad. On the episode of courtroom series 'The People's Court,' recorded the summer before her disappearance, Parker and Smith squared off over a $5,000 engagement ring. The show revealed a 'violent' history of her relationship with Smith, who had been dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 following a reported court martial and military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery. Smith was charged with domestic battery during their relationship, after which Parker filed a request for a restraining order in 2009, which was denied, . In her filing she said he 'smashed the passenger side window in my SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw them in the road'. She also alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is coming.' 'He gets pretty malicious and vindictive,' she said of him on The People's Court, 'and he's a mean person especially when he's been drinking.' Smith had sued Parker, claiming she lost the engagement ring when she threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton hotel during a science fiction convention. People's Court judge Marilyn Milian found in favor of Smith on the episode and ordered Parker to pay $2,500. A friend, Angela Launer, told ABC around the time of the disappearance that Smith was known to abandon Parker in out of the way places. 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing the relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'. Police have not charged Smith in relation to his ex-fiancée's disappearance, but he is currently being considered a person of interest in the investigation. Smith currently has custody of the couple's twin children. Parker also had a son from a previous relationship who was 10 years old at the time of her disappearance. An attorney for Smith told ABC that Smith had not committed any crime. The family revealed after her disappearance that Parker left a short message the day before she went missing in which she sounded normal and asked her father to make plans to call her. ‘Hey Dad, it's about 8:40. This is Michelle on Wednesday morning,’ she said. ‘I know that you're at work, but call me when you have lunch or you have break or the end of your day.’ The family spent Thanksgiving with about 50 volunteers, searing within a two-mile radius from a cell tower that had last pinged her location, reported the Orlando Sentinel. ‘I'm thankful that my sister has not been found in a bad way, because every day that doesn't happen, I still have hope that she's still out there somewhere,’ her sister Lauren Erickson told ABC at the time. Her friend Angela Launer told ABC Mr Smith was known to abandon her in out of the way places. 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing their relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, has maintained that Smith is not responsible for her daughter's disappearance. 'Who would want to hurt the mother of their children?' she told ABC. 'I don't see how in any way he would benefit from it. I know in my heart of heart that she's been carjacked.’ 'That the people saw an expensive car and a girl who looks like she has money and I know they've made a mistake and I know that they want to fix this and I forgive them.’","Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando went missing hours after an episode of The People's Court starring her and her ex-fiance, Dale Smith .

"Security guards and closed circuit camera systems will be deployed at 54 schools around Australia amid fears they could become the targets of violence, terrorist attacks or harassment stemming from 'racial or religious intolerance.' Half of the schools selected for the $18million, three-year funding program are Islamic or Jewish schools. Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan announced 54 schools have been approved for help protecting their students under the program, theDaily Telegraph reports. Scroll down for video . In September last year youths allegedly shouted out threats to kill Christians and waved an Islamic State flag as they drove past a Maronite church and school in Sydney's west . Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, is one of around 100 Australian men who are thought to have travelled to fight with the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria and Iraq . ‘This support recognises the unique security circumstances that some schools face,’ Mr Keenan said. ‘All our children have the right to be educated in a safe and secure setting.’ The funding promise was first made last year when the Attorney-General's Department invited schools to submit applications for extra security measures on their premises. 'The Australian Government has committed $18 million over three years for the new Schools Security Programme. It is designed to provide funding to government and non–government schools and preschools assessed as being at risk of attack, harassment or violence stemming from racial or religious intolerance,' the Attorney-General's office said. 'The programme will provide non-recurrent funding for security infrastructure, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, lighting and fences, and for the cost of employing security guards,' it added. Schools across Australia requested extra security assistance. Of those approved, 29 are in NSW and a large number of them are in Western Sydney. Victoria had the next-highest number of schools approved, with 15. Half the schools are Islamic or Jewish. The funding announcement comes after youths allegedly shouted out threats to kill Christians and waved an Islamic State flag as they drove past a Maronite church and school in Sydney's west last year, terrifying members of the community. NSW police investigated the incident at the Our Lady of Lebanon church and the Maronite College of the Holy Family in Harris Park in Sydney's west in September. It is alleged a youth in a passing red hatchback yelled out: 'We're going to kill all you Christians.' Also in September last year, a Jewish school in Sydney’s eastern suburbs constructed a bomb proof wall. Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan announced 54 schools have been approved for help protecting their students and premises . Religious tension around Australia is thought to have been stirred-up by the actions of Islamic State jihadis such as Khaled Sharrouf (pictured) The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi erected the concrete wall in front of its college, which houses kindergarten to year 12 students as well as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen. Whilst Director Rabbi Dovid ­Slavin has been working towards breaking down barriers, he said 'building walls is the unfortunate reality' in Australia today. The construction of the wall was reportedly funded by private donations and $519,000 granted the Secure Schools Program. It came after a group of teenagers allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August. Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm. Mohamed Elomar fled western Sydney in December 2013 to join the Islamic State . Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths allegedly started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'. Another incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media. Last month it emerged that principals are struggling to deal with the students and parents who are falling under the sway of radical Islam, according to a group representing educators. Another teenager who was suspected of having ties to terrorism was Numan Haider who was shot dead by police last year after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne . The Australian Principals Federation has welcomed the Victorian government's move to introduce new measures to deal with the growing problem in schools. A state education spokesman said the department was working more closely with police and had nominated staff 'to provide advice and support to schools'. It comes after one principal told Fairfax Media of his struggles to help two children whose parents have left Australia to Syria to fight with Islamic State in the Middle East at his state-run primary school. 'We have to work extra hard to ensure students don't take up their parents extreme beliefs,' he said. 'I have them singing the national anthem with the Australian flag and say what a lucky country they live in.' The school is made up of a lot of children from the Shiite, Alawite and Sunni Muslim communities. Since then, there had been a rise in suspensions of students as they fought at school. The schools that have requested security assistance are based around Australia, with 29 of them in NSW and a large number of them in Western Sydney . 'What's happening in the Middle East does impact here - the families are divided in their beliefs,' he said. Australian Principals Association branch president Peter Kearney told Daily Mail Australia 'several issues' about 'social cohesion' had been raised by principals. 'One thing we see is that where there are tensions in the community then there are tensions in the school,' he said. Mr Kearney said radicalisation of students and children had been 'a battle for principals' but they were unsure about how to deal with it. The former principal's comments follow growing concerns for the vulnerability of teenagers being recruited by terror group Islamic State. Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadi - who went missing from his western Sydney home has appeared in a number of recruitment video for the extremist organisation in Syria. Another teenager who was suspected of having ties to terrorism was Numan Haider who was shot dead by police last year after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne.","Federal government to spend $18m over three years on school security .

"Pictures of Caitlin Kearney line the walls of her mother's Pitman, New Jersey, home, but Denise Urevick says she hasn't seen her daughter for years. The photographs are the only image of mom that Caitlin's own three-year-old daughter, Lily, who lives with Urevick, has since Kearney left her as a newborn in 2012. Kearney and Lily had been living with Kearney's grandmother until June of that year, when she walked into the home and heard her grandmother on the phone - upset - and speaking about her. Missing: Caitlin Kearney, recently would have turned 23, hasn't been seen by her family since she walked out of her grandmother's home where she was living in 2012 . 'Caitlin just turned around and walked out,' Urevick, 57, told the South Jersey Times. 'No one had heard from her that day.' Her disappearance, coming after what her mother characterized as a losing struggle with drugs, derailed both her family life and Kearney's plans to study nursing. 'When she first left, I had heard there were sightings of her,' Urevick said. 'I knew she was OK. I reported her missing when the information stopped coming in.' Urevick says she started searching for her daughter in Camden, where her daughter had gotten into trouble with the law and occasionally Urevick heard troubling rumors. 'What is really frightening, was at one point we were told that she could have been held against her will,' Urevick said. 'But we never were able to find out if that was true or not.' Both Pitman Police Department and the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office have investigated Kearney's case but all leads pointed to dead ends. Struggling: Urevick says she hears occasional rumors about her daughter, who has been spotted in Camden and occasionally gotten into trouble with the law . Unreachable: Urevick says Kearney recently had begun having issues with substance abuse that was souring their 'normal' relationship . Detective Bryn Wilden of the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office said his departmetn was 'unable to substantiate any claim that Caitlin had been held against her will.' Last week, Pitman police re-released the case, hoping to turn up new information that could lead to Kearney after two and a half years of fruitless searching. 'I'm still holding on to hope that we'll find Caitlin,' Urevick said. 'Of course I constantly think of her and worry about her. But I have to be OK for my granddaughter.' 'If Caitlin should read this, she should know her entire family wants her back home,' she added.","Caitlin Kearney, 23, walked out of her grandmother's home where she was staying 2-and-a-half years ago .

"Mohammed Emwazi mixed with a violent street gang who used stun guns to target wealthy victims in London’s Mayfair, it has emerged. He also had childhood links to other Islamic extremists who went on to join terror groups in Syria and Somalia. Emwazi was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi – a member of a masked gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below the IS killer at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John’s Wood, North West London. Emwazi was a known associate to Choukri Elleklifi (right) - a member of a masked gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks in London . But he fled to join an Al Qaeda group in Syria before he could be brought to justice, and was killed by government forces near Aleppo in August 2013. He and Emwazi were both said to have fallen under the sway of extremists while they were at secondary school, before Emwazi was further radicalised by hate preachers he encountered at Westminster University. School contemporaries claimed the older boy was involved in regular fights and the ‘borderline stalking’ of a female classmate. He was said to have dressed like a ‘gangster rapper’ as a teenager and to have experimented with alcohol and cannabis, before being radicalised by fanatical Islamists in his late teens. It is thought the toxic combination of their preaching and the violence he was exposed to through his association with Ellekhlifi may have fuelled his own descent into hate-filled brutality. Ellekhlifi and two friends committed eight robberies against wealthy victims in Mayfair, central London, in the space of a few days in July 2012 – not long before Emwazi travelled to Syria and joined Islamic State. The extremist, a former University of Westminster student, used to dress as a gangster rapper, said friends . Wearing masks, they threatened their victims with a stun gun and demanded they hand over possessions including wallets, watches and mobile phones. Two of their victims ended up in hospital with minor injuries after the stun gun was fired directly at them, and a sub-machine gun was later found at the home of one gang member. Ellekhlifi was charged but fled to Syria. He was found guilty in his absence and sentenced to six years for conspiracy to rob. Before his death, he was pictured in the country wearing paramilitary equipment and clutching an AK-47. Emwazi was never accused of taking part in the robberies carried out by the gang. In a separate case, he was charged with possessing stolen bicycles, but was later acquitted by a jury. He has also been linked to a network of British-based jihadists who have avoided deportation by using the Human Rights Act to block moves to force them to leave Britain. They include an Al Qaeda suspect with known connections to the failed July 21 London bomb plot and a second London-based man accused of attending an Al Shabaab training camp in Somalia. Emwazi has also been linked to radical hate preachers who taught ‘white widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite and the Woolwich killers Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo. Britain’s security services have faced criticism that he was able to travel to Syria undetected, despite his many links to known terror suspects. This is despite emails sent by the militant in 2010 and 2011 claiming that MI5 was harassing him. Up to five schools are being investigated by the Department for Education which is worried about the radicalisation of pupils, it was reported last night. The department’s counter-extremism unit has been called in after it emerged that former pupils had joined extremist groups. The review includes Mohammed Emwazi’s former school – Quintin Kynaston academy in London – which is known to have had at least three ex-pupils join Islamic terror organisations. As well as Emwazi and gangster Choukri Ellekhlifi, former pupil Mohammed Sakr left Britain to join Somalia-based Al Shabaab before being killed in a US air strike in early 2012. Questions have now been raised about whether enough was done to prevent teenagers at the school being brainwashed by extremists. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered officials to investigate the academy’s records to examine what measures were in place to tackle radicalisation. A spokesman for the department said that the academy is ‘clearly a different school today’ than it was when Emwazi attended, but said they were reviewing records to ‘see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future’. The school insists it is not a terrorist breeding ground and that it has been ‘proactive’ in working with the Government’s counter-terrorism strategy. Current headteacher Alex Atherton said: ‘Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at Quintin Kynaston.’ The review includes Mohammed Emwazi’s former school – Quintin Kynaston academy in London – which is known to have had at least three ex-pupils join Islamic terror organisations .","Mohammed Emwazi had links to violent street gang of muggers in London .

"At Dolce & Gabbana's Milan Fashion Week show this afternoon, it wasn't just the clothes that turned heads on the catwalk. In a tribute to mothers and motherhood, each model carried a baby down the runway, with some expertly holding their precious cargo and others struggling to come to grips with the little ones. The backdrop, a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word 'mamma' in script, completed the theme of the show, which was fittingly called 'Viva la Mamma'. Scroll down for video . At Dolce & Gabbana's Milan Fashion Week show this afternoon, models walked the catwalk while carrying babies in a tribute to motherhood . Pregnant Italian model Bianca Balti (left) strutted her stuff in the label's latest designs. Another model (right) kept her precious cargo close . The tiny fashionistas, who were all decked out in lace dresses and mini suits, ranged in age from just a few months to a few years old. While most of the babies were apparently unrelated to the models, pregnant supermodel Bianca Balti, 30, showcased her very own baby bump on the runway, looking positively glowing in a powder pink sheath dress and black heels. According to guests, the youngsters on the runway were extremely well-behaved, but a few pictures from the show tell something of a different story. In one image, for instance, a model clad in a black and red floral ensemble smiles brightly as she carries her adorable accessory - but the baby looks thoroughly nonplussed.

"Gliding confidently beneath the ripples, this baby boy has taken to swimming like a duck to water. And it may have saved his life – regular dips since he was just seven weeks old helped William Jones build up enough strength to survive open heart surgery. Here he is at 15 weeks, enjoying a swim just two days before being admitted to the paediatric cardiac unit at Southampton General Hospital where he had surgery to repair a hole in his heart. William, who has Down’s syndrome, was taken swimming by his parents, Susan, 41, a teacher, and Andrew, 39, a warrant officer in the Army, who wanted him to be strong enough to cope with the operation.

'The swimming has helped improve his muscle tone and gain strength in preparation for cardiac surgery. 'The first time we took William to the pool he stretched back and floated happily. He really seems to love being in the water. ‘With Down’s syndrome, muscle is quite weak but after just a couple of sessions in the pool we noticed his muscles were developing.’ Before surgery William had eight lessons in a hydrotherapy pool organised by baby swimming teachers Aquatots. And now he is growing stronger, his mum can’t wait to see him paddling again. ‘We are very keen to get him back in the pool as soon as possible because it is really going to help with his development,’ she said.

At one point during her first night away from hospital, the little girl  slept for a full four hours straight. Four days later, the couple were allowed to take home Scarlett and Esme. The following day, they revealed on the Facebook page that their first night with three babies was 'tiring, but worth it'. It is yet to be seen how Ashley and Tyson will cope with all of their four daughters at home, without the round-the-clock care that the babies had at the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo. As they have done throughout their  journey, the couple are looking to their faith to stay strong. In Saturday's Facebook post, they said: 'We feel so blessed that this has turned out so perfectly! We know our Father in Heaven is watching over us and has guided us, the babies and the doctors.' First of four: Ashley and Tyson brought the first of their daughters - Evangeline (pictured) - home on February 16. At one point during her first night away from hospital, the little girl slept for a full four hours straight . Big girl:  Evangeline was the first of her sisters strong enough to leave  Utah Valley Regional Medical Center . Parenthood is a breeze! In a post in February, Ashley wrote  their daughter had a peaceful first night at home . They added: 'The doctors are the first to admit that this has been a true miracle in everyone's eye and they babies statistically should not have done this well! (sic)' Indeed, the quadruplets birth was a one-in-70 million chance. The Gardners had spent eight years trying to conceive when they underwent their first - successful - round of in vitro fertilization. The couple hit the headlines last October after  Ashley's priceless reaction to discovering she was pregnant with quadruplets was caught on video and posted online, where it quickly went viral. Footage showed Ashley gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before placing her hand on her forehead and breathing out. She then started laughing hysterically alongside her husband. The couple went on to become a national sensation, documenting their pregnancy on social media. Second and third: On February 20, the couple were allowed to take home Scarlett and Esme (pictured). The following day, they revealed on Facebook that their first night with three babies was 'tiring, but worth it' Hitting the headlines: The couple hit the headlines last October after Ashley's priceless reaction (pictured) to discovering she was pregnant with quadruplets was caught on video and posted online, where it  went viral. Unlikely: Ashley says  the chances of her conceiving the four girls - and them surviving  - is 70million-to-one . 'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson told Deseret News earlier this year, adding: 'Our story's a story of hope.' On December 28, Ashley gave birth to their four daughters via C-section. The girl's weights at birth were 1lb 13oz (Indie), 2lbs 9oz (Esme), 2lbs 6oz (Scarlett) and  2 lbs 10oz (Evangeline). The quadruplets' survival was deemed a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant. The couple were forced to fly to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October . Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. A few days ago: On Tuesday, Ashley wrote on the social networking site that she wished she could take Indie home soon. 'Sitting here at the NICU holding my Indie girl! She seems very restless tonight,' she wrote . Heartbroken: She added: 'She must know that all her sisters are gone. She settled right down after snuggling in with mommy! It breaks my heart that she is still here at the NICU! I want to bring her home so badly!' Tyson said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. Incredibly, surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems. Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing contractions a few weeks early in December. Shortly after the birth, Ashley took to Facebook to express her delight at her four tiny bundles of joy, writing: 'They are simply perfect! My heart is so full! And to think, I almost gave up before doing IVF. Getting into the festive spirit: The Gardners posted this picture online before the birth of their girls, writing: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks' Proud new father: Tyson later posted this image: 'Moms saying Hello to Esme! Incredible day! God is real' 'I felt so broken and didn't feel I could take any more! I gathered the courage to try once again and look! To you I say never give up on your dreams! You never know when they will come true!' On Tuesday, Ashley wrote on the social networking site that she wished she could take Indie home soon. 'Sitting here at the NICU holding my Indie girl! She seems very restless tonight,' she wrote. 'She must know that all her sisters are gone. She settled right down after snuggling in with mommy! It breaks my heart that she is still here at the NICU! I want to bring her home so badly!' Thanks to the efforts of Indie's doctors and nurses, her wish has now come true.","Ashley and Tyson Gardner brought their daughter, Indie, home Saturday .

"The family of a high school honor roll student accused of encouraging her friend to kill himself before raising thousands of dollars for suicide prevention has insisted she is innocent. Michelle Carter, 18, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy III, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his idling truck in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, last July. When Roy texted Carter that he wasn't sure he should take his life and had climbed out of the vehicle, she allegedly texted him: 'Get back in.' Her parents have defended their daughter saying she is 'not the villain the media is portraying her to be' and was only trying to help Roy, who had been suffering from depression. But classmates interviewed by police after the tragedy described her as someone who craves attention and is known as the girl who 'cries wolf'. Carter also claimed the pair had been dating 'on and off' for two years, but Roy's best friends claim they had never heard of her. Accused: Michelle Conrad, pictured left, allegedly knew that her friend Conrad Roy III, right, was suicidal but rather than seeking help, she encouraged him to take his life in the minutes before he died last July . In a statement received by The Boston Herald, the family said: 'Our hearts have and remain broken for the Roy family. 'For everyone that does not know our daughter, she is not the villain the media is portraying her to be. She is a quiet, kind, and sympathetic young girl. She tried immensely to help Mr Roy in his battle with depression. We know that once all of the facts are released, our daughter will be found innocent.' After the death, Carter, who attends King Philip Regional High School, started raising money and awareness for suicide prevention and organized a fundraising softball tournament last September. In a description for the event, 'Homers for Conrad', Carter wrote: 'Life can be tough, but helping others makes it easier.' She later wrote on Twitter that the event had raised $2,300. However when Roy's best friend was interviewed by police about the charity event, they said he believed she was 'kind of looking for attention' and feared she was taking credit for his idea, according to court documents. He also felt forced to add her as an organizer of the event because she was annoyed she wasn't listed. Tribute: In the hours after he was found dead, Carter shared this message to her Twitter page . 'Duplicitous': Three days after she allegedly encouraged him to take his life, she questioned why he had died . Cold: She also shared messages calling for suicide prevention, while paying tribute to her friend . Detective Scott R. Gordon wrote in a police report: 'I asked him if he had a lot to do with the fundraiser, and he said not too much but he did try and get her to move it back to Mattapoisett where all of Conrad's family and friends were but Michelle wanted to keep it in Plainville. 'He further explained that (Carter) was getting so involved in it, and he was just curious about how she knew Conrad, and Michelle said that they had been dating on and off for two years and (he) said at that point that he had never heard of her, so he didn't know exactly if that was true or not.' Our hearts have and remain broken for the Roy family. For everyone that does not know our daughter, she is not the villain the media is portraying her to be. She is a quiet, kind, and sympathetic young girl. She tried immensely to help Mr. Roy in his battle with depression. We know that once all of the facts are released, our daughter will be found innocent. According to court documents seen by the Herald, one friend added: 'She was a very nice, outgoing person but she requires a lot of attention and reassurance. Another said Carter has a history of being the 'girl that cried wolf,' and sometimes (it) was hard to tell if she was being totally truthful.' Joseph Cataldo, her attorney, has said accusations she was looking for attention after Roy's suicide are 'ridiculous'. 'She did help organize a fundraiser in his honor, in his name, to call attention both to his plight and others in his predicament,' he said, 'but she was not seeking attention for herself or any kind of personal gain. Carter, who was 17 at the time of Roy's suicide, was indicted on February 5 and arraigned on an involuntary manslaughter charge the next day in New Bedford Juvenile Court. The high school senior was charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted. She is free on bail and is due back in court in April. Police and prosecutors say Carter, of Plainville, texted back-and-forth with Conrad before he took his life in the parking lot of a Fairhaven Kmart on July 13, 2014. Court documents show the two friends exchanged more than 1,000 text messages  in the days leading up to his death, the Fairhaven Neighborhood News reported. Most recently, just two days before her arraignment, she shared this image of Conrad, adding: 'Really missing you tonight'. She is free on bail but has been ordered not to touch her social media pages . Before his suicide, Conrad told her he was scared and not ready to leave his family, according to a police report, but 'she continued to encourage him to take his own life', the Sun Chronicle reported. 'When he actually started to carry out the act, he got scared again and exited his truck, but instead of telling him to stay out of the truck ... Carter told him to 'get back in',' the police report said. His body was found in the truck after his parents reported him missing, and police found the text messages after looking through his phone. Gregg Miliote, a spokesperson for Bristol County District Attorney Quinn, said in a statement on Thursday that Carter knew he was having suicidal thoughts. 'Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,' Miliote said. Quinn will not be overseeing the case because he knows the girl's family, he added. Carter has also repeatedly posted online about how much she misses her friend. 'Such a beautiful soul gone too soon,' she wrote on the day of his death. 'I'll always remember your bright light and smile. You'll forever be in my heart, I love you Conrad.' Victim: Roy, 18, was a boat captain at his father's company and was about to start college when he died . Three days later, she added: 'I will never understand why this had to happen.' '1 month without your goofy humor and genuine love,' she later wrote. 'I miss you every day. I hope you're finally happy up there Co.' On September 10, 2014, she posted: 'National Suicide Awareness day, I wish more people understood. I love you and miss you everyday Conrad. Help others #WeCanEndSuicide.' Her most recent message - written just two days before her indictment - reads: 'Enjoy the parade from up there tomorrow Conrad, I know you would of loved to be there ♥ Really missing you tonight.' As conditions of her bail, she is not allowed to use the internet or social media and cannot text anyone but her parents. She is due back in court for a pretrial hearing on April 17. According to The Plainville Times, the teenager was also a founding member of 'Connect-To-Cure', a fundraiser selling $10 bracelets to raise funds for cancer patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Three weeks after she was arraigned, she went to the hospital to take part in a charity event. Her lawyer told The Standard Times that Carter did not commit a crime and expects the charge to be dismissed. Free: Carter, a high school senior who's on the honor role, has been charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted . 'I can't understand why they brought the charge,' Joseph P. Cataldo said. 'They're trying to claim there is manslaughter, when they freely admit the boy took his own life. You can't have it both ways.' King Philip Regional School District declined to comment on the case. 'The circumstances surrounding this tragic loss are under investigation,' Superintendent Elizabeth Zielinski told CBS Boston. 'Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family and school community of Conrad Roy.' Conrad Roy had graduated from Old Rochester Regional High School, where he was an all-around athlete who played baseball, rowed crew and ran track, according to an obituary. He had earned his captain's license from Northeast Maritime Institute and worked for his family's marine salvage business. He was planning to attend Fitchburg State University. His father, Conrad Roy Jr., was on a tug boat that came to the rescue of victims of US Airways Flight 1549 that crashed in the Hudson River in 2009, the Sun Chronicle reported.","Michelle Carter allegedly sent Conrad Roy III, 18, a series of texts encouraging to take his life in a parking lot in  Massachusetts last July .

"A rare copy of the Sex Pistols' controversial single God Save The Queen has sold for £6,000 at auction. The never-played record is one of a handful out of 25,000 that were not destroyed by the punk band's former record company. In near mint condition, it is among the most valuable records ever pressed in Britain. This rare copy of the Sex Pistols' controversial single God Save The Queen has sold for £6,000 at auction . A&M Records ditched the rebellious punk rockers because of their bad behaviour on March 10, 1977- just six days after signing them. A series of incidents including Sid Vicious breaking a toilet bowl, cutting his foot and trailing blood all over the office and John Lydon making a death threat to a good friend of A & M's English director was enough for the company to wash their hands of them. Nearly all of the 25,000 copies of the single that had been pressed in the six days were promptly destroyed. Only nine copies with the original A & M sleeve are known to exist today and the one now being sold was saved by a former employee of the record company. The single was later released by Virgin, reaching No 2 in the charts. But its controversial lyrics and cover, featuring a defaced picture of the Queen, meant the BBC refused to play it. A&M Records ditched the rebellious punk rockers (pictured) because of their bad behaviour in 1977- just six days after signing them- and destroyed nearly all of the 25,000 copies of the single that had been pressed . An unnamed private collector bought the mint-condition record, one of only nine known copies, from Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berkshire. Alan Pritchard, SAS's music and entertainment specialist, said: 'The Sex Pistols are such a cult band and this is the most iconic withdrawn single. 'There are very few in existence as most were destroyed when the band was dropped. Just a handful were kept behind by people in the industry. 'When you get rareties like this it attracts a lot of interest from collectors, vinyl is highly sought after worldwide.' The highest recorded sale of the A & M version of God Save the Queen was £13,000 in 2006 when UK collector Marshal Peters sold a copy with its A & M card envelope.","A very rare copy of Sex Pistol's God Save the Queen has sold for £6,000 .

"Betrayed: Controversial critic Brian Sewell revealed once-trusted friends have stolen his paintings . He has built an impressive art collection over a decades-long career as Britain’s most-feared critic. But now Brian Sewell has revealed that some of the works he has accumulated have gone missing – stolen by once-trusted friends. ‘It is surprising how unpleasant people can be,’ he tells Event magazine today. ‘How untrustworthy friends can become. ‘How somebody you think you can absolutely depend on will do something so mean that it astonishes you.’ None of Mr Sewell’s light-fingered visitors are likely to face justice since he has decided to not report the matter to police. The critic, who is suffering from cancer, refuses to identify those he holds responsible for betraying him but makes it abundantly clear that he knows who they are. The thefts have occurred over the past ten years and came to light recently when he started sorting through his belongings, bagging up old clothes for charity and consigning other unwanted items to the bonfire. Friends and acquaintances visiting his home in Wimbledon, South London, have made off with paintings and drawings, he says, and, when challenged, have denied all knowledge. However, Sewell has confessed that he occasionally indulged in similar behaviour himself when visiting friends’ homes – though on a much smaller scale. He said: ‘I have stolen the odd book myself. I have a theory that only men steal books, although when I proposed that to a woman a month or two ago she was absolutely outraged. ‘It’s not really books I’m worrying about – it’s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear. You don’t know when they disappear but, when you think about it, it’s only... when people have been to the house. ‘This is betrayal. It makes me so angry and helpless because you can’t do anything about it.’ Sewell, whose trenchant views once led to leading figures in the art world demanding his dismissal as the Evening Standard’s art critic, also speaks –with some reluctance – about his illness. 'I have stolen the odd book myself,' the critic said. 'It’s not really books I’m worrying about – it’s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear. It’s only... when people have been to the house' ‘I think a serene death with my dogs on the bed would be wonderful,’ he said. ‘It may still happen. I really don’t know.’ The 84-year-old has admitted to disliking children but loving animals – ironically as his latest book is aimed at youngsters. The White Umbrella, which has just been published, is about a wounded donkey found by a TV crew visiting Pakistan – and he says he wrote it as a ‘distraction’ from his radiotherapy. Last night he said he had confronted the ‘friends’ he suspected of robbing him but had failed to get any of the missing artworks back. ‘I have always done it face-to-face and I now know it isn’t worth doing because it simply gets worse – the lies don’t help.’","Thefts took place over the past ten years but only came to light recently .

"Mourners were today demanding justice for an atheist blogger hacked to death by Islamists in Dhaka over his opposition to religious extremism. Hundreds of mourners gathered around the coffin of Avijit Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, after he was murdered in the street last week on his way home from a book fair. His wife and fellow blogger, Rafida Ahmed, remains in hospital in a serious condition after she suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack. Scroll down for video . Mourning: Flowers are laid on the coffin of Avijit Roy, the atheist blogger hacked to death in the street in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, as he returned with his wife from a book fair on Thursday evening .

Anguish: Mr Roy's father Ajoy Roy, seated right, is comforted by fellow mourners at his son's funeral earlier today. Hundreds came to see Mr Roy's coffin at Dhaka University and lay flowers before his burial . U.S. citizen: Mr Roy with his wife Rafida Ahmed on holiday together at the Grand Canyon. She remains in hospital in a serious condition after she suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack . The murder of Mr Roy, an atheist who advocated secularism in Bangladesh, came amid a crackdown on the country's Islamist groups after they increased their activities in recent years. A resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Roy came to visit Dhaka, the city of his birth, in the middle of last month and had been due to soon return home. Today mourners carried flowers to his coffin at Dhaka University to pay their respects. 'Free thinking in Bangladesh is become a great danger, all the free thinkers are at great risk,' writer Shahriar Kabir told Reuters. 'We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.' As Mr Roy's father stood by, Kamal Hossain, the architect of Bangladesh's secular constitution, called the killing 'a heinous murder'. 'My question is, why did it take place?' said Mr Hossain. 'Avijit was killed because of his writing. By killing him, the killers have torn apart our constitution.' No arrest has so far been made. People also held a demonstration at the spot where he was killed and chanted slogans demanding 'immediate arrest and quick trial of the perpetrator'. Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism. The naturalised U.S. citizen, who was a bio-engineer as well as a blogger, had been receiving death threats online for years. Mr Roy and his wife have a daughter at university in the U.S. Ajoy Roy stood alongside his son's coffin as mourners filed past. He reiterated that Islamist militants were responsible for his son's death, but also blamed the government for failing to protect him despite repeated threats on his life. 'I am speechless at this moment of mourning. When the fundamentalists threatened, I informed the Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector General of Police,' Ajoy Roy said. 'This murder has proved their utter failure.' Heartache: Fellow mourners comfort Ajoy Roy as he looks down at his son's coffin at Dhaka University earlier today. Avijit Roy was returning from a book fair at the university when he was attacked in the street . Last visit: A resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Roy came to Dhaka, the city of his birth, in the middle of last month and had been due to soon return home after attending the university book fair . Secularist: Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism . Target: Mr Roy, who was also a bio-engineer, had been receiving death threats online for years . Respected: Dozens of mourners queue to pay their last respects to Mr Roy at Dhaka University . An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam'. The extremists also said he was singled out because he is a U.S. citizen - and characterized the vicious killing as 'revenge' for attacks on ISIS in Syria. Police said at least two men, who are believed to have links to Dhaka University, attacked Roy around 8.45pm on Thursday, landing three strong, deliberate blows to the right side of his head with machetes. They turned on his wife, Rafida Ahmed, when she tried to save him, then fled into the crowd, dumping their weapons as they ran. Police have expressed shock that extremists struck at a university book fair, which was heavily guarded. Witnesses have even said officers and bystanders were there during the murder - but did nothing. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it 'a shocking act of violence' that was 'horrific in its brutality and cowardice'. Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of free speech campaign group Index on Censorship said: 'Our sympathies are with the family of Avijit Roy. 'Roy was targeted simply for expressing his own beliefs and we are appalled by his death and condemn all such killings.' Family man: Mr Roy and his wife in a photo believed to show their daughter, right, a student at a US college . Serious condition: Ms Ahmed suffered severe head injuries and lost a finger trying to defend her husband . Bloodbath: The scene immediately following the attack on the couple. An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam' In 2013, religious extremists targeted several secular bloggers who had demanded capital punishment for Islamist leaders convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh's war for independence. Blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed that year in a similar attack near his home in Dhaka after he led one such protest demanding capital punishment. In 2004, Humayun Azad, a secular writer and professor at Dhaka University, was also attacked by militants while returning home from a Dhaka book fair. He later died in Germany while undergoing treatment. Media group Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.","Hundreds of mourners gather to see Avijit Roy's coffin at Dhaka University .

"Two-thirds of the laws passed by Britain’s parliament over the past 22 years have either been made or influenced by the European Union, according to a study. An analysis of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 found that 64.7 per cent carried the fingerprints of Brussels. The study, by the Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Britain, found that 59.3 per cent of the total are regulations – binding EU laws which must be accepted by member states without modification. Some 49,699 have been enacted. Scroll down for video . An analysis of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 found that two-thirds were made or influenced by the European Union (pictured, the EU flag) And the other 5.4 per cent are directives, a general aim which can be interpreted in the laws passed by national parliaments. Some 4,283 have been implemented by the UK parliament. The study found that the largest number of EU-influenced directives passed into British law was in 2009 when 294 were brought in. There were 171 last year. Of the major pieces of legislation in 2013, 35 out of 78 were implementing EU directives. The findings will fuel debate about David Cameron’s plans to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU if he wins a second term, ahead of his promised in-out referendum before the end of 2017. In his landmark speech on Europe two years ago in which he offered the referendum, the Prime Minister said people rightly questioned whether ‘the balance was right’ in terms of EU legislation. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘David Cameron has rightly pointed out that bureaucratic EU rules unnecessarily affect our daily lives far too often. ‘The European Commission and European Parliament almost always see regulation as the answer to every problem the EU faces, regardless of the impact on business and our economic competitiveness. Access to the single market should not come at the cost of having two-thirds of our laws being decided by the EU. ‘There must be a significant reduction in the amount and scope of EU legislation and powers over certain policy areas should be given back to Parliament so decisions are made far closer to the British people.’ Business for Britain, which is backed by business leaders who want to see Britain either leave the EU or have a fundamentally different relationship with it, says it acknowledges that regulations and directives are needed for the single market to work effectively. The campaign group’s figure is far higher than an estimate from the House of Commons library, which put it at 13.3 per cent. Business for Britain said the explanation for the difference was the fact that many EU regulations simply pass into UK law, without ever being voted on by MPs. Last year, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip leader Nigel Farage held two televised debates about Britain’s membership of the EU . Last year Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip leader Nigel Farage held two televised debates about Britain’s membership of the EU in which Mr Clegg claimed only 7 per cent of our laws are made in Brussels, while Mr Farage insisted it was up to 75 per cent. Pro-Europeans said the campaign group’s report was ‘misleading’. Roland Rudd, chairman of Business for New Europe, said: ‘It is wrong to imply that all laws originating at EU-level are undemocratic or over-burdensome. ‘The UK gets a seat at the negotiating table and most of the time, one EU law gets rid of 28 different national laws across Europe, making it much simpler and easier for businesses to export.’","Study found 64.7 per cent of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 have either been made or influenced by the European Union .

"A toddler was left behind in the woods by nursery school staff after they took a group of children on a walk, it emerged today. Fordfield House Nursery has apologised unreservedly after the shocking failing in care was revealed in an Ofsted report. The youngster was only returned to the nursery - which caters for children under the age of five - after being found by someone from a nearby riding stables. Failing in care: A toddler was left behind in the woods by Fordfield House Nursery during a class outing . After the incident last December staff at the nursery in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, notified the inspector that a 'serious incident' had occurred. It is believed the child, whose age and gender is unknown, was left behind in woodland at the end of the trip to the woods. The nursery has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones. Ofsted would not confirm how the child came to be left behind but their report states they issued 'compliance action'. This included a 'notice to improve' which asked the nursery to 'ensure children are kept safe on outings'. A welfare requirements notice was also serves which states the nursery must 'ensure staffing arrangements meet the needs of all children and ensure their safety'. New measures: The nursery, pictured, has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones . It also states that they must 'ensure that children are adequately supervised and decide how to deploy staff to ensure children's needs are met'. It also asked them to 'identify the steps to be taken to remove, minimise and manage[...] risks and hazards'. Ofsted said it had also carried out a further inspection into the nursery and a report would be published 'in due course'. The report, which was published last month, said: 'The owner took immediate action following the incident. 'All outings have been stopped until relevant policies and procedures have been amended and fully implemented within the nursery. 'New mobile phones that will be used on outings have been purchased. We are satisfied with the action taken by the provider. The provider remains registered with Ofsted.' The nursery was in fact rated outstanding by Ofsted after an inspection last July and its director, Carole Cross, said parents had been 'kept fully informed'. She said: 'We made our parents and Ofsted fully aware at that time and they rigorously inspected the nursery and investigated. 'We complied and worked with the inspection team immediately and, as a result, we have put improved and effective changes in place to make our nursery even better than it was. 'We have apologised unreservedly to our parents.' A nursery spokesman said: 'The incident was last year and it has been fully investigated by Ofsted.' A mother who has three children at the nursery said: 'I believe that the incident should not define what is a wonderful establishment. 'The nursery responded in the appropriate way and rather than dwell, they have put measures in place to stop any such incident - a direct result of human error - from happening again. 'I only hope that this does not mean an end to the wonderful walks in the woods that my children have enjoyed with nursery over the last eight years.'","Toddler left in the woods by staff at Fordfield House Nursery, Bedfordshire .

Two people voluntarily turned themselves in and they are being questioned about the incident. The United States Coast Guard Mid-Atlantic division provided this aerial shot of the scene in Pine Beach, New Jersey. A dead dog was recovered after a pickup trunk sunk in Toms River last night . A dead boxer mix was found in the truck, but no people were found inside of the submerged pickup . The search and rescue effort for the truck involved crew members wearing 'ice rescue' suits and 'fan boats' Authorities were alerted about the truck after a witness reported seeing it doing 'donuts' after driving onto the river around midnight last night. Before the truck hit the ice, a male passenger was seen getting out. A helicopter crew spotted a hole in the ice this morning and the truck was found approximately 100 feet from shore, NJ Advance Media reported. No people were found in the submerged pickup, but a dead boxer mix was found inside. Toms River police wrote on Facebook: 'Police units responded and also observed the vehicle on the ice. 'The headlight and brake lights could be seen from the shoreline as the vehicle headed South and West towards the other side of the river. 'After a period of time went by the lights suddenly were no longer visible. 'Fearing that the truck broke through the ice, search teams were activated.' The rescue effort involved crew members wearing 'ice rescue' suits and using 'fan boats'. The New Jersey State Police Marine Unit and the Pine Beach Police Department are continuing to investigate.","Pickup truck sunk in Toms River near Pine Beach, New Jersey, last night .

"A herbal treatment nicknamed ‘pig pungent weed’ has become the first traditional Chinese medicine to be approved for use in the UK. The plant Sigesbeckia, which has an unpleasant smell, is renowned for its ability to treat aches and pains – including those caused by arthritis. It is the active ingredient in Phynova Joint and Muscle Relief Tablets, which have just been licensed by drug safety watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Healing power: Sigesbeckia is the active ingredient in a new drug which have just been licensed by safety watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency . The tablets are expected to go on sale online within the next month. Many herbal products have vanished from sale in recent years after a 2004 EU directive banned any medicines that were not licensed from being sold. The directive also made it more difficult for medicines to get a licence as it demanded they had to have been in use for 30 years, of which at least 15 years had to be in the EU. Some Western herbal medicines have managed to gain licences in a process costing thousands of pounds to verify their ingredients. But the Phynova tablets are the first traditional Chinese medicine to be approved. Robert Miller, chief executive of Oxford-based Phynova, said he was ‘extremely proud’, adding: ‘This has come from years of working with our Chinese colleagues. Helping weed: Sigesbeckia is renowned for its ability to treat aches and pains  caused by arthritis . ‘Britain can now benefit from having access to high quality, regulated Chinese medicines.’ He also said that the company is planning to apply for a licence for a second traditional Chinese medicine, a cold and flu remedy. Dr Chris Etheridge, a medical herbalist and adviser to Potter’s Herbals, celebrated the ‘good news’, adding that Sigesbeckia, which is not commonly used in the West, ‘offers an alternative to those who prefer not to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for muscle and joint pain’. But Michael McIntyre, chairman of the European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association, warned that the new product demonstrates the difficulties the EU rules created for supplying herbal products safely to the public. He said it is ‘almost impossible to satisfy the licensing conditions’. He added that some people have therefore turned to the internet to buy unlicensed products, but this means they have ‘no idea whether they are safe or effective’. According to figures from market researchers Ipsos MORI, at least six million Britons have consulted a Western or traditional Chinese herbal practitioner in the last two years.","Drug containing ‘pig pungent weed’ has just been licensed .

"When Tony Ansell was given an Airfix kit at was six-years-old, it was something of an inspiration. Twenty years on the keen model maker has created a fleet of radio controlled warships at his workshop in Ferndown in Dorset. Each warship is made to scale, using original Royal Navy blueprints and photographs to ensure they capture a snapshot in time when the vessels were in action. Model maker Tony Ansell  spent the last 20 years making scale models of radio controlled navy warships. His Dorset workshop features models of HMS Campbeltown (top), HMS Hood (middle) and HMS Fencer (bottom) Mr Ansell, a former plumber, uses original Royal Navy blueprints to make the scale models of the warships . And so dedicated is the former plumber to his craft that he is in the process of writing to the Queen to ask for permission to name one of his ships - a G3 battlecruiser - Beatty because the original was cancelled and therefore never named. 'You need to put in the research and I tend to pick a particular time in the ship's life to make it at because warships went in for refits lots and could be different from year to year,' said Mr Ansell, 63. 'I like to make ships you don't see at model shows very often and bigger ones are more of a challenge because you have to be more detailed.' Mr Ansell uses fibreglass to make the hull of the ships and flexible sheets of 1mm thick plastic for the rest of the structure. He researches each of the vessels before he makes them, using photographs to ensure accuracy. Most of the other items such as guns and aircraft are made from resin and mini Airfix kits. Constructing the models is a painstaking process, sometimes taking longer than it took to make the actual warships themselves. It took nine years for Mr Ansell to complete HMS Dreadnought  laying each of the planks individually . Replica fighter planes sit on the deck of one of Mr Ansell's boats that make up his fleet of model warships . HMS Campbeltown was an American ship that was eventually transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 . Mr Ansell's most recent build, the battleship HMS Dreadnought, is a 6ft long, 1:196 scale model and has as taken him nine years to finish - nine times longer than it took to build the actual warship in 1906. But the project was delayed by a lack of photographs of the vessel and he built two other models during that time. He has also made models of aircraft carrier HMS Fencer, HMS Campbeltown and HMS Hood, the ship sunk by the Germans in World War Two. As well as his scale warships, Mr Ansell has also created replicas of tanks, keeping them all to precise scale . The 63-year-old makes the models in his Dorset workshop and is seen consulting an original blueprint . The HMS Dreadnought replica (left) was the most time consuming of all Mr Ansell's models and each additional part, from aircraft to weapons and fighters is made with similar attention to detail from resin or airfix kits (right) He is making a G3 battlecruiser - a ship that was planned but not built because a naval treaty came into place that limited the weight of warships. Because the G3 was cancelled, it was never given a name, so Tony plans to write to the Queen to ask her permission to name his HMS Beatty, after the British admiral at the Battle of Jutland. HMS Fencer - 1:196 scale model . The original HMS Fencer was an aircraft carrier, commissioned in February 1943 . Escorted Atlantic, African and Russian convoys . Also took part in a strike on a German battleship . HMS Hood -  7ft long, 1:1,128 scale model . Original was an Admiral Class battlecruiser . Warship sunk by the Germans during World War Two . Had an overall length of 860ft . HMS Dreadnought - 6ft long, 1:196 scale model . Took Mr Ansell nine years to finish . The Dreadnought was introduced in 1906 and became an important development in naval technology . It was the first naval warship to have a uniform battery, rather than just a few guns . He added: 'With the Dreadnought I even laid the planks on the deck one by one. It took six months just to do the deck but it looks like the real McCoy. 'The G3 was never named because it wasn't built. Some names were banded about but they were then put to other ships. 'So I want to keep with naval tradition and write to the Queen to ask for permission to name it after Admiral Beatty. 'The Navy do it when they name ships and I want to make things official. I'll ask her if there's something else she'd rather I called it.' On average, a ship takes about three years to build and his hobby has cost Mr Ansell several thousands over the years. He said: 'Back in the 90s, my ambition was to make a 10-foot model and I got laughed at, but I kept making models bigger and bigger. 'The next one I'm going to do is nine-foot so I think I've proved the doubters wrong.' Mr Ansell belongs to a model boat display team in Portsmouth who stage battles with their ships and even use pyrotechnics, which means they have to have a health and safety team at the ready.","Tony Ansell has been making model warships for the last 20 years at home .

"The average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing, scientists have claimed. In research looking back over IQ tests from the past few decades, they found that the tests were becoming harder - but people were still doing just as well. But the reasons why people are becoming smarter is not known - with theories including better education and improved medical care. Researchers at Kings College London looked at scores over 64 years. In total, more than 200,000 participants in IQ tests were studied. Since 1950, average intelligence was found to have risen by about 20 IQ points. Explanations include better education (stock image shown) and improved medical care . The research, titled A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Raven's Progressive Matrices and reported by William Kremer for the BBC, was published in the journal intelligence. Carried out by Peera Wongupparaj, Veena Kumari and Robin Morris from Kings College London, they looked specifically at the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a separate study in December 2014 found - and its impact increases as the child ages. Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families. And the gap got wider throughout childhood, with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence. Scientists from Goldsmiths, University of London compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the Twins Early Development Study (Teds). The study is an on-going investigation socio-economic and genetic links to intelligence. This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence. In total, more than 200,000 participants from 48 countries over 64 years were studied in the research. Since 1950, it was found that the average intelligence had risen by the equivalent of 20 IQ points. 'RPM is a valid and reliable measure of general IQ, Dr Wongupparaj told MailOnline. 'Also, it is cultural-free test so that it has been widely used for nearly 80 years.' ‘IQ tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100, so this is a significant jump,’ the BBC reported. The research builds on earlier evidence from philosopher and psychologist James Flynn, from the University of Otaga in New Zealand. He had noticed that IQ tests were getting harder, but people were still getting similar scores on them - which became known as the Flynn Effect. This graph shows how the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) scores have been increasing over time. RPM is seen as an accurate way of measuring intelligence, and 'it is cultural-free test so that has been widely used for nearly 80 years,' Dr Wongupparaj told MailOnline . The research was carried out by scientists from Kings College London. They looked specifically at the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) - an example is shown. This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence . Apparently, if modern Americans took a test from a century ago, they would get a relatively high average IQ score of 130; vice versa, and our ancestors would score a measly average of 70. This equates to a three-point rise in IQ per decade. According to the new study, though, outside of the US the biggest change was clearly in developing countries, IQ was ‘catching up with the developed world’. ‘There are multiple possible reasons proposed for this phenomenon,’ they write. These include improved education, increased exposure to testing, improved medical care and nutritition and decreased family size. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that the instance of IQ increasing was not just true in general for the world as a whole - but could also be noticed on a much smaller scale. ‘The Flynn effect is strong enough to be showed in even small and non-representative samples as well as in the very young and older adults,’ the researchers conclude.","Researchers at Kings College London looked at scored over 64 years .

"Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son is to follow in his father's footsteps after he signed a deal to compete in the Formula 4 series, which nurtures young talents. Mick Schumacher has been snapped up by the Netherlands' Van Amersfoort Racing team after he finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father Michael is the most successful driver in Formula One history, with seven titles, but retired from the sport after a devastating ski accident left him in a coma. Family business: Mick Schumacher, 15, has signed a deal to race for Van Amersfoort Racing in Formula 4 . Experience: Mick finished runner-up in the world, European and German kart championship last year . Champion: Michael Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, with seven titles . Fritz van Amersfoort, owner of the racing team that bears his name, said of Schumacher Jr, 'we have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick is the first driver named by Van Amersfoort Racing for the 2015 season. The team propelled Max Verstappen - son of Schumacher Sr's 1994 Benetton F1 team-mate Jos - to prominence in Formula 3 last season. Verstappen Jr, 17, will now race for Toro Rosso in the 2015 F1 season. 'In the last couple of years, it has become a tradition for us that we offer the runner-up from the German junior karting championship a test session in our simulator,' added Mr Van Amesfoort. 'This is handled by the DMSB, the German motorsport authority, and that is how we first got in touch with Mick Schumacher last autumn. 'He spent a full day in the simulator at our headquarters in the Netherlands, then we witnessed him during a test session at Valencia and, eventually, we reached an agreement to compete together in this year's ADAC Formula 4 series.' Mick Schumacher could follow the path of Max Verstappen, who also raced for Van Amersfoort Racing . 17-year-old Verstappen will drive for Toro Rosso in the 2015 F1 season after his prodigious rise . Announced in 2013 and first run last year, Formula 4 is an open-wheeled motor racing competition designed for junior drivers as a stepping stone to Formula One. Vehicles may have a maximum power output of 160hp and must cost less than €9,500. There is no global championship, but individual nations can host their own championships according to rules and specifications of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. Michael Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in Meribel in the French Alps in December 2013. He emerged from an induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula One driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. Michael Schumacher was seriously injured after a skiing accident in December 2013 . Schumacher snr is Formula One's most successful ever driver with seven world championships . Schumacher takes the chequered flag upon winning the Canadian Grand Prix for Benetton in 1994 . And in January a report claimed Schumacher's recovery had reached a point where he now cries when he hears the sound of his children's voices. According to an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, the fact Schumacher is reacting with tears to his loved ones' voices is 'valuable news', after a year of seeming 'really far away'. Writing in the paper, Giorgio Terruzi said: 'Schumi cries. And sometimes mysteriously. He cries when he hears his children, his wife's voice, his dogs. In the silence of that room, a tear runs down his thin face at a known sound.' He added: 'Inside this we can find... There is life, enclosed in a drop; there is the strength of a man who is moved and that moves each of us. We have his tears, his senses exposed.' However, Schumacher's manager has disputed reports of her client's recovery, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation.","Mick Schumacher came second last year in Germany's kart championships .

"Nazakat Ali, 30 (above), has been jailed for 14 years for attempted murder after stabbing his 27-year-old wife Shahzana Kausar 15 times during an argument . A domineering husband tried to murder his wife by stabbing her 15 times after she said she wanted to take up English lessons. Nazakat Ali, 30, stabbed his 27-year old partner Shahzana Kausar during a row at their home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after she made it clear she wanted to enrol at college to study English. Manchester Crown Court heard how he grabbed a knife and, in front of his own mother, stabbed his wife more than a dozen times as he refused to accept that she wanted to gain a 'degree of independence'. Following the attack on September 29 last year, Ali fled the scene and Ms Kausar was left lying in a pool of the blood on the floor. She was later flown to hospital where doctors carried out two emergency operations to heal stab wounds to her neck, collarbone, abdomen, ribs and a severed artery which caused her to lose one third of her body's blood. Ali has now pleaded guilty to attempted murder and has been jailed for 14 years by the judge who called him a 'dangerous man'. The court heard how the incident unfolded after Ms Kausar returned home from the Jobcentre and told her husband that she had been advised to enrol at college to improve her English. He told his mother, who was living with the couple at the property, that he was not going to allow his wife to join the course, and an argument ensued. The couple had known each other for 16 years and married in Pakistan in 2005 before moving to the UK together in 2008. Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said: 'When the defendant and Shahzana were upstairs in their bedroom, he became angry and started shouting and slapped her across the head. She asked for her mobile phone so she could contact her sister or the police, but he refused to return it. 'She left the house to walk to her sister's address but was followed by the defendant. She asked for help from a bystander but the defendant apologised and they returned home. Once they had returned home they sat in the kitchen with the defendant's mother. 'Shahzana told the defendant if he were to behave in a similar manner again, she would leave him. 'He became angry and punched her, knocking her to the floor. He picked up a knife from a kitchen drawer and repeatedly stabbed her. 'She described it as ""the way he stabbed me, it was like dying"". She begged him to stop, which he did, before running from the house.' Ali's mother provided a statement to the court which said the pair had been abusive towards each other and Ali had stabbed his wife when she ran at him. When Ms Kausar was taken to hospital, X-rays revealed she had blood within her chest, which had to be drained, and that she was bleeding from an artery. She also had further stab wounds to her liver, colon and pancreas. She has since started to recover from her injuries but is still undergoing surgical treatment and has a constant pain in her left shoulder. She said the incident had changed her life significantly and that she had even even contemplated self-harm as a result of the attack. Ali stabbed his wife after becoming angry at their home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester (pictured), when she told him she wanted to enrol at college to learn English. He left her for dead after the attack and fled the scene . The court heard how Ali handed himself in to police the day after the attack. The judge was also told how he was convicted in 2009 for his part in a burglary in which he and an accomplice forced their way into a family home, gagged a 40-year-old woman and threatened her and her baby with a screwdriver. Ian Harris, defending, said: 'His family have told me that when they visited the defendant he has been in tears when he has discussed what he did. 'A letter he has written may be starting to point towards maturity which clearly hasn't been demonstrated hitherto. He has set out how deeply sorry and remorseful he is for his actions towards his wife and family. 'It is a case of loss of temper. An intent to kill formed in the heat of the moment. The incident itself would have taken a matter of seconds.' Passing sentence, Judge David Stockdale QC told Ali: 'There was an argument between you, triggered, it seems, by her express wish to attend a college course to improve her English. 'That wish was, in my judgement, a wish for a degree of independence on her part, which you would not tolerate. 'Your desire to dominate and control her, it seems to me, lies at the heart of the dreadful events which were to follow. 'The attack was sustained and repeated. There was extensive life-threatening internal injuries. You took a lethal bladed weapon and used it repeatedly on a defenceless woman - your own wife in her own home. 'You are, in my judgement, a dangerous man. I am unhesitatingly of the opinion there is a significant risk of serious harm from future offences committed by you.' Following the sentencing, detective sergeant Louise Ashurst described the attempted murder as 'one of the most brutal and horrific attacks I have experienced as a detective.' She said: 'The injuries she suffered were so severe that the first officer on the scene thought she was dead, her defensive injuries showed that he stabbed her with such force that the knife went right through her hand, breaking her forefinger. 'It was only after the officer felt for her pulse, that he realised she was still alive and even then it was touch and go, with the victim undergoing life-threatening surgery and several harrowing weeks in intensive care. 'But the victim was strong and brave, and I hope this sentence goes some way to helping her overcome what has happened.'","Nazakat Ali stabbed his wife Shahzana Kausar 15 times during argument .

"Claims: Aleksandar Kovacic, pictured outside the High Court in London today, said he could barely walk after a fatal head-on collision in 2010 . A 40-year-old man who was seeking nearly £1million in damages after a fatal head-on collision will not receive any of the money after he was secretly filmed enjoying a family trip to the seaside. Aleksandar Kovacic said he could barely walk and was incapable of returning to his job as a support worker after the crash in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in March 2010. The aspiring social worker was awarded £97,000 in damages - a fraction of the amount he sought - but is unlikely to see any of it after being ordered to pay back insurers and cover legal fees. A senior judge ruled he had 'exaggerated' his disabilities and tried to 'play-act' his way to a huge payout at London's High Court today. Aspiring social worker Mr Kovacic suffered serious injuries when 68-year-old Norma Wroe drove into the path of his car on the A422 near Newport Pagnell. Mrs Wroe died in the crash. He suffered fractures to both legs, his right arm, a rib and his back, as well as soft tissue damage, and remained in hospital for two months. He also had to undergo further surgery on two occasions after developing infections in his wounds. Mr Kovacic, from Bedford, Bedfordshire, sued Mrs Wroe's estate and her insurers, Aviva, for £900,000 in damages. Aviva admitted the crash was caused by Mrs Wroe's negligence. In his claim, which was initially supported by clinical experts, Mr Kovacic said he could barely walk, was unable to work and was suffering depression. But Aviva's suspicions were raised and he was placed under surveillance in 2013. Footage shot by private investigators also showed him driving nearly 200 miles on a day out with his family, taking his children to school and climbing in and out of his car with ease. He was also seen walking without a stick and carrying heavy items. However, he did use his stick, and appeared to limp and get in and out of a taxi with difficulty, while attending an appointment with a Harley Street medical expert for the defence. After viewing the videos, which were recorded on nine days over several weeks, Judge Neil Bidder said he was sure Mr Kovacic's description of his disabilities 'simply could not be believed'. All of the experts who had backed Mr Kovacic's case changed their opinions in light of the footage. Aviva had offered to settle his claim for £350,000, but he insisted on fighting for more in court even after his lawyers withdrew from the case. Mr Kovacic, who represented himself, told the High Court in London that the undercover footage was 'unrepresentative' and did not show him on his 'bad days'. He insisted that he could not return to his job or achieve his ultimate career aim of training to be a social worker. But Judge Bidder said the odds against him only having been filmed on his 'bad days' were 'huge'. He told the court: 'I have concluded that Mr Kovacic can simply not be believed in relation to his condition and, except where his claim is supported by reliable other evidence, I am unable to accept his account.' 'I'm afraid that, having seen him give his evidence and having seen the DVDs, I am driven to the conclusion that he deliberately exaggerated his condition.' 'Could not be believed' A senior judge ruled Mr Kovacic had 'exaggerated' his disabilities and tried to 'play-act' his way to a huge payout at London's High Court today, pictured. He was awarded £97,525 in damages . The judge also said that he would have been able to keep his job, from which he was let go in 2012 after nearly two years on sick leave, had he not exaggerated his condition. He added: 'I'm afraid to say that I find as a fact that, had he not been exaggerating his symptoms, but returned to work prior to March 2012, he would not have been dismissed by his employers.' The judge found that Mr Kovacic was entitled to £97,525 damages from the date of his accident to when he substantially recovered, which was about the end of 2011. However, he will not see any of the cash, and Aviva's lawyers said he would probably end up owing the insurance company money. He had received interim compensation before Aviva's suspicions were raised and was also ordered to pay legal costs which are likely to run into six figures.","Aleksandar Kovacic suffered serious injuries in head-on collision in 2010 .

"Decision day: David Cameron's daughter Nancyis among tens of thousands of children who will found out today if they have got in to their first choice . Almost half the children in some areas were yesterday denied their preferred secondary school as pressure grows on places. Tens of thousands of ten and 11-year-olds across the country were not given their first choice when councils announced allocations. Cities including London and Birmingham saw three in ten miss out on their favourite, while in several areas that figure was four or nearly five in ten. Competition for places is getting fiercer in many areas which have seen population increases fuelled partly by immigration. Experts said the crisis over places which has affected primary schools for several years is now transferring to secondary schools. However, efforts to expand schools in metropolitan areas where demand is most acute have been slowed by the high costs of creating new buildings. Councils notified parents of their children’s fate yesterday by email or letter, meaning some families will not receive the news for several days. The allocations to more than half a million families are likely to result in a large number of appeals. In the capital, where applications rose by 4 per cent to 84,140 compared to 80,966 the previous year, 32 per cent did not get their first choice. And while 14 per cent managed to get their second choice, 6 per cent failed to get into any of their six choices. In Hammersmith and Fulham, 45 per cent were denied their first choice. In Wandsworth and Westminster 42 per cent missed out. In Birmingham, where 14,625 of the city’s pupils applied for a secondary place, 32 per cent were rejected by their first choice, a slight rise on last year’s 30 per cent. In Bristol, 25 per cent missed out on their favourite school while Buckinghamshire was unable to offer first choice places to 26 per cent. In Essex, 14 per cent did not get their first choice. In Birmingham a third of children missed out on their first choice of secondary school, with just 68.5 per cent getting their first option. In other areas - such as Cornwall - almost all children got the place they wanted . This graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice of school. Many children living in big cities will have to go to their second choice . David Cameron is to become the first Conservative prime minister to send a child to a state secondary school after receiving offers of a place yesterday. His daughter Nancy is understood to have applied to several London schools, including some of the most competitive in the country. ‘We have been round three or four schools in London and had a good look,’ the Prime Minister said recently. ‘My daughter has got a very large say in the matter.’ Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha are understood to have included the Grey Coat Hospital academy, a Church of England school a short walk from Downing Street, on their list of applications. The school is rated outstanding by Ofsted and is one of the most sought-after in the area, with seven applications for every place. It takes girls aged 11 to 18 and boys only in the sixth form. The Camerons have also considered Lady Margaret School, an academy in Fulham, West London, also a Church of England school rated outstanding. And they are thought to have looked at Holland Park School, one of the first comprehensives in the UK where Labour grandees such as the late Tony Benn sent their children. Mrs Cameron, who was educated at private Marlborough College, is said to have told friends she is keen for Nancy to have a ‘normal education’. Yesterday’s figures show around 42 per cent of applicants in Westminster have not been given their first preference of school. In some areas competition was less fierce, with 98 per cent getting their first preference in Cornwall and more than 95 per cent in Swindon, Derbyshire, Doncaster, Durham and East Riding. Under the admissions system, families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria. Factors can include proximity to the school, faith or ability – with some schools specifying how many bright, average and low ability pupils they will admit. Some of the most popular choices are grammar and faith schools, as well as well-performing free schools and academies. Helen Jenner, chairman of the Pan London Admissions Board, said: ‘Demand for places is growing, as we are beginning to see the pressure on primary schools transfer to secondary.’ Rachel Burrows, editor of the Netmums website, said: ‘It has never been harder to get your child into the school you want. The system is simply not working for schools or parents.’ Early analysis suggests that, outside the capital, around one in seven pupils will miss out on their first choice of school this year. This figure is based on 23 authorities that gave full figures. In London, just over two-thirds – 67.56 per cent – of applicants have got their top choice. The proportion of children gaining their first choice of secondary school fell for the first time in five years in 2014. Around 14.8 per cent of applicants – about 77,100 youngsters – missed out, up from 13.3 per cent in 2013. A Department for Education spokesman said the Government had invested more than £5billion to create more than 445,000 new school places since 2010. He added: ‘Last year over 95 per cent of parents got one of their top three choices.’ Low figures: Of the parents who applied to Birmingham City Council, pictured, one in three were rejected from their first choice school and one in ten were offered places outside the city .

"Millions of ducks raised for the dinner table are being denied essentials like a pond to swim and bathe in, warns the RSPCA. The charity is calling on families to boycott duck meat until farmers and supermarkets implement dramatic improvements to the way the birds are treated. It says the reality for the 14.3m ducks reared for meat in the UK every year is very different from the Beatrix Potter and Jemima Puddle-duck view of farm life. Scroll down for video . Poor conditions: Ducks are often crammed into barns in their thousands in the semi-darkness without water to swim in . In fact, most are reared in barns, where thousands of birds are crammed together in semi-darkness, and they never get a chance to get their feet wet, let alone swim around. The RSPCA said not one of these ducks are raised according to the minimum welfare standards it supports under its ‘Freedom Food’ scheme and it is demanding new laws to improve conditions. However, producers insist there is no need to provide ponds as ducks ‘have a low motivation to swim for any length of time’. A survey by the RSPCA found most consumers have no idea how the ducks are raised and most would be appalled that they do not get access to water to swim and bathe in. Calling for action: The RSPCA wants conditions to improve for the millions of ducks reared for meat in the UK . There are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink, and the duck industry’s own standards, through the Red Tractor scheme, only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water. Welfare expert at the RSPCA, Dr Marc Cooper, said: ‘Ducks are waterfowl, therefore they should be provided with water that allows them full body access. This is not only good for their health, as it helps keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers clean, but it also allows them to do the things they naturally want to do. ‘It is disheartening that we are in a situation where the vast majority of farmed ducks are not provided with full body access to water. ‘We want consumers to know the facts about how farmed ducks have been reared, and we want the industry to take on board the evidence within the report and help improve the lives of millions of ducks.’ A YouGov survey for the RSPCA found that four in ten parents are likely to take children to a local pond or lake to feed the ducks. Yet the vast majority - 93 per cent - were unaware that it is not a legal requirement for farmed ducks to have bathing water they can get into. There are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink, and the duck industry’s own standards only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water . Some 78 per cent were ‘appalled’ that ducks farmed for their meat may never get access to bathing water. A new RSPCA report calls on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made. It warns: ‘It is very difficult for consumers to find any meat from ducks reared to welfare standards the RSPCA would find acceptable. ‘So unless they can be confident that this is the case, they are strongly encourage to avoid buying duck meat due to welfare concerns associated with poorer rearing conditions.’ ‘Unfortunately current UK law does not require water to be provided to ducks for anything other than drinking, and ducks may only have access to water from drinkers such as nipple drinkers. ‘We believe the law should be changed so that producers are legally required to provide farmed ducks with suitable open water facilities that allow them fully body access.’ The British Poultry Council said ducks do not need water to swim and bathe in and it is not practical for farmers to provide it. The organisation claimed ducks ‘have a low motivation to swim for any length of time’. British favourite: The RSPCA have called on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made . It has set up a Duck Assurance Scheme (DAS) to cover rearing policies and ensures there is enough water to allow the ducks to dip their heads in and use the water to preen their feathers. The BPC said the standards used by the RSPCA ‘have been drawn up by a working group lacking in any practical experience of growing ducks on a commercial scale’. It said: ‘It is not practical to provide deep water for swimming - especially in indoor systems- and ducks do have a low motivation to swim for any length of time. ‘Open water sources, particularly those in which ducks can get in, have poor water quality which can lead to bacterial infections of the eyes and nostrils. Keeping eyes, nostrils, feet and plumage clean is key to good duck health and welfare and is provided for the form of open water resource in the DAS. ‘The DAS requires that ducks must have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds, to exhibit normal behaviour, to bathe, and have access to wholesome feed and clean fresh drinking water. ‘DAS standards are built on science and are regularly reviewed and amended where new research supports good practice in the industry.’","RSPCA wants conditions improved for 14.3m ducks reared for meat in UK .

"A little girl has been cured of a rare a condition that made milk shoot out of her nose. Georgie Yorke was born with birth defects that meant her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach. This meant that whenever her mother tried to feed her with a bottle, milk would come back out of her nose and mouth. Georgie was rushed to surgery to undergo an operation to connect the oesophagus to the trachea just 22 hours after she was born on July 10 2014. Georgie Yorke, now eight months, was born with birth defects meaning whenever she was fed, milk shot back out of her nose and mouth. She is pictured with parents Stacey Ross, 25 and Vic Yorke . Georgie was born with the birth defects oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - meaning her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach . Georgie was rushed for an operation to correct the defects when she was just two days old. She has since had five more operations to further correct the problem and rid her of scar tissue . Georgie, aged eight months, is now out of hospital and finally able to enjoy life at home with parents Stacey Ross, 25, and Vic Yorke, 19, from Consett, County Durham. Ms Ross, a travel agent, said: 'When Georgie was born, I was rushed in for an emergency C-section, so I didn't get to hold her in the beginning. 'When I finally tried to feed her that night, the milk was coming out of her nose and mouth and going everywhere - almost like when you drink a fizzy drink and it shoots out of your nose. 'I thought it might have been me - and because I was trying to feed her on my own. 'But when the midwife came around to help me, she realised something was wrong as the milk was going down the wrong tube and Georgie's breathing wasn't right. 'She was taken away from me a few times in the night and taken into special care. It wasn't until they X-rayed her that I was told what was wrong.' Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects the baby's oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. It often happens together with another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea). This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. It's not known why the defect develops, but it's more likely to happen in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy (polyhydramnios). The defect means the baby won't be able to swallow and digest food safely, or at all. Oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula are thought to affect about one in 2,500-3,500 births. If they're not corrected soon after birth, the pouch at the end of the oesophagus may fill with food and saliva, which can overflow into the baby's windpipe. Source: NHS Choices . Doctors diagnosed Georgie with oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - two conditions that tend to occur together. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. The condition often occurs alongside another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula. This is where the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea) are connected, rater than being separate. This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. Georgie was kept in surgery for five hours and spent six days in intensive care at the Great North Childrens' Hospital, Newcastle. Ms Ross said: 'I was shocked to see her go straight into surgery, but I didn't really know what to think at first. 'All I could think when I saw her lying there was that I wished it could have been me. 'I couldn't wait for the three of us to get home together, so it wasn't a nice feeling to know that we couldn't even put the banners up at home to welcome the baby.' Since the initial surgery, Georgie has had a further five operations to correct her tubes and scar tissue. She will have to undergo further operations, but is currently developing well. Ms Ross said: 'We've had major setbacks and she's been so poorly but she's such a bright and bubbly little thing. Georgie is now at home enjoying time with her family. Her mother said: 'We've had major setbacks and she's been so poorly but she's such a bright and bubbly little thing.She does everything a normal baby would do' 'Georgie is a lovely baby. She's so bright and clever. She does everything  a normal baby would do. 'She loves peekaboo and is full of smiles.' Bruce Jaffray, consultant paediatric surgeon at the Great North Childrens' Hospital, said: 'A tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormality with the oesophagus which develops incorrectly - essentially leading to two blind endings to the oesophagus, the lower ending of which stopping at the windpipe. 'Patients undergo surgery whereby the two ends are stitched together and usually do well after that. Any additional medical conditions diagnosed are unrelated. 'When baby's first attempt at feeding is met with coughing and spluttering, nurses pass a tube down the nose and into the stomach and perform an X-ray. 'If the tube gets stuck in the chest as opposed to reaching the stomach, a tracheoesophageal fistula is diagnosed.'","Georgie Yorke, now eight months, was born with oesophageal atresia .

"Any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be. And it is a daily reality Lili Kirtin-Grossman - who is only eight - knows all too well. Before Lili, from Barnet, north London, even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed, as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family. Scroll down for video . 'Capable' Lili Kirtin-Grossman, 8, helps to support her mum Sarah, who suffers from a degenerative spine condition and has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, with looking after her two younger siblings . The young schoolgirl knows how to work the family washing machine and will frequently put on a load of washing before going to school in a morning . Lili has been identified as one of Britain's youngest carers, looking after her younger siblings Kaya and Tyler as well as her mother, Sarah. The 37-year-old, who is an ex-dancer, is registered disabled and suffers from a degenerative condition - scoliosis - which causes the spine to curve. The painful illness not only makes it difficult for her to walk but can leave her in agony. In addition, Sarah has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, which has seen her sectioned twice. Sarah is separated from Lili's father Graeme and has two other younger children, three-year-old Tyler, who suffers from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and two-year-old Kaya, who, more often than not, Lili is charged with taking care of. She told the Mirror: 'I've always done lots to help Mummy. She wakes me up in the morning around 7am - I'm normally a bit tired, but I get myself dressed and then help Kaya out of her cot, because we share a room.' Mum Sarah (left) says she feels guilty that she has to ask Lili to help with family life. Lili (right) can prepare family meals including pie and mash and spaghetti bolognese and knows how to use a knife safely . An average day continues with Kaya preparing 'Coco Pops and milk' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea. Lili adds: 'Some mornings I'll run Mummy a bath. Depending on how well she is, she can dress herself, but I help with things she finds hard, like putting on her socks and shoes. Then, when we've all got our bags and coats on, I go to school.' Lili's story is all too familiar. According to the charity Carers Trust, there are currently estimated to be at least 180,000 carers under 18 in the UK. The organisation has launched a new website, Babble.carers.org, specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups. The charity adds that many children feel they can't share the burden of what's happening at home, with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone. Another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying, with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name-calling at school. Lili is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she doesn't feel like she's missing out: 'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps' For Lili, school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home. When the school bell rings in the afternoon, Lili can often find herself head of the kitchen, preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash. Although Sarah arranges for food shopping to be delivered, little Lili is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops. 'I'm used to shop assistants and customers looking surprised and asking me if I'm by myself,' smiles Lili. 'I just explain my Mummy is outside waiting, and I make sure I get the right change.' Other household chores include hoovering, separating our colours from whites and putting on a wash-load and doing the dishes...tasks which leave mum Sarah feeling wracked with guilt. 'I feel constantly guilty that Lili does so much for me and the other kids,' says Sarah. 'I should be looking after her.' Sarah says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner Graeme in 2014, quickly plunging Lili into the role as key carer. Sarah (left) separated from her partner Graeme last year, leaving Lili (centre) a key ally in caring for her younger children Kaya (far left), now 2 and Tyler, (far right) now 3 . Time for fun: Mum Sarah makes sure Lili (above right) is well supported. The eight-year-old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it . 'She's always been so grown up and capable. Graeme and I decided to split up last year – it's not easy living with someone who's bipolar. He's a good father and the children see him all the time. 'I do worry Lili will end up resenting me one day. I ask her if she wishes she was like her friends, but she just says, ""This is my home, you're my mum, why would I want anything else?"" I'm lucky to have her.' In a bid to inject some fun into Lili's life, Sarah ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be. She has support from counsellors and is a member of a young carer's club which focuses on enabling Lili and other children in similar situations to kick back and have fun. So, does Lili worry that she's missing out? The resilient youngster seems to take her demanding role in her stride, saying only that she enjoys spending time with her friends and with her dad. She adds that all she'd really like is to 'make mummy better'. 'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps and biscuits while they watch TV. I wish I could have more play dates, but it's hard for Mummy to have extra children round.' 'I do like helping Mummy, but I can get fed up sometimes when she keeps sending me up the stairs to fetch nappies or put clothes away. I'll say, ""I don't want to"", and sometimes she'll say, ""It's OK, I'll leave it here and you can do it later.""' 'I never wish I was anyone else. But if there is one thing in the world I could wish for, it would be to make Mummy better.'

"'Happy Feet' may have triggered the world's interest into the largest penguin species, but little was actually known about the fluctuating numbers of the emperor penguin, until now. The very first study into how the Antarctic's climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years has been conducted by a team of researchers, including some from the University of Tasmania and the Australian Antarctic Division. It was found that at some point, the Antarctic was too cold for these birds. Scroll down for video . The current sea ice conditions are optimal for the emperor penguin population, however this may not last if global warming persists . The largest penguin species in the world is currently thriving in the Antarctic with numbers drastically increasing over the last 12,000 years . During the last ice age, conditions became so severe that the emperor penguin population was around seven times smaller than it is now. Temperatures were at least 15 degrees colder on average than they are today and just three colonies of the penguin survived that period. Lead researcher Jane Younger said that despite emperor penguins being accustomed to temperatures of minus 30C, the last Ice Age seems to have been a snap too cold for them. The study shows how the climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years, finding that Antarctica was once too cold for them . The warming has made it easier for the emperor penguins to feed as the sea ice has melted and lessened the distance to the ocean . 'Due to there being about twice as much sea ice compared to current conditions, the penguins were unable to breed in more than a few locations around Antarctica,' Ms Younger said. 'The distances from the open ocean, where the penguins feed, to the stable sea ice where they breed was probably too far.' The findings have suggested that the current sea ice conditions might be optimal for the emperor penguin population. With the species flourishing, the study has shown that their numbers began to increase over the last 12,000 years when temperatures rose and the sea ice began to decline. This warming would have made it easier for the penguins to access the ocean to feed. Researchers are currently unable to determine the future of the largest and heaviest penguin species as they are clearly very sensitive to climate change and the current ideal conditions for these birds may not last.","The first study into the fluctuating numbers of the emperor penguin species has been conducted by scientists .
During the last ice age, colonies were seven times smaller as opposed to the 50 thriving colonies now .

"A British holidaymaker who was caught driving at 110mph on New Zealand’s west coast claims he was speeding because his father had diarrhoea. Peter Lee, 47, offered the excuse when a police officer stopped him for driving at nearly double the 60mph speed limit. Mr Lee, who has had bankruptcy proceedings in the UK, has been ordered to pay a fine of more than NZD$1,000 (about £500) or spend a short amount of time in jail. The incident involving a British holidaymaker comes after a series of crashes involving foreign drivers . Mr Lee, from Kent, was charged in New Zealand’s Queenstown District Court with dangerous driving on State Highway 6, near Hokitika, stuff.co.nz reported. Police said his claim that his father, a passenger, was ill with diarrhoea did not wash, and he was arrested and his rental car contract was cancelled. Mr Lee was in possession of £20 and NZD$365 (approximately £180) when he was arrested, and lawyer Sonia Vidal told court that his father was covering the costs of the trip. Judge Michael Crosbie said Mr Lee would be arrested at Auckland’s airport if a fine is imposed and he fails to pay it, stuff.co.nz reported. Mr Lee, from Kent, was stopped by police on Highway 6 on New Zealand's picturesque west coast . Mr Lee is scheduled to return to court tomorrow with enough funds to pay a fine. The judge told court: ‘I would be setting an untenable precedent if everyone on the road thought they could get away with a fine [for excessive speed]. There are already enough mixed messages out there about our roads or road abuse. ‘It should not be lost on him the maximum penalty is three months' jail. Unless he can make arrangements to pay he can go off to prison.’ A driver from Christchurch snatched car keys from a tourist who crossed the centre line at Lindis Pass . It comes as tourist drivers face greater scrutiny in New Zealand following a series of fatal crashes and confrontations with locals. Last week, a local motorist punched a tourist driver in the face in the town of Greymouth, leading police to urge residents not to take matters into their own hands, the New Zealand Herald reported. Police said the assault occurred for no reason at all. In recent weeks, locals have snatched car keys from at least four tourists who were accused of driving dangerously. In the latest incident, a foreign driver was filmed crossing the centre line in a rental car in the Lindis Pass, the Otago Daily Times reported. A Christchurch man who was following the tourist took his keys and showed the video to police, who ticketed the holidaymaker and had his rental contract revoked.","Police said Peter Lee's excuse that his father was ill did not wash .

"Only one woman in ten now stays at home to raise a family. Official figures show the proportion of women who are stay-at-home mothers has dropped by more than a third in the past two decades to a historic low. But there has been no compensating movement towards staying at home among men. Just over one man in 100 brings up his children full-time. Scroll down for video . Changing times: Official figures show the proportion of women who are stay-at-home mothers has dropped by more than a third in the past two decades to a historic low . The findings, published in an Office for National Statistics report, come at a time of continuing controversy over the pressure on mothers to go out to work and warnings over the welfare of children. Specifically, the figures detail those who give their occupation as ‘looking after family or home’. It does not include unemployed women, who are classed as looking for work. Last year Chancellor George Osborne published plans to encourage up to half a million more women into work by the start of 2016. He said he wanted to ‘support women who want to work’ by increasing access to child care. But at the time critics warned that the Government risked ‘stigmatising’ stay-at-home mothers. A childcare voucher scheme worth up to £1,200 to parents will go into operation next month. The report said the number of adult women who are ‘economically inactive’ – in other words they neither work nor want to work – has dropped fast since 1980. The report said the number of adult women who are ‘economically inactive’ – in other words they neither work nor want to work – has dropped fast since 1980 . It said: ‘There are many reasons for economic inactivity, such as study, looking after the family or home, sickness or disability, or not needing to work. ‘However the main reason for the decline in female inactivity rates over the longer period has been a decline in the share of women staying out of work to look after the family or home.’ The report said the proportion of women aged between 16 and 64 who are economically inactive because they are looking after the family or the home was 15.9 per cent in the spring of 1993, but fell by last autumn to 10.1 per cent. The figures showed the share of adult women who were stay-at-home mothers dropped below 15 per cent in 1995 and had reached 13.5 per cent when Tony Blair entered Downing Street in May 1997. The proportion of women who are stay-at-home mothers briefly dropped below 10 per cent last summer, and stood at 10.1 per cent at the end of 2014, the report said. By contrast, the proportion of men who choose to become house-husbands has remained low, despite the encouragement of politicians who believe men should take a larger share of childcare duties. In the spring of 1993 just 0.6 per cent of men were economically inactive because they were looking after family or home. While the proportion doubled over the next two decades, that still meant that just 1.2 per cent spent their days looking after home or children last year. The march of women into the labour market follows the increasing importance of education and jobs to girls, and the pressure on women to remain in work to pay ever-higher mortgages and keep up with the cost of living. But critics accuse successive governments of doing nothing to help those who want to bring up their own children since the decision to tax married couples separately in the late 1980s first left stay-at-home mothers without any support in the tax system. While working mothers have gained heavily from tax credits, increasing maternity leave, and state-subsidised childcare, those who stay at home with their children have no help from the benefits system. Helping trend: Last year Chancellor George Osborne published plans to encourage up to half a million more women into work by the start of 2016 . Laura Perrins, of Mothers At Home Matter, said: ‘It is a reflection of Government policy that women have to look for work when many want to look after their children instead. ‘The Government is only interested in income tax revenue. It has no interest in the wishes of mothers or the welfare of their children.’ Research for the Department for Education last year found more than a third of working mothers would like to give up their jobs and stay at home with their children. More than two out of three women are now in employment – 68.5 per cent in the last three months of last year, according to the ONS. At the beginning of the 1980s the level of working among women was barely over half. The percentages mean there are now more than 14million women in work, but only two million are full-time mothers or homemakers.","Number of stay-at-home mothers dropped by third in 20 years to record low .

'He wrote: ""Avijit Roy lives in America. So it’s not possible to kill him at this moment. But when he’ll return to the country, he’ll be murdered.""' Police added that Mr Roy's family had been threatened by the extremist, who is known for his Facebook postings against atheist writers, on several occasions on Facebook and Twitter. Farabi posted on Facebook last year: 'It's a holy duty of Bangalee Muslims to kill Avijit.' Major Maksudul Alam, another spokesman, said: 'He is the main suspect. [Roy’s] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times. Commander Mufti Mahmud Khan added: 'Farabi has admitted that he threatened Avijit but we are not sharing more information with you for the sake of the investigation. We need to ask him more.' Farabi was previously arrested over the murder of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haide, in February 2013 but was released on bail. The arrest comes a day after hundreds of mourners gathered around the blogger's coffin near Dhaka University to pay their respects. Ms Ahmed remains in hospital in a serious condition. Shahriar Kabir, a writer, said at the memorial: 'Free thinking in Bangladesh is become a great danger, all the free thinkers are at great risk. The scene immediately following the attack on the couple shows Ms Ahmed covered in blood. An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam' Ms Ahmed lying on a stretcher after the brutal attack. She is still recovering in hospital . A source in the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said the elite force had seen correspondence between Farabi (centre) and another person about killing Mr Roy . A RAB spokesman confirmed that Farabi (centre) is the main suspect and said that Mr Roy's family had been threatened by the extremist on several occasions . Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals, like Farabi (centre), had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism . 'We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.' As Mr Roy's father stood by, Kamal Hossain, the architect of Bangladesh's secular constitution, called the killing 'a heinous murder'. 'My question is, why did it take place?' said Mr Hossain. 'Avijit was killed because of his writing. By killing him, the killers have torn apart our constitution.' People also held a demonstration at the spot where he was killed and chanted slogans demanding 'immediate arrest and quick trial of the perpetrator'. The murder of Mr Roy, an atheist who advocated secularism in Bangladesh, came amid a crackdown on the country's Islamist groups after they increased their activities in recent years. A resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Roy came to visit Dhaka, the city of his birth, in the middle of last month and had been due to soon return home. Friends and relatives of Mr Roy sob as mourners come to pay respects to the writer, whose murder came amid a crackdown on Bangladesh's resurgent Islamist groups . Mr Roy's father Ajoy Roy, seated right, is comforted by fellow mourners at his son's funeral earlier today. Hundreds came to see Mr Roy's coffin at Dhaka University and lay flowers before his burial . Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism. The naturalised U.S. citizen, who was a bio-engineer as well as a blogger, had been receiving death threats online for years. Mr Roy and his wife have a daughter at university in the US. Ajoy Roy stood alongside his son's coffin as mourners filed past. He reiterated that Islamist militants were responsible for his son's death, but also blamed the government for failing to protect him despite repeated threats on his life. 'I am speechless at this moment of mourning. When the fundamentalists threatened, I informed the Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector General of Police,' he said. 'This murder has proved their utter failure.' An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam'. The extremists also said he was singled out because he is a U.S. citizen - and characterized the vicious killing as 'revenge' for attacks on ISIS in Syria. Orange and red flowers are laid on the coffin of Mr Roy as hundreds gather to pay their respects . Fellow mourners comfort Ajoy Roy as he looks down at his son's coffin at Dhaka University earlier today . A resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Roy came to Dhaka, the city of his birth, in the middle of last month and had been due to soon return home after attending the university book fair . US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the murder 'a shocking act of violence' that was 'horrific in its brutality and cowardice' Mr Roy, who was also a bio-engineer, had been receiving death threats online for years . Dozens of mourners queue to pay their last respects to Mr Roy at Dhaka University . Police have expressed shock that extremists struck at a university book fair, which was heavily guarded. Witnesses have even said officers and bystanders were there during the murder - but did nothing. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it 'a shocking act of violence' that was 'horrific in its brutality and cowardice'. Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of free speech campaign group Index on Censorship said: 'Our sympathies are with the family of Avijit Roy. 'Roy was targeted simply for expressing his own beliefs and we are appalled by his death and condemn all such killings.' Mr Roy was a family man and is pictured above with his wife in a photo believed to show their daughter, right, a student at a US college . In 2013, religious extremists targeted several secular bloggers who had demanded capital punishment for Islamist leaders convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh's war for independence. Blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed that year in a similar attack near his home in Dhaka after he led one such protest demanding capital punishment. In 2004, Humayun Azad, a secular writer and professor at Dhaka University, was also attacked by militants while returning home from a Dhaka book fair. He later died in Germany while undergoing treatment. Media group Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.","Farabi Shafiur Rahman previously threatened Avijit Roy's family .

"A popular noodle brand has launched an investigation after pictures emerged online apparently showing maggots crawling around the  lid of one their products. The disturbing photos were posted on numerous complaint websites by a person using the name 'Concerned Public'. They claimed they bought Maggi Noodles in Coles Coorparoo and Coles Morningside, two neighbouring suburbs in Brisbane's south-east. The owner of the infested cup of noodles said it was the second time in a month they had found maggots in their noodles and decided to take the matter public to 'alert people of the outbreak'. Scroll down for video . Popular brand Maggi have launched an investigation into their noodles after pictures emerged online (above) showing tiny maggots crawling around inside the lid of a cup of beef noodles . The pictures, which show the noodles with an expiry date of October 14, 2015 and September 10, 2015, appear to show a flesh coloured larva perched under the lid of a cup of instant, beef flavoured noodles. 'We have been buying Maggi Noodles for our kids as a snack for a long time and nobody should have to buy a product that has been imported to find maggots, or whatever the infestation is under the lip of the packet,' the concerned consumer said. 'Both times these have been in our cupboards for only a few hours, which is why we are posting this report. We reported it and they promised it would never happen again but it has.' Nestlé Australia say they received a complaint in February regarding the presence of maggots on a cup of Maggi Noodles. They told Daily Mail Australia they were investigating the incident together with the Brisbane City Council. 'The quality and safety of our products is a non-negotiable priority,' a Nestlé spokesperson said. 'For this reason, we have programs in all our factories and warehouses to monitor for and exclude food pests from the time we receive raw ingredients through to delivery to our customers.' The disturbing photos were posted on numerous complaint websites by a person who goes by the name 'Concerned Public' 'We understand that the larvae was found outside the cup of noodles but we take every complaint seriously and are currently conducting tests to identify the type and origin of the larvae.' Maggi is a particularly well known brand in Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Nigeria, the Philippines and Singapore for its instant noodles. The product, which is made by Swiss company Nestlé, is made and imported from Malaysia. They are also the manufacturer of a range of well-known Asian sauces, curry sauces, recipe bases and stir fry creations. Brisbane City Council told Daily Mail Australia they received notification of this complaint from Queensland Health on February 11, 2015. The council was not contacted directly by the owner of the noodle cup. The complaint said that the cup of Maggi Noodles was purchased from Coles Coorparoo, while online the poster also mentions Coles Morningside. 'A Council officer conducted an on-site investigation on 11 February 2015 and found that there was no evidence of any pest infestation or issues at Coles Coorparoo,' a council spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. The owner of the infested cup of noodles said it was the second time in a month they had found maggots (or larvae) in their noodles and decided to take the matter public to 'alert people of the outbreak' The pictures, which show the noodles with an expiry date of October 14, 2015, appear to show a flesh coloured larva perched under the lid of a cup of instant, beef flavoured noodles . 'The insect on the packaging was identified as an insect cocoon and it was found on the exterior of the packaging. There is no evidence it has originated from Coles.' The council said there is no food safety contamination risk from the cocoon and no further action will be taken against Coles. Coles Australia refused to comment on the presence of maggots in their Morningside or Coorparoo branches when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. In a public post online, the owner of the infested noodles said their family would never have known the maggots were in the cup, had they not been under the lid of the noodles. 'They look the same as the noodle and you digest them without even knowing, until you see them crawling out of the cup,' they said. According to the online poster, the larva break free of their cocoon when the noodles are heated with boiling water and crawl upwards. However, the owner of the cup claims the maggots fall into the cup because they have nowhere else to go. Maggots are the worm-like larvae of flies. They are usually found on food and eat faecal matter, decaying food and flesh. If ingested into the human digestive system, maggots can cause gastrointestinal problems, food poisoning and allergic reactions. Nestlé said this is an isolated incident and they want to reassure consumers that their suppliers must adhere to their strict, global, responsible sourcing guidelines wherever they operate.

"The artist who painted Bill Clinton's portrait for the National Gallery claims that there's more to the painting than meets the eye. Pennsylvania artist Nelson Shanks said that he slipped a Monica Lewinsky reference into the full-body portrait because the scandal was something he could never get 'completely out of his mind'. The painter said that the reference to former President Clinton's affair with the former White House intern was in the shadows of the painting, in the form of her infamous blue dress. Presidential: The full-body painting of Bill Clinton debuted in the National Portrait Gallery in 2006 (pictured above). The painter of the portrait, Nelson Shanks, has said that the dark space under the mantle represents the scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky which cast a shadow over Clinton's time in office . Scandal: Circled on the left, there's a shadow under the mantle that's in the silhouette of a dress. The portrait caused a stir at the time it was debuted as well, because it as though Clinton is not wearing a wedding band . 'If you look at the left-hand side of it there's a mantle in the Oval Office and I put a shadow coming into the painting and it does two things,' Shanks told Philly.com. Shadow: Lewinsky's infamous blue dress that she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair . He added: 'It actually literally represents a shadow from a blue dress that I had on a mannequin, that I had there while I was painting it, but not when he was there. 'It is also a bit of a metaphor in that it represents a shadow on the office he held, or on him.' Shanks, who's painted portraits of Princess Diana and Pope John Paul II, also said that Clinton was the 'most famous liar of all time'. The portrait caused controversy when it first was revealed in 2006 because it looks like Clinton is not wearing a wedding band, according to the New York Daily News. And according to Shanks, the Clintons 'hate the portrait' and are 'putting a lot of pressure' on the National Portrait Gallery to remove it. But a spokeswoman for the gallery has denied those accusations. When the painting was first debuted in 2006, it seemed as though Bill Clinton was quite pleased. 'I think the painting really feels like Bill Clinton,' he said then, according to the Washington Post. 'It has - I would not call it swagger... What? An informality? A looseness, a relaxed nature.' Shanks's most famous works include Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Luciano Pavarotti. His works spanned political and religious leaders, musicians and composers, actors and more. Controversy: Shanks (right) claims that he could never get Bill Clinton's controversy with Monica Lewinsky (left) 'completely out of his mind', especially when he was creating the portrait . He is a realist whose keen observation skills can be seen in his paintings that have an acute sense of detail, with wrinkles on hands and creases in pants. In 2009 the artist was awarded the Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Portrait Society of America, while in 2011 he was voted an honorary member into the Russian Academy for his works of art. Shanks said because of the Lewinsky controversy, Clinton was the hardest person for him to paint. Lewinsky, who was 22 when she started interning at the White House claimed to have sexual relations with Clinton nine times between 1995 and 1997. Clinton initially swore under oath that he ‘did not have sexual relations’ with Lewinsky but later admitted that he had misled the American public. Clinton famously said he 'did not have sexual relations' with Lewinsky when she claimed they had had relations nine times between 1995 and 1997 . Lewinsky revealed her relationship with the president involved oral sex but not sexual intercourse. She famously kept a blue dress which she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair. In late July, 1998, Monica had to turn a dress over to Kenneth Starr's investigators after signing an immunity agreement. A blood sample was taken from Clinton on August 3, and on August 17, the FBI reported its conclusion that Clinton was the source of the semen on the dress 'to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.' Clinton, however, was found not guilty and though he was impeached, he remained in office. And with speculations that Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, might launch her 2016 presidential bid in April, Bill Clinton could be back in office within two years.","Painter Nelson Shanks claims he put shadow of a dress in Clinton's portrait .

"As the classic Australian invention of the cask wine turns 50 this year, the best goon bags on offer are revealed. Many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century. So much so that in 2015, one in every three glasses of wine drunk in Australia actually comes out of a cask. A stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask hadn't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each Aussie only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year. This figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal. Scroll down for video . Drew Lambert, a member of the popular wine blog, taste-tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes, numbered and then pegged to the clothes line .

Drew encourages wine lovers to check out the variety of cask wines that is now on offer. 'If you haven’t ventured into the cask section of your local bottle shop lately, you’re in for a treat.

"The number of UK-bound African and Asian migrants in Calais has dropped by two thirds this winter as unprecedented numbers have succeeded in dodging border police and sneaking into Britain. On one day alone, Saturday January 17, 300 managed to gain entrance to the Channel Tunnel when chaos ensued after a truck caught fire, it emerged at the weekend. Hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks which board ferries linking Calais to the Kent coast. Many more opt for soft touch French Channel ports like Ouistreham and Cherbourg where border controls are less stringent. Waiting: Less than 1000 Africans and Asians are now estimated to be sleeping rough in squats and at three open air camps  close to the ferry terminal at Calais . The homeless migrants pay Albanian people-smugglers hundreds of pounds to be ferried south of Calais and loaded into lorries at motorway rest areas . Scores of migrants gained access to the ferry terminal in large numbers this winter when a winter storm blew down security fences and hundreds invaded truck car parks. Less than 1000 Africans and Asians are now estimated to be sleeping rough in squats and at three open air camps including the notorious 'Jungle 2' close to the ferry terminal. At the beginning of the year when a day centre opened on the outskirts of the port and began serving food to refugees, numbers were estimated at around 2,500. Local newspaper Nord Littoral reported at the weekend that 'It is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in Calais but one thing is certain : it has decreased significantly'. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson for a charity organisation as saying : 'We think there are about one thousand, maybe even fewer.' Hiding: Hundreds of migrants have stowed away on trucks boarding ferries linking Calais to the Kent coast . Camp: The homeless migrants in Calais pay Albanian people-smugglers hundreds of pounds to be ferried south of Calais and loaded into lorries at motorway rest areas . Pessimists at Calais predict that numbers of UK bound refugees will increase again to 300 plus during the spring and summer as new arrivals from Libya fleeing persecution by Islamic extremists start arriving . Numbers increased dramatically last summer as waves of Eritreans and Ethiopians hit the French Channel coast and set their sights on the UK. There were violent scenes as knife- wielding Sudanese nationals clashed with Eritreans over territorial disputes . Nord Littoral points to two main causes for the exodus . One is that 'more men and women are getting through' to the UK. The other is that migrants disheartened by months of living in cold and squalid tents have opted to apply for asylum and have been transferred to state run hostels as far afield as Burgundy, hundreds of miles south of Calais. A spokesman for the French Immigration department said, ' Since September 2014 more than 400 registered as applying for asylum and 45 percent of those have been given protection'. Making a dash: Scores of migrants gained access to the ferry terminal in large numbers this winter when a winter storm blew down security fences and hundreds invaded truck car parks . At the beginning of the year when a day centre opened on the outskirts of Calais, numbers were estimated at around 2,500. There are now said to be fewer than 1,000 people living there . At the beginning of February 60 Africans were ferried southwards from Calais and put up in a former Gendarmerie at the town of Pouilly en Auxois in Burgundy south east of Paris. Pouilly is just one of dozens of villages all over France which have been designated to accommodate asylum seekers whilst their applications are being processed . Residents of the small village have protested to local mayor Bernard Milloir at the influx of Sudanese, Eritreans and Ethiopians. Monsieur Milloir called the complains 'nauseating'. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart welcomed the decrease in migrants numbers at the port attributing the rise in numbers seeking French asylum to the opening of the day centre and installation of CCTV cameras. In January she called on aid groups to evacuate the filthy Jungle 2 squat and move migrants to a municipal camp nearby. Last year Madame Bouchart threatened to open a floodgate of migrants to swamp Britain and called for the UK border to be moved back to Dover to ease congestion at her port. Work is currently in progress at the Jules Ferry day centre to prepare overnight accommodation for women and children only due to be available at the end of the month.","Number of migrants reaching Britain from France has soared this winter .

"A man who took up an offer from two strangers in the street to smoke marijuana later had his clothes stolen by them after being assaulted, police in San Francisco said. The victim’s ordeal began in the early hours of Thursday morning when he was asked by two men in the Nob Hill area of the city to smoke marijuana with them. The 35-year-old Californian agreed and they walked to an apartment, or possibly a hotel room, in the 2000 block of Polk Street, according to local media. A man who took up an offer from two strangers in the street to smoke marijuana later had his clothes stolen by them after being assaulted, police in San Francisco said . Quoting a police source, nbcdfw.com said that after arriving in the room the victim took his jacket and pants off, having become too warm. After visiting the bathroom, the victim was punched in the face by the two suspects, who then took his cellphone, wallet and clothing, the site said. Police were called to the scene at 3.45am. The victim refused medical treatment for minor bruising to his cheek. He described his attackers as black, between 25 and 35 years old, with one dressed in a hoodie and dark jeans, the other wearing dark clothes. It follows news that a year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million. In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million. But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report. In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News. A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumer (above Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio selects marijuana strains from the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary in December 2014)","Victim's ordeal began in morning of Thursday in Nob Hill, San Francisco .

"Ten men have been charged as part of an investigation into child grooming and sexual exploitation in Rochdale against girls as young as 13. The men are accused of a catalogue of serious sex offences, which include numerous charges of rape and sexual activity with a child, against seven victims between 2005 and 2013. All 10 have been arrested under Operation Doublet, which aims to tackle child sexual exploitation by older men in Rochdale. The operation was launched after the conviction of nine men last May for their roles in a child abuse ring which spanned Rochdale and parts of Greater Manchester. Ten men have been charged as part of an investigation by Greater Manchester Police (headquarters pictured)  into child sexual exploitation and child exploitation in Rochdale, Greater Manchester . Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The majority of the offences were committed between 2003 and 2013 and focus on reports that teenage girls were sexually exploited by older men. 'So far, 65 people have been arrested as part of Operation Doublet and the investigation continues. 'This is an extremely complex and challenging investigation which started in May 2012. The investigation will continue over the coming months and further arrests are anticipated. 'The welfare of the victims is paramount and we have a team of experienced officers supporting them through the process.' The charges are; Shayfur Rahman, 31, of Prestwich, one count of rape; Kutab Miah, 34, of Rochdale, three counts of sexual activity and one count of rape; Rehan Ali, 26, of Manchester, one count of rape, three counts of sexual activity with a child when the offender was over 18 and three counts of sexual activity with a child when the offender was between 15 and 17.

Ashfaq Yousaf, 28, has been charged with one count of aiding and abetting rape against one victim. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim. Afraz Ahmed, 32, of Rochdale has been charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit rape and one count of rape against one victim. He also faces two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, relating to offences against to girls. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim. Ian Wiggett, assistant chief constable at Greater Manchester Police said 65 people have been arrested so far under Operation Doublet . Mohammed Davood, 37, of Burnley has been charged with one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against one victim. He has also been charged with three counts of rape, one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of sexual assault against a further victim. Mohammed Miah, 39, has been charged with three counts of sexual activity and one count of rape against one victim. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk welcomed news of the charges. He said: 'I welcome today's news that more alleged perpetrators of child abuse are being brought to justice. I have spoken to the Director of Children's Services at Rochdale Council earlier today and have been fully briefed on the developments.' He added: 'I have been critical of child protection agencies, and especially Greater Manchester Police, in the past regarding their handling of these cases. But credit where credit is due, these arrests demonstrate the progress that has been made. 'We have seen in recent months that Rochdale is far from the only town in the country to have experienced this type of abuse. The difference in Rochdale is that we now have much better systems in place for protecting children and all agencies are working together to catch the perpetrators. 'Finally, it should be recognised that these arrests could not have happened without the incredibly brave actions of survivors of abuse. I know from personal experience just how difficult it is for survivors to speak out about their abuse. So I want to pay tribute to the young women who have suffered this abuse and have worked with police.' The Crown Prosecution Service said the majority of alleged offences took place when the complainants were under 16. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor, said: 'These defendants now stand charged with serious criminal offences and have the right to a fair trial. 'It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' Two of the men, Ahmed and Law, were remanded in custody when they appeared at Bury Magistrates' Court on February 24. Choudhry, Rahman, Davood, Ali and Miah will appear at the same court tomorrow and the remaining three defendants will face Tameside Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

"When Western explorers first discovered set eyes on animals in far-flung locations, artists had the difficult job of depicting them from their exotic descriptions. Now these paintings, including one of a scaly rhino with horns on its back, are among the works going on display at an exhibition entitled ‘Strange Creatures’. The show will examine the history of animal representations and how art was used to bring newly discovered creatures into the public eye, especially before the days of  zoos, the television and the internet. Researchers’ stories include medieval accounts of exotic creatures and art from the ages of exploration. This is a copy of Dürer's rhino, made in 1558, which was based on a written description. It has fantastical armour and a strange shoulder horn, and became an enduring image of rhinos for Europeans . The images, which was picked by palaeontologists, historians of science and exploration and art experts, will be go on display at the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London. Researchers’ stories include medieval accounts of exotic creatures, art from the ages of exploration and empire, sailors who faked ‘dragon’ specimens by manipulating dried fish and even contemporary knitted craft taxidermy. For the dragons, sailors would cut rays and skates in a certain way, and then dry them out. This created specimens that were then sold as dragons and angels, Grant Museum Manager Jack Ashby who curated Strange Creatures, told MailOnline. 'Naturalists drew these creatures for engravings in their books, which others would copy. 'Each time, the artist might embellish the picture to make it more dragon-like, and soon books appeared to show genuine specimens of dragons. They were called “Jenny Hanivers”. 'We have engravings of them reproduced in the exhibition.' The show centres upon George Stubbs’ painting of a kangaroo, which was created following Captain Cook’s first Pacific ‘Voyage of Discovery’. It is Europe’s first painting of an Australian animal and became the archetype for how people imagined this iconic species for decades, including its over-sized tail. Stubbs, who had never seen a kangaroo, based his painting on an inflated skin, skull, written descriptions and sketches, without ever having seen the animal himself. This trunked elephant is taken from a 13th century manuscript engraving drawn in 1241 before the artist, Matthew Paris, had seen one. It seems to show people using the animal as transport while they play music . Two works by 18th century painter, George Stubbs, were saved for the nation in 2013. They included what is thought to be the first depiction of a kangaroo in Western art. The National Maritime Museum bought the paintings after a substantial donation from a shipping magnate. The paintings were commissioned after Captain Cook's first voyage on Endeavour. Stubbs used sketches and specimens to paint the animals in the UK, which he had not seen in the flesh. The painting was saved for the nation by the National Maritime Museum. The exhibition includes a number of animal artworks created by people who had never seen the creature in the flesh, such as a 16th century copy of Dürer’s famous armoured rhinoceros. It was based on a written description and has fantastical armour and a strange shoulder horn. Despite the inaccuracies, it became an enduring image of rhinos for Europeans. ‘Sometimes the pictures were created from explorers’ written descriptions, while other artists copied existing drawings but added their own interpretations of those descriptions,’ said Dr Chiara Ambrosio who contributed to the exhibition. An elongated elephant that almost looks like a cartoon and features a band of humans playing instruments on its back, was found in a 13th century manuscript. Matthew Paris drew it before he had seen one, but a later painting is more accurate because he based it on an elephant that he saw in the Tower of London, which once housed a menagerie of animals. Paintings of pouchless kangaroos with extremely long tails and rhinos with scaly skin and horns on their backs are among the works of art that will go on display at an exhibition entitled ‘Strange Creatures’. This work by 18th century painter, George Stubbs, is the earliest European painting of an Australian animal . ‘Sometimes they were created from explorers’ written descriptions, while other artists copied existing drawings but added their own interpretations of those descriptions,’ said Dr Chiara Ambrosio who contributed to the exhibition. This 17th century drawing has been done by someone who has not seen a real lion . The imagery was picked by palaeontologists, historians of science and exploration and art experts. This elephant is from the same 13th century manuscript as the other elephant, but was drawn in 1255 after Matthew Paris had seen an elephant in the Tower of London. Mr Ashby said: ‘It’s not only historic artworks which misportrayed these amazing species’. ‘We also see it in the practice of taxidermy, where skins were shipped back to Europe and fleshed-out to recreate the animal based on a few notes. ‘It’s also true of modern dinosaur toys, which have been copying outdated images of fossil species for over a century.’ Events including a Knit-a-thon and drawing classes will accompany the free exhibition, which runs from March 16 to June 27 2015. St Jerome in his Study: German artist Albrecht Dürer probably sourced his image of the lion (pictured) from elsewhere, which may help to explain the beast's strange appearance. Illustrated scenes in the early modern Bible were seen as opportunities to depict exotic animals from distant lands . This image shows a very early accurately portrayed rhino, based on observations of the live animal, Clara. It comes from a book called Tabulae scleti et Muscularum Corporis Humani by Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, 1747 . Dinosaur and other extinct animal models of varying accuracy. Many of these were produced long after the nineteenth century view of dinosaurs – as slow moving, tail dragging, lizard-like animals - had been disproved. Yet the traditional image of a dinosaur (toys are shown) has proved very hard to dispel .","Paintings of strange animals will go on show at  the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London from March 16 .

"The Secret Service has arrested two men in two separate White House security breaches that have occurred just hours apart, sparking lockdowns at the presidential mansion. On Sunday night, an unnamed suspect stepped over a bike rack situated outside the White House fence. The bike racks were installed last year following a high-profile fence-jumping incident that involved an Army veteran armed with a knife. Early Monday morning, another person attempted to walk through a gate while a construction crew were leaving. Scroll down for video . Breached: The White House, pictured Monday, has become the site of two new security breaches that took place just hours apart and sparked lockdowns . Sneak: A man tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area . According to NBC, both men were taken into custody, and the Secret Service has given the all-clear at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The agency has been tight-lipped about the two breaches, which are now under investigation. The suspects have not been named. The bike rack-jumping incident took place at around 11.30pm Sunday near the southwest corner of the presidential residence, reported MyFox DC. The male suspect was arrested and charged with unlawful entry. The breach led to a 30-minute lockdown at the White House. Just before 7am Monday, another man allegedly tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area. A Secret Service agent stopped the intruder in his tracks and arrested him after a brief confrontation. The White House was placed on another lockdown that lasted only a few minutes following the second incident. The twin security breaches come just over a month after a small drone operated by a government employee accidentally crashed on the South Lawn of the White House. Agency under fire: An incident last September involving an armed fence jumper led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's (left) resignation. Her replacement, Joseph Clancy (right), said on This Week Sunday that his agency is working to 'regain the trust' of the public . The Secret Service has come under scrutiny following a string of distressing incidents involving White House security. In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled. The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. The White House was briefly on lockdown this past August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. In an interview on ABC's This Week Sunday, Joseph Clancy, the newly appointed director of the Secret Service, said his agency is working to 'regain the trust' of the public after the litany of security breaches, reported USA Today. ‘We have not received an unfair rap,’ Clancy said.’I think when you fail, and we have failed, we own it. Now, it's up to us to correct it.’ The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.","A man was arrested at 11.30pm Sunday after jumping over bike rack near southwest corner of White House .

"A newly-divorced father who used a train set to lure his two young sons to their deaths in a 'terrible' arson attack had been worried about his access rights to the children, an inquest has heard. Darren Sykes died alongside Paul, nine, and Jack, 12, after setting a fire in his  home and locking himself and the boys in the attic. The 44-year-old had been worried about how much he would be able to see the children after recently divorcing from their mother, Sheffield Coroner's Court heard. Mr Sykes died in the attic after inhaling smoke while Paul's body was found near the edge of the loft. Jack, who was found unconscious next to its hatch door, died in hospital five days later. Darren Sykes died after setting fire to his home after luring sons Paul (left) and Jack (right) into the attic with a new train set. The newly-divorced father had been worried about his custody rights, an inquest into his death heard . The 44-year-old had recently divorced the boys' mother when he set the fire. Above, a family photograph taken in the years before their death . In the days before his death the father of two from Penistone, south Yorkshire, sent letters to a bank telling them he 'would not be alive' to pay his mortgage. On October 22, when the three were killed in the fire, he sent a text message to a handful of friends saying 'he was going to be at peace'. Concluding that the carpet estimator had intended to take his own life, Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries said: 'The whole business is absolutely terrible. Following a police statement which described the ongoing custody battle between Mr Sykes and his estranged wife Claire, he added: 'He may have taken the view he would have less access.' On the morning of his death Mr Sykes spent £800 on a model railway track before sending text messages to both his sons asking them to visit him at his house that day. Before luring them into the attic he sprayed four cans of petrol across  the ground floor of the house and barricaded doors with furniture. He had also tied the front and back garden gates with cord to prevent anyone from accessing the property. Mr Sykes had recently divorced the boys' mother Claire (above). A coroner told of how he may have been worried about his access rights to the children after family court liaisons met with police officers . Jack, left, spent five days in hospital fighting for his life while younger brother Paul (right) was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital . Neighbours described seeing a flash come from the property moments after Mr Sykes sent text messages to friends saying he would be 'at peace'. Police and firefighters arrived to find the 44-year-old's body in the loft . Police were forced to smash a window to gain access to the property. Right, neighbours leave tributes to the family following the tragedy . 'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' said special fire investigator Michael Mason. Evidence suggested Mr Sykes's eldest son Jack made a desperate attempt to escape as flames ravaged the floors beneath them. 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. 'It was a natural reaction to try to get out.' Explaining how investigators knew it was Jack rather than his father of young brother who tried to escape, he added: 'Opening the hatch made the position untenable.' Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Dorries said it was 'abundantly clear' Mr Sykes had set the fire which killed him and his two sons. 'All three were inside the loft with the hatch closed when the fire took hold. 'There is no evidence that it was set by anyone else other than Mr Sykes. He intended to take his own life.' An inquest into the boys’ deaths will be held later this week.","Darren Sykes, 44, died alongside his two sons in a house fire in October .

"Google wants to rank internet pages based on the quality of the facts they contain. A new paper published by a group of software engineers suggests that the internet search giant may be preparing to change the algorithms it uses to scour the web. Currently searches appear according to a complex combination of key words and links with other websites, but this fails to weed out inaccurate information. Google may be about to change the way it delivers search results to users by ranking results by accuracy . Instead a Google research team has developed a way of measuring the trustworthiness of the information contained on an internet page. If implemented it could mean that currently popular sources that regularly get facts wrong could fall foul of the new search technique. Not one to be outdone by its rivals, Google is reportedly working on a mobile payment service called Android Pay. The firm is expected to officially announce the service at its developer conference later this year. It will create a way for companies to accept transactions through their apps without having to introduce their own individual payment services. Android Pay users will then be able to upload credit card or debit card information to a single secure location but use it to pay for items across apps. And customers will be able to use it to pay for in-app purchases, goods or services with a single tap. Google is also expected to allow companies to use its Android Pay API to enable tap-to-pay options in physical stores using NFC readers, for example. In a paper to be published in the Proceedings of the Very Large Database Endowment, the Google researchers said webpages would be allocated trustworthiness scores. They said: 'Quality assessment for web sources is of tremendous importance in web search. 'It has been traditionally evaluated using exogenous signals such as hyperlinks and browsing history. 'For example, the gossip websites listed (see image below) mostly have high PageRank scores, but would not generally be considered reliable. 'Conversly, some less popular websites nevertheless have very accurate information.' 'We address the fundamental question of estimating how trustworthy a given web source is. 'Informally, we define the trustworthiness or accuracy of a web source as the probability that it contains the correct value for a fact (such as Barack Obama's nationality), assuming that it mentions any value for that fact.' Currently web searches are ranked by, among other things, the number of incoming links to a page to help Google's search bots determine the quality of the link. This, however, is really only a measure of the popularity of a webpage rather than the accuracy of the information it contains. Google researchers have developed a new algorithm that looks for facts and inaccuracies on web pages . Webpages containing inaccurate information can be widely shared and linked to by blogs and other external sites, causing them to feature high up in Google search results. However, Xin Luna Dong, Wei Zhang and colleagues at Google have designed a way of automatically extracting information from webpages and ranking them for trustworthiness. They use a system they have called Knowledge-Based Trust, which pulls facts from many pages and then jointly estimates the correctness and accuracy of these. It then counts the number of incorrect facts on a page to give it a trust score. To help the software the team has developed draws on Google's fast Knowledge Vault - a store of facts that have been pulled off the internet and are unanimously agreed on as being true. The software extracts what are known as 'knowledge triplets' - such as Barack Obama, nationality, USA. The list of the top five gossip sites above currently rank in the top 15 per cent of search results but Google researchers say that using their new algorithm these will be religated to the bottom half of search results . Websites that contain contradictory information are then moved down the rankings on internet searches. In a test of their system, the researchers applied their model to 2.8 billion pages on the internet and were able to reliably predict the trustworthiness of 119 million pages and 5.6 million websites. Giving an example of the nationality of US President Barack Obama, they say their system can distinguish between sources that are correct, those that are wrong and those read incorrectly by information extraction software. When the team applied their algorithm to a list of top 15 gossip websites including Yahoo! OMG!, TMZ, E Online, and Gawker they found that they ranked in the bottom 50 per cent of searches. The researchers said: 'In other words, they are considered less trustworthy than half of the websites.' However, under the current search system used by Google, they rank among the top 15 per cent. In another example the paper describes how forums are also another source of poor information. They said: 'For instance, we discovered that answers.yahoo.com says that 'Catherine Zeta-Jones is from New Zealand', although she was born in Wales according to Wikipedia.' A spokesman for Google said there were no specific plans to use the algorithm in their public search engine yet. He said: 'This was research - we don’t have any specific plans to implement it in our products. We publish hundreds of research papers every year.'","Google researchers have developed new algorithms for searching out facts .
Web pages are given a Knowledge Trust score based on how accurate it is .
The more incorrect facts on a page the lower it is ranked in search results .
Current searches use links from other websites to determine page quality .

"Primary school students in Victoria have been punished for using the bathroom during lesson time, leading children to wet themselves in class. Parents have expressed their outrage after learning that students at Bellbridge Primary School in Hoppers Crossing, south-west Melbourne, were fined and kept in during lunch and recess if they went to the toilet during class time. Danielle Henderson, whose 11-year-old daughter Lauren was fined $50 in play money for using the bathroom, said the issue was reported to the school council more than a week ago. Danielle Henderson's (right) 11-year-old daughter Lauren (left) was fined $50 for using the bathroom . Students at Bellbridge Primary School in Hoppers Crossing, south-west Melbourne, have been punished for using the bathroom during lesson time . 'I found out about it a couple of weeks ago via a Bellbridge parents Facebook site,' Ms Henderson told Daily Mail Australia. 'There were a huge number of parents in uproar. 'The school has been fully aware of this for quite some time now.' Ms Henderson said children had been wetting themselves in class and had to be sent home for changes of clothes, while others had to record their bathroom breaks on class whiteboards. 'When kids are that age they like to do the right thing, so if a teacher says they can't go they're going to hold and hold and hold,' she said. 'I haven't had to worry about [my daughter] having an accident, she's 11, but my worry is she's going to end up with a urinary tract infection or something along those lines. 'She has to write up the time she went to toilet and what time she came in, so her name goes up on whiteboard for 29 other children to see. Parents have expressed their outrage after learning that students were fined and kept in during recess if they went to the toilet during class . 'Each child's toileting record is up for public display - I'd love to see how an adult would react to that in the workplace.' Ms Henderson said a parent who was also a school council member agreed to raise the issue at a meeting more than a week ago, but says it was 'brushed off'. 'A number of parents went to individual classroom teachers who again have brushed it off,' she said. 'If there is a child using a toilet break as an excuse to get out of work deal with that particular child rather than punish the whole school.' Bellbridge Primary School principal Debbie Clancy said she became aware of the practice on Monday and has now stopped it. 'Of course, our students are free to go to the toilet whenever they need — and we would never stop a child from going to the toilet during class time, or penalise them for doing so,' Ms Clancy told the Herald Sun. 'A small number of classes have deducted points earned in the 'earn and learn' system as a way to discourage children from using the toilet during class time. 'As this does not fit in with our positive approach, this no longer occurs at our school.'","Primary school students punished for using bathroom during lesson time .

"A Chinese family was kicked off a Cathay Pacific flight after their three-year-old son refused to wear a seatbelt, causing a delay for other passengers. The Hong Kong-bound plane sat at its gate at a Bangkok airport for an extra 30 minutes while the family, flight attendants and other travellers were involved in a heated stand-off. Most airlines allow children under two to sit on a parent’s lap during take-off and landing. Any child over that age must sit in their own seat and wear a safety belt. The boy's father (middle) rowed with other passengers, putting the flight 30 minutes behind schedule . In last Thursday’s incident, the boy refused to take his seat and wear a seatbelt moments before flight CX654 was scheduled to take off from Suvarnabhumi Bangkok International Airport, a passenger, named Lau, told Hong Kong’s Apple Daily newspaper. All other passengers were seated and prepared for their two-hour journey. Flight attendants asked the family to put the boy in his seat and buckle his safety belt, but the parents refused to obey their directions and insisted that the boy be allowed to sit on his mother’s lap, the South China Morning Post reported. A passenger recorded the argument that followed and shared the video with Apple Daily. A female passenger urged cabin crew to call police after the family refused to get off the plane . In the video, the boy’s defiant father said: ‘If others keep on harassing us, then we will not leave.’ A female passenger, speaking in Cantonese, urged cabin crew to call police, adding: ‘We are customers too. Why are you two allowed to harass all the passengers on board?’ The boy’s father, speaking Putonghua, refused to stand down, saying: ‘If you keep on talking, we won’t leave.’ Moments later, the boy’s mother carries the crying child off the plane as the father collects their belongings. In a similar incident, police were called after a couple refused to place their grandson in his seat . Cathay Pacific defended its decision, telling the South China Morning Post that it was based on safety grounds. A day before, police were called to Hong Kong International Airport after a three-year-old boy would not remain in his seat on a Hong Kong Airlines flight that arrived from Bali, Indonesia, the newspaper reported. In that incident, the boy’s grandparents disobeyed instructions from cabin crew and carried the boy.","Plane sat at its gate in Bangkok while father rowed with staff, travellers .

"Britain will carry on shivering its way into spring with snow and sub-zero temperatures over the next few days. But winter will feel well and truly left behind by the weekend as temperatures are expected to reach a balmy 13C (55F). Parts of the country were battered by snow showers and freezing conditions yesterday, making driving perilous. Scroll down for video . Treacherous: An car flipped on the side of the road after an accident on the M6 in Cumbria where icy conditions caused problems for drivers . Gridlock: Poor visibility caused by heavy snow showers led to queues of traffic in Danholme, near Bradford West Yorkshire, this morning . Snow showers: Freezing temperatures caused rainfall to freeze in Birmingham, where commuters were forced to shelter under umbrellas . Wintry white: While yesterday was the first official day of spring, parts of the country, including the Howgill Fells in Cumbria, woke up to snow . Where's the warm weather? Two freezing lambs stand next to their mother in a Cumbrian fields as they wait for more milder spring weather . Stranded: A motorist is pictured waiting for help after his car became stuck in the snow in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire this morning . And forecasters last night warned that there is more bad weather to come this week – with plummeting temperatures expected to bring a fresh flurry of blizzards today. Freezing temperatures will persist tomorrow with a low of -3C (27F) in the South. And parts of north-west England and Wales are expected to wake up to at least two inches of snow. However, that will all change this weekend as temperatures leap by as much as 15C (59F). By Friday the mercury is set to rocket to a maximum of 13C (55F) in the South and 12C (54F) in the North. Forecaster Gemma Plumb, from MeteoGroup, said: ‘From the weekend and going into next week, we’re going to see a high-pressure system sitting across much of the UK. That will bring mainly dry and fine conditions, with some risk of rain in the North West.’ And Met Office forecaster Kate Brown said: ‘Any chance of terrible wet and windy weather for the rest of the month looks small. It will be colder at nights but temperatures will stay closer to average for this time of year.’ Yesterday north-west England and Northern Ireland saw several inches of snow as Manchester dropped to -1C (30F). In London, though, it was a brisk 5C (41F) with bright sunshine a hint of the warmer week . Photographs taken across the UK this morning show cars abandoned at the side of the road as drivers in northern and western parts of Britain struggled against poor visibility and icy conditions. One car was seen flipped over on the side of the M6 in Cumbria today, where people woke up to blankets of snow and colder-than-average temperatures. And in Birmingham, people were forced to carry umbrellas as plunging temperatures caused showers to turn snowy. Commuters in Stowmarket, Suffolk, were faced with blizzard conditions as they drove to work, whilst others in Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire also saw snow flurries. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for snow and ice from 6pm today to 10am tomorrow in Northern England, Northern Scotland and Western Scotland. Some areas could see 3cm of snow and up to 8cm is expected on higher ground. Though it is not yet known how much snow has fallen across Britain, forecasters predicted yesterday than around 4in of snow may fall over the Pennines and the Scottish Highlands on land above 1,300ft (400 metres). And 2.4in of snow was forecast to fall in western Britain. While daytime temperatures mean that it is unlikely snow will settle over the course of the day, more is expected to fall as temperatures plummet tonight.  Northern Scotland is expected to see the worst of the cold weather, with forecasters predicting readings of -1C in some areas. Braving the elements: This runner was forced to sport gloves and a long-sleeved top for his run through Temple Newsham park in Leeds today . Warning: The Met Office were forced to issue an amber warning for poor visibility and icy roads in areas including Bradford, pictured . Chilly: The M6 in Cumbria was just one major road affected by the snowy showers this morning - and is expected to see more tomorrow . Wrapped up: Huddled in jackets beneath umbrellas, commuters make their way to work in Birmingham city centre this morning . Prepared for more: A snow plow was brought out to clear the M6 in Cumbria today, where wintry weather caused traffic congestion . It means parts of the country that see snow today could wake up to snow on the ground tomorrow, according to Met Office forecasters. Spokeswoman Laura Young said: 'There is a little bit more to come, definitely for the first part of the week.' But she said warmer weather was expected by Wednesday and Thursday, with parts of southern England seeing temperatures reaching double figures. Bands of higher pressure mid-week will mean that there is less rain or snow by Wednesday. But clearer skies will also herald colder overnight temperatures - with the last frost for a while expected on Thursday morning. Blanketed: A snow storm clears over the rolling patchwork of drystone walled fields on the Howgill Fells in Cumbria . Caught in a flurry: A bird searches for food as snow falls in Temple Newsham park in Leeds today, where temperatures will hover around 5C .

Traffic chaos: Cars crawl along the road as drivers navigate heavy snow in Denholme near Bradford, West Yorkshire, this morning . Despite the wintry weather this week, the country has experienced a very mild few months. Provisional Met Office statistics show that the UK has had its sunniest winter in records dating back to 1929. The weekend weather will see a divide between the north and south. People in the north and north-west can expect it to be cloudy and windy with outbreaks of rain, while in southern England it will be generally drier with good sunshine.

"An exodus of GPs leaving to work abroad or take early retirement means surgeries across England are in crisis, experts warned last night. The number of family doctors applying to work in Australia, Canada and other countries where they can earn more for fewer hours has jumped by 40 per cent in just five years. And around 22,400 GPs – more than half of England’s 40,200 family doctors – want to retire before the usual age of 60, separate figures show. Lured away: Online ads promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’ if they leave Britain for Australia (file image) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make ‘important changes’ to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs. Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered. It follows the Mail’s revelation last week how one practice, in Swinton, South Yorkshire, was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment. Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP at the Crown Street Surgery, told Inside Out that three of its doctors had moved to Australia and Canada since last summer due to ‘unsustainable daily pressure’. The programme, being broadcast tonight, also obtained figures from the General Medical Council that revealed 792 GPs were given ‘Certificates of Good Standing’ last year to allow them to practise abroad. This compares to 576 in 2008 and 562 in 2009. Crisis: Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered (file photo) The NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a ‘fully funded induction and returner scheme’. On top of the exodus to foreign climes, 56 per cent of GPs ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ expect to leave the profession before their 60th birthday, according to a survey of 1,004 family doctors carried out by Inside Out. Dr David Jones, 46, who formerly practised in Manchester, moved to Perth, Western Australia, over a year ago. He said: ‘We arrived in November 2013. It’s wonderful here. We do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine. I’m very, very proud of what my colleagues at home do. They do an incredibly difficult job. They get assaulted from all sides. ‘I do feel guilty to some extent. When a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country. But the way that asset is being treated in that country, it’s just pushing people away. It’s reached a point where people are just saying no, I’m not doing this any more. ‘We shouldn’t be here. Had our profession been looked after as it should have been we wouldn’t think about leaving.’ The website GP Jobs in Australia promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’. It adds: ‘Typical earnings start from £145,000 and rise to £195,000 per annum after a few years’ experience.’ But it says doctors working in rural locations can earn ‘considerably more’, adding: ‘Compared to the NHS, there’s less hassle, less bureaucracy, more medicine and money.’ Younger doctors are not plugging the gaps, with up to one in eight GP training posts unfilled. They are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons. The situation has become so dire that 1,063 GPs are needed just to return to the patient-to-doctor ratio of 2009, according to separate figures released by the House of Commons Library. Under the previous Labour government, GPs benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to £105,000 a year and enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work. But many doctors now say they are dismayed by the volume of paperwork, the demands of the ageing population and the insufficient funds given to surgeries by the Government. Mr Hunt said yesterday: ‘What I hope GPs recognise is the things they’ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed. 'They said they didn’t like the targets they have, what are called the QOF targets, and we’ve reduced those by 40 per cent. ‘They said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the Autumn Statement. ‘These things don’t happen overnight so I would urge people to bear with us while we make these really important changes. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS – but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis. It is getting harder and harder to get a GP appointment as a result.’","Online ads promises British GPs more money for less hours in Australia .

"An oral surgeon has given up his license and sold his practice after he was accused of being under the influence of medications when he pulled the wrong teeth from two patients and operated on the wrong side of a patient's mouth, officials said. Dr Gary Dean Burnidge, 75, voluntarily surrendered his license to the state's dental board last month. The board began investigating after an internal complaint filed in October said Burnidge slurred his speech and drooled while operating on a patient. According to the complaint, he extracted the wrong teeth from two patients and attempted to extract a tooth without numbing the area first. A 75-year-old dentist, who is believed to have extracted the wrong teeth from two patients, surrendered his license in Tulsa, Oklahoma (stock image) Burnidge also is accused of giving patients too much anesthesia, requiring a procedure to restore their blood oxygen levels. The dental board said that during its investigation it discovered that Burnidge was purchasing controlled medications from the pharmacy next door, including Valium, Neurotonin and Phenergan, which can be used as a sedative. According to an order by the board, the dentist asked his staff to give him injections that they believe made him impaired. The board asked to see several patient files, but they were not available. According to the order, staff reported seeing Burnidge's wife in the office throwing away files. Susan Rogers, the board's executive director, described Burnidge as a well-respected dentist. She said he told the board he had health problems and was planning retirement soon. A call to Burnidge's former practice to seek comment on the allegations rang unanswered and there was no way to leave a message.","Dr Gary Dean Burnidge, 75, voluntarily surrendered his license to the state's dental board in Tulsa, Oklahoma ."

"Tom Brokaw, 75, will release a new memoir about his battle with cancer, titled A Lucky Life Interrupted . Tom Brokaw has announced he will share the story about his battle with cancer in a new memoir titled A Lucky Life Interrupted. Brokaw, 75, drew upon a journal he began keeping in late 2013 after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer in the bone marrow's white blood cells. The retired NBC anchor said he hopes the book will help others who have to deal 'with this unwelcome condition,' in a statement he released through publisher Random House. The book will be released May 12. Brokaw remained private through much of his cancer treatment, publicly announcing he had cancer only six months after he was diagnosed. During an interview with David Letterman, Brokaw said he was 'pleased with the progress' of his treatment but that's as far as he would go in describing his fight with the disease. 'There are a lot of other people out there...going through what I'm going through, and they don't have the advantages I do,' he told the talk show host, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw, who told Letterman his work was 'therapy', continued to work throughout his treatment, serving as a special NBC correspondent and contributing to the network's winter Olympics coverage in Sochi last year. In September Brokaw revealed on the Today Show that the cancer was almost gone, although he recognized that 'the disease will not completely go away' but can be 'managed'. Three months later Brokaw announced that he was officially in remission and that he would be going on a drug maintenance regimen 'to keep it there', he said in a note to his 'NBC family' that was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw served as the head anchor for NBC Nightly News for 23 years before he retired and passed the chair to Brian Williams in 2004. He remained mostly silent during the controversy surrounding Williams' story about his experience in the Iraq war and released a statement that said the anchor's fate was in both Williams and NBC's hands. Brokaw continues to serve as a special correspondent for NBC and has written seven other books. Brokaw, who was the lead anchor of NBC Nightly News for 23 years and still serves as a network correspondent, said he hoped the book would help others who had to deal 'with this unwelcome condition'","The book will be titled A Lucky Life Interrupted and will be released May 12 .

"A voluptuous make-up artist who was targeted by bullies at school for having large breasts at a young age is hoping to become a poster girl for curvier women after reaching the finals of a competition that celebrates the fuller figure. Danielle Fearon, 24, was picked on by cruel classmates when she started developing breasts earlier than other girls. The young model, who lives in Toddington, Bedfordshire, was so ashamed of her 32DD figure that she covered up her figure by wearing unflattering clothes after bullies accused her of putting tissues down her bra to enhance her natural assets. Scroll down for video . Beating the bullies: Danielle Fearon, has reached the finals of the Curvy Kate lingerie model competition...proving she's overcome the body issues caused by taunts at school . Natural beauty: Danielle, who grew up in north London but now lives in Bedfordshire, used to cover up as a teenager after 'jealous girls' accused her of faking her large breasts . Happy in a two-piece: Danielle is comfortable disrobing after finding a new body-confidence in her 20s . Danielle, who's just 5ft 1in tall, now has a 30GG bust and says jealous schoolgirls seriously dented her body confidence: 'It started off at school with kids just being kids and came from jealous girls.' 'There were lots of jokes around school about me and if we were in a food technology class and the teacher said chicken fillets then people would look at me and snigger. 'One of the jokes was 'how do you know when I've got a cold? Because my boobs look smaller when all the tissues I stuff in my bra have gone.' Now though, Danielle is having the last laugh after beating thousands of other women from around the world to be chosen as a finalist for a plus-size lingerie company's annual 'Star in a Bra' competition. Curvy Kate makes swimwear and underwear for larger figures, striving to use 'relatable role models' that 'promote a positive approach' to body image. The company's competition will see ten finalists invited to London for a photoshoot and makeover before a final public vote in April. And the overall winner will join the lingerie company's line-up at their summer shoot and be awarded a year-long modelling contract. An inspirational figure in Danielle's life, her grandad Victor Galdes, passed away from cancer last year. A erstwhile note he wrote telling her: 'Whatever happens in life, always remember to smile' propelled her to enter the competition . 'When I found out I was in the final I screamed a little bit - I'm still in shock now,' says Danielle, who is single and lives with her parents. She decided to enter the competition after finding an inspirational note left behind by her granddad Victor Galdes, who passed away from cancer in September last year. Danielle said: 'The past year has been particularly difficult because I lost my granddad due to cancer. 'He was really inspirational and was a real character and if there was ever anything I wanted to do, he would say 'go for it'. 'After he passed away we found a note in his holiday home in Malta he had written when he realised how seriously ill he was. 'It says 'Whatever happens in life always remember to smile' and that is what I decided to do. All about that bass! Danielle is hoping to become a role model for curvy girls . Danielle is finally comfortable in her own skin: 'As I got older I got more body confidence by realising things you think are important when you're younger aren't any more.' 'As I got older I got more body confidence by realising things you think are important when you're younger aren't any more. 'I have become much more comfortable in my own skin and don't feel like hiding myself away. 'The thought of modelling has always been a distant dream and seemed an impossible with me being curvy and vertically challenged. 'But I would love to join the campaign in celebrating and promoting beauty in women of all sizes and give others the confidence to love their shape too.' Danielle will now battle against 24 other women from all over the world in a public vote which ends this week. Alongside a modelling contract, the lucky winner will also get an all-expenses paid trip to the Mediterranean for two, with £1,000 spending money thrown in.","Danielle Fearon developed breasts early and was bullied by 'jealous girls'

"A woman from the seaside town of Hastings who gets £1,100 of benefits a month has labelled the government 'disgusting' for allowing people to live on that amount of money. In the show Benefits Britain, which airs on Channel 5 tonight, a camera crews follows Debbie Merton, 46, who hasn't worked in 24 years and lives in a large council flat on the East Sussex coast. She doesn't reveal the disability  that allows her to receive this amount of money every month, but says that it is unlikely she will ever be able to get a job. Scroll down for video . Debbie Merton, who gets a benefits income of just under £1,100 a month and hasn't work in 24 years . While Debbie has been on state handouts for several years, she reveals that as a young woman, she also struggled to find any work because of her lack of skills. She said: 'I tried getting other jobs before I was disabled but couldn't because I had no qualifications, it really winds me up - I get so angry.' She continued: 'It's bloody hard and the government  don't really give a s***, they're alright in their posh houses and eating lobster and caviar every night.' 'It's just disgusting how they expect you to live on money and support a house and support yourself.' Debbie, centre, with her partner Pete, right and their friends, left, at one of Debbie's regular dinner parties . Another person who hits the sharp side of Debbie's tongue is the Queen. As Debbie has her neighbours round for dinner and several drinks, she holds court on the British monarch, saying: 'Look at the Queen, she's got Buckingham Palace and God knows how many other f****** properties. 'All her grandchildren and kids have got two, three, four different houses and we're sitting here on the poverty line, eating c**p. while THAT is sitting in her f****** palace, eating pretty, eating swan and everything. 'It winds me up.' Debbie is known for being a socialite in the area and loves having friends over for home-cooked meals and a knees-up. Debbie with one of her pets - a bearded dragon . But her outgoing nature eventually gets the better of her and after one raucous evening too many, she receives a formal warning from her local housing association over loud noise coming from her flat. According to the official letter, her neighbours have complained about fights in her home and loud music being played until the early hours, leading to the police having to be called at 2am. She says: 'We did have a discussion earlier in the evening, but when the police turned up at two in the morning, we were ready for our bed.' 'We're meant to be a community at the end of the day but now I've got a final warning to get out of my flat. 'I'm definitely moving from here, I can't stand it round here.

Another person on the show is single mother Stacey Farrand, 28, from Hastings, who lives in a one-room bedsit with her son Eddie and lives off £56 a week. Stacey is trying her best to move out of her 15 sq ft room and into a two-bedroom house, but can't afford the £800 deposit needed for a new flat. She was employed for several years full-time as a builder until she fell pregnant and she frequently explains to the cameras that she can't wait until she is off benefits again and in employment so that she can give her son the things he needs. She says: 'I'd love to not be on benefits and go back to work. 'If I had the money now, no limited money, I'd get a flat, get Eddie a decent bed, do his bedroom up and then save up to do my driving lessons. 'I need him to have a bed, a room and a bath - he hasn't even experienced a bath yet, only a sink. 'I'm meant to provide for him. 'I want a benefit-free, stress-free life for Eddie, I don't want him to worry about having dinner, where he's going to sleep or whether he's going to have a sheet on his bed. 'This time next year, hopefully we won't be on any benefits and we'll be in a two bedroom flat.' Stacey buys her shopping from the out-of-date bin at her local convenience store . Stacey and her son Eddie live in a 15 sq ft one-room bedsit . She is also adamant that her son Eddie won't ever rely on handouts from the state. She says: 'Eddie's going to be an astronaut or a judge. 'He'll be going to full school, college and university - I want him to have everything. 'When he gets older, he'll have a career and get no benefits.' The programme shows Stacey trying to eke out her £56 a week on food from the out-of-date bin in her local convenience store, and revealing that she once fainted  from hunger. She said: 'I've been really hungry - I've passed out on the street before because I haven't eaten.' Towards the end of the programme, Stacey is seen going down to the council offices to apply for a larger place for to live with her son. But the housing offices are unable to help and she walks away empty-handed, back to the room where she is forced to bathe her son in a sink because she doesn't have a bath.

"It is arguably the most famous road in America, but can Scotland compete with the iconic Route 66 that stretches from Chicago to Los Angeles? In a bid to show visitors what the far north of Scotland has to offer, the North Highland Initiative, backed by Prince Charles, has launched the spectacular North Coast 500 route (NC500), which they hope will become as iconic as the American highway. The stunning touring route will start in the Highland's capital, Inverness, and snake past some of Scotland's impressive coastal and mountain scenery. The coastal route is said to be ideal for drivers, motorcyclists and even walkers who want to discover the far north of Scotland . The North Coast 500 route in Scotland covers over 500 miles of spectacular Scottish scenery, including sights such as the mountains of Suilven and Canisp from Loch Druim Suardalain . Taken from the roadside heading south a couple of miles from the Kylesku Bridge. The NC500 route runs over 500 miles through the Scottish Highlands . Enjoy Brora Beach along the way. You can sometimes see dolphins, minke whales, and grey and common seals off the coastline, which makes it an ideal place for walking and picnics . The coastal NC500 route has been created to showcase what the far north of Scotland has to offer, including local food, drink, accommodation and activities . It is hoped the 500-mile route will also help to showcase local food, drink, accommodation, culture, heritage and outdoor and adventure activities. Unmissable sights along the road include mountain ranges, Ben Hope and Suilven, the fairytale grand castle, Dunrobin, the Ardvreck castle ruins and the breathtaking Achmelvich and Dornoch beaches. The route can be completed in a long weekend, or over several weeks on a more leisurely schedule and can be explored as a loop or in part. Dunrobin Castle has 189 rooms, making it the largest in the northern Highlands. Its origins lie in the Middle Ages, but most of the present building and the gardens was added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850. It is located on the NC500 1 mile north of Golspie . Ardvreck Castle is a ruined castle dating from the 16th century which stands on a rocky promontory jutting out into Loch Assynt in Sutherland, north west Highland, Scotland . Stop off at the beautiful Achmelvich Bay on your driving, cycling or walking tour . NHI chairman David Whiteford said: 'NC500 is one of the most exciting and innovative developments for tourism in the north Highlands for some time. Across the globe, touring routes have become famous and often the very reason for visitors making the journey to that country. 'We have, in the North Highlands, an opportunity to create a globally significant route that captures the essence of the wonderful landscapes and seascapes, people, stories, culture, history, adventures, food and drink and much more.' Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland said: 'There really is nothing quite like the open road, and this particular route really does take in some of the most picturesque parts of our beautiful country. People travel from all over the world for Route 66, and with our scenery, there's no reason why the North Coast 500 can't prove to be just as popular. 'You never know, at the end of the 500 miles, visitors might just be tempted explore 500 more.' The NC500 route follows the A835 out of Iverness towards the west coast. It then follows the rugged coast line upwards through the north west highlands across the north edge of mainland Britain and then follows the east coast on the A9 from Britain's most northerly village, John O'Groats, looping back to the starting point, Iverness. Route 66, in the USA, is colloquially known as the Main Street of America or the Mother Road and construction started on November 11, 1926 . 1. Route 66 is 2,448 miles long. 2. It was commissioned in 1926. 3. Route 66 starts in Chicago, and ends in L.A. (Santa Monica), covering Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. 4. Route 66 crosses three time zones. 5. In 1926 only 800 miles of Route 66 were paved. The completion of the paving end-to-end came about in 1937. 6. Despite a lot of the Route 66 being replaced by the interstate highways I-55, I-44, I-40, I-15 and I-10,  a surprisingly high amount of old road is still waiting to be found by the more adventurous traveler. 7. Route 66 was the title of a TV series running from 1960 till 1964. 8. In 1985 Route 66 was officially decommissioned, but for daily use it was replaced far earlier by the Interstates. 9. The popularity of Route 66 improved the economy of the small towns along its route during the Great Depression.","The NC500 is a brand new driving route in the Highlands, promoting its spectacular scenery .

"A possessive boyfriend who beat his petite girlfriend to death while shouting 'log on, log on' after becoming obsessed with the idea that she was having an affair on Facebook has been jailed for life. Kane Boyce, 34, brutally murdered Paula Newman, 20, in New Addington, south London, after she refused to hand over a password to one of her social media accounts. He stamped on her head and nearby residents heard piercing screams as he attacked her and shouted: 'If you don't log on, we'll see what happens.' Kane Boyce, 34, (left) has been jailed for life for murdering his 20-year-old girlfriend Paula Newman (right) by beating her and stamping on her head in south London, after she refused to hand over her Facebook password . Following the brutal attack, which caused Miss Newman to suffer a major haemorrhage, Boyce drove her to a friend's house where he showered her as she slipped in and out of consciousness. He failed to call an ambulance until the following morning and she was taken to hospital where she died from her injuries. Boyce, an electrician from Erith, southeast London, has now been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years before parole. The jury was told that while Boyce had the ability to charm women, he had a history of being manipulative, controlling and extremely violent to his partners. The Old Bailey heard how he admitted manslaughter in relation to Ms Newman's death but was found guilty of murder following a trial by jury. Sentencing Boyce, Judge Paul Worsley QC said he was 'controlling, obsessive and violent' towards women. He said: 'The attack was a sustained and brutal assault using fists and feet and your superior force. 'I regard you as a man who has demonstrated that you are a danger to young women who form relationships with you. 'Paula was a vulnerable woman. Besotted by you, she was only 20 and you were 13 years her senior, almost a foot taller and you weighed some seven stone more than she did. 'You had a history of violence and controlling behaviour towards her. 'You have a record of cowardly attacks towards other women going back 15 years.' Boyce, wearing a pink shirt and grey blazer, stared straight ahead impassively as he was sentenced. The court heard how he flew into a fit of rage on November 12, 2013, when Miss Newman stopped him from reading her online messages and refused to hand over her Facebook password. The Old Bailey heard how Boyce was 'obsessed' with looking at Miss Newman's Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him . He was 'obsessed' with looking at her Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him, the Old Bailey heard. He claimed they both accessed each other's Facebook accounts to 'give each other lives' on the Candy Crush mobile phone game. 'You get four lives an hour or something,' he said. 'I went on her phone to send myself a life so I could carry on playing.' On the evening of the murder, he attacked Ms Newman in his car and then followed her as she tried to escape to a nearby field in the New Addington area of south London. Neighbours heard 'piercing female screams' as he pushed her to the ground, hit her and stamped on her face, causing a major haemorrhage. He then bundled his girlfriend back into his car and drove her to a friend's house where he showered her and left her lying naked on the bed. At 6am the next morning, he drove to a stretch of road and collected Miss Newman's shoe and body warmer from beside a fence. When he returned home, paramedics were finally called, but Miss Newman  could not be saved. Following her death, Boyce lied about the attack and claimed she had suffered a fit. He also destroyed any evidence linking him to the crime. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton, QC, said: 'This defendant is a man who is jealous, obsessive, controlling, and violent. 'The defendant, in a violent rage, beat and it would appear kicked or stamped on Paula's head causing her severe and irreparable brain injury which brought about her death.' The court heard how Miss Newman had been planning to leave Boyce in the weeks before her death. 'It appears that at the beginning of their relationship, the defendant treated Paula well and gave her gifts, but within a few months this changed', she said. 'The relationship was up and down to say the very least. 'By the end of the summer, Paula was confiding in those close to her that they were serious problems in the relationship, they were arguing, she told those close to her that the defendant was controlling, abusive and possessive and she was unhappy.' Stefani Taylor, a friend of Miss Newman, told police: 'He had complete control of her and I have never seen her like that before. 'I pleaded with her to leave him but she would always say she loved him.' Miss Newman, who was five foot three inches tall and weighed under nine stone, started dating Boyce just seven months before he killed her and they first shared a house in Beckenham, London. The court heard how she told a friend four days before her death that she wanted to move out, and asked for help removing her possessions to avoid Boyce noticing until she had actually left. 'Paula also confided in her niece Nicola Newman that the defendant wanted her to stay in the house all the time - she felt like a prisoner', Ms Etherton said. Boyce, 34, was jailed for life, to serve a minimum jail term of 20 years, at the Old Bailey in London (pictured) Ms Etherton added that the day before her death, Boyce was heard complaining that Miss Newman would not let him into her Facebook account. 'In the weeks prior to Paula's death, and indeed at the time of her death, this defendant became obsessed with getting access to Paula's Facebook accounts', she said. Boyce told a friend: 'I've asked her for this Facebook account and she won't give it over to me for love nor money.' He also posted online: 'I knew she was f****** cheating on me, lying cheating slag', the court heard. In sentencing Boyce, Judge Worsley said Miss Newman 'had her life ahead of her'. He told the court: 'She was a much-loved member of her family. 'You ended that life when you lost your temper with her because you disapproved or disagreed with her Facebook friends. 'You were controlling abusive and violent. 'You attacked her on the edge of a housing estate when she got out of the car to escape your violence. You took her to the ground and you beat her and kicked her and she sustained a subdural haemorrhage. 'There is evidence of a stamp and a mark of an upper trainer could have caused the mark to her face. 'You failed to call an ambulance because you feared that they would recognise the bruising on her face chest and arms as signs of violence. You tried to conceal what had happened.' The judge described Boyce's explanation in court as 'another tissue of lies' and added: 'You have lied throughout in an attempt to save your skin.' Boyce shook his head as he was led down to the cells. In a victim impact statement, Miss Newman's brother Gary Newman said her four brothers were wracked by guilt that they could not protect their younger sister. He said: 'Losing Paula has left my family feeling sad, shocked, cheated and devastated. 'The incident has totally destabilised my family and it is a day to day struggle for each member of our family. 'We are all devastated and confused and want to know the truth about what happened to our sister.' Mr Newman said Miss Newman was 'the baby of the family' and described her as 'an amazing person.' He added: 'Paula was a lovely beautiful girl who we saw growing into a beautiful young woman. 'We were just starting to feel that Paula was standing on her own two feet. 'When the family gets together it doesn't feel the same anymore because Paula isn't there. 'She should have lived a long, healthy, happy life. She had a kind, carrying nature and was always there for you. 'It hurts to think that all we have are memories of her, and won't get the chance to hold her and hug her again.' 'We know that nothing will ever bring her back but the family are putting their faith in the judicial system and can only hope that Kane Boyce gets his just rewards.'","Kane Boyce found guilty of murdering his petite girlfriend Paula Newman .

"Dashing blue blood Andrea Casiraghi may be fourth in line for the throne of Monaco - one of the wealthiest countries in the world - but it seems his wife Tatiana Casiraghi (née Santo Domingo) has amassed an even greater fortune. Mrs Casiraghi, 31, who wed her 30-year-old husband in 2013, just landed herself on Forbes' 2015 World's Billionaires list at number 847, with an estimated net worth of $2.2billion, which she largely inherited from her Bavaria beer brewery owner grandfather, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, in 2011. The socialite couple currently reside in Paris with their son Sasha, who turns two this month, and Mrs Casiraghi is approximately four months pregnant with their second child. Scroll down for video .

Mr Casiraghi - the eldest son of Princess Caroline and her second husband Stefano Casiraghi, and the eldest grandson of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly - did not appear on Forbes' rich list. Though his net worth is unknown, his looks have earned him plenty of credit over the years. The blonde aristocrat made Forbes' 20 Hottest Young Royals list in 2008, and was named the second most beautiful male royal of all time by BeautifulPeople in 2011. Mrs Casiraghi was born in New York and raised between Geneva, Switzerland, and Paris. Her grandfather was cited the second richest man in Colombia by Forbes in 2011, and died the same year at the age of 87. Heirs: Mrs Casiraghi - pictured (left) with her 23-month-old son Sasha, as well as her husband (right) in November - inherited her fortune from her Bavaria  brewery owner grandfather, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, in 2011 . Welcome! Mr and Mrs Casiraghi waited a year and a half to publicly introduce Sasha to the world, which they did at Monaco's National Day celebrations at the Palais Princier de Monaco (pictured) on November 19 . In his will, Domingo split his vast $8 billion fortune six ways between his children and grandchildren; leaving Mrs Casiraghi and her New York-based DJ brother, Julio Mario Santo Domingo III, an equal share of $2 billion. Mrs Casiraghi, who founded an ethical fashion retailer called Muzungu Sisters in 2011, met her husband while the two were at boarding school together in Fontainebleau, near Paris. They dated for seven years before tying the knot in a civil ceremony in Monaco on August 31, 2013. The pair later hosted a second celebration in Gstaad, Switzerland on February 1, where they exchanged their vows in a candlelit Roman Catholic service. In addition to their son, the ceremony was attended by a number of their close family and friends, including Princess Caroline, Prince Albert and the groom's siblings, Pierre, Charlotte and Alexandra.

"A grandmother was left shaking with worry after being sent an energy bill demanding more than £9,000 - despite her really only owing her energy supplier £59. Margaret Corey, 72, was sent a letter by British Gas claiming they were planning on taking the huge sum from her bank account within days. She was told she owed more than £8,000 for gas and over £1,000 for electricity - 150 times more than the amount she actually had to pay. Margaret Corey was left shocked after she received two bills from British Gas for a total of £9,000 . Mrs Corey, from Fulwood, Lancashire, said: 'It said I owed £8,047 for gas and another £1,259 for electricity and that it would be taken out of my account on March 9. 'I was in total shock. For an OAP who lives on her own like me, it's enough to make you ill. Luckily I have a good neighbour who I went to see.' Mrs Corey said she 'couldn't stop shaking' after opening the letter, that outlined how her direct debit arrangement had changed after she'd agreed to a new tariff. When she called British Gas to inquire about the amount, she was told her combined bill should actually be £59. She said: 'The man I spoke to just said that it was a blip. He said that there's quite a few, and its worrying that he was so calm about it. 'I'm worried about other people who have got these mistakes and how they will feel.' Mrs Corey said she feared the money would automatically be taken out of her account after getting the letter . She added: 'And what if people don't check things like I do and British Gas try to take all that money out of their bank? 'Not many people will have that kind of cash in their account, so the payment won't go through, and that could cause all kinds of long-lasting problems.' A spokeswoman for British Gas said it was an isolated error. Leigh Francis said: 'When Mrs Corey contacted us about her energy tariff we set up her payment plan incorrectly. 'We've now put this right and have apologised to Mrs Corey for the distress and inconvenience and offered her a gesture of goodwill.'","Energy giant set up grandmother's payment plan incorrectly on phone .

"Anna Duritskaya, 23, pleaded to be allowed home to her native Ukraine but was said to be under police guard for further questioning . The girlfriend of murdered Russian politician Boris Nemtsov was under armed guard at an unknown location last night, as tens of thousands marched in Moscow in his name. The former deputy prime minister and leading critic of Vladimir Putin was gunned down as he walked home from dinner on Friday with Anna Duritskaya. The model, 23, pleaded to be allowed home to her native Ukraine, but was said to be under police guard yesterday for further questioning. She is understood to have given a description of the killer, despite partial ‘memory loss’ from ‘deep shock’, a law enforcement source said. As an ‘immediate eyewitness’, there were ‘grounds to conduct additional investigative action regarding her’, the source added. Last night it emerged the head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, who will lead inquiries into the murder, is a Putin loyalist with a history of intimidating the Press. He once threatened to behead a journalist and investigate the killing himself. Ukraine’s consul in Moscow, Gennady Breskalenko, said Miss Duritskaya was questioned until 5am on Saturday at the Investigative Committee building, where he had tried to see her. Ostap Semerak, a Ukrainian MP, said the model’s parents were concerned. He said Miss Duritskaya told them by phone that she had ‘no idea where she is kept’, only that she was ‘taken to some flat which is guarded, and she is not allowed to leave’. Associates of Mr Nemtsov said she was staying with a friend. The opposition leader had organised the protest against Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, but it became a mourning rally, with chants of ‘Russia without Putin’. Police claimed 16,000 marched, but observers said there were up to 70,000, with several thousand more in St Petersburg. David Cameron said he was ‘shocked and sickened by the callous murder’ and that Mr Nemtsov was ‘dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the Russian people, demanding their right to democracy and liberty … and to an end to corruption’. Mr Nemtsov, 55, a former nuclear scientist, rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin, after the Cold War, becoming deputy prime minister in 1997. Scroll down for video . The 23-year-old model and the opposition leader had dinner in central Moscow before Mr Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge overlooking St Basil's Cathedral. Miss Duritskaya is said to have suffered partial memory loss . Thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow to protest against his murder with any attributing blame to the Russian President . The 55-year-old was shot four times by an unknown killer. He was a vocal critic of Putin throughout his career . After leaving parliament in 2003, he founded opposition movements and was a vocal critic of Mr Putin over Ukraine, the economic crisis and corruption. Voters in Estonia appear to have turned away from a party that supports closer ties with Moscow. Pollsters say first returns, based on online voting, heavily favour the Reform Party of Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, with 37.5 per cent, more than the 28.6 per cent it won in 2011. The opposition Centre Party, which supports closer links with Moscow, had just 7.7 per cent – compared with the 23.3 per cent it won in 2011. But it is thought these voters have less access to the internet. A married father of four, he is understood to have been with Miss Duritskaya for three years. She was unharmed when he was hit by four of seven bullets fired from a white Lada on a bridge near the Kremlin. Mr Nemtsov had warned that Mr Putin wanted him dead. But the Kremlin strongly denied any official responsibility for the killing. Investigators said they were looking at the possibility he was killed by opposition figures, or that Islamic extremists targeted the Jewish politician. In an interview hours before his murder, Mr Nemtsov accused a ‘mad’, ‘aggressive’ Mr Putin of lying over the Ukrainian conflict and called his rule a ‘catastrophe’. The president wrote to Mr Nemtsov’s mother, promising to ‘do everything’ to ensure the perpetrators are ‘properly punished’. The government is offering £31,500 for information leading to the killer. Vladimir Putin has denied any involvement in Mr Nemtsov's death.

"Former rap mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight told a judge that he is suffering from blindness and other health complications moments before he was taken to hospital for the third time since he was charged with murder. Knight, 49, also told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Brandlin on Monday that he had fired attorneys handling his case and was receiving inadequate medical treatment in custody. The Death Row Records co-founder, who wore glasses during the brief court appearance, said he was blind in one eye and had only about 15 percent vision in his other eye. Scroll down for video . Health issues: Suge' Knight told a judge that he is suffering from blindness and other health complications moments before he was taken to a hospital following a court appearance on Monday (pictured) Constant treatment: It is the third time Knight has been transferred to hospital after he was taken into custody and charged with murder . Knight said he was having difficulty comprehending the proceedings and told the judge he had been shot six times last year and had a blood clot in his lungs and other complications. He also said he had lost 35 pounds as a result of his injuries. Brandlin transferred Knight's case to another judge, and he was taken for medical care before his case could be called in Judge Ronald Coen's courtroom. Coen said before calling the case that Knight had been taken to a hospital, but he did not elaborate. On February 19, Knight was taken into medical care, complaining about stomach problems to a shooting in a nightclub last summer. The music producer was earlier hospitalized on February 3 when he had a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges. Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital. At the time it was reported that he had suffered a blood clot and had been given blood thinners. Knight has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges after he struck two men with his truck, killing one, on Jan. 29. He remains held without bail. Knight was out on bail in the separate robbery case at the time. His lawyer claimed that Knight was ambushed and feared for his life prior to the hit-and-run. Authorities allege Knight killed Terry Carter, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck near a film set in Compton, California. Police said he fled the scene. Representation: The rap mogul told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Brandlin that he had fired attorneys handling his murder case  and was receiving inadequate medical treatment while in custody . It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.' Attorney David Kenner, who has represented Knight since the case was filed, told Coen that his client has been jailed too long and a hearing to set bail should be convened as soon as possible. Coen ordered another hearing for Knight on March 9. Knight said he had fired Kenner and his law partner, telling Brandlin, 'I fired these lawyers.' He repeatedly tried to speak during the hearing in Brandlin's courtroom, but the judge admonished him not to interrupt. Knight said down and muttered an expletive while Brandlin quickly concluded the proceedings. He wore orange jail attire and glasses during the hearing, and spoke while flanked by deputies. Knight was shot six times at a nightclub in August. Within days of his release from the hospital, he was accused by a celebrity photographer of stealing her camera.

"It's only logical that Kirstie Alley has been called out by Star Trek fans for paying tribute to the wrong Spock. The actress raised the heckles of Trekkies Sunday when she wrote a tribute on Twitter seemingly honoring a real-life celebrity child psychologist instead of the fictional science officer of USS Enterprise portrayed by the late actor Leonard Nimoy. 'Rest in peace Dr. Spock ... Xxxooo,' Alley wrote in a message accompanying a black-and-white still photograph of Nimoy as the half-Vulcan first officer under the command of Captain James T. Kirk.

The vintage image also features a young Kirstie Alley as the Romulan Lieutenant Saavik, who appears to be going in for a kiss with Nimoy's stone-faced Spock in the 1982 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan. Alley was later replaced in the role by the actress Robin Curtis. The 64-year-old TV and film actress unwittingly eulogized Dr Benjamin Spock, a famed pediatric psychoanalyst and the author of the mega best-seller Baby and Child Care who passed away in 1998 at age 94.

"A pair of cheetah cubs were taught a lesson  on how to catch a quick lunch as they watched their mother stalk and take down an antelope in just 15 seconds. The mother was leading her children through the Masai Mara National Park in southern Kenya when she spotted an isolated impala in the distance. The cheetah, which can accelerate to speeds of 60mph in mere seconds, got itself into position before bursting into action and giving chase. The chase is on: The cheetah, which can accelerate to speeds of 60mph in just seconds, got itself into position before bursting into action . Fight to the death: A cheetah locks on to the next of an isolated impala as she tried to catch dinner for her and her two cubs . On the prowl: The mother cheetah hides in the savannah as it prepares to strike, picking the best moment to charge at its prey . Stalking: The cheetah got its two cubs to hang back as she approached the impale in the Masai Mara National Park in Kenya . The impala stood no chance, with the big cat catching the animal in just 15 seconds - barely enough time for the cheetah cubs to realise what they were watching. Predator and prey were seen grappling with each other for around three minutes, but before long the impala stopped putting up a fight and collapsed. The cubs had hidden out of sight as their mother went hunting but were called out shortly after the brutal battle came to a close so the family could tuck into dinner together. The small cheetahs may appear cute but they are actually particularly ferocious, as was seen as they tore apart the carcass of the impala while their mother rested following her fight. The stunning pictures were taken by photographer Massimo Mei, 53, who was on a trip to the African country. Big cat: The impala stood no chance, with the cheetah catching the animal in just 15 seconds as the cubs watched intently . Death grip: The impala uses up what energy it has left in a desperate attempt to escape the clutches of the cheetag . Predator and prey: The cheetah and impala do battle as the antelope tries to wriggle free from the big cat's vice grip . Gotcha: But the antelope cannot put up enough of a fight and it is soon dragged to the ground with fatal injuries . Dinner time! After killing the impala, the mother cheetah calls over her cubs so the family can tuck into their dinner together . Italian Mr Mei, from Rome, said: 'When the impala was caught we moved fast - closer to the action and found the cheetah clamping it. 'It was like a dance of death time moved slowly keeping with the breath of the impala getting slower and slower. 'The chase went on for just 15 seconds but took about three minutes for the impala to give up its struggle. 'The mother of four cubs is well known in the park - her name is Malaika, or 'Angel' in Swahili. 'Malaika tried to pull the impala into the shadows but it was too heavy, so decided to prepare the meal for the cubs where it was. 'When ready she called the cubs over. When they arrived and began feeding it made me forget the agony of the scene I witnessed.' Thanks mum: One of the cute but ferocious cubs licks its lips while the other devours the impala's carcass . Tucking in: As their mother rests after the short but strenuous battle, the young cheetah cubs get their fill . Feast: After getting her breath back, the cubs' mother returns to get her dinner, dragging the impala's body away from her child . Family dinner: The stunning pictures were taken by photographer Massimo Mei, 53, who was on a trip to the African country .

"A number of Australians are sending the Attorney-General a very clear message of what they think about the government’s proposed new metadata retention laws - straight to his iPhone and his email inbox. Those opposed to the Abbott government’s plan to force telcos to record all Australians' calls, texts, and emails so that it can be freely accessed by police and intelligence agencies have begun trolling George Brandis’s Apple device and copying him into all of their emails. The bill to retain so-called metadata for a minimum two years has been drafted as a counterterrorism measure but the bill does not specify what metadata is and experts differ on definition. Mr Brandis's bombardment comes as the Senate  censured him for seeking the resignation of Human Rights Commission boss Gillian Triggs and failing to defend her from 'malicious attacks'. Attorney-General George Brandis has been bombarded with messages after it was revealed his public email was linked to a mobile . Software engineer Justin Simon first realised that he could send an iMessage direct to Mr Brandis's phone . The fallout from the public spat between the government and Professor Triggs continued on Monday when the upper house spent hours debating the Labor motion condemning Senator Brandis over his handling of the issue. Opposition Senate leader Penny Wong claimed the attorney's 'deplorable' treatment of the commission and its president made him unfit to hold office as the nation's most senior law officer. Senator Brandis vigorously defended his position, claiming the public deserved to know why the government had lost confidence in Prof Triggs. Delaying an inquiry into asylum-seeker children in detention until after Labor lost office could only be seen as protecting that side of politics, he said. 'To say that is not to attack her character, or to be a bully-boy, it is merely to explain why a conclusion has been reached,' he told parliament. The Senate has censured Attorney-General George Brandis for seeking the resignation of Human Rights Commission boss Gillian Triggs and failing to defend her from 'malicious attacks' Software engineer Justin Simon first realised that he could send an iMessage direct to Mr Brandis’s phone on Sunday by spotting his publicly available email is linked to his Apple device, BuzzFeed revealed. Mr Simon then shared the revelation on Twitter with the crudely worded tweet: ‘Hey c*** how’s tricks?’ Other Twitter users then followed suit by trolling Mr Brandis’s iMessage account with messages. Luke Vurens wrote: ‘Hello Mr Brandis can I please see your harmless metadata? It’s for security purposes. Don’t worry, if you’re not doing anything wrong you don’t have anything to free.’ A grassroots campaign called Help Curious George also served up the Attorney-General’s email address and encouraged the public to ‘cc senator.brandis@aph.gov.au on all your emails’. ‘Attorney-General George Brandis is very very curious. He wants to know exactly what we're all up to online. And the phone. Email, Facebook, Twitter. Calls, Texts, Skype. Friends, Family, Politics. The lot!,’ the online campaign reads. Emily Lockwood pointed out that Mr Brandis has a physical similarity to Muppets character Professor Bunsen Honeydew . Lauren Ingram ironically sent Mr Brandis the first chapter of 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell, ‘over many messages’ ‘We like “Curious George”. He's such a clever little monkey. But he's really not too technical. Please pledge below to help George feed his insatiable curiosity.’ Emily Lockwood pointed out that Mr Brandis has a physical similarity to Muppets character Professor Bunsen Honeydew. ‘How do you feel about looking like one of the dumbest muppets?,’ she emailed him. Will Southers wrote: ‘Hi George, just wondering what your favourite emoji is? Mine is [thumbs up emoji] in case you were interested.’ Lauren Ingram ironically sent Mr Brandis the first chapter of 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell, ‘over many messages’. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 bill will be debated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The government wants to be free to set the definition without consulting Parliament after the bill becomes law. Another Twitter user promised to entertain Mr Brandis with the Harry Potter series in iMessage form . Those opposed to the government's data retention plan began the social media hashtag #StopDataRetention . In its review of the draft bill, Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee recommended that the definition be set in the legislation rather than decided by government through regulations. In describing metadata, the government uses the analogy of traditional mail. The metadata is the information written on the envelope, not what's written on the letter inside. With telephones, metadata includes the number called, the duration, time and date of the call, plus the location of the cellphone. It does not include the contents of the conversation. But the Internet is a grayer area. George Williams, a University of New South Wales law professor, said the recommendations addressed his two major concerns with the legislation: that it failed to specify what metadata was and failed to say who could access it. Attorney-General George Brandis said the government would make a public response next week. It could ignore the recommendations, but to do so would likely doom the legislation to rejection in the Senate, where the ruling conservative coalition does not hold a majority. Will Southers wrote: ‘Hi George, just wondering what your favourite emoji is? Ben Jenkins also took the opportunity to troll Mr Brandis once the campaign began . The government has said metadata includes the number called, the duration, time and date of the call, plus the location of the cellphone. It does not include the contents of the conversation . Several countries have laws on metadata retention. U.S. laws allow government access to metadata with or without a warrant. Australian police say they already access metadata, but are concerned that many companies don't store it for as long as they used to. Several companies have warned that the new retention obligations would cost them and their customers millions of dollars. The Attorney-General’s website unveiled the estimated cost on Sunday. ‘The Attorney-General’s Department has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to cost the implementation of the proposed data retention regime in consultation with industry. ‘PwC estimated the upfront capital cost of the regime to all of business to be between $188.8 million and $319.1 million, which is less than 1 per cent of the $43 billion in revenue generated by the telecommunications industry annually,’ the website states. ‘This estimate will inform the Australian Government in delivering on its commitment to make a reasonable contribution to the capital costs of implementation of the data retention regime. Because Australians are among the worst in the world for illegally downloading movies and video games, many fear that prosecutions won't stop at terrorists. The Attorney-General’s website states: ‘Australia needs a data retention scheme because telecommunications companies are retaining less data and keeping it for a shorter time. This is degrading the investigative capabilities of law enforcement and security agencies and, in some cases, has prevented serious criminals from being brought to justice.’","The government wants to record Australians' metadata for two years .

"Their faces covered in elaborate black patterns and, in some cases, totally dark with ink, these smiling villagers are some of Burma's last surviving tattooed women. A custom that, according to legend, began when an ancient king tried to make slaves of the women, the inkings were first intended to repel incomers and then became a symbol of beauty. But with  younger people increasingly reluctant to be inked for fear of ridicule and for fear of the heavy fines imposed by the ruling military junta, Burma's tattooing tradition is on borrowed time and could disappear within a generation. Sign of beauty: The women of the Chin, Magan and Muun tribes say facial tattoos are a sign of beauty . Customs: The tradition exists alongside other customs such as playing the flute through the nose. A Magan woman is pictured. Isolated: The tribes live far from the Burmese capital Naypyidaw in a mountainous area that was cut off until two years ago . Fines: The military junta has done its best to eradicate the tattoo tradition and levies a hefty fine of half a cow on anyone who gets one . Meaning: Each of the facial tattoos is replete with symbols, although the most frequently seen design is the spider's web (pictured) Variation: These women, both from the Chin tribe, have less prominent tattoos than those from the Muun and Magan peoples . Attractive: This lady told MailOnline that her spider's web tattoo caught men like the real thing catches flies . As a result, few women now have the markings, with the majority of those who do living hidden away in the mountainous Chin, Rakhine and Arakan regions - all of which were closed off to visitors until two years ago. Now an estimated 700 tourists travel to the area each year, although few are inclined to attempt the precipitous climb up to the mountain eyries of the Magan, Chin and Muun tribes. Those who do will be rewarded with a warm welcome - and a glimpse into one of Asia's oldest, and most threatened, cultures. Most of the tattooed women boast spider's web designs which, as one villager quipped to MailOnline, 'attract the men like a spider's web catches insects'. Others bear full-face tattoos, with every part of their face covered in ink - again, a symbol of beauty. So popular did the look become, one elderly lady, Pa Late from the remote Kanpelet village, revealed that women who chose not to have it 'looked ugly to all the men'. Must-have: The tattoos are thought to be an ancient custom that arose in response to a slave-hungry king. It was supposed to make girls ugly . Mandatory: In the centuries that followed, the tattoos became a sign of beauty and were insisted upon by parents . Generation gap: Although Ma Aung Seim has facial tattoos, her granddaughter Yi Yi (left) has refused to have them for fear of ridicule . All black: Pa Late, who says her tattoos took three days to complete, says an all-black face was once thought to be the most attractive . Youngest: 67-year-old Miss Heu is one of the youngest women to have the tattoos in Kanpelet. She was tattooed by her grandmother . Delicate: Women of the Chin tribe have smaller and more delicate tattoos that only cover part of the face . Painful: The facial tattoos are made using thorns (pictured) and ink made from a mixture of pig fat, cow bile, plants and soot . Toothless: Many of the women regularly chew betel nuts which results in tooth loss and brown stains on the rest . The tattoos, which are created using thorn needles and an ink made from a mixture of cow bile, soot, plants and pig fat, are also a sign of bravery - particularly those etched on the neck, which are the most painful of all. In the past, women who tried to avoid being tattooed found themselves thrown into the family pig pen where, says Pa Late, they stayed until they changed their minds and submitted to the procedure. Now, however, the tables have been turned on the tribesmen, with the brutal military junta that dominated the country until 2011 declaring the tattoos illegal and imposing harsh fines on anyone to break the rules. Although the country is currently undergoing a political renewal under current president, Thein Sein, the fines remain in place - and as a result, fewer and fewer women are getting the tattoos. Other tribal customs, such as changing a woman's name when she becomes a mother, remain intact, as does a continuing belief in the power of the village shaman and his totems. High on Mount Victoria in a Chin village called Pan Baung, the skulls of pigs and buffaloes sacrificed during shamanic ceremonies adorn each house, while outside, the family totems are arranged in a wooden palisade. Traditional lives: All three tribes live in remote mountain villages and, as a result, are still adept at handicrafts and believe in shamans . Few visitors: The Mount Victoria area in which they live was closed to outsiders until two years ago. Now 700 tourists arrive each year . English: To the tribespeople, all foreigners are 'English' - a legacy from the UK's time as the colonial power in Burma . Pale: They also believe that white skin is the result of boiling the individual concerned in water . Smoke break: Nearly all the women smoke pipes, although their frequent smoke breaks don't seem to affect their ability to move around . Relaxed: Most of the women smoke tobacco in their clay pipes, from which they are rarely parted . No problem: The women's daily routine, which involves heavy lifting and mountainous paths, is seemingly unaffected by their smoking . Hard work: For the Chin, Muun and Magan (Chin pictured) women, life revolves around collecting water and gathering food . Most homes have a small post topped with an egg beside their front doors, which according to local lore, is a way to bring the family good luck and happiness, while also repelling evil spirits. Other Chin traditions include a ban on men eating meat in his wife's family's home in case it brings bad luck and an emphasis on having sons who will, should a family member be murdered, be expected to avenge their death in person. That many of the Chin, Muun and Magan traditions, including, rather charmingly, a penchant for playing the flute using the nose, exist intact only because of the villages' remoteness. Although many villagers have left in search of work in Naypyidaw, the capital of Burma, and in countries such as Singapore, those who remain live much as they always have - without electricity and with sightings of foreigners few and far between. With so few visitors, any non-Burmese to appear in the village is immediately deemed to be English - a hangover from the colonial times. Amusingly, many of  locals remain convinced that white skin is the result that person being boiled. But, as with their tattoos, the future looks uncertain for the Chin and other Burmese tribes, whose traditions are beginning to be eroded by incomers - not least in the non-Chin teachers who teach the children different traditions and a different language. In Pan Baung village only six tattooed women, all of whom are now in their 80s, remain. They truly are the last of their kind. Totems: The people still believe in totems such as pig skulls (left behind boy) and eggs, which are thought to bring good luck and happiness . Family: Wooden totems represent different stages in a family's life. Each is paid for with a buffalo so the more there are, the richer the family . Extra money: Most of the tribes are self-sufficient but make extra money through weaving and basket making . Housework: Women do all the cooking and housework. The tribes say it brings bad luck if men cook . Precipitous: The tribes live deep in the mountains in small villages that cling precariously to the steep slopes . Spectacular: Many live on Mount Victoria (pictured), which is too steep for most visitors to navigate .","The Muun, Magan and Chin tribes of remote north-western Burma consider tattoos a sign of beauty .

"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the world’s first all-electric communications satellites successfully launched this morning. The huge 22-story tall booster took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 3.50am GMT this morning (10.50pm EST yesterday), the third flight in less than two months for SpaceX. On this occasion, though, SpaceX made no attempt to land the rocket again on a floating barge, as they had done previously. Scroll down for video . A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying two commercial communications satellites launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 41 this morning. It is seen here over the skyline of downtown Cocoa Beach in a two minute time exposure of the launch . On top of the rocket were a pair of satellites built by Boeing and owned by Paris-based Eutelsat communications and Bermuda-based Asia Broadcast Satellite (ABS). The satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion, as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured. This has the benefit of making the much lighter, as they don’t need to carry fuel with them. ‘The value of electrical propulsion is that it allows the satellite operator to need much less fuel than when the satellite has chemical propulsion,’ Eutelsat chief executive Michel de Rosen said in an interview before launch. Without the fuel they would normally need - hydrazine - the satellites each weighed less than 5,000lbs (2,270kg), whereas normally they would have weighed more than 8,000lbs (3,630kg) without an ion propulsion system. This also meant both satellites could be carried by SpaceX’s medium-sized Falcon 9 rocket – had they been laden with fuel, only one could have been taken to orbit on this launch. This also brought the cost of the launch down - Eutelsat and ABS paid around £20 million ($30 million) each to place their satellites on the rocket, as a single launch costs about £40 million ($60 million). However, as ion propulsion - also known as Solar Electric Propulsion - is much weaker than chemical propulsion, it will take them months rather than weeks to reach their desired geostationary orbit. ‘You can have a much lighter satellite, so that, in theory, the cost of your launch is much reduced.’ The lighter of the two satellites, ABS 3A, will reach its destination by the end of August, while the Eutelsat 115 West B spacecraft will take a few weeks longer. In space, the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions, so as to avoid a collision. Once in their desired orbits, about 22,300 miles (35,800km) above Earth, they will be able to remain operational for at least two decades. To get there, they will use what is called a ‘supersynchronous transfer orbit’, which involves performing a large elliptical ‘loop’ around Earth to reach this relatively distant location. Once they reach their orbits, they will remain in one position over a particular part of the world, providing coverage to certain areas. Specifically, the ABS 3A satellite will connect the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The Eutelsat 115 West B satellite, meanwhile, will provide coverage from Alaska and Canada to South America. Eutelsat's spacecraft will become part of a 35-member network providing a range of mobile, internet, video and other communications services. The new satellite expands the company's reach into the Americas. ABS, which currently has six satellites, will position its new spacecraft to also serve customers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The companies are partnering for a second pair of satellites that are due to launch aboard another Falcon 9 rocket later this year. SpaceX also flies cargo missions to the International Space Station for Nasa and is working on an upgraded spaceship to fly astronauts as well. The next SpaceX launch, which will take a communications satellite for Tukemenistan into orbit, is currently scheduled for 21 March 2015. On top of the rocket (shown) were a pair of satellites built by Boeing and owned by Paris-based Eutelsat communications and Bermuda-based Asia Broadcast Satellite (ABS). The satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion, as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured . The rocket flies through Brevard County skies in this view from Melbourne after its liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Without chemical fuel the weight of the satellites was drastically reduced, allowing both to be launched on the same rocket rather than costly separate launches. In space, the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions, so as to avoid a collision . The Vine above shows the moment the first of the two satellites - ABS 3A - was released into orbit . The two satellites are seen here before launch. ABS 3A is on the top, and the Eutelsat 115 West B is on the bottom of the payload. The latter was slightly heavier to support the weight of the former .","A SpaceX rocket has lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida carrying the world's first all-electric satellites .

"When Alison Norris couldn't find work in Detroit, she searched past city limits, ending up with a part-time restaurant job 20 miles away, which takes at least two hours to get to using public transportation. Norris has to take two buses to her job at a suburban mall in Troy, Michigan, using separate city and suburban bus systems. For many city residents with limited skills and education, Detroit is an employment desert, having lost tens of thousands of blue-collar jobs in manufacturing cutbacks and service jobs as the population dwindled. Mayor Mike Duggan, however, has made rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs some of Detroit's priorities now that the city is out of bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Alison Norris, 26, pictured on February 12, catches at least two buses during a two-hour, one-way commute from Detroit to her restaurant hostess job in the city's northern suburbs . Norris is among many Detroit residents without cars who often must travel long distances for low-paying positions in customer service or sales far outside the central city. Norris says there are too few jobs in the city . But those jobs may not materialize quickly enough for Norris and others who've found local prospects slim, and the lack of reliable public transit is an obstacle that's driving even those who've stuck it out to consider leaving. 'There no jobs in Detroit,' said Norris, 26, waiting in 16-degree temperatures for the first of two buses to the Somerset Collection mall in Troy, where she makes $8.25 an hour as a bistro hostess. 'If it's no jobs, then why stay in the city?' said Norris. 'There is nothing here.' The city's unemployment rate, which hit 25 per  cent in 2009, stood at 14.9 per cent last year, state figures show, compared to a regional rate below 7 per cent. Many residents without cars — about 40 per cent of Detroit's population, according to federal figures — often enter low-paying retail or sales positions far outside the city. The number of Detroit residents who work outside the city is nearly double the number with jobs inside the city, according to statistics from regional planning organization Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMGOC). More than 228,000 Detroit residents commute beyond the city limits, while only about 115,000 people who live in Detroit also work in the city, SEMCOG says. Inner-ring suburbs are the primary work destinations for Detroit residents. But several thousand, like Norris, make longer odysseys. 'The city of Detroit has been on hard times for a while, and there aren't as many jobs in the city as I'm sure the city will like,' said Carmine Palombo, SEMCOG's deputy executive director. 'Mayor Duggan is working on that. But for right now, there are a lot of jobs — and some of the lower paying jobs — in the suburbs that people from the city are trying to fill,' Palombo said. Part of the problem is getting there. The Motor City, built largely on the auto ownership dream, tore up its streetcar system in the 1950s. The city today has no subway or tram system outside a 3-mile elevated loop that serves only downtown. And while construction has begun on a light rail, it will connect only the thriving downtown and Midtown areas, not reach into the hardest-hit neighborhoods. As its financial state worsened, Detroit had reduced bus service on some routes and eliminated others. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has said that his priorities for Detroit are rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs. The population of Detroit has decreased to 680,000 from 1.8million in the 1950s . A regional transportation system — separate from Detroit's and primarily serving the suburbs — also has struggled with funding. Newspapers across the U.S. reported on 56-year-old James Robertson earlier this month, who said he walked 21 miles to and from his factory job in the suburbs after his car failed and bus service was cut back. The Detroiter received a $350,000 from a GoFundMe campaign and a new Ford Taurus after his plight received national media attention. The bus routes still provide a cobbled-together lifeline for those like Norris, who said she'd prefer to work in Detroit. Her desire to one day move closer to where the jobs are collides with Duggan's hopes to spur growth in the city, whose population has fallen to 680,000 from a high of 1.8million in the 1950s. 'There are a lot of people trying to rely on public transportation to get them to a job,' Palombo said. 'What you tend to see is... people move out along with the jobs. It's that movement of households.' Duggan has said Detroit is working on training programs to prepare residents for skilled jobs in the city. James Robertson, 56, was highlighted earlier this month as a Detroiter who worked outside the city. He walked 21 miles to and from work every day because he couldn't afford a car . After a GoFundMe site was set up for Robertson, people from around the world raised more than $350,000 for him and he was eventually given a new Ford Taurus . The fire department will help high school students receive paramedic and firefighting certifications, and the police department is working on a similar program. The mayor said half the jobs on an entertainment complex and hockey arena, most initially construction work, will go to city residents. 'It helps a lot if we can get the jobs located nearby,' said Duggan, who also announced earlier this year that the city would get 80 new buses and launch a mobile app for the system. One new business, Detroit Manufacturing Systems, is working with the city on bus times to accommodate employee schedules, said owner Andra Rush. Entry-level workers making auto interiors earn $11 an hour plus benefits. The company has hired nearly 1,000 workers, including 300 over the past few months, and more than half the new hires live in Detroit. That's no accident. 'By hiring Detroiters, we help Detroit,' said Rush. Michigan Economic Development Corp.'s new Community Ventures program is also working to create jobs for residents, according to the Detroit Free Press. The company has created a model for worker retraining programs that helps structurally unemployed workers learn new skills. Detroit Manufacturing Systems (pictured) is working with the city's public transportation services to accommodate employees. More than half of the 1,000 new hires for the company are Detroit residents .","Detroit resident Alison Norris, 26, has to take two separate bus systems to get to her $8.25-an-hour job in a suburb 20 miles from her home .

"The father of a man killed by the FBI in the investigation of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev is suing the agency for $30million. Abdulbaki Todashev, father of then-27-year-old Ibragim Todashev, said he will file a notice of claim in the death of his son, who was shot by Special Agent Aaron McFarlane the night of May 21, 2013. The claim will lead to a wrongful death lawsuit, and the elder Todashev is also alleging negligence by the FBI for hiring McFarlane, who had a checkered past. Scroll down for video . Warning: graphic image below . Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot by FBI agent Aaron McFarlane during investigations into the Boston bombings. His father Abdulbaki  has filed a notice of claim alleging wrongful death . Todashev (left) was repeatedly questioned by federal agents in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Abdulbaki Todashev (right) has previously said that 'FBI bandits' killed his son . The agent settled two police brutality lawsuits while at the Oakland Police Department and allegedly falsified reports before joining Boston's FBI, according to the Boston Globe. Todashev is represented by the Council on American–Islamic Relations, who says that his son 'did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm to McFarlane or any other person' while being questioned about the Boston Bombings and a 2011 murder. The Department of Justice and a Florida State Attorney’s Office have both cleared McFarlane of wrongdoing in the shooting at Ibragim Todashev's Orlando apartment. Both official reports said that the agent acted in self-defense after being attacked by Todashev, a trained martial arts fighter. The Russian immigrant, who lived in Massachusetts before moving to Florida, was reportedly writing a confession for involvement in the 2011 killing of three drug dealers in Waltham, a suburb of Boston, when he threw a coffee table and lunged at McFarlane with a broom. FBI agent McFarlane and two Massachusetts state troopers were interrogating Todashev for six hours before he was shot. The Chechen Orlando resident had reportedly been writing a confession linked to a murder case . Todashev was friends with Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) after training with him. Tamerlan,  26, was killed shortly after the 2013 attack, and his brother Dzhokar, (right, then 19) is now on trial . He was shot seven times in two bursts of fire, including once on the top of the head. Abdulbaki Todashev, in Moscow, says that the agent killed his son 'in cold blood,' according to MSNBC. He has previously said that 'FBI bandits' had been behind the death. Two Massachusetts state troopers were also present and CAIR Florida  says that 'none of the agents present sought to intervene to prevent the excessive force, though able.' Lawyers for the group also say that McFarlane allegedly falsified police reports and was misusing government money by working for the FBI while accepting disability payments from California. Abdulbaki Todashev also alleges negligence in the FBI's hiring of McFarlane . A statement from the Todashev family, who buried Ibragim in Chechnya, Russia, said they want to 'draw public attention to the illegal practices, abuses of power, and civil rights violations by the FBI. FBI internal investigations cleared every officer in 150 shootings since 1993, according to a 2013 investigation by the New York Times. CAIR also faults the agency for 'allowing of agents to conduct potentially charged interviews in people's homes'. Ibragim Todashev was approached by FBI almost immediately following the Boston bombings, and had questioned him repeatedly and confiscated his electronic devices before the shooting. The six-hour Orlando interrogation occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston bombings, where Todashev's friend Tamerlan Tsarnaev, then 26, is thought to have killed three and injured more than 200 with homemade explosives. Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in the manhunt that followed the attack. His friend Todashev, who had trained at the same boxing gym as the attacker, told agents that the bombings were 'horrible and unnecessary,' according to the claim of notice. The episode that led to his death happened after the man's girlfriend had been taken to an immigration detention center after allegedly refusing FBI agents' request to inform them of his activities. The claim of Abdulbaki Todahsev (left) against the FBI is being handled by the Council on American–Islamic Relations's Florida office, including CAIR Tampa executive director Hassan Shibly (center) A witness Todashev had brought to his interrogation was allegedly sent away shortly before his friend was shot. A spokesman for the Boston FBI told Daily Mail Online that the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The national FBI office also declined comment on the same grounds and referred to the Department of Justice and Florida reports on the incident. Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokar, 19 at the time, is on trial for terrorism charges in connection with the Boston Bombings. Opening statements in the case will begin later this week. Opening statements terrorism trial of Dzhokar Tsarnaev for the Boston Marathon bombings will begin this week.

"Budget prices: Aldi is introducing Wagyu burgers at £2.99 each in a bid to chase from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers . An A list celebrity might spend £29 on a Wagyu burger at London’s Dorchester Hotel – after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence. Alternatively, you could try the local Aldi, where the budget chain is introducing Wagyu burgers at £2.99 each. The budget chain is to offer a limited stock of Wagyu burgers made with beef imported from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers. Normally, luxury restaurants, stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo – so putting it out of reach for most families. However, Aldi is bringing the beef, which originated with pampered cattle in Japan, to the masses. Last year the company sold Wagyu sirloin and rib-eye steaks at £6.99 each, which resulted in something of a stampede among the BMW-driving classes. It believes the burgers will be similarly successful. Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture. The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century. Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around. Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition. However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK and New Zealand. Beef from Wagyu cows is sold for as much as £100 per kilo in luxury restaurants and gourmet butchers . Aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the Oscars ball. Stars such as Bradley Cooper, Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore were amongst the 1,500 members of Hollywood royalty to dine at infamous Governors Ball, where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu. The chain’s managing director of corporate buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. Following the frenzy around the Wagyu steaks Aldi sold last summer, we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers. Following his Oscar success, Eddie Redmayne dined at the Governors Ball where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu . ‘Aldi’s Specially Selected Wagyu Burgers are made from premium quality Wagyu beef, and are available at an everyday low price, which our customers have come to know and love.’ At the Dorchester Bar, the £29 Wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise. Aldi suggests teaming its version with its Specially Selected Brioche Burger Buns, which are 99p for four, and a pack of Roquefort cheese, which is £2.29. That would give a price for the Aldi version of less than £4 – assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese.","Budget supermarket is importing the high-quality meat from New Zealand .

"You could call Dominic Pace the ultimate film buff. The 39-year-old actor is so passionate about his craft that he has travelled with his wife and children to more than 250 film locations in an ‘epic road trip’ that began five years ago. Their travels have taken them to some of the world’s most popular spots – from the ‘Rocky steps’ in Philadelphia to the fire station featured in Ghostbusters – and lesser-known locations, including the house from Father of the Bride and the corner shop where McLovin tries to buy alcohol in the film Superbad. Scroll down for video . Dominic and Dante recreated a fight scene from Rebel Without a Cause at Los Angeles' Griffith Park . James Dean died in a car crash less than a month before Rebel Without a Cause was released in cinemas . Father and son faced off again at the Los Angeles gymnasium made famous in The Karate Kid's final scene . The Karate Kid's final scenes were filmed at California State University, Northridge in Los Angeles . Dante pretended to be McLovin, the underage character who tries to buy beer in a scene from Superbad . The 7 Days Food Store, where this scene from Superbad was set, is located in Glendale, California . Dominic, a character actor who works mostly in television, has been documenting his family’s travels, taken between breaks in work and school, with photos that show them recreating famous film scenes. It all stems back to a decision he made in 2010 when he returned from work one day and found his kids staring at the television and tablet computer in their Hollywood home. He thought it would be fun to take them to film locations in the Los Angeles area, and the idea snowballed into something that has taken them across the US and provided lasting memories. Dominic told MailOnline Travel: ‘I've always been a fan of film, and the artists who have made so many iconic projects over the past 100 years. These artists are what have always inspired me to become an actor, so that I may one day have the same impact on someone as they have had on me. One of the highlights of the family's travels as a visit to the Iowa farm from Field of Dreams . Tourists are lured to Dubuque County, Iowa, to visit the farm where Field of Dreams was filmed . Dominic and Geraldine  recreate Pretty Woman's final scene outside the Las Palmas Hotel in Hollywood . The family's travels have taken them across the US, including the famous 'Rocky steps' in Philadelphia . Tourists flocked to the Philadelphia Museum of Art every day to recreate this scene from Rocky . In New York City, the Pace family visited the fire station featured in Ghostbusters . The fire station, which acted as a stand-in for the Ghostbusters' headquarters, is located in Manhattan . ‘I've always felt some of these locations were informal landmarks and tributes to the actors, directors, directors of photography and screenwriters who have done such great work. ‘To stand where Pacino and Brando performed, or even The Goonies, or where John Hughes directed in Chicago, it's always been very special to me. ‘The world is covered with so much negativity, and I thought it was the perfect way to sort of jump into these imaginary worlds that have given everyone so much happiness through our lives.’ Dominic said the hobby has provided invaluable bonding time with his wife, Geraldine, 40, and their sons, Dante, 9, and Benett, 6. One of the lesser-known locations was the New Jersey setting for Camp Crystal Lake in Friday the 13th . Scenes from the opening of Reservoir Dogs were filmed in this parking lot in Los Angeles . This scene from Reservoir Dogs was filmed in a car park at a bowling alley in on Eagle Rock Boulevard . Their first visit was to Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, where Dominic and Dante recreated James Dean’s knife fight scene from Rebel Without a Cause. Since then, they have visited homes from films or television programmes (The Godfather, A Christmas Story, All in the Family, Risky Business, and Michael Jackson’s Thriller music video, among them), sat on the bleachers at the Iowa farm which served as the setting for Field of Dreams, and walked on the beach where scenes from Jaws were filmed. Dominic, who has had guest roles in programmes such as NCIS, Bones, Desperate Housewives and NYPD Blue, even had his grandmother pose for a photo outside the New Jersey strip club which was the stand-in for the Bada Bing in The Sopranos. Dominic and Dante strike a pose outside the LA home from Michael Jackson's video for Thriller . Dante and Benett sit outside the Burbank home where the fictional Arnold family lived in The Wonder Years . Of the 250-plus locations he has visited, Dominic was blown away by the town of Brownsville, Oregon, which served as a fictional town in the classic coming-of-age film Stand by Me. He said: ‘It’s a town that really hasn’t changed much since the film. And it’s not just a house or a street, but the entire town was [featured]. 'When you’re there, you can really have a sense of being in one of the greatest Hollywood films. It was sad as well, as my Generation X shares the same age as the boys in the film when it was released. Dante channels Tom Cruise's character from Risky Business outside the Chicago home shown in the film . Tom Cruise starred in Risky Business as a teen who gets up to no good while his parents are away . The Pace family's road trips usually take them to Major League Baseball stadiums all over the US . Dominic said one of his favourite locations was Brownsville, Oregon, where Stand by Me was filmed . ‘When you’re there it’s a feeling as if time has moved on and the boys have grown up, as we have … but there’s still that beautiful feeling of youth and hanging out with our friends just like the characters did, without a care in the world at one time.’ Films from the 1980s – The Karate Kid, Back to the Future and any written and directed by John Hughes – hold sentimental value for Dominic, who watched plenty of them while spending summers at his grandparents’ home as he grew up in Ossining, New York. He said: ‘My grandparents were very special to me, and their house was the one place where there was so much love, with family and friends coming in and out all of the time. ‘Those films attach my memories to my grandparents, and some of the best years of my life I've had so far. Dominic and his sons pose for a snap at a Los Angeles hotel featured at the end of the 1982 film Poltergeist . Poltergeist tells the story of a California family affected by strange events after moving into a new home . Fans of the classic film ET are frequent visitors to this house in Tujunga, California . ‘My grandmother would be cooking, my grandfather either working in his tool shed or playing solitaire watching with us. I think ultimately that's the magic of being at some of these locations, a fond memory of who I was with when I watched the films for the first time.’ But not all locations lived up to the family’s expectations, given the passage of time. An Italian restaurant in the Bronx, which was featured in The Godfather, is now a yarn store, while, and the diner from the opening scene of Pulp Fiction is no longer there. They were unable to get close to the New Jersey lake where scenes from the original Friday the 13th were filmed, as it is now a private camp operated by the Boy Scouts of America. Dominic and Geraldine share a kiss as they recreate a scene from Moonstruck at a New York apartment . The family home featured in A Christmas Story has been preserved as a museum in Cleveland, Ohio . The family’s next trip will take them to Miami, where they plan to visit locations from Ace Ventura, Scarface, Porky’s, The Birdcage and Miami Vice. In the next few years they would love to visit locations in Europe. As they continue to scratch locations off their list, Dominic said he wants to publish a travel guide for other tourists who share his passion. ‘As well as being in the business as an actor, I am equally a fan, and have a tremendous appreciation for so many brilliant actors, directors, writers before me. ‘Ideally, I'd like to put together a book once I'm finished, combining not only the addresses within the states of these classic locations, but also GPS road maps to unique hotels and eats throughout the country.’","Dominic Pace is an actor who has had roles in many TV programmes .

"Christian Connor secretly filmed female patients at two hospitals in Salford and tried to groom a 13-year-old online, being 'compelled' by his addictive personality and a foot fetish, a court heard . A mental health worker was branded 'merciless' and 'odious' by a judge after he admitted secretly filming female patients in hospital toilets and grooming a 13-year-old boy online. Christian Connor, 27,  was 'compelled' by an addictive foot fetish to spy on victims at two hospitals in Manchester as well as to take secret pictures of women using the bathroom in a Salford house, a court heard. The mental health support worker was also found to have a cache of under-age and extreme pornography stored on his computer and attempted to persuade a teenage boy to send him pictures of his genitals. Judge Douglas Moore sentenced Connor to 16 months in prison and said: 'You behaved in an appalling way showing a complete abuse of trust, targeting young people and individuals that you knew.' He added: 'Words like 'manipulative', 'despicable', 'merciless' and 'odious' spring to mind.' Isleworth Crown Court heard Connor's crimes were uncovered when he was caught after befriending a 13-year-old boy from Hounslow, west London on the internet and persuading him to send images of his feet to an email address. The boy refused requests to send pictures of his genitals. Officers traced Connor and seized his computer, which contained the secret footage he had filmed in Prestwich Hospital and Salford Royal Hospital. It also contained videos he had recorded in the bathroom of a house  as well as child and extreme pornography. The offences took place between September 1, 2010 and April 16 last year. Judge Moore told him: 'You were within the mental health unit where people are seeking help and need security and you showed a ruthless disregard for their well-being.' 'You took photos of individuals when they were taking baths and showers and these people people thought you were a friend. 'You showed no mercy to those individuals.' Police seized 411 images mostly made up of Connor's secret filming, plus 12 more from the internet. These were category A, the most serious images. Connor, of Stretford, Manchester pleaded guilty to eight counts of voyeurism for the purpose of sexual gratification; three counts of possessing under-age and extreme pornography and one count of encouraging the making and distributing of indecent images. He was also made subject of a ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order. The court heard Connor was 'aroused' by his ability to manipulate people and said the images were for his enjoyment. Judge Moore added: 'This is an abuse of trust case because he worked within a mental health unit and he was a mental health support worker at the time. 'A mental health unit demonstrates clear vulnerability and one victim is reluctant to return because she no longer feels safe there.' Connor admitted secretly filming patients at Prestwich Hospital, which provides mental health care . Connor had worked at Salford Royal Hospital as a mental health support worker when he was arrested . Connor was employed as an NHS support worker for six years, but was forced to abandon his degree studies two years in when arrested. His mother is an auxiliary nurse and his father, who supported him in court, a management accountant. Penelope Blake, defending Connor said: 'He was living in this secret world where he was compelled by this addictive personality, this foot fetish, to commit the offences he did. 'It was a manifestation of his addiction, his obsession. This is not something he will be doing again and he is nothing but embarrassed, ashamed and disgusted. 'From an early age he wanted to spy on everyone and this grew into addictive, obsessive behaviour. He says he gets a 'buzz' from it and being in a position of power. 'There is almost an alter-ego person different to his day-to-day self,' added Miss Blake, who confirmed Connor has sought counselling since his arrest. 'He has lost his sister, who says she wants nothing more to do with him, his girlfriend, his friends and the stigma of these offences will follow him for the rest of his life. He'll be on the sex offenders register.'","Christian Connor was a mental health support worker at two hospitals .

"A woman who fractured her neighbour's skull with a claw hammer has told the jury that she 'only wanted to knock him out'. Lisa Williams, 49, admitting hitting David Coleman, 54, three times in the head with the hammer after a long-running dispute between their two families about a fence. But she claimed she was acting in self-defence after Mr Coleman got into a fight with her brother and told the court she has 'learned  you don't knock people out with hammers'. The families had been 'neighbours at war' for eight years and Mr Coleman claimed the Williams would throw dog faeces into the garden and bang on walls at night to stop them sleeping.

Mr Coleman from Chingford, north-east London, also claimed Williams hated him because he looked like her ex-partner. A brawl erupted in June 2013 when Mr Coleman confronted Williams' brother Jonathan about mud smeared all over his front bay windows, Snaresbrook Crown court heard. Jonathan Williams was said to have got the upper hand in the fight and pinned Mr Coleman to the ground before his sister emerged from their house brandishing a hammer. A brawl erupted when Mr Coleman confronted Williams' brother about mud smeared on his windows, Snaresbrook Crown court (pictured) heard . Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman three times to the head with the hammer but claims she was acting in self-defence and denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent. 'I hit him three times on the head with the hammer, the third time I used more [force] than I used for the first two, I wanted to knock him out, I wanted him to stop,' she said. When asked if she had stopped to think what type of injury a hammer blow would cause she said: 'No, I've since learned you don't knock people out with hammers - I thought he was going to kill us.' She claimed at one point in the fight Mr Coleman was straddling her, saying: 'I think I was concussed, it was so quick - I was concussed, I was woolly headed and what followed was as a result of being woolly headed. 'It was awful, I couldn't think straight, Jonathan was trying to release Mr Coleman's grip from him - he wouldn't let go and he kept flailing his legs out at my brother's legs.' 'I was horrified, it's like you're fighting for your life, it's like the whole world is caving in.' She claimed that she stopped when her brother managed to grab the hammer out of her hands. Other witnesses claim it was a third neighbour Bernard Mason, who ran from his home to break up the fight and disarm Williams. His wife Pamela Mason was forced to sit on her to restrain her until the police arrived, it has been claimed. The trial continues.

"Lasting love: The star with husband Grant Roffey . Having forged a career starring in Hollywood blockbusters and packed theatres, people might assume Julie Walters to be brimming with confidence. But the veteran star has revealed that when it came to romance in her younger years, she relied on a helping hand from alcohol to bring her out of her shell. The mother-of-one, 65, has admitted that before meeting her husband Grant Roffey, 57, thirty years ago, she had never had sex while sober. However, now she has been diagnosed with a yeast allergy she almost never drinks and, on the rare occasions she does, hates the effect it has on her health. In a candid interview, she also reveals she is finding it increasingly difficult to learn her lines, a problem she has increasingly found as she stars in new series Indian Summers. The Mamma Mia! star met Mr Roffey while she was starring in a production of Macbeth and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately but they only married in 1997, 11 years into their relationship. Talking to Saga magazine, she has said how their first encounter ended with a drunken tryst and that, at that time in her life, she always needed to drink before being able to have sex. She described how she and a friend had drunk three bottles of champagne before bumping into her future husband at a bar in Leicester. She said: ‘It was full of Hooray Henries. I remember saying, “I bet nobody here’s a member of the Labour Party.” And he turned round and said, “Well I am, actually.” ‘“Cor, you’re massive! Look at this bloke’s neck. God, it’s as big as my thigh!” I was so embarrassing. We started talking about God knows what, and when Ros [her friend] and I left he said, “I’ll see you home.” And we staggered out with him. ‘So we walked Ros home, then he walked me home. I said, “Come in!” He said, “No, it’s all right.” I said, “Come iiiiinnn! I’ve got a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau!” He moved in and never moved out. It was instant for me. ‘I remember saying, “Do you want my children?” That first night – terrible things! – it was driven by alcohol. I was shy like that. Who’d have sex without alcohol? Especially the first time. He was really sweet about it. Before we were together, I don’t think I’d ever done it sober.’ While she might owe her happy marriage to alcohol, she now hardly touches a drop due to a yeast allergy. She explains that she had always felt ill after drinking but assumed it was the same for everyone. It was only well into adulthood that a doctor suggested an allergy test that revealed the true cause. The actress met her husband in 1986 and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately. Pictured, Julie flaunts her sexy side that same year in comedy Car Trouble . She said: ‘If I were to have Marmite, it would just take the roof of my mouth right off. Anything with yeast makes my eyes go funny, makes me a bit wheezy. ‘And before, when I’d had a few drinks, the next day I’d always have these flu-like symptoms. I thought everybody had those, and I was telling this gynaecologist … and she suggested a skin test to see if I was allergic to anything. And the yeast went, whoo! So now I know.’ Even so, she still occasionally has the odd glass of champagne if she needs a quick boost of confidence. She said she never drinks, ‘except, say, if I got on Graham Norton where you have to be jolly with people you’ve not met before, and I have a glass of champagne. But I don’t like the effect on my body.’ This is not the only problem alcohol has caused for her health. Ever since she entered menopause at the age of 50, she had been unable to sleep after drinking. She has spoken before of her struggles with menopause and again said how she continues to suffer with hot flushes after 15 years. She said: ‘It was like a chimney and came from the base of my spine. I was doing this TV called Murder, and every take there’d be, “Stop, she’s having a flush!” The actress also revealed she is finding it difficult to learn the lines for current Channel 4 series Indian Summers, in which she plays Cynthia (pictured) ‘At the National I’d come off stage for a quick change and have to shout, “Garth, the tray!” And this guy would come with this big tin tray and fan me. Harry Potter, I was in a wig and padding, and they had to put this big tube of air conditioning in my face.’ A more pressing issue caused by her advancing years is a difficulty with learning her lines. Veteran star Michael Gambon, 74, recently announced his retirement from the stage because of his fading memory and Dame Judi Dench, 80, has previously revealed she takes supplements to help her memory. While still perfectly capable of working, Miss Walters said it has started to become a concern, especially for her part in Channel 4 series Indian Summers. She revealed she flew out a week early to the set to give herself time to commit her role to memory. She said: ‘I’m too old now to just go out there and start shooting. I worked out how many days and hours of jet lag. Otherwise I’d never remember the lines. ‘I have to learn things ahead of time now, which I’ve never had to do in my life. The night before, I’d just have a look and lie in the bath and think, “Oh yes, right”. The next day I would hardly look at my lines, and they’d be there. Now? I’m going through them, going through them.’","Star says she relied on alcohol when it came to romance in younger years .

"Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones. The bodies, which were found neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers, are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago. Archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) were called in to take a look and have spent  days tirelessly uncovering the bones. Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a small Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones . They found seven chambers containing around 20 skeletons each and a further chamber that had another 150. Pascal Roy, store manager of the Monoprix supermarket, said that the shop had been built on the site of the old Trinité hospital, which functioned from as early as the 12th century. He said: 'We figured there'd be a few bones there considering it used to be the site of a cemetery, but we didn't expect to find mass graves.' But other experts have said the bodies might have been placed there when more than six-million corpses were moved to the Paris Catacombs from the city's cemeteries 200 years ago . Archaeologists are slowly and delicately uncovering the skeletons and attaching numbers to them. Above are skeletons 159, 157 and 162 . The bodies are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago - perhaps the plague or a famine . They were neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers. Seven of the chambers contained 20 skeletons and one contained more than 150 . Experts called the site 'extraordinary' and said they were astonished to find so many skeletons in one place. They said: 'The fact that the skeletons were so closely packed together in a mass grave suggests that they were the victims of an epidemic like the plague, which struck France throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. 'The grave provides an excellent opportunity to learn about how death was managed and how funerary practices were carried out centuries ago.' Isabelle Abadie, an archaeologist, added that it was particularly interesting because the bodies were not thrown into the graves, suggesting that they might have been placed head to toe to save space.

Archaeologists are pictured (right) starting the work . Experts called the site 'extraordinary' and said they were astonished to find so many skeletons in one place. One archaeologist pictured above carefully bags up any smaller bits of bone . Archaeologists put pieces of medieval ceramics into small plastic bags, as well as pottery from modern times and any other finds . The archaeologists use particular tools to excavate their site including a small shovel, a variety of brushes and sometimes a garden hoe . Fragments of medieval ceramics were also found among the bones,  along with pottery dating from this century. The archaeologists on site will now carry out carbon and DNA testing on the bones to find out more and will then be able to more accurately date the find. After the testing is completed the remains will be taken away and studied. The state will take charge of their final resting place. The discovery comes weeks after 15 skeletons were found in a unique Romano-British settlement in Ipplepen, Devon. The remains of two skeletons buried together in Diros Caves, Greece, were also unearthed in 2013 and were analysed to show they were 6,000 years old around two weeks ago. It is thought the bodies might have been placed there after more than six-million corpses were moved to the Paris Catacombs from the city's cemeteries 200 years ago . Experts said: 'The grave provides an excellent opportunity to learn about how death was managed and how funerary practices were carried out centuries ago' It is amazing to see the skeletons in their full form, with some of the only bones missing being the lower legs and feet . The archaeologists, who wear masks while carrying out the dusty work, will now carry out carbon and DNA testing on the bones to find out more. They will then be able to more accurately date the find . After the testing is completed the remains will be studied before the state  takes charge of their final resting place .","Skeletons found under the Monoprix supermarket on Boulevard Sébastopol in Paris .

"A plan to keep David Cameron as Tory leader even if he loses the election to Ed Miliband, is being drawn up by senior allies. Cabinet colleagues, including George Osborne and Michael Gove, will attempt to form a protective ring around Mr Cameron if he falls short in May – provided Mr Miliband does not secure a decisive victory. They believe that continuity at the top will be essential if there is a prospect of a second general election. Senior Tories have hatched a plan to keep David Cameron as Tory leader even if he loses the election to Ed Miliband . Tory high command is even preparing to declare a ‘moral victory’ if – as some polls suggest - Mr Cameron secures more votes than Labour but emerges with fewer seats. Mr Cameron will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to Mr Miliband, who many Tories rate as the worst Labour leader since Michael Foot. The last leader of a major party to cling on after defeat was Neil Kinnock in 1987. One Tory MP said Mr Cameron ‘won’t last five minutes’ unless he manages to retain the keys to Downing Street in May. ‘He either wins, or he goes,’ the MP said. ‘He has said himself that if he can’t beat Miliband he doesn’t deserve to be in this game, and he’s right.’ But some senior ministers believe Mr Cameron should stay on if Mr Miliband is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition. In this scenario, they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run-up to a second election that could take place as early as the autumn. Chancellor George Osborne (left) will attempt to form a protective ring around Mr Cameron if he falls short in May – provided Ed Miliband (right) does not secure a decisive victor . Mr Osborne is reported to have held talks with Tory whips last week to draw up a ‘Save Dave’ strategy for protecting Mr Cameron from an internal challenge, although a source close to the Chancellor insisted the Conservatives were still ‘playing to win’. Current polls suggest that neither Labour nor the Conservatives will secure an outright majority in May – raising the prospect of either another coalition or a period of minority government. Senior Tories are urging Mr Cameron to govern alone if the Conservatives emerge as the largest party but do not have an overall majority. They argue that ditching the Lib Dems would allow the party to govern properly, and free up 23 ministerial jobs to aid party management. One Cameron ally said: ‘If there is an opportunity to govern without going into coalition, we would seize it.’","Senior Tories plan to keep David Cameron as leader if he loses election .

"Four football fans, said to be Chelsea supporters, were ordered off a train on Sunday night following claims they were making racist chants. The group were evicted from a Euston to Manchester service after the Capital One Cup final at 10.30pm. Transport police were called to the service and boarded at Stoke following complaints from other passengers where they threw the supporters off. Chelsea supporters wave flags at Wembley but later a group of four were order off a train and police are looking into claims that they were making racist chants, causing one black passenger to move carriages . Supporters stream away from the stadium towards Wembley Park train station after the cup final . One witness told Sportsmail: 'It was horrendous. They were Chelsea fans and they were being nasty and offensive. One passenger, a black man, moved carriages because he was disgusted with them. 'One girl was crying. The police got on and marched them off the train.' Another witness said the fans were asking two young Asian girls where their burkas were and singing songs about Spurs and Auschwitz. A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We're not aware of any evidence to suggest that these were Chelsea supporters. But if they are we will assist the British Transport Police with their enquiries.' The incident comes after footage emerged of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro refusing to allow a black man to enter their carriage before a Champions League clash. The clip also captures a number of Chelsea supporters making a racist chant. Following the incident the Metropolitan Police passed on the details of the three men to the authorities in France, who are investigating.

'Colleagues from Staffordshire Police also attended. Officers asked four men to leave the train at Stoke. We have spoken to two witnesses, and investigations continue.

"Boy George wants to build a glazed extension at his Grade-II listed property in Hampstead, London . Boy George's plans to build a lavish glazed extension onto his Grade-II listed London mansion have been turned down. The 53-year-old applied to build the extension at his multi-million pound  home  in Hampstead in a bid to brighten up the property. According to his planning application, the Culture Club frontman also wanted to chop down three trees to allow more light into the Victorian building. But Camden council rejected the proposals last September, saying the designs were an 'over-dominant and incongruous addition'. It added that they would be 'detrimental to the character, appearance and special architectural and historic interests of the hosted listed building'. The singer, who put the papers in under his real name George O'Dowd, is now appealing against the decision. The building works, filed under the singer's real name George O'Dowd, would see new floor-to-ceiling windows installed to increase light. Among the planned works were external and internal alterations to the ground floor front windows, a new side window, a new rear garden door and re-landscaping of garden. The garden landscaping would include the removal of three mature trees and the demolition of an existing summer house. But the designs were opposed by the Hampstead Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CCAC). A letter sent to the council by the group said the scheme was an over-development and would affect neighbours. They wrote: 'We object to the extension and the hard landscaping because of the garden take-up and potential light pollution.' As part of the plans, Syte Architects, based in Soho, said: 'The house does not benefit from a great deal of natural light into its interior. Its frontage is orientated to the north east. 'The rear has a southwesterly orientation but a combination of factors mean that the interior often suffers from poor levels and quality of natural lighting.' Camden council rejected the proposals for the Victorian mansion (pictured) last September, saying the designs were an 'over-dominant and incongruous addition' It added: 'The proposed extension has been designed to create living spaces with a greater sense of connection to the garden and better levels of natural light. These spaces will have a different atmosphere and character to the internal spaces in the existing house.' A planning inspector will consider written representations from both sides and is expected to make a site visit to his home before reaching a decision.","Eighties singer, 53, said work would brighten up his Hampstead mansion .

"British police should be dispatched to Turkey to catch ISIS sympathisers travelling to Syria, MPs said today. Home Affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said police 'spotters' were needed in Istanbul amid growing numbers of fanatics using the city as a gateway to the frontline in neighbouring Syria. It comes after three London schoolgirls were spotted in the city on the Turkish leg of their trip before they were feared to have crossed the border into Syria. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs she was in talks with Turkish airlines to ramp up security to catch women and girls travelling to Syria . Shamima Begum, 15, was pictured with Amira Abase, also 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, at a bus station in Istanbul. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs she was in talks with Turkish airlines to ramp up security amid evidence that there are an 'increasing number of women and girls' travelling to join ISIS. She said should would look 'with very great care' at Mr Vaz's call for British police to be stationed in Istanbul. It came after Mrs May was called to the House of Commons to give an urgent statement on the terror threat in the wake of last week's revelation that the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' was the London-raised university graduate Mohammed Emwazi. The Home Secretary said she would look 'with very great care' at Mr Vaz's call for British police to be stationed in Istanbul. A man thought to be Jihadi John (front black headscarf holding rifle) proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013 . Mr Vaz said: 'I'm sure that the Home Secretary has heard the anguished pleas of the parents of the three London schoolgirls who have left this country. 'Will she look at a recommendation that was made by the Home Affairs Select Committee which is that police spotters need to be placed in Istanbul because this is the destination of concern – so that there can be immediate action taken if young girls disappear in this way.' Mrs May said: 'We have seen over time an increasing number of women and girls going to Syria, alongside the men and boys that we have seen going previously. ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' - Mohammed Emwazi - was pictured in 2009 when he worked for an IT company in Kuwait . 'It's an ongoing issue – that's why it is the case that Home Office officials have been speaking to Turkish airlines about these issues. 'I will be meeting and talking to the Transport Secretary whether there are further arrangements that can be put in place to ensure we don't see families facing the trauma and stress that these families are.' At least 60 women and girls, including 18 under the age of 20, have travelled to join ISIS, a senior counter-terror officer has revealed. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, the Metropolitan Police's National Coordinator Counter Terrorism coordinator, urged the travel industry and families to be 'vigilant' in the battle to stop young people from flying to join the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. She told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: 'The reason we are so worried about it is in the last year 22 young women have travelled, all but four if those 22 were ahead 20 or younger. The last five who have travelled were aged 15 or 16. 'This is a growing problem and it's one of real concern. The more everybody involved in travel understands this problem and can be alerted and vigilant the better. There are police powers. There is a new police power to remove someone's passport if we are concerned that they might be travelling for terrorist purposes. We have used that already. 'Mostly this is about the level of vigilance of everybody who is working in the industry and an understanding that actually some of these women and girls are very carefully prepared for their travel so they don't stand out. They take unusual routes and it is very had to spot them. '60 women and girls have travelled. 22 much younger have been reported by their families who are absolutely distraught.'","Home Affairs committee chair Keith Vaz said 'spotters' needed in Istanbul .

"A ten-year-old girl with a rare but intractable form of epilepsy is leading the crusade to have marijuana extract oil approved for medicinal use in her home state of Idaho as a form of treatment for her deadly seizures. Alexis Carey, from Boise, has Dravet Syndrome, an incurable genetic disease that causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal. After her family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children with her condition, they wanted to see if it would help her too, but Idaho’s stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. Family support: Alexis Carey (left), a 10-year-old girl with a rare form of epilepsy, sat with her mother Clare Carey (center) and five-year-old sister Alanis Carey (right) last Friday in Boise, Idaho . Helping hand: Alexis, who has Dravet Syndrome, worked with her therapist Brigette Borup last week as her family fights to have Idaho lawmakers legalize marijuana extract oil to treat her seizures . 'Parent to parent, when you're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that's no longer anecdotal,' Clare Carey, her mother, said. 'That's hope.' The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil. Twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil February 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking. Marijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores. With no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child's developing liver, kidneys and other organs. Proponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children. Over time, Mrs Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on. 'Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control,' she said. 'Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know.' Sisterly bond: Alexis can be seen playing with Alanis. The 10-year-old girl began having seizures when she was only two months old . Natural remedy: This closeup image shows a drop of marijuana oil on the end of a needle. Proponents of the oil for medicinal use argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children . Making a change: Governor Terry McAuliffe (center) holds Haley Smith, 14, from White Stone, Virginia on his lap after signing the bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy . Alexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder. It wasn't until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was two that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Mrs Carey said. Since then, Alexis' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures, but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type. Alexis' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks - albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs. Mrs Carey said working with Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated. Lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she explained. This year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Senator Curt McKenzie and Representative Tom Loertscher. Both are chairs of the legislature's State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance. The measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee. Yet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose.","Alexis Carey, from Boise, Idaho, has Dravet Syndrome, an incurable genetic disease that causes severe and multiple seizures .

"Grand banqueting halls, opulent lobbies and vast ballrooms; you could easily be forgiven for thinking this was a collection of photographs was documenting some of Europe's grandest hotels. However, a closer look will reveal the majestic rooms to be engulfed in swathes of dust and moss; hotels that once hosted royals and high society abandoned to the elements. This is the latest result of urban exploration photography, going beyond 'no entry' signs to capture images of dilapidated buildings across Europe. IT worker Thomas Windisch, from Graz in Austria, started out looking at some of his own country's dilapidated hotels . This is one place in Austria you wouldn't want to stay in, although the bed might be nice and soft for you . This bathroom was obviously one of this Austrian hotel's more exquisite spots, but has been left to rot in a sad state of affairs . This room in Austria sums up the lonely, empty feeling of some of Europe's grandest abandoned hotels . IT worker Thomas Windisch, from Graz in Austria, indulged his passion for photography by travelling across the continent, visiting over 100 abandoned hotels along the way. Other photographs include a competition swimming pool, complete with viewing gallery and water slide but with not a drop of water in sight. A ballroom can also been seen scattered with rubble and shattered glass as well as a banqueting hall which doesn't look to have hosted any banquets or parties for many decades judging by the layer of dust that sweeps across its furniture. Thomas, 32, says some of the hotels he visited on his 12,000-mile journey of curiosity have been lying empty for over two decades. If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe this Italian hotel's banqueting hall to be a popular spot for rich tourists . The photographer went beyond 'no entry' signs to capture images of dilapidated buildings across Europe . Incredibly, the grand piano remains at this Austrian hotel, and you can imagine a little work could restore this venue . The photos show how much effort into interior designing has gone to waste as rooms are left to rot . At least there's plenty of power sockets! Abandoned hotels from Slovenia also feature in the eerie photo album . He said: 'Of course I saw some of the shots on the internet before but when I entered the locations for real, I just stood there for several minutes and was like 'Wow, this is amazing. 'It's pretty awesome to see areas of a hotel that are normally not accessible for guests and to understand how a big hotel works in the background. 'And of course, the decay and the reclaiming of these buildings by nature add a bit of a surreal and mystic touch which makes them unique and even more interesting.' IT worker Thomas Windisch describes how the abandoned hotels gave a 'surreal' feeling that produced a real wow factor . Windisch visited over 100 hotels across Europe as he searched for the spectacular clash of dilapidation and luxury . The bathroom of a honeymoon suite, would now be a thing of nightmares as oppose to a memory to treasure forever . This room appears a lot clearer of dust and decay than some of the others, but the German hotel has been closed for business . This sitting area in a German hotel has managed to stay mould-free, and looks like it might have some nice views . Although perhaps not to everyone's style, the purple tiling has remained well maintained at this Austrian site .","Thomas Windisch, from Graz in Austria, travelled across Europe, visiting over 100 abandoned hotels along the way .

"Lawyers for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have said it would be 'unthinkable' and 'shocking' if their clients were put to death by the Indonesian government, while a desperate last-minute plea to save the Australian duo was still to be heard. Australian lawyer Julian McMahon referred to what he expects from a modern democracy when he described any attempt to end the pair's life before the appeal is heard as 'unthinkable'. 'Now if it turns out that my clients are moved from here to a place of execution while they are in the process of having an appeal heard in a court then that would be a shocking thing,' Mr McMahon said outside Kerobokan prison in Bali, according to a report by the Daily Telegraph. 'It’s unthinkable that people who are having their right to life litigated in a court can at the same time be taken away for that court by powerful people, such as the executive and simply executed.' Scroll down for video . Final journey: The strain shows on the faces of Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right), pictured in Kerobokan prison this week in Kerobokan prison with Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) who can do nothing to save them from execution which now seems set for this weekend . In waiting: Seen from the waters off Nuskambangan in central Java this is the police station on the 30km long island which houses seven prisons, including Batu or 'stone' prison where special isolation cells have been prepared for the Australian Bali 9 duo ahead of the deaths by firing squad . It had earlier been confirmed by the Indonesian Attorney General that any pending legal appeals will not delay the execution of the Bali Nine duo and the eight other drug smugglers. The news came as Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso announced Australian death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be moved to 'Death Island' where they will be executed this week. HM Prasetyo also confirmed that the preparations for the mass death by firing squad were '95 per cent' ready as Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers are planning to lodge an appeal within the next week. Grisly business: Dressed in civvies to play their roles as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two police officers from Indonesia's mobile brigade take part in a dress rehearsal for the men's removal to Nusakambangan island for their execution along with eight other drug traffickers . The two Australians have a 900km journey from Bali where they have lived for the last decade, west to the port town of Cilacap from where they will be transferred to the prison island and place of their execution, Nusakambangan . However, HM Prasetyo said following the clemency plea rejection there were no more 'no more legal avenues left', The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'Regarding the transfer (of Chan and Sukumaran), it will be done as soon as possible,' he said. 'It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared. As an Indonesian battleship is due to arrive in the waters off Nusakambangan island in southern central Java, Mr Samiarso said that for the first time Attorney General M. Prasetyo had issued him with an order to to move the Bali Nine duo to the island. Last rites: Kerobokan prison (pictured, this week) will hold a special Hindu ceremony for Chan and Sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths . Is all hope lost? Bali's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that Myuran Sukumaran (above, left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be moved from Bali to Nusakambangan Island this week to be out to the firing squad . A masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade 'Brimob' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Denpasar airport, which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill-fated heroin smuggling trip . These armed personnel carriers belonging to the Indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two Australians to Bali's airport whereupon they will be placed in Sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to Cilacap, which is just a short trip to their place of execution, Nusakambangan . This comes as gruesome details of the planned executions comes to light. The two Australians and eight others will be executed in similar fashion to five foreigners and an Indonesian woman killed by firing squad on the island on January 18. Four of the  prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres. Indonesian Rani Andriani aka Melisa Aprilia, opted not to be attached to a board, saying in a written submission beforehand 'submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Indonesian police carry out an ant-terrorist drill at Pasir Putih prison, the 'supermax' of Nuskambangan's seven correctional facilities on the island where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shot this week . After weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that Nusakambangan, where police were pictured (above) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the Australians Chan and Sukumaran . Indonesia plans to  hold the Australians and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night. The prisons boss for Central java provence, Ahmad Yuspahruddin,confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the Australian pair or Batu, or 'stone' prison away from the jail's other inmates weho weren't on death row. The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to Nusakambangan, which had been predicted more than a week ago, was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once. Myuran Sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and Andrew Chan, less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into Australia had been caught and jailed . The men spent time with family members, although Sukumaran's father, Sam and siblings, brother Chinthu and sister Brinthe returned to Australia on Sunday. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34, were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the 'Bali 9' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of Indonesia to Australia in 2005. They were sentenced to death in February 2006 and have been living in Kerobokan prison. The other eight due to face the firing squad are: Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Serge Areski Atlaoui of France, Martin Anderson of Ghana, Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Silvester Obikwe of Nigeria and Rodrigo Gularte, a paranoid schizophrenic man from Brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital.","Lawyers beg for more time so appeal can be heard before executions .

"A 30-year-old police officer on Hawaii's Big Island was arrested and placed on administrative leave after he hit with his car and killed a bicyclist visiting from Michigan . Hawaii Island police officer Jody Buddemeyer was arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide in connection with the death Sunday morning of Jeffrey Sunow, 63, of West Bloomfield, Michigan, according to West Hawaii Today, a newspaper in Kailua-Kona. Buddemeyer, who was assigned to the South Kohala district, was released after his arrest. Hawaii Island police officer Jody Buddemeyer was arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide after allegedly striking and killing a man with his car . Jeffrey Sunow, 63, (pictured in red) was found lying face down near a badly damaged bicycle off Waikoloa Road . There is no telephone listing for him in Hawaii, and he could not be reached for comment Monday. The bicyclist was found lying face down near a badly damaged bicycle on the shoulder of Waikoloa Road, authorities said. Sunow died at the scene, first-responders said, Hawaii News Now reports. He was declared dead at North Kohala Community Hospital, where the body was taken. Buddemeyer reported the crash shortly before 6:30 a.m. Sunday, according to authorities. The Office of Professional Standards is conducting an administrative investigation, which is standard after any fatal incident involving an officer, police said. Officers say that given the time of day a rising sun would've been in both men's eyes . The eastbound lane of Waikoloa Road was closed for several hours following the collision. The collision occurred on a notoriously dangerous stretch of the road, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. A steep incline where the crash occurred follows a bend in the road. 'There's no curb,' acting West Hawaii Fire Battalion Chief John Whitman said. ""It's very unsafe if you're riding a bicycle."" The rising sun would likely have been in both men's eyes at the time, Whitman said.","Officer Jody Buddemeyer was arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide .

"Drought caused by climate change may pushed Syria towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart, according to researchers. A new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the Syrian regime in 2011. The drought, which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change, destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country, driving farmers into cities. This image taken in Syria in 2009 shows how drought left farmers unable to grow crops on the parched land . The resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty, government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war. The conflict hjas since escalated into a complex war involving extremist Islamic groups including ISIS and forces from other nations including the US. The brutal civil war in Syria has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space. Researchers at the American Association for the Advancement of Science  analyzed high-resolution satellite images of Aleppo taken from August 2012 to May 2013. They noticed a dramatic increase in the damage to buildings and infrastructure over the 10-month period, with almost all of the destruction concentrated in rebel-controlled or contested areas. They also found that the historic 13th century walled ancient city of Aleppo - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - has also suffered extensive damage from the war. Satellite images have also shown how the proliferation of roadblocks and build up of artillery and tanks have increased. In separate satellite images released by Amnesty International in 2012, there were more than 600 craters caused by artillery fire in the small town of Anadan, four miles from second city Aleppo. An estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war. Dr Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, said: 'We're not saying the drought caused the war. 'We’re saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict. 'A drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human-driven drying of that region.' The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the 2006-2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s, 1980s and 1990s. Particularly hard hit was the Fertile Crescent that spans Syria, Turkey and Iraq. Since 1900 the area has undergone warming of between 1 degree C and 1.2 degrees C and rainfall in the wet season has fallen by 10 per cent. The researchers said the trend matched that predicted by models of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide emissions. They said that the wind patterns bringing rain from the Mediterranean weakened while higher temperatures caused greater evaporation of moisture from the soils during the summer. The drought was so severe that the Euphrates river in the city of Raqqa, eastern Syria receded to the point shown above in 2010. Previous water levels can be seen clearly on the observation tower. Nearly half a million people left this area during the drought and 85 per cent of livestock were killed by the lack of water . Rising city populations and increasing poverty due to the drought led to the 2011 uprising which swelling into outright conflict which is now devastating much of the country like Aleppo's al-Shaar neighbourhood above . This caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in Syria. Combined with a growing population - from four million in the 1950s to 22 million now - this led to increasing levels of poverty and pressure within the country's urban areas. The researchers said that Bashar Hafez al-Assad's regime also encouraged water intensive crops like cotton for export while illegal drilling of irrigation wells rapidly depleted groundwater. In the worst hit north east areas of the country, livestock herds were practically obliterated, cereal prices doubled and nutrition-related diseases among children increased dramatically. Shahrzad Mohtadi, a student at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University who also took part in the research, said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities. The initial 2011 uprising and subsequent civil war has now mutated into a complex battle between factions, like the Kurdish People's Protection Unit pictured above, Islamic State fighters and the Assad regime . Writing in the journal, the authors said: 'Rapid demographic change encourages instability. 'Whether it was a primary or substantial factor is impossible to know, but drought can lead to devastating consequences when coupled with preexisting acute vulnerability.' It is the first study of its kind to look at how climate change has played a role in a current war. Professor Solomon Hsaing, a public policy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said similar climatic changes had triggered the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the region 4,200 years ago following a drought lasting several years. However, Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford University, said: 'There were many things going on in the region and world at that time, such as high global food prices and the beginning of the Arab Spring, that could have also increased the likelihood of civil conflict.'","Study finds that Syria suffered the worst drought on record before the war .

"One angry passenger managed to delay flights out of a Nigerian airport after stepping out on the runway in front of a plane. After finding out his flight from Abuja's Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport was cancelled, the flustered passenger decided to take his frustrations out by taking his luggage and entering the runway. Passengers on board an Arik flight to Lagos were forced to disembark after the man refused to move, with one eyewitness saying security failed to show up and it took the pilot to plead with the man before the plane could take off. The man was angry that his flight to Sokoto was cancelled, and so entered the runway . At least two flights out of the Nigerian airport, one to Calabar and one to Lagos, were delayed by two hours by the man's actions. Passenger Cedar Chinwuba, who was on the flight to Lagos, posted a series of photos on Twitter as the scene played out. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Chinwuba said: 'It was very terrible. What came to my mind was that Nigeria Airport Authority needs to step up. 'For two hours, no security agent showed up. It got to the point the pilot announced that he had placed a call to Arik airline to send the Nigeria police but had no response. The man's actions caused panic among passengers on a flight bound for Lagos, who were forced to disembark onto the tarmac . Twitter user Cedar Chinwuba reported live from the scene as he was a passenger on the plane that was blocked from take-off by an irate man on the runway . 'An announcement was made by the pilot that we couldn't take off due to some disgruntled passengers blocking the plane and he has tried to reach the airport security but no response. 'After a few minutes, he requested that due to security reasons those who wish to disembark from the trip should do so. 'Only in Nigeria issues like this happen and they never get penalised. One eyewitness said security failed to arrive for more than two hours after the pilot had radioed through . 'One of the angry passenger I had a chat with stated that all they wanted was a senior officer of Arik coming to the tarmac to address the issue. 'It worries me as an airport user.' He explained that along with all the other passengers on the Lagos flight were told to get off the plane and that 'no Arik flight was leaving Abuja.' MailOnline Travel have contacted Arik Air, and are awaiting comment. The flight is believed to have taken off at 5.15pm local time, two hours behind schedule.","Man takes unusual action after his internal flight in Nigeria was cancelled .

"Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan who turned to God after being handed a death sentence in Indonesia has been ordained as a Christian minister. After six long years of study inside Bali's Kerobokan jail, the 31-year-old was ordained inside the prison's chapel last month as he found out his and Myuran Sukumaran's plea for clemency from Indonesian president Joko Widodo had been rejected again. The Sydney man was ordained by Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor with the Bayside Church in Melbourne, who bought with her a letter of accreditation approving Chan as a Christian minister in Australia. Scroll down for video . Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan (left), seen here with Matius Arif Mirdjaja who he baptised, has now been ordained as a Christian minsiter . Five senior ministers from different denominations endorsed Chan after he spent years studying the religion and helping drug addicts within the prison. Reverend Buckingham told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I have never experienced a student like Andrew, and probably never will again. He is extraordinary. He has such a determination to learn, in fact almost a desperation.' 'He is the real deal, and Myuran [Sukumaran] is as well. They are living proof that people can change, circumstances can change. Indonesia should be proud of the impact they are having,' she added. Sukumaran and Chan await transfer from Kerobokan  prison to the death island of Nusakambangan, where they are set to face the firing squad . Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) are both said to be changed men since they were arrested in 2015 on heroin smuggling charges . Reverend Buckingham first met the pair in 2011 after her friend founded Indonesian charity group Yayasan Tangan Kasih (Arms of Love) which works in Kerobokan prison. In February, a former inmate of Kerobokan prison told Daily Mail Australia how he was baptised by the Bali Nine member. He said Chan helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction, and called on the Indonesian government to show the Australian mercy. When Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs. The pair knew of each other from the previous three times Mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken. After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan (second left) started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison . It was not until Mirdjaja (pictured) personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity . In 2011, the Indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery. '[The first time we spoke] we had a debate about philosophy and Christianity,' Mirdjaja told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that time, I mocked him because I said that 'The Christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe. How do you as a Christian believe in someone who died on the cross and couldn't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass?'' Mirdjaja said Chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him. After the first conversation, they continued their debates about religion, philosophy and history, which the Australian 'knows a lot about'. This photo taken in 2006 shows enforcer, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and mastermind Andrew Chan in a holding cell at Denpasar Court . Chan and Sukumaran admitted their roles in the Bali Nine drug ring as part of a appeal against their death sentences . Myuran Sukumaran (left) has been awarded his associate degree in Fine Arts, a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row . 'One day he came to me and said 'You can't fit God in your brain man, no matter how big your brain is, you cannot fit God in your brain because God is in your heart, so you have to fit God in your heart',' Mirdjaja said. 'He said that to me... at that time I had addiction to drugs inside prison still [to heroin]. 'During that period, he gave me a Bible but I just threw it away and again Andrew never got offended.' It was not until Mirdjaja personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity. 'A spiritual encounter happened during that period [when Mirdjaja was still addicted to drugs], one of them was when Andrew helped me get through my addiction so he laid down and prayed on me and then he did it constantly,' Mirdjaja said. The pair are said have helped countless other prisoners during their time in jail . 'Andrew didn't intend to ask me to stop drugs at that time but how he approached me was helping [me to be] free from my addiction. 'I had my addiction for 20 years and that's when I stopped and I realised that he taught me a lot about Christianity. I made the decision to be baptised in prison, so Andrew baptised me.' After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison. According to the Indonesian, this is one of many programs Chan and his fellow Bali Nine inmate, Myuran Sukuraman, have pioneered to help rehabilitate 'hundreds' of prisoners. Mirdjaja left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south-east Asia, while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the Australians to help others at 17 different prisons around Indonesia. Mirdjaja visits Chan five times a week when he's in Bali. Mirdjaja said he had witnessed Chan and Sukuraman change people's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared. 'These guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart. My life before I had seen so many lies, I've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour,' he said. 'They do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand. [Chan and Sukuraman's] message is simple - love and compassion. They never judge other people.' Last week Sukumaran was awarded his associate degree in Fine Arts, a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row. Sukumaran's mentor and friend, Archibald prize winner Ben Quilty, announced news of the degree from Curtin University on Friday. The news came as Sukumaran and Chan await transfer from Kerobokan to the prison island of Nusakambangan, where they are set to face the firing squad.","Andrew Chan, 31, was ordained by a Melbourne Reverend one month ago .

"A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him. Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000. It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle. From Yorkshire to Iraq: Security guard Yasir Abdulla (left near his home and right patrolling the border of his home town of Sheikhan, Iraq) joined hundreds of fighters trying to stop the spread of ISIS . On patrol: Mr Abdulla (right) pictured with an Islamic State fighter who he and others had detained . He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq. Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body. Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a Kurd . The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him. 'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son. 'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind. 'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said ""You've just eaten him.""' During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender. He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack. But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS. The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists. Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer. Taking aim: With the flag of the Kurds on the back of his weather-beaten truck, Mr Abdullah fires at ISIS . Proud Kurd: Mr Abdulla said Islamists threaten to kidnap locals and bury them alive if they do not surrender . ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims. Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site. It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs. Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas. One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'. The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post. However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.' Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS. It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists. It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq. UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias. He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis. 'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.' Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN. Pro-ISIS supporters wave flags as they parade through Mosul in Iraq. A British fighter has told how a Kurdish mother, whose son was kidnapped and murdered by the group, was fed his body when she travelled to Mosul demanding to see him . Yasir Abdulla also says that ISIS fighters, pictured, terrorise locals by calling them on the phone and threatening to bury them alive unless they surrender to them .

"Officials in Indiana knew that a 16-year-old mentally disabled girl was being subjected to appalling neglect four years before she was rushed to hospital covered in feces and weighing just 35lb. The girl was in such a grave condition that she was put on life support at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis last December. The victim is the granddaughter of Steve Sells, 58, who, along with his wife, Joetta, 54, and their daughter, Crystal, 21, has been charged with neglect. 'Cruel': Steve and Joetta Sells were granted custody in 2009 when their daughter, Crystal, abandoned her child . Scene: Sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat. When detectives searched the house, they found a mattress, a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom . Court documents indicate that the teenager was brutally beaten by her caretakers, lodged on a blood-and-feces-stained mattress and forced to eat human waste and go to the bathroom in a bucket. Now it transpires that the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) first learnt of her ordeal as far back as 2010, with the teenager’s harrowing plight brought to the attention of authorities multiple times since, according to the Indystar.com. It claims that according to DCS records dated September 21, 2010, someone told the body that the victim, then 11, was ‘very malnourished’, had a bruise on her check and had not been seen in school. The DCS told the family it was going to investigate the claims, citing ‘serious medical concerns’. Records show that Steve Sells was ‘extremely hostile’ in meeting about the allegations, but agreed with his wife to co-operate, taking his granddaughter to a doctor and dietician several times. In November the DCS moved to dismiss the case, Indystar.com reports, due to lack of evidence. Third suspect: Crystal Sells, 21, has been charged with seven counts of battery, confinement and neglect targeting her mentally-disabled 16-year-old niece living with Crystal's parents . But a report landed on their doormat again the following October claiming that the pair were keeping the girl prisoner in her room for days at a time without food and denying her access to a toilet. The family claimed that the girl was being kept locked up for her own safety. In November 2011 the DCS closed its investigation, saying that it didn’t have enough evidence to prosecute the family. Last December the girl was taken to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson covered in feces and so thin that police said bone were protruding from her skin. She was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis in critical condition. In January Crystal Sells was arrested on seven counts of battery, confinement and aiding/inducing or causing the neglect of a dependent causing serious bodily injury. Investigators say Sells played a major role in the abuse targeting her special-needs niece. The arrest came a month after Steve Sells and his wife Joetta were charged with neglect. According to probable cause affidavits, Crystal Sells was seen on one occasion striking her mentally disabled relative in the head with a plastic chair, WISH-TV reported. When questioned by police, Miss Sells admitted to the abuse and said that even after she had realized that what was being done to the girl was wrong, she did nothing to stop it. ‘There were clearly times over the course of the four years where she was involved in the batteries, she was involved in the criminal confinement and she clearly could have gotten help for this young girl if she chose to and did not,’ said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings. Court documents show that Joetta and Crystal Sells waited three hours to call an ambulance after the girl was found unresponsive December 1, giving them enough time to come up with a plausible story in order to avoid prison time, according to a relative. That same relative said the women seemed more distraught by the prospect of going to jail than the girl’s appalling condition. Steve Sells, the girl's legal guardian since 2009, was initially charged with 12 counts of neglect and battery. He was hit with additional charges of theft, perjury and welfare fraud for allegedly misusing his granddaughter's Social Security benefits totaling $55,000, according to WTHR. Jannifer Sells and her fiance said they want the girl to come live with them once she feels better . His wife faces 11 felonies counts of neglect of a dependent, criminal confinement and battery resulting in bodily injury. The couple are being held on $100,000 bonds. Mr Sells was awarded custody of the girl after claiming that his daughter, Jannifer Sells, had abandoned her . Speaking to Fox 59 in January, Miss Sells said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter. In December doctors at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital recommended taking the teenager off life support, so grave was her condition, but around New Year’s Eve she rallied. She is now said to be awake and capable of getting out of bed. Jannifer Sells and her husband-to-be Anthony Gaw said they want the girl to come live with them once she regains her health. The Sells family allegedly kept the teenager locked in a room with only a mattress, space heater, blankets, a bowl with oatmeal and a bucket, according to the documents first shared by Fox59 in December. Authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top, out of reach of the teenager, and another child at the home said Sells would lock the door 'during the day and nights'. The child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl's fingers reaching around the door, in an apparent attempt to get out, the documents said. Everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood, authorities said. The gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital December 1 and doctors contacted authorities. They then executed a search warrant at the home. 'If you see pictures of the victim, it's very disturbing,' Sgt. Joel Sandefur said told the Indy Channel. 'We wouldn't accept treatment of an animal that way, let alone a human being, a 15-year-old girl.' The teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago, according to the court documents. The older girl, whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain, was kept locked up inside the room by Steve Sells, according to his wife of six years. She had not been to the doctors or to school in two years, the Indy Channel reported. He told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself, claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife. Neighbor Thomas McAllister told said that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children. He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father. 'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.'

"The Glasgow pub where 10 people were killed when a police helicopter crashed through the roof is planning to reopen 18 months after the tragedy. The Clutha in Glasgow city centre has been shut since November 29, 2013, when the Eurocopter EC 135 crashed into the building, killing seven customers and three police officers. Much of the pub had been left untouched since the night of the disaster, but building work is now underway and owner Alan Crossan hopes to reopen by May. Scroll down for video . The Clutha in Glasgow city centre has been shut since November 29, 2013, when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed into the building . The helicopter crash killed all three police officers on board and seven customers who were drinking in the pub at the time of the incident . The pub has remained closed since the incident in November 2013 but building work is now underway as part of attempts to clear debris . Much of the pub has been left untouched since the crash, with glasses and live music flyers still strewn across the pub from the night . Drinks and mixers remain untouched on the bar at The Clutha, which has been situated on the banks of the River Clyde since 1819 . Owner Alan Crossan said it has been incredibly difficult to decide what to with the pub since the crash but now hopes to reopen by May . He said the pub's adjoining Victoria Bar is to be refurbished, while the beer garden at the back of The Clutha will be covered over. He has not yet decided what to do with the area of the building where the Police Scotland helicopter crashed. He said: 'It's difficult, it's taken me a year and a bit to even get to this stage. Maybe in six months, maybe in a year, I'll know better what to do with this. 'Obviously, when we get people back in and the music starts again, we'll get a better idea of what we can do. 'The name will stay. The Clutha, before the accident, was pretty famous anyway, so the name will always stay. The Clutha means the Clyde and we're right next door to the Clyde, so we'll retain that.' He added: 'Obviously in its day it was a pub that was really happy and it was always a good pub, there were never any issues in it, so it's got a feeling now where it's strange, I could take a long, long time to figure out what to do with it.' The bar area of The Clutha took the main impact of the crash, while those in the area where a band was playing were initially unaware that a helicopter had crashed into the building. Thick dust covers much of the pub's original features and debris is strewn across the premises following the tragic helicopter crash . Many drinks and glasses can still be seen in the bar area, which was ripped apart when the helicopter crashed through the pub's roof . Mr Crossan said it could take a 'long, long time to figure out what to do' with the pub but currently has plans to reopen it by May 1 . Many glasses can still be found half-empty dotted around the pub, while food menus and live music posters are also scattered around . Glasses, many still half-filled with drink, could still be seen all around the pub today - some on the bar, some overturned on crates (above) Mr Crossan said building work is now underway to clear the rubble and debris and help refurbish the pub ahead of a reopening in May . Customers were forced to flee the pub when the helicopter plummeted through the roof, but many were killed instantly by the aircraft crash . The pub was hosting a live music event at the time of the helicopter crash in November 2013 and the pub was packed with customers . Inside The Clutha today, the scene looks largely as it would have done on the night of the disaster, when customers fled the building in panic. A glass stands on the bar counter with change next to it, while an unfinished drink is on a crate on the stage. Scattered flyers lie on the floor near the stage, while thick dust covers surfaces.

The Clutha (pictured before) has sat by the River Clyde in Glasgow since 1819 . The Clutha, where the Police Scotland helicopter crashed in November 2013, has sat staunchly by the River Clyde since 1819. It has helped foster Glasgow’s bustling music scene and has played host to the occasional celebrity. Named after the Latin name for the River Clyde, which runs through Glasgow, it was twinned with the nearby Scotia Bar, the oldest drinking establishment in the city. It was once the final stop for the Clutha boats, or ‘penny steamers’ that would take people to and from work in the Forth of Clyde, once the centre of the world’s shipbuilding industry. More recently it has counted Glasgow residents including comedian Billy Connolly and socialist politician Tommy Sheridan as patrons. It is now a noted live music venue, with performances most nights. Ska band Esperanza were playing on the night of the performance. The pub even plays a bit part in the story of war hero Private Jimmy Stokes, who charged into an occupied German building on his own in 1945. It was his last stop in his hometown before heading to war, where he bested the Germans but was fatally wounded and died overseas, being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The Clutha was also a favoured haunt of Scottish socialist Tommy Sheridan, who led protests against the poll tax in 1989 and was jailed twice. Although tee-total, he spent hours in The Clutha drinking coffee before handing himself over an unpaid court fine for causing a disturbance at a protest. Another tee-total star often spotted in the pub was Scottish comedian Billy Connolly. The entertainer, who now lives in the U.S., was even linked to an alleged assault at the venue in 1997 in the wake of a footballing triumph by local team Celtic. The comedian reportedly lashed out when a press photographer tried to take a picture of him.","Police Scotland helicopter crashed through roof of The Clutha pub in Glasgow city centre on November 29, 2013 .

"Ros Altmann says women are being forced out of the workplace because employers are ignoring the impact of the menopause . Women are being forced out of the workplace because employers are ignoring the impact of the menopause, a campaigner for older workers has warned. Ros Altmann, who advises the Government on how to keep over-50s in the workforce, said that while other life-changing events are recognised by businesses, the menopause is still taboo. As a result, older women are being failed by employers. Dr Altmann, who is an expert on pensions and finance, said some women struggling with symptoms of the menopause are perceived to be under-performing and are forced out of their jobs. Others, tired of battling on, will choose to leave or go part-time. Dr Altmann warned that menopause is just ‘not on the work radar’. ‘Pregnancy is, childbirth is, bereavement is, many other life phases are, but [menopausal women] get no support in the workplace,’ she said. The average age that women go through the menopause in the UK is 51. However, 1 per cent of women face it before they hit 40. The symptoms, which range from hot flushes to sleepless nights, headaches and depression, can last for as long as 14 years. Even for an average woman, it takes seven and a half years for the body to adjust. Hormone replacement therapy can help but it is usually only prescribed for five years. Dr Altmann, who has written a report on how to keep older people working, said she would have to be brave to call for training on how to manage women going through the menopause because ‘nobody ever wants to talk about that’. She told the Sunday Times: ‘A woman may come in one day… feeling awful and emotional and a lot of women find it hard to cope. You can’t sleep at night because of night sweats or you flush in a meeting. ‘Can you imagine telling a 40-year-old male manager you’ve got a problem with the menopause? It’s not going to happen. ‘Sometimes, women themselves think, “My God, I can’t cope any more” and leave. ‘Some drop to part-time work, even though they don’t need to. ‘We don’t know how it affects people because it’s not being managed.’ In December, a leading fertility expert called for women workers to be given paid ‘menstrual leave’. Gedis Grudzinskas, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, said female workers who feel under the weather every month should get up to three days off and that this should be separate from sick leave. The Harley Street professor said that his proposal was ‘about employers being sensible and aware’ about women in the workplace and trying to keep them there. He added that Britain is behind the times as menstrual leave is already legal in Japan, Taiwan and Indonesia, while Canada is discussing the idea.","Ros Altmann advises the Government on how to keep over-50s in work .

"MPs and peers may have to abandon the Houses of Parliament within 20 years unless a multi-billion renovation is given the go ahead, the Commons Speaker John Bercow has warned. Mr Bercow said a 'not inconsequential sum of public money' was needed to keep the Palace of Westminster 'fit for purpose'. He said it would be a 'huge pity' to have to leave the Commons and Lords, but experts have warned up to £3billion of repairs to the crumbling building are needed. John Bercow said a 'not inconsequential sum of public money' was needed to keep the Palace of Westminster 'fit for purpose' Among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes, ancient electrics and plumbing, asbestos, subsidence, badly-damaged stonework and fire risks. Speaking in Westminster Mr Bercow said: 'This is a fabulous institution located in awesome surroundings. It must not have the ethos of a museum. 'It will require bold and imaginative managerial leadership to ensure that we are a Parliament fit for purpose and that this Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation.' Referring to the blaze that burned down the old palace of Westminster in 1834, Mr Bercow said: 'It would be a huge pity if we decided that by the time we had reached the 200th anniversary of the vast fire which consumed the old parliament and brought this one in to being, we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly.' He added: 'Yet I will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years, that will be the outcome.' The cost of repairing the Houses of Parliament could top £3billion, an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested. MPs and peers may have to abandon the Houses of Parliament within 20 years unless a multi-billion renovation is given the go ahead . Among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes, ancient electrics and plumbing, asbestos, subsidence, badly-damaged stonework and fire risks . The cost of repairing the Houses of Parliament could top £3billion, an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested . Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’: . ASBESTOS . The walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICS . Much of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILATION . Many original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATING . Many boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODING . Faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFS . A problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGS . Several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE . Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. Dr Richard Ware said last year that it was ''not unreasonable'' to think the bill could top £2 billion, but BBC2's Newsnight programme claimed that the ''working assumption'' of insiders was that it could be a billion more. The Speaker also addressed the 'agony' of the controversial process to recruit a new clerk for the House of Commons, insisting he had always believed that splitting the role in two was the right way to proceed. Mr Bercow led an appointment panel in an external search to replace Sir Robert Rogers, who retired early as clerk last summer after a 40-year Commons career. The proposed appointment of Australian official Carol Mills was abandoned by Mr Bercow after protests from MPs that she was not able to do the job because she had no knowledge of Commons procedure. A committee led by former cabinet minister Jack Straw recommended splitting the role, with a director general responsible for administration and the clerk left to manage the constitutional and parliamentary elements. Mr Bercow said: 'On taking extensive evidence, they could see that the management of the House was simply not fit for purpose and they set out constructive proposals to equip us for the modern world. 'I am absolutely ecstatic that they reached the conclusions that they did, that they managed to obtain unanimity for their recommendations and that their findings were then accepted by colleagues without dissent in the debate in December and the legislation that came before the House last week. 'My one regret about all this is that it was not possible to find the consensus required to commission the Straw Committee a year earlier, because if we had it would have saved us the utter agony of a doomed first attempt. 'Finding a human being who was a parliamentary expert of the highest repute and a chief executive of stellar managerial form proved predictably impossible. 'Now that the role has rightly been separated - I argued all along that the clerk should not also be the chief executive and this has now been agreed by the House - I am confident that we will be able to find a clerk of the House whose constitutional qualifications would make Erskine May proud and a director general who can take on, full-time, the management of the Commons.' The Speaker also set out his plans for greater public involvement in the work of the Commons. He said: 'Democracy needs not only to be done but to be seen to be done to enjoy the weight it deserves. Reconnecting Parliament and the public is thus not some sort of public relations exercise but absolutely central to its status.' Mr Bercow said he was 'intrigued' by the recommendation of the Digital Democracy Commission for online public 'e-discussions' before debates in Westminster Hall, the Commons' second chamber. The Speaker also repeated his criticism of the way Prime Minister's Questions was conducted, and called for the party leaders to improve the tone of the exchanges. He said: 'PMQs are what the public see and hear of Parliament more than anything else. 'My submission, supported anecdotally wherever I go around the country and by some polling evidence, is that the public disapprove of the decibel level and orchestrated barracking. 'Put simply, if the party leaders want conduct on a Wednesday lunchtime to improve, it will. Post-election there will be an opportunity to achieve change that the public would welcome.'","Speaker John Bercow warns of major bill needed to renovate Parliament .

"Wallis Simpson ordered a top level diplomatic mission to rescue her swimming costume she had left behind at her luxury villa at the height of World War II. The US-born wife of King Edward VIII made the American Minister in Lisbon and the American consul in Nice find the Nile green outfit at the property in the South of France. The diplomats opened up the shuttered rental property even though that part of the coast was occupied by the Nazis at the time. Scroll down for video . What war? While Mrs Simpson and the Duke of Windsor were safe in Portugal, she made two U.S. diplomats find the green swimsuit she had left behind at her luxury villa in Nice at the height of World War II . Andrew Morton, the biographer of Princess Diana, writes in his new biography of Edward that the task became known privately as ‘Operation Cleopatra Whim’. Morton is scathing of the Duke of Windsor and Mrs Simpson in: ‘17 Carnations: The Royals, the Nazis and the Biggest Cover-Up in History’, which is also about their close ties to the Nazi regime. He writes that after Edward abdicated in December 1936 he and his wife ‘acted as if World War II was simply a minor inconvenience to their lifestyle’ and that their ‘self-indulgence knew no bounds’. Despite millions being slaughtered in the conflict, in 1940 Mrs Simpson had ‘other pressing concerns’, notably her missing swimming costume. Morton writes that it was ‘vital it be returned’ so she enlisted the American diplomats to ‘repatriate the garment’. Nautical couple: This photograph of King Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson was taken during their 1936 Adriatic cruise in the yacht Nahlin . Beloved suit: A replice of the infamous green swimsuit made it into the 2012 film, 'W.E.', starring Andrea Riseborough as Wallis Simpson & James D'Arcy as The Duke of Windsor . He writes: ‘Even though their rented villa was locked and shuttered and that part of the coast occupied by the enemy, the diplomats duly did her bidding. ‘In the midst of war the swimsuit was found and dispatched safely to the grateful duchess.’ Morton also writes that Edward and Mrs Simpson were in regular contact with high level Nazi commanders to beg them to protect their homes in Paris and the South of France. At the time the couple were hiding out from the row over his abdication in Spain and Portugal. Morton writes: ‘The duchess was most concerned that their bed linens be protected from damage. Honoured guests: Edward and Wallis depart Hitler’s mountain retreat in October 1937, after meeting the Fuhrer . The book claims that the Duke, center, was angered at being forced to abdicate the throne in 1936  and was willing to work with Adolf Hitler, right, to regain it .

The Duke of Windsor chats to Hitler’s propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels at a party in Berlin in 1937 . ‘Even the diplomat brother of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was horrified by the duke’s behavior. (He said): ‘A prince does not ask favours of his country’s enemies. To request the handing over of things he could replace or dispense with is not correct.’ In extracts already made public Morton writes that Mrs Simpson was viewed with deep suspicion by palace courtiers and that she had been described as a ‘witch, a vampire and a high-class blackmailer’. Just weeks after her husband took the throne in January 1936 some even thought that she could be a spy. Morton says that in his view Edward was ‘a man who was disaffected with his position, disloyal to his family and unpatriotic towards his country.’","Wallis Simpson made diplomats fetch her swimsuit during WWII .

"Anthony Crook, 37, who said his reputation was destroyed when he was listed as a 'most wanted' rapist has won almost £70,000 in damages . A former high-flying City banker who said his reputation was destroyed when he was listed as a 'most wanted' rapist has won almost £70,000 in damages from police. Anthony Crook, 37, from Clacton, Essex, was working in Dubai when his image was wrongly released by Essex Police as one of their 'ten most wanted' in 2010. He claimed the worldwide coverage left him 'unemployable' and said the stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts. Mr Crook sued the force and in a hearing at the High Court today, Judge Deborah Taylor said the release of his name and image was a breach of his human rights. 'His details were published to the world at large,' she told the court. 'Whilst the press release was to local media, no consideration was given to the realities of modern technology: firstly, the potential for information to spread across the internet, and secondly, the difficulty once spread in eradicating that. 'The police lost control of the data. It was not on posters they could take down and photographs they could take from shopkeepers.' The court heard Mr Crook had been warned by a friend that a 'malicious' complaint might be made against him and had called Essex Police. But he was told by officers that no such allegation had been received and thought that was the end of the matter, he said. He only found out about the article - alleging he was wanted and at large over an alleged rape in Clacton - through his family. The article was accompanied by his address from his City days in Clapham and a photo which had been taken when he was a dreadlocked teenager. Mr Crook said the allegation was 'malicious' and there was no need to publicise it, as he had already offered to speak to police to clear it up. The result was that he was left 'unemployed and unemployable', his lawyers told the High Court. 'There was a level of shock and embarrassment. You are defined by the career you have,' he told Judge Deborah Taylor. 'I was financially in a very good place and that's completely wiped out overnight. 'It's an allegation of a sexual assault. There's a stigma attached to that which stays with you forever. 'The fact they didn't remove these things for such a long period of time made it impossible to get back into work and rebuild my life.' Mr Crook contacted the force, which ultimately agreed to have the story removed, but it had already spread via other media around the world. He told a hearing at the High Court (pictured) that the worldwide coverage left him 'unemployable' and said the stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts . He was horrified to find his name was even featured on the website of a newspaper in India, he told the judge. 'We were having to constantly search to find these links and provide them to the police,' he continued. 'The fact that they were there until 2013, three years after I contacted the police, just isn't satisfactory.' The stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts, he added. He sued for breach of confidence, in publishing the old photo, and for breaches of the Data Protection Act and a violation of his human right to privacy. Essex Police claimed the publication was in the public interest, but the judge said it was not 'reasonable, necessary and proportionate'. The judge rejected his claim that the publication directly led to him losing two good jobs - but said it had adversely affected his ability to get another. She awarded £5,000 for his psychiatric problems, £57,750 for loss of earnings, £2,000 basic damages and £3,000 aggravated damages. Speaking outside court, Mr Crook said: 'I am extremely happy that I have been vindicated and the police have finally been held to account. 'I now feel my name has been cleared and there has been an acknowledgement that the police had done wrong. 'Had they held their hands up in the first place and given me some kind of apology, we wouldn't have ended up in the High Court.'","Former banker Anthony Crook, 37, claimed his reputation was destroyed .

"A potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears. The Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was found in animals at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is just 35 miles north of New Orleans. The bacteria, primarily found in south-east Asia, can spread to animals and humans through direct contact with contaminated soil and water. A potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears (stock image) But despite thorough investigations by multiple authorities the cause of the release and extent of the contamination are still unknown. It is the latest in a series of significant accidents that have taken place across the country. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the release was worrying. Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a wide range of symptoms including fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Several countries have studied using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. If the disease is left untreated it is fatal. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. Confirmed infections are relatively rare. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he told USA Today. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' Research was being completed at the center using rodents to try and find a vaccine against the bacteria. But at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been accidentally exposed to it. The first was discovered nearly three months ago in November and two have since died. All four were in the center's veterinary hospital at the same time, leading to speculation that it could have been where the animals were exposed. At least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been exposed to the bacteria (stock image) But one US Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigator was also hospitalised after blood tests showed she had antibodies indicating a current or prior exposure to the bacteria. She is now recovering. Authorities are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Andrew Lackner, director of the center, said: 'We're taking this extraordinarily seriously. It's very disturbing to us. 'There has never been a public health threat.'","Bacteria released by Tulane National Primate Research Center, Louisiana .

"A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million as 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumers in the state's first year of full legalization. However sales for medicinal pot still outstripped the recreational sales by almost 50 tons, according to officials. In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumer (above Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio selects marijuana strains from the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary in December 2014) In its first annual report, it was revealed that 109,578 pounds (49.7 tons) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 38,660 pounds (17.5 tons) were sold on the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division . Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million. But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report. In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News. In a national first, voters in Colorado and Washington state opted to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults in landmark twin ballots in 2012, and the first retail stores opened in Colorado on January 1, 2014. States such as Oregon and Alaska, which have now also voted to legalize recreational pot as well as others where lawmakers face proposals to do so, are watching the Colorado results closely. Recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report (above a info-graphic created illustrating the findings from the report) Findings also showed that 322 retail stores were licensed at the end of the year, up from about 200 six months earlier, while 833 licenses were issued to retail businesses in general, and 1,416 medical marijuana businesses were approved by the state. It said medical businesses were cultivating around 300,000 marijuana plants on average each month during 2014, while the number of retail plants rose steadily from fewer than 25,000 in January to nearly 217,000 during December. The report noted that more than twice as many Colorado jurisdictions had 'completely opted out' of allowing either retail or medicinal pot businesses to operate than had permitted them. The state's marijuana laws have been challenged in federal court by neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, which argue weed is smuggled across their borders. Some Colorado residents said the pot industry has hurt their families, businesses or property values . Sixty-seven jurisdictions allow medical and retail licensees, 21 permit only medical, and five only retail, while 228 jurisdictions prohibit them both.

"A reduced-fare program has launched for commuters in Seattle's metropolitan area offering transit tickets based on income. The ORCA (One Regional Card For All) Lift program provides a discounted rate of $1.50 per trip for residents using public transportation earning less than 200 per cent of the federal poverty rate, which is currently $23,340 per person. As the metropolitan area's Metro fares increased for the fifth time since 2008 today, the program was created with the hopes that public transit would remain accessible for those who cannot afford the higher prices. The ORCA (One Regional Card For All) Lift program provides a deducted rate of $1.50 per trip for residents using public transportation, and who earn less than 200 per cent of the federal poverty rate, which is currently $23,340 per person (above King County Executive Dow Constantine, right, delivers the first of the ORCA Lift cards to local resident, Floribert Mubalama, left) In the second program of its kind in the nation, residents are eligible for the two-year long ORCA cards based on particular maximum household incomes (above a chart illustrating the maximum income for households to qualify for the ORCA Lift program) The program, run by King County Metro Transit, is unique because it relies on health clinics and organizations that signed up people for ObamaCare to enroll residents for ORCA Lift . The program, run by King County Metro Transit, is unique because it relies on health clinics and organizations that signed up people for ObamaCare  to enroll residents for ORCA Lift. This is why Seattle resident Basro Jama, 27, a single mom and an immigrant from Somalia, received her card last week while at the doctor with her two children, according to the New York Times. Jama, who earns less than $25,000 a year after taxes, will now save at least ten dollars on commuting costs each week with her ORCA Lift card. In the second program of its kind available on a large-scale in the nation, residents are eligible for the cards, which are active for two years, based on particular maximum household incomes. For example, a family of three with a maximum income of $39,580 would be able to apply for the program, as would a family of five with maximum income of $55,820. 'ORCA Lift will help people across our region get to work and school each day even as bus fares continue to rise,' said King County Executive Dow Constantine. 'By taking advantage of the strong network of community partners that we've built in recent years, we're making it convenient for riders to find out if they qualify for this new opportunity.' The first group of residents to sign up took place last week, and the program could possibly reach 100,000 people. Seattle resident Justin Bonzai shared on Twitter (above) that he received his ORCA Lift card on Friday . Some residents who do not qualify for the program have shared bitter feelings. Resident Lynn Sellick-Lane shared on Twitter (above) that if you do not qualify for ORCA Lift, 'you get to pay for everyone who does' The first group of residents enrolled in the program  last week, and it is reported the benefits could reach between 45,000 and 100,000 people, according to the Seattle Times. Around 1,000 people already received the card. Seattle resident Justin Bonzai shared on Twitter that he received his ORCA Lift card on Friday. He wrote: 'Yay I got the ORCA Lift card (discount bus trips) $1.50 for a bus ride instead of $2.75. Awesome.' But some residents who do not qualify for the program have shared bitter feelings. Resident Lynn Sellick-Lane shared on Twitter that if you do not qualify for ORCA Lift, 'you get to pay for everyone who does'. The program, created through a joint effort between Constantine and Metropolitan King County Council, has been characterized as a 'safety valve'. The fare changes are aimed to bring a balance between bringing in a revenue that will support Metro service while keeping bus trips affordable for people with low incomes . The fare changes are aimed to bring a balance between bringing in a revenue that will support Metro service while keeping bus trips affordable for people with low incomes, according to KING5. Between 1999 and 2012, 95 per cent of King County's new households have been earning either more than $125,000 or less than $33,000 with hardly any middle ground, said Constantine. He said: 'It's people doing really well, and people making espresso for people who are doing really well.' Even if commuters are qualified for the reduced fare program, but then start earning more than the 200 per cent of the federal poverty, they can still reap the benefits until their ORCA card expires . The reduced fare will provide 50 percent or more off fares to income-qualified riders which is applied to their travel on Metro Transit buses, Sound Transit Link light rail, and the Seattle Streetcar. And even if commuters are qualified for the reduced fare program, but then start earning more than the 200 per cent of the federal poverty, they can still reap the benefits until their ORCA card expires. As the fares increased 25 cents today on King County Metro Transit, the raised prices are part of a larger problem impacting America's public transportation systems. It was reported that more than 70 per cent of the country's transit systems raised fares or cut services since the recession, according to the American Public Transportation Association. While Seattle rolls out its ORCA Lift program, it is not the first of its kind. In 2005, San Francisco delivered its Muni Lifeline fare program but it currently only has less than 20,000 card holders - within a system that provides services to  350,000 people a day. Programs on a smaller scale have been launched in Ohio and Pennsylvania. But all eyes will remain focused on Seattle as other states watch to see how the program unfolds. 'Metro is only the second large transit system in the country to roll out a fare of this type,' said Metro General Manager Kevin Desmond. 'I am proud that we are able to step up to ensure continued access to bus service for those who need it the most.'","ORCA (One Regional Card For All) Lift program provides discounted rate of $1.50 per trip for commuters earning less than 200pc of federal poverty rate .

"The former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland is set to pocket a £1million bonus from the state-backed lender – two years after he was dramatically forced out of his job by George Osborne. There was growing outrage last night that Stephen Hester will get such a huge sum from a bank that was bailed out by the taxpayer. He could receive more than 500,000 shares in RBS – worth up to £1.9million – as part of a long-term incentive scheme dating from his days in charge. However Mr Hester, who now runs insurance firm RSA, is unlikely to receive the full entitlement because not all the terms have been met. Stephen Hester, left with a Warwickshire Hunt,  is set to pocket a £1million bonus from the Royal Bank of Scotland . In January 2012, when he was still at the helm of RBS, Mr Hester turned down a controversial bonus worth almost £1million after caving in to ‘enormous political pressure’ despite the backing of the bank’s board. At the time he was being paid £1.2million a year – or 46 times the average salary of employees in Britain. Mr Hester was brought in to turn around beleaguered RBS after the departure of disgraced predecessor Fred Goodwin. News that he continues to receive millions from his tenure at the bank has sparked fury after RBS last week revealed a seventh consecutive year of annual losses. Andy Silvester of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Until RBS is able to stand on its own two feet, it needs to seriously rein in payoffs, bonuses and these long-term incentives. ‘The Chancellor needs to stand up to those in the organisation who seem to have forgotten that taxpayers bailed the bank out. Shareholders must be heard – and at RBS, that includes taxpayers.’ RBS’s earnings have been hammered by a spiralling bill for its past misdemeanours – including those during Mr Hester’s reign. Last week it reported a £3.5billion annual loss and announced that former Financial Services Authority boss Sir Howard Davies will take over from Sir Philip Hampton as chairman. It set aside £2.2billion to cover legal claims, including £320million to pay further fines in the US for rigging foreign currency markets and an extra £400million in the last three months of 2014 for mis-selling payment protection insurance. RBS, which has been propped up by £46billion of taxpayers’ money since the 2008 financial crisis, still has the power to scrap or delay Mr Hester’s bonus. Shareholders have complained for years that it continues to hand ‘extraordinary’ packages to top staff. The Government has a 79 per cent stake in the bank, although it is eager to see it back in private hands. However, with the share price around 370p – still well below the 455p the Treasury needs to recoup its money – a sale remains a long way off. Conservative MP Mark Garnier, a member of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘Success for RBS will be when it is back in the private sector. So, given the current environment, I don’t think that people should be taking bonuses until such time that it is fully privatised again.’ RBS refused to comment.","Stephen Hester is set to pocket a £1m bonus from Royal Bank of Scotland .

"Dustin Klopp hanged himself in his cell at Lancaster County Prison in Pennsylvania on Wednesday . A Pennsylvania man accused of killing his wife with an ax on Christmas Eve and sexually assaulting her was pronounced dead after a suicide attempt. Dustin Lee Klopp, 36, hanged himself in his cell at Lancaster County Prison on Wednesday night. The Paradise Township man was brought to the hospital and declared brain-dead because of lack of oxygen to the brain, according to the Lancaster County coroner's office. Klopp was pronounced dead Friday. Authorities believe Klopp killed his wife, Stephanie Kilhefner, 34, at their home after an argument. They had been married for three years. It is believed he cut her throat with a knife and repeatedly hit her in the head with an ax. When Kilhefner was dead, Klopp put her body in a bag in a shed and tried to clean up the blood. He brought their children, aged five and two, to celebrate the holiday with his parents and then called police to confess. After placing the call, Klopp arrived at the state police barracks in Lancaster about an hour later. Police believe he sexually assaulted his wife during the incident, although it is not clear if she was alive or dead at the time. Klopp was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and evidence-tampering. The children did not see what happened, Lancaster Online reported. Police say Klopp, 36 (left) murdered his wife of three years, Stephanie Kilhefner, 34, (right) on Christmas Eve . The killing happened at the Lancaster home (left) Klopp and Kilhefner (right) shared with their two children . Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman called the situation 'awful' and 'chilling', the Huffington Post reported. He said: 'The timing makes it worse. 'Then you put kids in the mix and it makes it even more difficult. 'Christmas for them is ruined forever. It's just terrible.' In 2009 Klopp was arrested on drug charges and served time before being released in 2011 and marrying Kilhefner. Klopp's criminal record also included guilty pleas for DUI, resisting arrest, burglary and simple assault.","Dustin Klopp hanged himself at Lancaster County Prison in Pennsylvania .

"A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian'. The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread, which they could then share with friends on social media. But  the words 'lesbian', 'Jewish' and 'orangutan' are all banned from being emblazoned on the pots, it has been discovered. A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian' (file picture) The Nutella website says: 'Here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love.' But users realised that there is a long list of words banned, which bizarrely does not allow 'lesbian' but permits the word 'gay'. The word 'Christian' can also be written on the jars, but other religious terms such as 'Jewish' and 'Muslim' have been banned by Nutella, Pink News reported. The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread . Health-related terms, presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity, have also been banned, including the words 'cancer' and 'diabetes'. The company, owned by Ferrero, has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil, the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans. This may explain why 'boycott' and 'orangutan' make the long list of banned words. Ferrero said in a statement: 'By giving customers the opportunity to personalise their Nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand. 'Negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field. Similarly, terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities.' The news comes just a day after it emerged that Marks & Spencer had banned the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers. The policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a £35 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in 'Christ Church Teddington'. Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, said: 'If Christ becomes an offensive word in a Christian land then all of us should be alarmed.'","Nutella bans the 'word' lesbian from jars as part of marketing campaign .

"For six years a fleet of ten  Boeing 787 Dreamliners have been sitting unused and unwanted at a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. Now there may be hope for them as two buyers have come forward keen to buy the cut price jets. The abandoned and half-completed aircraft have been labelled the ‘terrible teens’ after being relegated during the early stages of production after numerous structural and weight issues. Scroll down for video . Ten Boeing 787 Dreamliners have been sitting unused and unwanted at a Boeing factory in Washington . According to Bloomberg, the planes have dropped in price to an estimated combined $1billion, which is about half the price of the final, lightweight 787 planes. Problems arose after Boeing fast-tracked production before the Dreamliner was certified airworthy. As a result the teens, which were among the earliest designs to be built, were  made too heavy to  fly as far as manufacturers had hoped. Although Boeing has never divulged the weight difference for the teens compared to catalogue models, once they are finished their range is estimated to be 6,850km, 1,850km less than later 787-8 Dreamliner models. Workers assemble Boeing  787 Dreamliner jets at the Boeing Everett Factory in Everett, Washington . Air Austral CEO Marie-Joseph Male: Air Austral is said to have bought two of the overweight planes . Ten early-production 787s were dubbed the 'terrible teens' after being abandoned due to design problems . The Boeing 787 passenger jetliner was introduced for the first time on Sunday, July 8, 2007 . But their rock bottom price tag  is finally attracting buyers, with Air Austral and Ethiopian Airlines said to be  in talks to buy the lot in attempts to cut costs amid soaring fuel prices. Two of the jets have been ordered by Air Austral, a French airline with its headquarters at Roland Garros Airport in Sainte-Marie on the island of Réunion. Eight more of the heavy Dreamliners look set to go to Ethiopian Airlines which is said to be in 'advanced discussions' to buy them. Ethiopian Airlines is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet . AllAfrica.com reports the African airline is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet including the latest version of the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A350. The Boeing 787 ran more than three years behind schedule for problems with carbon-fibre, on-board systems and manufacturing processes to be ironed out. It finally launched to great fanfare in 2011, three years after the so-called jetlag-busting was supposed to go into service. Airlines that use the jet, which is lightweight, making it more fuel-efficient for long-haul flights, include British Airways, Thomson, United, Etihad and All Nippon.","Ten  aircraft dubbed 'terrible teens' after early production design problems .

"Legal battle: Dentist Anca Macavei, who tried to treat a patient in McDonald's, outside the High Court today, where she is fighting the General Dental Council's decision that she should be struck off . A London dentist who was struck off after trying to work on a woman’s teeth in a McDonald’s restaurant is fighting the decision. Anca Claudia Macavei attempted to fit a bridge in the mouth of an unnamed patient after setting up a temporary surgery in the fast-food chain's Cannon Street restaurant in 2012. And when the woman refused to be treated, Miss Macavei insisted that it was necessary and tried to do the work in a hallway of a nearby dental practice. Miss Macavei, who is registered in Tulcea, Romania, has been suspended since last July when the General Dental Council (GDC) ruled she should be struck off. At the time, the GDC said her fitness to practice was ‘impaired’ by misconduct. Miss Macavei is now fighting a last-ditch battle to overturn that decision at the High Court. Miss Macvei had previously practised in Tavistock, Devon, but was living in London and advertising for Romanian patients online when she met Patient 1. She had an informal arrangement to use the Cannon Street Practice surgery on an ‘ad-hoc basis’ for seeing patients. But her relationship with the practice manager deteriorated and she was stuck with only limited access to the premises. On February 18, 2012, she met with Patient 1 in a McDonald’s close to the surgery. Last July, the GDC professional conduct committee found, on the balance of probabilities, that she had tried to work on the woman’s teeth in the restaurant. ‘Patient 1 was clear and specific in her evidence on this issue,’ it said in its decision. ‘She stated that you tried to put bridges in her mouth whilst in the McDonald’s and, when she refused, you insisted that it was necessary, to see if they would fit. ‘You confirmed in evidence that your access rights to the Cannon Street Practice had already been withdrawn by the time you met with Patient 1 at McDonald’s. ‘In the circumstances, the committee found that it was more likely than not that you did attempt a fitting of the bridges in that unsuitable environment, considering that you had nowhere else to go at that time. ‘The committee was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that you also attempted to provide dental treatment to Patient 1 in the hallway outside the Cannon Street Practice. ‘Both you and Patient 1 recalled that when you left McDonald’s, the entrance to the practice was open, as renovation work was being carried out. ‘Patient 1 told the committee that you both entered the hallway of the practice, where you tried again to fit the bridges. ‘She said that you told her that you had no access to your surgery because you had lost the key. ‘The committee found that it was more likely than not that this did happen following your failed attempt to fit the bridges in a more public setting where the patient was understandably uncomfortable.’ She was also found responsible for a ‘catalogue’ of other failings in her work with the patient and another. Miss Macavei, who is registered in Tulcea, Romania, but lives in London, was visibly emotional as she addressed the judge at the High Court today. She claims that the GDC’s decision to erase her name from the register was ‘disproportionate’. Suspension or conditions on her practice would have sufficed. Temporary practice: Miss Macavei tried to fit a bridge in Patient 1 in this McDonald's restaurant in Cannon Street, London. When the woman refused to be treated, she tried to do the work in a nearby hallway . James Townsend, for the GDC, is contesting Miss Macavei’s application. He said: ‘Given Ms Macavei’s catalogue of failings, lack of insight and failure to engage over more than two years with an attempt to help her, then to engage in a half-hearted way, the GDC submits that it cannot possibly be said that the decision of the professional conduct committee was wrong.’ The GDC made its decision to strike Miss Macavei off last July and she has been suspended since then pending her appeal to the High Court. Mrs Justice Patterson reserved judgment and will decide Miss Macavei’s future at a later date.","Anca Claudia Macavei attempted to fit bridge in Cannon Street restaurant .

"Leonard Nimoy's widow was surrounded and comforted by friends just hours the Star Trek actor was laid to rest during an intimate service on Sunday. Actress Susan Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air. The 71-year-old was hugged by a close companion as they remembered her husband of 26 years, who passed away on Friday morning following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - or COPD. Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock in the sci-fi franchise for 47 years, was reportedly buried at the Hillside Memorial Cemetery and Mortuary in Los Angeles, surrounded by close family and friends. A controversial absence was longtime co-star and William Shatner who was not able to make it back in time from a charity event in Florida. Scroll down for videos . Support: Susan Bay, Leonard Nimoy's widow is surrounded by friends outside the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills after her husband was laid to rest during a private service . Embrace: The 71-year-old was hugged by a companion two days after the iconic actor, who played Mr Spock, died in their home in Bel Air . Relationship: The couple were married for 26 years. The actress and Mr Nimoy's son Adam announced his death on Friday . However the Canadian actor, who played Captain Kirk, was the target of a barrage of abuse over the weekend by Twitter users condemning his decision not to attend and stay at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. According to reports the service was restricted to a small number of guests, including the couple's children Adam and Julie, and the star's stepson Aaron Bay Schuck. Afterwards, his family wrote a statement on Facebook saying: 'Thank you for all the love and kind words to Leonard. We lost a wonderful, talented, sweet man, a great father, husband, grandpa, and friend. 'Again thank you for all the love and good wishes. R.I.P and LLAP.' It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours of their passing. But, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, Nimoy was buried on Sunday. Although fans were barred from attending, they found their own ways to pay their respects. A moment of silence was held at the the Long Beach Comic Expo, a two-day comic book convention in California, with many attendees also dressed as Spock. Meanwhile, the actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was adorned with flowers, photographs and tribute messages. Mr Shanter revealed on Saturday that he would not be able to make it back for the service. The 83-year-old was seen landing at LAX at 11:30am, two hours after family and friends gathered to pay their respects. Speaking to TMZ outside the terminal building, he said the charity event went 'very well' but would not comment on the funeral. He led the tributes to the late actor following his death on Friday, saying he loved him like a 'brother'. Despite defending his claims and insisting his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth would be there, he received a wave of shocking abuse online. Statement: His family thanked supporters for their love on Facebook after the funeral and urged followers to 'Live Long and Prosper' Shatner was spotted on Sunday wearing the same clothes he had been wearing on Friday, as he touched down in Florida just hours after the actor who he described as a 'brother' passed away . Tributes: Shatner tweeted tributes to Nimoy (together, left, in 2009) as he attended an event with his wife (right) Elizabeth for the 58th International Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach . 'Lame excuse': A Twitter user condemned the decision by Mr Shatner. Others questioned why he didn't pay for a flight back from the event . When he revealed he was in Florida attending the Red Cross Ball and couldn't make it back in time, one of his followers said: 'Lame excuse. Man up.' Social media users demanded to know why Shatner did not pay $30,000 to fly back from Palm Beach to LA immediately after the Red Cross event on Saturday night. 'Priceline? Do Red Cross event and then private jet to LA,' wrote Todd Schnitt, a host of a morning talk show on WOR AM 710. Another said: 'Why not fly back right after?' Shatner responded to the trolls with memories of Nimoy. Family and close friends of the iconic actor who played Mr Spock gathered at 9am on Sunday to pay their respects after he passed away at his Bel Air, Los Angeles, home on Friday. Shatner was pictured catching an early flight on Sunday with his wife Elizabeth from Palm Beach to Los Angeles. He landed at LAX at 11.30am and so would have been in air during the service. Defence: Shatner responded to comments condemning his decision, saying he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago, adding that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth will be there . Bond: The pair (pictured during a scene of the 1982 film Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan) became friends during filming and remained close until Nimoy's tragic passing . Shatner was pictured early on Sunday morning at the airport in Palm Beach. He was wearing the same clothes as when he had jetted in on Friday. The actor had earlier responded to comments condemning his no show decision at his old friend's funeral, explaining that he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago. Answering one post addressed at him, he said: 'Walking out on a major fundraiser wouldn't have you calling me a jerk for leaving a charity high & dry? Hmm?' In response to people who expressed anger toward him for not flying to Los Angeles, the actor wrote: 'One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long.' He then used the social media platform to share his memories of Nimoy and answer questions from his followers about the late actor using the hashtag '#leonardnimoy.' 'I do want to thank everyone for coming here and sharing their memories and celebrating the life of LLAP! MBB,' he tweeted. After the charity event at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Shatner spoke to Local 10, but did not mention the funeral. He said: 'He [Nimoy] had a good, long life. He did a lot of things. He inspired a lot of people. He was loved by a lot of people and he loved a lot of people. 'It's sad that you have to be reminded that life is that short.' Shatner, posted a distraught message on Twitter on Sunday, the morning after he touched down at a Florida airport following his best friend's death. In the post, the 83-year-old Canadian actor wrote: 'I am currently in FL [Florida] as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight. Leonard's funeral is tomorrow. I can't make it back in time.

"Liam Gallagher was fined $5,000 for failing to appear at a child custody hearing. Pictured, his baby mother Liza Gorbani outside court today . Liam Gallagher was today hit with a second $5,000 (£3,300) fine by a New York judge who said she was tired of his ‘frivolous conduct’. Judge Laura Drager said that she could not ‘excuse him any longer’ and said his US child custody battle was going to trial. The lawyer for Liza Ghorbani, Mr Gallagher’s baby mother, said that Mr Gallagher had not turned up for a deposition he was supposed to give last month either. Ira Garr also revealed that their daughter Gemma, two, is exhibiting ‘delays’ in her development and is having problems with speech. With no settlement the case will now go to trial on March 26 with both sides digging their heels in. So far Mr Gallagher has only flown to America for one hearing in two years and was last month hit with his first $5,000 fine by Judge Drager. In the latest hearing she opened by asking Mr Gallagher’s lawyer Raoul Felder: ‘Mr Felder, where is your client’. Mr Felder said: ‘My client is not here.’ Judge Drager said: ‘Is there a reason why he is not here?’ Mr Felder said: ‘I have no good reason’. Judge Drager said: ‘I am imposing a sanction of $5,000 for what I deem to be his frivolous conduct in not appearing in this court.... ‘...I had him appear by phone and I excused his (non) appearance but as we proceed to trial I cannot excuse his (non) appearance any longer. ‘There is no reason that I have been given as to why he cannot appear’. In his submission Mr Garr attacked Mr Gallagher for his ‘willful failure’ to attend court. He ran through his litany of non appearances dating back to 2013 and said: ‘The history of non compliance is about the most flagrant I can consider’. Scroll down for video . Liza Ghorbani's lawyer said Mr Gallagher had not turned up for a deposition he was meant to give last month . Mr Garr also told the court that Mr Gallagher had never once even asked to see Gemma or requested visitation rights. Mr Felder however accused Miss Ghorbani of ‘greed’. He said that Mr Gallagher had been paying $5,000 a month to her for two years now even when there was no court order forcing him to do so. He said that with Miss Ghorbani: ‘It’s a desire not to collect child support, it’s a desire to get support for herself, to change her lifestyle. ‘She wants bodyguards, a doorman, she wants to be treated as maybe a wife is treated if it was a long marriage... ‘We are talking about greed here. If this was street talk I’d say the court was scammed’. He cast doubts on Miss Ghorbani’s claims she was poor by pointing out that she lived a comfortable life and was taking Gemma to music lessons and baby ballet. Mr Gallagher met Miss Ghorbani when she interviewed him in 2010. At the time, he was married to singer Nicole Appleton (pictured together in 2005) He also claimed that she spent $2,000 a month on her apartment in Manhattan to retain the ‘fantasy’ she was still living in the city when she was actually living with her parents in Virginia. In her ruling, Judge Drager rejected a motion by Mr Garr for the case to go into default, which would mean that the court would make a decision on how much Mr Gallagher should pay based on a per centage of his income. Miss Ghorbani is currently being paid $5,000 a month by Mr Gallagher until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed. When Mr Felder raised the prospect of Mr Gallagher attending the trial the judge said: ‘That would be great!’ Mr Gallagher, 41, met Miss Ghorbani, 40, after she interviewed him for the New York Times in 2010. At the time he was still married to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton with whom he is now divorced. Speaking after the hearing Mr Felder said that Mr Gallagher was in the UK but he did not know why he had not come to court. Asked if Mr Gallagher would attend the trial he said: ‘I don’t know’. Mr Garr would not elaborate on the nature of Gemma’s health problems but said that the ‘delays’ were being monitored. A spokesman for Mr Gallagher said: 'We believed that the case was resolved on an extremely generous basis to the lady until we got to court when she apparently received advice from others that prevented this. 'Liam always wanted to be more than fair and has always accepted responsibility for the child. The lady and her advisors have not allowed this to happen.'","Judge Laura Drager said she was tired of the singer's ‘frivolous conduct’

"AIDS came from gorillas as well as chimpanzees, new research suggests. Two of the four known groups of viruses that cause the disease have been traced back to the great apes that share about 98 per cent of their DNA with humans. It had been known simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) - the monkey equivalent of HIV - had jumped from chimpanzees into humans, but now it seems gorillas in Cameroon also played a vital role. Scientists say understanding the disease's origins will help predict the future risk of an outbreak. Scientists have discovered that AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon, as well as groups of chimpanzees in the country . The connection was uncovered after researchers analysed faecal samples collected in remote forests. They found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. HIV-1 - the virus that causes AIDS - has jumped species to infect humans on at least four separate occasions. The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon. Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is pictured . Groups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon. But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa. The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s. For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps. This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908. Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered. The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo. After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said. They identified it in four communities of western lowland gorillas in southern Cameroon - and dubbed it 'SIVgor'. Professor Beatrice Hahn, of Pennsylvania University, said: 'Viral sequencing revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the different gorilla samples. 'Two of the gorilla virus lineages were particularly closely related to HIV-1 groups O and P. This told us these two groups originated in western lowland gorillas.' Dr Martine Peeters, of Montpelier University in France, said the study has implications for understanding emerging diseases and gauging future human infection risks. She added: 'From this study and others our team has conducted in the past it has become clear both chimpanzees and gorillas harbour viruses capable of crossing the species barrier to humans and have the potential to cause major disease outbreaks.' The origin of HIV has baffled scientists since 1984 when it was first shown it causes AIDS. Evidence soon pointed to Africa and a similar virus in chimpanzees. Many scientists suspect that the chimp virus jumped into humans who hunt and butcher these great apes. But gorillas are now emerging as having played a supporting role in the AIDS epidemic - possibly by humans hunting them. The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Scientists identified pre-cursor of HIV virus in gorillas in Cameroon .

"Support: Samantha Green, 23, has been charged with son's murder - but her family is standing by her . The family of a California mother accused of killing her 20-day-old son who was found dead under heavy brush have said they are standing by her. Samantha Green, 23, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday, three days after her son, Justice Rees, was found dead in wetlands in Knight's Landing near the Sacramento River. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Frank Rees, Green's partner and Justice's father, also said he was standing by his fiancée. 'I will stand by her side through all of this,' he told KXTV. 'I know that she wouldn't intentionally hurt that baby. If there was some sort of accident or something that either she's not remembering or that she feels ashamed of or guilty about, she knows I'll forgive her.' Tragedy: Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing. She told authorities that they had been abducted . Support: Samantha's father Randy (pictured) and mother Laurie, said they were standing by their daughter because they know that she would never intentionally hurt her baby whom 'she loved very much' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villaseñor then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough, News 10 reported. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Scene: Crews can be seen looking through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body . Scene: Investigators flagged the spot where Justice's body was found by search crews on Wednesday . Police arrived around 5.30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Traverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush. Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am on Wednesday. A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough'. An autopsy is underway to determine the cause of his death. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. On Saturday, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto announced at a press conference that Green had been arrested and would be charged with murder. The district attorney has yet to decide what degree of murder she will face. 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child,' Prieto said. Prieto did not give any information as to why they decided to charge Green, but did say that authorities were not able to substantiate claims that she had been abused. Staying by her side: Green's partner and Justice's father, Frank Rees (pictured right) is supporting her . 'She made comments about she was there for so many hours screaming and hollering,' Prieto said. 'We were able to determine that perhaps (that) didn't happen.' He said that Green and her baby son had been the only two in her car, and added that authorities did not have knowledge of anyone else being involved. She is being held without bail at Yolo County jail. After police identified Justice's body on Wednesday, the family spoke of their heartbreak. 'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, with whom the young couple and their son had been living. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed. 'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know. This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'

"A motorcyclist suffered a pierced scrotum when the force of a crash forced his broken thigh bone into his genitalia. The 33-year-old was admitted to Ulm University Hospital in Germany with a 'hard, swollen, bluish scrotum and an externally rotated and slightly shortened left leg'. Medics treating him ordered a CT scan to get a better picture of the man's injuries. And it revealed a surprising diagnosis. The top of his left thigh bone, the femur, had been sheared off by the force of the collision. The impact had also caused the broken bone to pierce his scrotum from the inside. After the motorbike crash, the 33-year-old was admitted to hospital with a 'hard, swollen, bluish scrotum and an externally rotated and slightly shortened left leg', doctors reported . Medics treating him ordered a CT scan to get a better picture of the injuries. This revealed the top of his left thigh bone, the femur, had been sheared off by the force of the collision. And the impact caused the broken bone to pierce his scrotum from the inside . The man also suffered open fractures of his right forearm and hand, the New England Journal of Medicine report reveals. Specialists  operated on the 33-year-old using a 'direct scrotal incision' procedure to fix the bones back in place. The doctors treating the man said he had no 'urologic sequelae' - bladder and urinary dysfunction, despite his horrific injuries. After eight weeks of limited weight bearing, the patient was able to walk using a cane. And at a follow-up appointment 14 months after the crash, a CT scan revealed the bone structures in the man's leg were fully recovered and he was able to walk without the aid of the cane.

"A 20-year-old US Air Force satellite has exploded in space, adding 43 pieces of space junk to Earth’s orbit, reports have claimed. The explosion happened on 3 February due to a sudden temperature spike, although the event has only just come to light. However, talking to MailOnline, Nasa and Esa said the catastrophic event posed no significant risk to other satellites in Earth orbit. A US Air Force satellite has exploded 500 miles above Earth's surface. An unknown 'temperature spike' caused the explosion of the Defense MeteorologicalSatellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13). One of the series of satellites is illustrated here. This has resulted in 43 new pieces of debris in Earth orbit . The previously unknown incident was revealed by Space News, after posing questions to Air Force Space Command. Known as the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13), it was launched back in 1995 and had remained in operation until now. Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a US communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. Some tentative solutions to clear up space junk have been suggested - such as using nets to scoop some up - but nothing has been tried so far. This made it the oldest continuously operational satellite in this particular series of satellites. Exactly what has happened to the satellite, though, is still not clear, with the temperature spike remaining a mystery. Air Force Space Command said the power subsystem experienced 'a sudden spike in temperature'. This was followed by 'an unrecoverable loss of altitude control', before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially exploded. Part of the satellite still seems to be intact, however, as it is sending and receiving signals - although Air Force Space Command Told MailOnline said it was 'unrecoverable'. Speaking to MailOnline, Andy Roake, Chief of the Current Operations Division at Air Force Space Command, said the fault was likely due to the satellite reaching the end of its operational life time. ‘A thermal spike can be caused by a variety of things from on board anomaly to space environment changes,’ he said. ‘In this case we believe the satellite was wearing down. The satellite had already exceeded its design life three times over providing thousands of hours of weather imagery. ‘Prior to the power failure, the satellite had already lost its primary mission capability and so it provided limited operational capability.’ In addition, the satellite was still sufficiently intact to be sending and receiving signals from Earth, although ‘operators determined that DMSP Flight 13 had suffered damage to the power system rendering the satellite unrecoverable.' Air Force Space Command said the power subsystem experienced 'a sudden spike in temperature'. This was followed by 'an unrecoverable loss of altitude control', before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially, or completely, exploded (stock illustration shown) Six other DMSP satellites are in orbit, while a seventh is scheduled to launch in 2016. The Air Force played down the significance of the event, and said that the loss of the satellite - which had been retired to a back-up role - would not be detrimental to any of their operations. ‘Because this satellite was no longer used by the National Weather Service or the Air Force Weather Agency, the impact of the loss of this satellite is minimal,’ the Air Force told Space News. ‘We anticipate real-time weather data for tactical users will be slightly reduced without this satellite, but its data was not being used for weather forecast modelling.’ However, the main fear from such an event is the increase in the amount of debris into Earth orbit. Previous explosions in orbit, most notably the accidental collision of a US Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite in 2009, have released hundreds of pieces of debris into orbit. Another notable event was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007, when they blew up one of their own satellites, which was widely condemned. This raises the risk of a collision in future, and even the ISS occasionally has to perform manoeuvres to avoid space debris. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track (illustration shown) and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. This latest explosion is not thought to pose a significant risk, though . But speaking to MailOnline, Nasa and Esa played down the risk of any potential issue. ‘If the reported fragment numbers are stable, then the event is not considered major,’ said Dr Holger Krag, Head of Esa’s Space Debris Office. ‘What makes this event special is that the break-up obviously happened while the satellite was still operational.' Dr Krag noted that the explosion occurred above 500 miles (800km), where few other satellites were in orbit. Indeed, Esa’s closest mission is Cryosat-2, at an altitude of 450 miles (720km), so Dr Krag said they ‘do not expect any meaningful risk increase due to this event.’ The DMSP programme is used to monitor meteorological, oceanographic and solar-terrestrial physics for the US Department of Defense. It is managed by Air Force Space Command, with on-orbit operarions provided by Noaa. Shown is a rendering of lights on Earth using DMSP observations . Dr Eugene Stansbery, Program Manager of Nasa’s Orbital Debris Program Office, added: ‘The debris cloud from this event is obviously much smaller than the Chinese ASAT test of 2007 or the Iridium/Cosmos collision of 2009. ‘We have collected additional measurements to more fully characterize the event, but the data has not been processed yet. ‘Depending on what size you go down to, there are many thousands to millions of debris in orbit. This is a small increase to an existing risk to other spacecraft.’ And Mr Roake noted that the satellite would gradually decay from its current orbit until it re-entered the atmosphere, so was unlikely to significantly contribute to the space junk problem.","A US Air Force satellite has exploded 500 miles above Earth's surface .

"The former wife of jailed sex offender Max Clifford has been pictured wearing what appears to be an engagement ring. Divorcee Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced PR man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks. Since Clifford, 71, was jailed last May, Mrs Westwood has reportedly been seen several times with her former husband, IT consultant Lee, with whom she has a daughter. Scroll down for video . Engaged? In these photographs, taken  in the Cotswolds, Mrs Westwood is seen wearing what appears to be a sparkly band on her ring finger, sparking rumours that she and first husband Lee are engaged . Last year, the couple, who separated in 2003, were pictured enjoying time together in Broadway, Wiltshire, where the PR guru and his ex-wife had a £600,000 country residence. And these latest photographs, taken of Mrs Westwood in the Cotswolds village today, suggest that the couple have taken the next step towards rekindling their marriage. Dressed in a casual outfit and carrying a shopping bag, Mrs Westwood is seen getting into her car with what looks like a sparkly band on her ring finger. The 51-year-old was a volunteer bereavement counsellor for a children’s hospice in Guildford, Surrey, which Clifford became a patron of. He later admitted that he turned to her for support after the death of his first wife, Liz, from cancer in 2003. He began courting her and she worked as his assistant at his London offices. They married after she proposed to him on a golf course in Marbella, Spain. 'Rekindling their romance': Last October Jo and Lee Westwood were pictured enjoying time together in Broadway, Wiltshire, (above) where PR guru Clifford and his ex-wife had a £600,000 country residence . She was notably absent from his trial, however, which featured claims he abused girls as young as 12, and allegations that his extraordinary grooming technique involved telling impressionable young women that he had an extremely small penis. On the very day he was convicted she was seen walking near their Cotswold cottage – without her wedding ring. Weeks later, a court granted her a divorce in just 105 seconds for his ‘unreasonable behaviour’, which has caused her stress and heart problems. In October it was reported that Mr Westwood had been seen driving the £150,000 Bentley coupe Clifford bought his ex-wife as a wedding present. Divorced: Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced PR man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks. Above, at a court hearing last May . Perhaps unsurprisingly, she has splashed out on new personalised licence plates for the car, swapping the letters MAX for JO. Engagement rumours first emerged last year when the Daily Star Sunday claimed Mrs Westwood had been seen visiting a jeweller’s with her ex-husband, and wearing a large ring. A source told the newspaper at the time: ‘All Jo’s family and friends are really pleased that after everything she’s been through she is happy again. ‘None of them ever really liked Max. He was a bully and really put her through the mill. ‘She’s had a really tough couple of years with the allegations against Max but she’s put it all behind her. For the first time in ages she has a huge smile on her face.’","Jo Westwood pictured with what appears to be sparkly band on ring finger .

"My visit to Kimberley in Western Australia was my first ‘big’ trip Down Under. I’ve been to the country for a couple of short visits – I went to a friend’s wedding in Melbourne, for example – but this latest experience was something else. I was there to film part of my new series for More4 called Jimmy’s Australian Food Adventure. My tour involved seeing local producers, meeting the farmers and looking at what they are doing – to get a picture of the whole food culture. I wanted to understand what it was like when the first settlers arrived, to talk about Aboriginal dishes, and how all of that has had an effect on the country’s modern cuisine. During his tour, Jimmy went to Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, where there are lots of different species of crocodiles, including the large, troublesome saltwater crocs . Food in Australia has been greatly influenced by the second wave of immigrants: the Greeks, the Italians and, more recently, those from various parts of Asia. Until fairly recently, Australia was best known for pies and barbies – but now it’s at the forefront of international cuisine. It also produces some of the world’s leading wines and, with its diverse climate, it can grow pretty much any vegetable and fruit – from bananas to potatoes – nearly all year round. The other interesting thing is that Australia can produce all the vegetables needed to make Vietnamese and Sri Lankan dishes, for example. That’s not something we can do in the UK, so we have to import them instead. Australia was best known for pies and barbies – but now it’s at the forefront of international cuisine, and also produces some of the world’s leading wines . There are some fantastic chefs and some very interesting restaurants. If there is a problem with international recognition, it’s down to the fact it’s hard to define what exactly Australian cuisine is – there is a coming together of lots of different influences. Jimmy was in Australia was to film part of his new series for More4 called Jimmy’s Australian Food Adventure . However, I’m not sure this is actually a ‘problem’. For example, in South Australia I met an Italian market gardener who had emigrated and I was amazed at the variety of vegetables he was growing. Everything he would have produced back home on the Amalfi Coast, including cavolo nero and squashes, was there. In addition, he was growing different oriental vegetables which then go to farmers’ markets in Adelaide. At my farm in Suffolk, we have a farm shop, we run a farmers’ market, and we have a restaurant – we’re part of a food culture that can perhaps be accused of being slightly elitist. But in Australia, that attitude doesn’t exist because if people are snobby, they soon get shot down. This isn’t to say you won’t find fine dining Down Under. We went to Uluru – Ayers Rock – and I met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef. He did great fine dining, but following Aboriginal cooking styles and using native herbs and spices. The dishes included native thyme and garlic grilled wagyu fillet from Darling Downs, wattleseed-rubbed kangaroo carpaccio, bunya nut and shallot-crusted polenta fondant, and bush yogurt foam. Jimmy went to Uluru – Ayers Rock – and  met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef. He did great fine dining, but following Aboriginal cooking styles and using native herbs and spices . In Kimberley, we visited Cape Leveque, where I went crabbing with an Aboriginal elder called Brian Lee. It was amazing. You pull these huge mud crabs out of the mangroves, then cook them right there on the estuary. Incredible. In Darwin, I met Matt Wright, a real-life Crocodile Dundee. He farms saltwater crocodiles not just for the leather, for which they are renowned, but also for the meat. There are reasons to be concerned about some managed farming of what are perceived to be wild animals, but it can be a force for good. In the Pantanal in South America, the farming of caiman has helped to protect the wetlands. Crocodile strips are a popular local dish in parts of Western Australia . In Australia the population of the saltwater crocodile is up to the highest level since the 1970s. Crocodile is an interesting meat which you see a lot at farmers’ markets where they serve ‘croc in a wok’. During my tour, I went to Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, where there are lots of different species, including the large, troublesome saltwater crocs. Here they can put you in a big Perspex tube called the Cage of Death, and lower you into the tank with this beast. It’s only then you see their sheer majesty. Aboriginal elder Brian Lee looks untroubled by this feisty - and fairly large - mud crab . It was frightening, but awe-inspiring. Another great food place was Margaret River in Western Australia. There I discovered a company called Manjimup Truffles. Australia is the fourth largest truffle-producing country, after France, Italy and Spain. But the Australians aren’t content with that – they reckon in ten years they will be the largest producers. My favourite city is Adelaide. Many rave about Melbourne but Adelaide is trendier – the streets are lined with restaurants and there are fantastic farmers’ markets. I’m already looking forward to my next trip. It’s a long flight but once you’re there, it’s such a vibrant country you soon forget about the jet-lag.

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top U.S. officials faced off Monday in dueling speeches on the high-stakes Iran nuclear negotiations, a signature foreign policy objective of President Barack Obama. 'Imagine what Iran would do with nuclear weapons,' he warned on Tuesday, saying that the Islamic republic is already training, arming and dispatching terrorists on five continents. Asked whether President Obama watched the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters: 'I don’t believe that he did.' Netanyahu says a nuclear-capable Iran would have the means to achieve its stated goal of annihilating Israel. He listed a litany of instances when Israel has acted on its own, in defiance of the U.S., to protect itself. The Obama administration is pursuing talks with Tehran that critics say could ultimately allow the kind of nuclear enrichment inside Iran that Netanyahu fears most. U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power insisted on Monday in a speech preceding Netanyahu's that it will 'never' happen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, flanked by one of his security guards, addressed the 2015 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington on Monday . Netanyahu insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong' The backdrop for the rift between the longtime allies was the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. On Tuesday Netanyahu will address the U.S. Congress. Despite some Democrats' boycotting, demand to see the speech is brisk. 'We’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday in an emailed statement. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Each House member gets a single ticket to give away. 'I could scalp that ticket, there are so many people who want it,' Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg told The Washington Times. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Obama has repeatedly cautioned Israel not to launch pre-emptive attacks against Tehran, but Netanyahu suggested Monday that he could choose to act unilaterally as his country has done in the past, even at the risk of alienating the United States. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended her husband's speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference on Monday . 'In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare statehood,' Netanyahu recalled. 'That's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it. But, Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.' 'In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned ... that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone. But Israel did act – acted alone – to defend itself.' 'In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor at Osirak,' Netanyahu continued. 'The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms-transfers for three months. 'And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister Sharon launched Operation Defensive Shield. The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately but Sharon continued until the operation was completed.' 'I mention them to make a point,' he said. 'Despite occasional disagreements, the friendship between America and Israel grew stronger and stronger, decade after decade. And our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future.' US United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power told AIPAC that the United States will 'never' allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . The alliance between Israel and the Unites States is 'stronger than ever,' Netanyahu finally insisted, quelling fears of a rift between his Likud Party and Obama's Democratic Party. He insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong.' 'My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both,' he said. 'I deeply appreciate all the President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more.' 'The last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,' he added, 'and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.' Netanyahu addressed the gathering Monday morning at the Walter E. Williams Convention Center, bracketed by remarks from two senior U.S. officials: Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. The Obama administration hedged  last week about whether it would send someone to speak, and who it might be, after Daily Mail Online raised the subject during a White House briefing. Power insisted that 'The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period.' 'Talks, no talks, agreement, no agreement, the United States will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies,' she said to an audience of thousands. 'We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim. But if diplomacy fails, we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen. There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never.' She also criticized Netanyahu for 'politicizing' the Iran debate, saying U.S.-Israeli relations 'should never be politicized and it cannot and will not be tarnished or broken.' Netanyahu's visit to Washington has sparked criticism in both the U.S. and Israel. The centerpiece of his trip is an address to Congress Tuesday, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans and was not coordinated with the White House. HOUSE MEMBERS . Rep.

Neither President Obama nor Vice President Biden will meet with the prime minister while he's in Washington, citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in Israel's upcoming elections. A close Obama adviser, though, former presidential campaign aide Jeremy Bird, is in Israel working to help Netanyahu's opposition defeat him. Rice has been particularly sharp in her criticism of Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, calling the move 'destructive' to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon. A Netanyahu adviser told reporters traveling to Washington with the prime minister on Sunday that he was not coming to the U.S. capital to offend Obama. 'The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers' of the agreement that may be taking shape, the adviser said, speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record. Netanyahu outlined policy differences with the White House on Monday . Pro-Palestine demonstrators wore Netanyahu masks and showed symbolic 'blood stained hands' on Sunday during protests led by Code Pink . The adviser said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel 'does not oppose every deal' and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one. As Netanyahu was preparing to speak, Secretary of State John Kerry was in Switzerland for another round of talks with Iran. The U.S. is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late-March deadline. The U.S. is negotiating alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.","White House says Obama did not watch Netanyahu's speech on Monday .

"A lovesick American teenager almost died after getting drunk and nearly drowning in a river when he was dumped by a young Chinese woman he flew 7000 miles to visit. The 18-year-old, who was only named by his surname Pratt in Chinese media, had travelled from his home state of Ohio across to Jiangshan, a city in Zhejiang province in China, after becoming infatuated with a young woman he had met online. But after getting the cold shoulder from his online ladylove when he turned up, he started drinking and was found suffering from hypothermia and unconscious on the staircase leading down into the Xu River. Scroll down for video . A lovesick American teenager (pictured) almost died after getting drunk and nearly drowning in a river when he was dumped by a young Chinese woman he flew 7000 miles to visit . The teen had met the girl online and promised that he would visit her. After getting the cold shoulder when he turned up, Pratt drank himself unconscious and was found on steps leading down into the Xu River . A spokesman from the Cheng Bei Police Station quoted on Qianjiang TV said: 'He was unconscious and lying in a pool of his own vomit. It looks as if he might have fallen in the water at some stage as his clothes and shoes were soaked. To be honest he was so inebriated, he could easily have drowned. It was only a short distance to the water.' Pratt was taken to a local hospital and after regaining consciousness discovered that he had also managed to lose all of his money meaning he could no longer pay for his hotel room. However after hearing about his hard luck story, the hotel manager decided to let the teenager have the room for free. He admitted to police that he did not know the girl's real name, only her online pseudonym which was Xiaoqian, and he also admitted he had only started talking to her this year. Because she had perfect English and great photographs, he had fallen head over heels in love and had promised to come and visit her. Homeward bound: The American teenager, known only as Pratt, survived his brush with death and is now returning to the United States according to the Chinese . Pratt is pictured here in hospital recovering from his ordeal . Police said it appears the young woman may not have taken him seriously until he suddenly turned up in Xiamen, in Fujian Province, and then went to Jiangshan to meet the girl. Detectives confirmed from his mobile phone that he did try to ring her several times, after which he was told to leave her alone – and his number was blocked. Depressed about the rejection, Pratt had started drinking and was last seen cursing and staggering near Xu River, where he was found passed out later that night. Police tracked the young woman down, but she again refused to meet him despite hearing about the fact that he had almost died. A police spokesman said: 'We followed his progress until he left the country, and he is already on the plane back to the United States.' When contacted, Pratt denied that he had travelled to China because he was in love with a girl or that he was stood up by her.","Lovesick US teen travelled from Ohio to Jiangshan, China, to meet the girl .

"High-end fashion brands once came with a sky-high price tag. But now top designers are joining the ‘300 club’ – so-called because their bestselling products cost around £300. Although far from cheap, it is a price many can afford to save up for. And aspirational shoppers keen to buy into a little piece of luxury are behind a massive increase in sales of products from Michael Kors, Fendi and Ralph Lauren. Scroll down for video . Top designers are joining the ‘300 club’ – so-called because their bestselling products cost around £300- to meet the demand from aspirational shoppers who want to save up to buy a luxury item- they include, clockwise,  Michael by Michael Kors' red silk dress at £265, DKNY's feather skirt at £305, Mulberry's Mini Lily cross-body bag at £350, Tamara Mellon's red suede court shoes at £310 and Nicolas Kirkwood's blue metallic shoes at £305 . Fashion writer Karen Kay said: ‘True luxury now costs five figures or more and fashion houses do very expensive pieces which target that market. What they are also aware of is the real cash cow that your average girl on the street in London or Manchester can afford – an entry level designer handbag. She gets a taste of the label at a price she can afford.’ Miss Kay said that the £300 mark has been settled upon because it is accessible while retaining, ‘a level of aspiration, out of the reach of the Saturday spontaneity shopper’. And she said that society’s increasing fixation on image has caused the leading fashion houses to respond. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was spotted sporting the Dillon Bag by Michael Kors which falls into the 300 club, priced at £310 . ‘This market is catering for the mass market, which didn’t happen before,’ she said. ‘A lot of women now think nothing of spending £300 on a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes. Ten years ago that would have been absurd for anyone to spend that much other than fashion people. It’s a combination of social media and celebrity and selfie culture. I just think people are so consumed by image these days and that having that bag or those shoes is a status symbol.’ Miss Kay said handbags have replaced perfume as the key affordable item from top brands. For example, the Dillon tote by Michael Kors’ diffusion label Michael by Michael Kors, which retails at £310, became hugely popular after being seen on the arms of celebrities such as supermodels Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 27, and Miranda Kerr, 31, and actress Freida Pinto, 30. This white cotton and silk skirt with stripe detailing from Burberry is on sale for £250 (left) while the ribbed twisting sleeveless jumper from Stella McCartney is £310 . Jimmy Choo's patent nude wedge sandals with ankle straps fall into the aspirationally affordable bracket at £325 as are these disco-styled glittery gold and leather sandals at £265 from Marc by Marc Jacobs . However, from the same designer, the more affluent can spend £13,000 on the Crocodile Duffel. In the final half of last year, Michael Kors reported a rise in revenue of nearly 30 per cent to £840million. The Sunday Times reported figures from research company Kantar, revealing that 900,000 British women aged between 25 and 35 buy luxury brands and the market is worth around £4billion a year. Miss Kay said some designers, such as Chanel, do not sell £300 products as they would not want to ‘dilute’ their brand. This was backed by Dawn Pedersen, editor of fashion website Trendzine, who said of the £300 club: ‘This is at the lower end of the luxury designer spectrum. At London Fashion Week a few days ago, the fashion crowd were carrying bags by Celine, Balenciaga and Dior – all with a £1,000-plus price tag.’ Michael Kors' pleated metallic dress, which features a herringbone jacquard design, is just under the £300 mark at £282 while this crisp white short-sleeved shirt with large lapels from Dolce & Gabbana is on for £315 . These brown Louis Vuitton sunglasses with gold patterned arms are £315- the same price as this blue leather bralet from T by Alexander Wang .","Top designers are joining the ‘300 club’- where bestsellers cost £300 .

"The middle class will be ‘decimated’ by the rise of robots replacing traditional jobs like teachers, lawyers and doctors, a leading author warned today. Web entrepreneur Andrew Keen will leave the middle class ‘hollowed out’, while a new elite make billions from the profits of machines dominating the workplace. The grim warning comes ahead of Mr Keen taking part in a debate tonight entitled: ‘Be afraid, be very afraid: the robots are coming and they will destroy our livelihoods.’ Economists used a simulated economy to create a model plotting a range of possible robot scenarios.  This model revealed the rise of robots will initially create a tech boom, but this boom will turn to bust as workers are forced from their jobs and don't have enough money to pay for the goods the robots are producing . A study into the impact of the emergence of artificial intelligence and the rise of robots last week warned it will see unemployment soar, welfare costs increase and could even bring the global economy to its knees. The role of computer coders and developers will increase in importance as demand for smart machines rise. But traditional roles which depend on intellectual skills risk being eroded. Mr Keen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Sure there are going to be a few brilliant entrepreneurs who will become multi-millionaires or billionaires but what we are seeing is the sweeping away of the middle, the hollowing out of the middle. ‘That's the nightmare of this technological revolution. The low end will be fine, the middle class is going to be decimated, and there will be a new elite an elite who are able to work with computers, who will make massive profits from it. Web entrepreneur Andrew Keen claimed the ‘nightmare’ of a technological revolution will leave the middle class ‘hollowed out’ ‘But this is deeply threatening for people who have traditionally relied on intellectual skills to make their living.’ Asked what kind of jobs are under threat, he warned: ‘Middle class jobs - teachers, lawyers, doctors, experts - the traditional 20th century meritocracy is about to be swept away.’ Mr Keen, the author of “The Internet Is Not The Answer” and ‘Digital Vertigo’, insisted he did not mean robots would be ‘science fictional beings that are going to replicate human beings’. But they would replace jobs. ‘It's as profound as the industrial revolution at the beginning of the 19th century,’ he added, warning there may be a need for regulation to protect people and jobs. He went on: ‘What lies on the horizon - this is not a fake threat - is a technology which does indeed change everything. ‘Just because in the past it's worked does not in any way guarantee that in the future we should simply cross our fingers and say well in the past it's worked so somehow jobs will appear. ‘No economist have been able to say to us concretely what are most people going to do ion a world where artificial intelligence dominates society.’ A study by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research warned that over time demand for new code and, thus for high-tech workers, will eventually drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees. Lead researcher Seth Benzell said: 'Whether it’s bombing our enemies, steering our planes, fielding our calls, rubbing our backs, vacuuming our floors, driving our taxis, or beating us at Jeopardy, it’s hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines can’t do or won’t soon do.' However, Pippa Malmgren, the co-Founder of H Robotics which makes flying drones for commercial use, insisted that people would adapt to the new jobs market. She told Radio 4: ‘For every robot you create you actually generate three or four new jobs. ‘But they are not in the field of picking something up, or doing that heavy manual labour, they are in the area of doing something creative, advertising, legal and all sorts of distribution related. ‘It's going to open up a huge opportunity for people who have practical skills, who know how to weld metal, how to play with an engine, because then they can take what robotics provides and innovate with it and create a whole array of new jobs that we haven't even thought of.’ She said it was not possible for people to choose a career for life. ‘I don't think planning works. It's like surfing, you can’t pick a wave and say that’s the job I want to do with for my life. The economy keeps moving and changing. ‘And throughout history we will have to adapt and change. We are on the brink... we have already begun the next industrial revolution. This is going to create a wave of new activities and new jobs.’ According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years. Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes. She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life. According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the TC channel Syfy - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history.","Andrew Keen says ‘nightmare’ tech revolution will hollow out middle class .

"Just weeks after Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up spoke of how plastic surgery ended her in intensive care with rotting legs, the model has been rushed back into hospital. Andressa Urach, 27, spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg after fillers 'rotted' her muscles and had to be removed, triggering a life-threatening infection. The model and tv-presenter is now in care yet again, after suffering infections as a result of the implants in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Back in care: Just weeks after Miss BumBum model Andressa Urach was released from hospital over her infected legs, she has been rushed back to hospital to remove infected buttocks implants . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek, as her leg and life are at risk. Urach, who came second in the popular Miss BumBum competition in 2012, was taken to hospital after waking up with a huge inflammation. 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' Miss Urach said from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo . 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' In December last year, Miss Urach spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg after fillers 'rotted' her muscles and had to be removed, triggering a life-threatening infection. Bum note: Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek, as her leg and life are at risk . Pain in the backside: Miss Urach was hospitalised after waking up with a huge inflammation in her buttock . Miss Urach, who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, has reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. Ordeal: Urach pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com. Brazil's Plastic Surgery Society said she was given a dose of silicone gel 200 times what the government allows . Terrible toll: Brazilian TV presenter Andressa Urach, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . Taped up: The presenter spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . Damage: The sobering, graphic photos show gaping holes in Miss Urach's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. Her mother Marisete De Favari logged in to her Twitter account, asking the model's 220,000 followers to pray for her as she remained on the ward in a serious state. 'I would ask for prayers from friends and people who wish for the recovery of my daughter,' she wrote on December 10. 'She's starting to walk, put her foot down and sit. After all this time lying down, she expected it would be painful. She has been taking morphine since entering the hospital, but now they are taking the drugs away from her gradually. 'As she had sepsis, healing will be slow, because it has to happen in a natural way so that it is not subject to a new infection. 'This takes time and she is assisted by doctors all the time. She has had no contact with anyone but the doctors and her mother.' The model added on December 26: 'My loves, thank you for the affection and chains of prayers. God is great and is taking care of me.' Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Miss Urach featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in northern Syria have mysteriously released 19 Christians hostages, local activists have revealed. The members of Christian Assyrian community were among 220 people kidnapped by jihadis from a string of villages along the Khabur River in Hassakeh province last week. The terrorists gave no explanation for why they had chosen to free the 19 men and three women, who were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh, and arrived safely  at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon. The news provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive. The unexplained release is reminiscent of ISIS' freeing of 200 elderly  Yazidi community members near Kirkuk in Iraq in January, which came after the hostages had been held for several months. Free: Members of Christian Assyrian community embrace their relatives after being released by ISIS . Safe: 19 men and three women were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh and arrived safely at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon . Release at last: News of the release provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive . Captured: The Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians and later published these photographs on its Facebook page . It is not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives but not more than 200 others . Both Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and the Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians. The later published photographs on its Facebook page that it said were taken in Hassakeh and appeared to show a crowd of people dressed in winter coats greeting the returnees. The photos appeared genuine, according to the Associated Press news agency. It was not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives. Saedi said all those released were around 50 years of age or older, which suggests age might have been a factor. Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, said all those released were around 50 years of age or older, which suggests age might have been a factor . The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown . Similar: The unexplained release is reminiscent of ISIS' freeing of 200 elderly Yazidi community members near Kirkuk in Iraq in January (pictured), which came after the hostages had been held for several months . The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims. Known as a jizya, the tax effectively forces Jew and Christians - so-called 'People of the Book' - to either pay a regular sum of protection money to the jihadis, or otherwise choose between forced conversion to Islam or brutal execution. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown. The fate of the more than 200 other Christian Assyrians still in ISIS' hands remains unclear. Prayers: An Assyrian Christian woman attends a mass in the Syrian capital Damascus yesterday in solidarity with the 220 people kidnapped from a string of villages along the Khabur River in Hassakeh last week . Service: Assyrian Christians attend a mass in solidarity with the people kidnapped last week . Displaced Assyrian women, who fled their homes due to ISIS attacks, take part in prayers at the Ibrahim al-Khalil Melkite Greek Catholic church in the Jaramana district on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus . Most of those kidnapped are believed to have been taken by fighters to Shaddadeh, located 30 miles south of Hassakeh. Assyrian leaders and Sunni tribal sheikhs have begun reaching out to ISIS to try to negotiate the release of the captives, activists said. 'We're trying to contact any party that might help. We're working through our friends the tribal sheikhs,' said Younan Talia, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization. 'Some friends of Daesh are trying to send messages.' Talia said there has been no response yet. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. Diminished: Some 30,000 Assyrian Christians lived in Syria before the start of the civil war in 2011 . Future: Syria's embattled Assyrian Christian community is one the world's oldest Christian groups . The Sweden-based director of the Assyrian Network for Human Rights in Syria, Osama Edward, also said efforts were underway to try to negotiate the captives' release. The abductions have added to fears among religious minorities in both Syria and Iraq, who have been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State group. During the militants' bloody campaign in both countries, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate, minorities have been repeatedly targeted and killed, driven from their homes, had their women enslaved and places of worship destroyed. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have released sickening footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria. Brutal: A man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad was seen being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range . Murder: A militant shoots Ahmed Muhammad once in the back of the head, before standing over him and firing several more bullets into his neck once he lies prone on the grass . Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. The sickening film is reminiscent of the gruesome video showing the burning to death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, in that it begins with a lengthy interview with the orange-jumpsuit wearing victim speaking while sat at a table in a darkened room.

"Scientists have discovered that there might be dark matter trapped inside the sun - and it could be  the solar interior. The bold new theory suggests that a form of the mysterious particle - which has yet to be directly observed - is absorbed by the sun from the centre of our galaxy. And once inside, it affects the movement of heat within our solar system's star - which could explain why scientists have struggled to explain 'pressure waves' inside the sun. Durham University scientists have proposed a new model for the sun. They say that dark matter may be transferring heat around its interior (artist's illustration shown). This would help explain how pressure waves move around the sun. Current models are insufficient to account for how they move . The theory was put forward by scientists from Durham University. They propose that so-called asymmetric dark matter (ADM) could explain some inconsistencies in the standard solar model. So far, the standard solar model has proved successful in calculating the sun’s density and temperature - but measuring 'pressure waves' in its interior has proved much more difficult. The sun is about 15 million Kelvin in temperature at its core, and 6,000 Kelvin at its surface. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. Pressure waves are produced as a result of activity on the solar surface. They are not entirely dissimilar to pressure waves - or P -waves - produced on Earth during an earthquake. It has previously been theorised that dark matter originating from elsewhere in the galaxy may have an affect on the sun - particularly its activity and even its structure. ‘Weakly-interacting dark matter from the galactic halo is captured when it passes through the sun,’ the researchers note in their paper. The dark matter becomes gravitationally trapped within the sun because it does not contain much antimatter. This means it is not destroyed when it interacts with other matter - so the sun likely has a steadily increasing amount of dark matter. And this same dark matter could be having more of an effect on the sun than previously thought. According to the researchers, dark matter (illustration shown) originates in the galactic halo of the Milky Way before passing through the sun - and in some instances, it becomes gravitationally trapped . Dark matter particles are thought to absorb energy in the hottest, central parts of the core. They then travel to different regions of the sun before scattering again and ‘re-depositing their energy,’ the researchers write. This reduces the central temperature and moves heat elsewhere. But this same effect also leads to lower nuclear fusion rates in the core, so the sun compensates by pumping more hydrogen into its core - keeping its luminosity constant. This has an effect of lowering the pressure towards the sun’s surface. 'To prove that this is really what is going on in the sun, we'd need to find a stable dark matter particle that interacts in this way with normal matter,' Dr Pat Scott from the Astrophysics group at  Imperial College London, who was involved in the research, told MailOnline. 'Either the next run of the Large Hadron Collider, or some of the next generation of direct searches for dark matter, should be able to find such a particle if it exists.' Pressure waves in the sun are produced as a result of activity on the solar surface, shown here in this illustration. Red and blue denote different directions for the waves. They are not entirely dissimilar to pressure waves - or P-waves - produced on Earth during an earthquake . ‘The structural changes in the core shift the balance between gravity and pressure elsewhere,’ say the researchers. This would explain why observations of pressure waves in the sun - namely how they move, and how heat is transported - do not match up with theories of solar behaviour. Another conclusions the scientists is that the type of dark matter in the sun is ‘asymmetric,’ as mentioned earlier, which means it contains very little antimatter. ‘The relative absence of antimatter means that the density of the sun’s dark matter is not decreased over time,’ notes Kathy Fey from The Space Reporter. ‘Their model relies on the assumption that it is the change in momentum during particle collisions between dark and normal matter that drive the nature of the interactions between particles. ‘The calculations produced by the team suggest that dark matter displaying this property would transfer large amounts of heat from the sun’s core to its surface.’ The researchers also note that their theory is consistent with predicted properties of dark matter that is being searched for with detectors on Earth and in space.","Durham University scientists have proposed a new model for the sun .

"A high-risk convicted sex offender with a history of preying on children and the elderly who fled Canada for Seattle in 2013 has been arrested in connection to the rape of a 69-year-old woman. Michael Stanley, 49, made headlines in October 2013 when he cut off an electronic-monitoring ankle bracelet and crossed the Canada-US border unchallenged. He's an American citizen, and US authorities said they had no reason to arrest him. Canada decided not to ask for his extradition, and he registered in Seattle as a Level 3 sex offender. Busted: Michael Stanley (pictured left and right), 49, was arrested Friday for a sexual assault involving an elderly woman. The sex offender made headlines in 2013 when he cut off a electronic monitoring bracelet and fled from Canada for Seattle . Vile crime: Stanley served 32 months for luring two mentally challenged boys into an apartment, lighting a crack pipe, blowing smoke in their faces and then sexually assaulting them . Stanley, formerly of Edmonton, had a criminal record in Canada that dated back 25 years. Before he fled, he had most recently served 32 months for luring two mentally challenged boys into an apartment, lighting a crack pipe, blowing smoke in their faces and then sexually assaulting them. Stanley spent nine years in prison in the 1980s for the aggravated sexual assault of a wheelchair-bound 82-year-old woman in Lethbridge, Canada, reported CBC.ca. Precedent: Stanley spent nine years in prison in the 1980s for the aggravated sexual assault of a wheelchair-bound 82-year-old woman . The 49-year-old ex-convict also has a history of kidnapping children from playgrounds. Parole board documents also described a case in which Stanley broke into a 69-year-old woman's apartment while she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The King County Sheriff's Office said he was arrested last Friday morning after entering the woman's home, in the Skyway neighborhood south of Seattle, through a window. No weapons were used, but the victim sustained what the sheriff's office described as minor injuries. Prior to that, authorities said, Stanley had been meeting his requirements as registered sex offender, including checking in weekly as required and providing an accurate account of where he was staying each night. Stanley, who is homeless, was being charged Monday and no court appearance was immediately scheduled, said Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's Office. He said prosecutors would request that bail be set at $1million. Stanley ran into trouble soon after arriving in Seattle in fall 2013. He was arrested on misdemeanor charges of harassment and resisting arrest after he threatened someone who asked him to be quiet. He was sentenced to seven months in jail.","Michael Stanley, 49, crossed the Canada-US border in 2013 after removing his electronic monitoring bracelet .

"She is rarely pictured without a beaming smile on her face as she goes about her royal duties. But yesterday the Duchess of Cambridge was showing the strain of keeping up with her busy schedule at almost eight months pregnant. She looked pale and tired, with fine lines on her forehead, as she left an exclusive London hotel, and, unusually, failed to offer onlookers even the briefest of grins. Nevertheless Kate, 33, still showed off her impeccable style in a floral print dress, matched with navy Alexander McQueen court shoes and an understated £255 Russell & Bromley Muse Suede Clutch.

We weren't expecting to see the Duchess of Cambridge today but here she is looking fresh as a daisy in a lovely floral print frock as she stepped out of the Goring Hotel. This spring-ready dress is by Erdem and is from the London based designer's Resort 2013 collection. So not only is Kate rocking one of the coolest high end labels around but she's still wearing regular fitting clothes, despite being seven months pregnant. How does she do it? With fans in Alexa Chung, Kate Bosworth and Keira Knightley, Erdem is now a regular feature on the red carpet and Kate's look today confirms just how into fashion she is. Styled with her favorite navy blue suede Alexander McQueen heels and a clutch by Stuart Weitzman, she's the picture of elegance. And what you can't see is that the dress has a cute cut out at the back. Gorgeous! Unfortunately it is no longer available to buy but if you click the link (right) you can take a look at the current collection at Net-a-Porter.

She looked remarkably svelte, displaying her neat baby bump in the £995 Erdem dress, which is not designed for pregnant women, as she left the lunchtime reception at the five-star Goring Hotel. Kate's lunchtime foray was not part of her official schedule and, according to Kensington Palace, the 33-year-old was attending in a private capacity, having received a personal invitation from the hotel. Today's visit is far from being the first time that the Duchess has spent time at the Goring. Last December, the hotel was the venue for a meeting of the board of the 1851 Trust, the sailing charity of which the Duchess is patron. She also stayed in the hotel, which is situated across the road from Buckingham Palace, in the run-up to the 2011 Royal Wedding along with her parents and siblings Pippa and James. Getting bigger: The Duchess, who is now seven months pregnant and is due to give birth in April, showed off a noticeably bigger bump . No coat: The Duchess was without a coat and chose to brave the cold in nothing more than her patterned silk dress . Other royals to love the London hotel include the Queen Mother who apparently considered it her favourite and used the Goring, which first opened its doors in 1910, as the venue for her last public appearance in 2002. Today's visit to the Goring Hotel was the Duchess' first public outing in two weeks, with her last official visit coming when she travelled to the Potteries in Stoke-on-Trent to tour the Emma Bridgewater factory. During that trip, during which she  wore a Seraphine dress, a SportMax coat and her trademark £395 Jimmy Choo satin shoes, the Duchess tried her hand at making plates and was declared a natural by local potters. She also used the occasion to visit the Action for Children Cape Hill Children's Centre in Smethwick, where she joined a group of youngsters who were trying their hand at crafts courtesy of a couple of old tin cans and some colourful feathers. The Duchess, an art fan herself, promptly rolled up her sleeves and got stuck in before declaring, as she made her way back to her waiting car: 'George would have loved this!' Prince George's father, the Duke of Cambridge, is currently touring China and spent his second evening in the country making a speech in Shanghai, following a historic meeting with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Private visit: The Duchess' visit to the Goring was not part of her official duties and was the result of a personal invitation from the hotel . Happy memories: It was at the Goring, which sits across the road from Buckingham Palace, that Kate spent her final night as a Middleton . On her way: After the lunchtime reception, the Duchess hopped back in her car and returned to Kensington Palace . President Xi, who is part of the Communist party leadership  once dubbed 'appalling old waxworks' by the Prince of Wales, gave William a warm welcome and also heaped praise on the rest of the Royal Family. The two men met in the imposing Great Hall of the People - home to the Chinese Congress - where the president talked of the royals' interest in his country and the positive contribution they have made to the relationship between China and the UK. Despite Prince Philip writing off Beijing as 'ghastly' during his 1986 royal tour of China, President Xi as also extended an open invitation to the Queen and her family, which, according to commentators, could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne. Afterwards, the Duke was driven to the Forbidden City, an imperial palace that was used by both Ming and Qing dynasties and takes up more than 180 acres of central Beijing. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, construction on the palace complex began in 1406 and it later became home to 25 different emperors as well as the spot where the last Emperor of China, Puyi, abdicated in 1912. The Duke then flew out of Beijing and on to the coastal city - and former British stronghold - of Shanghai, where he helped launch the GREAT Festival of Creativity, a government-inspired scheme intended to promote British business. On his travels: The Duke of Cambridge is currently touring China and made a speech in Shanghai at a festival promoting British business . Speech: The Duke spoke of the close links between the UK and China and his hope that the collaboration will continue in future . Innovation: He took the opportunity to speak about Britain's innovation in film, art and the media but also in education and healthcare . Colourful: The scene as the Duke arrived at the business festival was a colourful one thanks to the presence of flag waving dancers . In a speech made at the event, William described the festival as 'a showcase and celebration of the creative strength of the British economy and the ingenuity of the British people.' 'It is a platform not only for our famed and still thriving creative sectors, such as film, art and media,' he continued. 'But it is also a platform for the creativity and inventiveness that British firms apply in a wide variety of sectors, like healthcare and education.' The Duke also took the opportunity thank President Xi for his 'warm welcome' and put his knowledge of Mandarin to use, opening the speech with 'Nushimen, Xianshengmen, wan shang hao' which translates as 'Ladies and gentlemen, good evening'. 'This is my first time in China,' he added. 'But less than 24 hours into my first visit, I have a strong sense of the opportunity that exists for collaboration and partnership between our two countries. 'This morning in Beijing as I was warmly welcomed by President Xi in the Great Hall of the People before visiting the Forbidden City, I was given the chance to appreciate first-hand that China and Britain are united in our experience as countries with a proud and ancient history.' William's visit, which comes immediately after a four-day trip to Japan, will continue for another two days with the Duke due to see more of Shanghai and the southern city of Jinghong before flying home. Meeting the locals: William visited the Shija Hutong Museum where he was introduced to vulnerable children being helped by Chinese charities . Historic: William was also given a guided tour of the magnificent Forbidden City in Beijing before flying to Shanghai . Warm welcome: Despite his father's 1997 description of the Communist leadership as being 'old waxworks', William got a warm reception . All smiles: The Duke enjoyed a friendly meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing . Visit: The Duke, pictured with Chinese deputy president Li Yuanchao, was asked to pass on an invitation to visit to the Queen .","The Duchess of Cambridge was at the Goring Hotel's 105th birthday celebration this lunchtime .

"A man accused of fatally shooting three people at Jewish sites in Kansas declared 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed after the attacks, a police officer who was at the scene testified on Monday. Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish. Scroll down for video . Wheelchair: Frazier Glenn Miller is accused of killing three victims during shootings at a Jewish community center and nearby retirement home in Kansas. The shootings happened on the eve of Passover . Illness: Miller, of Aurora, Missouri, has emphysema and was seen in court on Monday in a wheelchair and using an oxygen tube to help breathe . Mugshot:  Miller, a white supremacist pictured here in April 2014, allegedly declared 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed after the attacks . Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified Monday at a preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to put Miller, of Aurora, Missouri, on trial. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty. Ingram said he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed, the court in Olathe, Kansas, heard.

Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller is accused of killing two people at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. The victims were Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood . A third victim, Terri LaManno, 53, was visiting her mother when she was shot and killed allegedly by Miller at the Village Shalom retirement center nearby . In several phone calls to The Associated Press, Miller said he thought he was dying and felt he was fulfilling a patriotic duty by killing Jews. He regretted shooting the teenager, who he said looked older. This is not the first time Miller has had a run-in with the police. After a nationwide manhunt for the white supremacist in 1987, federal agents found him and three other men at a rural Missouri home stocked with hand grenades and automatic weapons. Miller was indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder. He served three years in federal prison. Miller also ran for the U.S. House in 2006 and the U.S. Senate in 2010 in Missouri, each time espousing a white-power platform.

"A Canadian tourist with several previous child sex convictions has been sentenced to seven years in Nepal prison for sexually abusing a boy. Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, a businessman from the province of Nova Scotia, was also ordered to pay $10,000 to the victim by the judge in his ruling on Sunday, according to Lalitpur District Court. MacIntosh lured the boy, who has only one arm, to his hotel room in Lalitpur, a suburb south of the capital, Kathmandu, and repeatedly molested him, according to the Globe and Mail. Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, a businessman from the province of Nova Scotia, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Nepal for sexually molesting a boy (above Nepalese police escorting MacIntosh to his final hearing on Sunday) He arrived in Nepal on a tourist visa in August 2014 and was a frequent visitor to the children's shelter where the boy lived, and also gave the child promises of paying for a prosthetic arm while also offering him gifts and money. MacIntosh was detained by the police in December after the victim filed a complaint with police. Details of the victim were not given because he is a minor. MacIntosh previously faced 17 child sex offense convictions  after being accused of sexually abusing boys in the 1970s, and the allegations surfaced in 1995, when he was living in India. However, he was not extradited until 2007 and the first of his two trials in Nova Scotia did not start until 2010. The 17 sex-related convictions against him, involving three boys, were overturned in April 2013. He was also ordered to pay $10,000 to the victim who he repeatedly molested at his hotel . Bob Martin, 57, one of six men who led to the Nova Scotia convictions said Nepalese officials finally brought a serial child predator to justice. He said: 'It's deplorable, even embarrassing, that a foreign country has to make up for the inadequacies of the Canadian justice system.' Police are investing to discover if there were any other minors involved.

"Myer boss Bernie Brookes is stepping down after almost nine years in charge, as Australia’s largest department store chain pushes to modernise its business. The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, who joined the retail company in June 2006, resigned as Myer promised to ‘adapt more quickly and be closer to its customers’ after a drop in share prices last year. In an executive shake-up that will see Myer’s Chief Information and Supply Chain Officer Richard Umbers take over Brookes’ role, the chain said in a statement: ‘It is appropriate for a new CEO to be given the opportunity to own, lead and drive the transformation program over the coming years.’ ‘It has become clear that to thrive in a modern retail environment, Myer must adapt more quickly and be closer to its customers,’ Myer Chairman, Mr Paul McClintock AO, said. Scroll down for video . Myer boss Bernie Brookes is resigning after almost nine years in charge . Richard Umbers has been promoted as Myer's next CEO and posed at the company's HQ in Melbourne today . ‘A strategic review has been ongoing for some time, with a view to reshaping the business for a profitable, sustainable future. ‘Already in his time at Myer, Richard has demonstrated that he is a contemporary retailer with the clear ability to reshape Myer in a new retail landscape,’ Mr McClintock said. The retail giant will pay Umbers $1.2 million annually and he will also be eligible for performance-based bonuses. Umbers, who trained as an engineer in the British army, joined Myer in September 2014 after previously holding executive positions at Australia Post and Woolworths. In September last year, Myer shares fell 19 per cent, reducing more than $262 million from its market capitalisation. The share dive came after Myer’s release of its full-year results and its profit guidance for 2015. UBS analyst Ben Gilbert told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time that he predicted a ‘sell’ on Myer. ‘Despite putting on a brave face, [the] fiscal 2014 result showed that Myer is struggling and having to spend more to stand still,’ he said. Jennifer Hawkins (C) and models walk the finale during the Myer A/W 2015 Season Launch at Myer Mural Hall on February 12, 2015 in Melbourne . Model Jennifer Hawkins acts as a brand ambassador for the department store chain . ‘We believe Myer management are doing a good job but face numerous challenges that pose a significant threat to future earnings.’ Mr Gilbert listed the threats to Myer's business as new competition in the market such as Uniqlo, Sephora and H&M, the falling Australian dollar and rising costs. Announcing his resignation, Mr Brookes said: ‘Myer is a fantastic company with an iconic brand and legacy that I remain incredibly passionate about. While there is no doubt that there are many challenges facing the business, I do believe Myer has a strong future ahead of it. ‘After almost nine years, the time is now right for me to pass on the reins to the next leader to take the business forward.

"Ann Summers has been forced to remove raunchy Fifty Shades of Grey-style posters from its windows following a backlash from mothers and campaigners. The high street lingerie chain confirmed several branches, located near stores targeted at children such as Mothercare and Build-A-Bear, have removed the provocative images. The posters, which were rolled out in all 142 Ann Summers stores several weeks ago, show a woman kneeling on a red sofa, dressed in a cut-away leotard that reveals her breasts and nipple tassels. She is holding a large leather whip and striking a provocative pose next to a handcuffed man in his underpants. Ann Summers has been forced to remove raunchy Fifty Shades of Grey-style posters showing a woman wearing nipple tassels and holding a whip . Mothers and campaigners have complained saying the the 'pornographic' images could be easily seen by children . In what appears to be a reference to the bondage film Fifty Shades of Grey, which was released nationwide during Valentine's weekend, the text on the poster reads: Fact not fiction. Bring the film to life. Last night Vivienne Pattison of campaign group Mediawatch-UK said her group had made complaints about nine branches of Ann Summers. As a result the posters, which have been described as pornographic, have been removed from stores in Milton Keynes, Wimbledon, Sutton, Norwich, Eastbourne, Taunton, and the Ann Summers stores in all 18 Intu Chapelfield shopping centres. A spokesman for Ann Summers confirmed the company has had six complaints from its retail stores and fewer than 20 complaints via email or letters. Miss Pattison said the campaign potentially breached the recommendations made by the 2011 Bailey Review into the sexualisation of children, which was backed by Prime Minister David Cameron. The high street lingerie chain confirmed several branches, located near stores targeted at children such as Mothercare and Build-A-Bear, have removed the provocative images . The posters show a woman kneeling on a red sofa, dressed in a cut-away leotard, with a man in handcuffs . She said: 'We are used to seeing the windows of Ann Summers featuring lingerie but this image, featuring a bare breasted (except for nipple tassels) model goes too far and is inappropriate for display in places which are likely to have numbers of children present. 'Any child passing this image will be subject to its overt sexual messaging and imagery. Government guidelines for retailers in the Bailey Review state that sexualised images should not be displayed in children's eye line. 'This government has done much to address the early sexualisation of children in our society and Ann Summers needs to be made aware that it too has a responsibility in this regard.' Miss Pattison's concerns were echoed by members of the public, including Christian pastor Paul Burns, who said he was shocked to see the display on his way to church. He said: 'I watched four separate families pull their children away from this window display. It has whips, it has a woman basically degraded with what you would expect to see in a porn film that people buy to watch. It is not what you expect to see in a family shopping centre.' Taking to Twitter, others expressed similar views, with one writing: 'Please remove your offensive window displays based on 50Shades of Grey, sexualising children, inciting abuse of women.' Another tweeted: 'Awful display in @Ann_Summers exposing children to sexualised imagery opposite @mothercareuk.' A spokesman for Ann Summers said: 'Our Dark Desires campaign launched on 26th January 2015. Therefore, our campaign imagery has been visible in both our stores and online for a number of weeks now but it's only this week that we have received a handful of complaints. 'In regards to the 50SOG references, the 'Bring the film to life', we have taken inspiration from the themes and trends surrounding the film and the wording is a tongue-in-cheek 'nod to'.'","Ann Summers has been forced to remove raunchy Fifty Shades posters .

The diminutive Mikulski, seen standing on a box behind a Senate podium, castigated Republicans on Feb. 24 for refusing to pass a Homeland Security funding bill without a string attached that would de-fund the persident's executive actions on immigration . Mikulski, a tough, no-nonsense lawmaker who rose to the leadership of the powerful Appropriations Committee, became the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress in 2012. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and has served in the Senate since 1987. She said that when her term has ended, 'I will know that I will have given it my best shot.' Her retirement is certain to set off a race among potential candidates to succeed her, including Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, and former Govs. Martin O'Malley, who is considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Republican Bob Ehrlich. She becomes the second Senate Democratic woman to announce her retirement this year, following Barbara Boxer of California. In a 2014 interview, Mikulski said her approach as chair of the Appropriations panel was 'to focus with civility and courtesy. Old school values. Don't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press.' In her state, she has been fiercely protective of the environment, especially Chesapeake Bay issues. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described Mikulski at the time as forceful and results-oriented. 'I think she's terrific,' he said. Mikulski had been seen as more engaging and approachable than her predecessors as appropriations chairman, the late Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Daniel Inouye, Hawaii, both Democrats. She had spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties, learning their needs and end goals. After a short tenure as chairman, she now is the top Democrat on the panel after Republicans captured control of the Senate in last November's elections. 'She knows that if you know somebody and what they want, you can help them be successful. And when you help people be successful, Republicans or Democrats, that's how you move bills,' said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Mikulski protege. Mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women. The Maryland senator sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill in an April 2014 floor showdown. 'When I hear all these phony reasons, some are mean and some are meaningless, I do get emotional,' Mikulski said of arguments against the legislation. 'I get angry. I get outraged. I get volcanic.' Mikulski played off former CIA Director Michael Hayden's recent comment that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, was motivated by 'emotional feeling' when she sought an investigation of the spy agency's harsh treatment of terrorism suspects .","Mikulski is a Maryland native who bas been in Congress since 1976 and a senator since 1987 .

"A homeless Marine who died of terminal cancer received his dying wish to be buried in a uniform he could never afford to own. Donnie Loneman, 59, had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade when doctors gave him three weeks to live. Loneman, who had loved being a Marine, asked for three things: to be buried in dress blues, with a 'high and tight' Marine haircut and a corps flag for his casket. Scroll down for video . Donnie Loneman, a homless Marine who had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade, requested that he be buried in dress blues after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer . Loneman, 59, also asked to be given a Marine 'high and tight' haircut and to be buried with the corps flag . The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair Medical Center put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. A flag and the dress blues were donated, and the foundations also paid for Loneman's funeral expenses and gave him an honor guard for his burial, according to KOCO-TV. Loneman, who was Native American, was beloved by the local veteran affairs organization, who knew him to have 'a good heart' and a 'great sense of humor'. 'We get guys like him once in a blue moon, who really make a difference for everyone here,' said Christine Cleary, who worked with the medical center. The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. His funeral was also paid for and he received an honor guard for his burial . Even as the organization fought to get Loneman off the street, he would say the aid should be given to a veteran who needed more help than him. As one friend recalled in a letter, Loneman had grit. When she worried about him living out in the cold he simply responded that Marines are tough. 'We can take it,' she recalled him saying. 'We can take anything.' Loneman wasn't even afraid of death. He told Cleary he was happy because he knew he was going to heaven, where he would get to see his mother and the Marines. 'He said ""I'm going to enter the gates, and I'm going to tell all the Marines that are standing there that they're relieved of their duty, and I'm going to take their place""', Cleary recalled him saying. 'And I'll stand there until my arm gets tired, and another Marine comes.'

"President Obama is alleged to have stopped an Israeli military attack against Iran's nuclear facilities in 2014 by threatening to shoot down Israeli jets before they could reach their targets, according to reports to emerge from the Middle East at the weekend . The threat from the U.S. forced Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to abort a planned attack on Iraq, reported Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida. Netanyahu will be in Washington for an address to Congress on Tuesday aimed squarely at derailing Obama's cherished bid for a diplomatic deal with Tehran. Scroll down for video . President Obama is alleged to have thwarted an Israeli military attack against Iran's nuclear facilities in 2014 by threatening to shoot down Israeli jets before they could reach their targets . For six years, President Obama and Netanyahu have been on a collision course over how to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, a high-stakes endeavor both men see as a centerpiece of their legacies. The Netanyahu government took the decision to strike Iran last year after discovering that the U.S. and Iran were involved in secret talks over Iran's nuclear program and were about to sign an agreement in that regard behind Israel's back. The report claimed that an unnamed Israeli minister who has good ties with the US administration revealed the attack plan to Secretary of State John Kerry, and that Obama then threatened to shoot down the Israeli jets before they could reach their targets in Iran. According to the report, 'Netanyahu and his commanders agreed after four nights of deliberations to task the Israeli army's chief of staff, Benny Gantz, to prepare a qualitative operation against Iran's nuclear program. 'In addition, Netanyahu and his ministers decided to do whatever they could do to thwart a possible agreement between Iran and the White House because such an agreement is, allegedly, a threat to Israel's security.' For six years, President Obama and Netanyahu have been on a collision course over how to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, a high-stakes endeavor both men see as a centerpiece of their legacies . The sources added that Gantz and his commanders prepared the requested plan and that Israeli fighter jets trained for several weeks in order to make sure the plans would work successfully. Israeli fighter jets reportedly even carried out experimental flights in Iran's airspace after they managed to break through radars. Stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb has become a defining challenge for both Obama and Netanyahu, yet one they have approached far differently. For Obama, getting Iran to verifiably prove it is not pursuing nuclear weapons would be a bright spot in a foreign policy arena in which numerous outcomes are uncertain and would validate his early political promise to negotiate with Iran without conditions. Netanyahu considers unacceptable any deal with Iran that doesn't end its nuclear program entirely and opposes the diplomatic pursuit as one that minimizes what he considers an existential threat to Israel. Tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and exists only to produce energy for civilian use. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was forced to abort a planned attack on Iraq after the U.S. threatened to shoot down Israeli jets . 'Through scaremongering, falsification, propaganda and creating a false atmosphere even inside other countries, (Israel) is attempting to prevent peace,' Iran's top nuclear negotiator said on Saturday in Tehran. 'I believe that these attempts are in vain and should not impede reaching a (nuclear) agreement,' said Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. U.S. and Iranian officials reported progress in the latest talks on a deal that would freeze Tehran's nuclear program for 10 years, but allow it to slowly ramp up in the final years of the accord. Obama has refused to meet Netanyahu during his visit, with the White House citing its policy of not meeting with foreign leaders soon before their elections. Vice President Joe Biden and Kerry will both be out of the country on trips announced only after Netanyahu accepted the GOP offer to speak on Capitol Hill. The prime minister is scheduled to speak on Monday at AIPAC's annual policy conference. The Obama administration will be represented at the event by U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and national security adviser Susan Rice, who criticized Netanyahu's plans to address Congress as 'destructive' to the U.S.-Israeli relationship. The Iran dispute has spotlighted rifts in a relationship that has been frosty from the start. Obama and Netanyahu lack any personal chemistry, leaving them with virtually no reservoir of goodwill to get them through their policy disagreements. Activists rally and protest outside Fox News Building on 6th Ave and 48th St to protest the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to address Congress on Tuesday . Within months of taking office, Obama irritated Israel when, in an address to the Arab world, he challenged the legitimacy of Jewish settlements on Palestinian-claimed land and cited the Holocaust as the justification for Israel's existence, not any historical Jewish tie to the land. The White House was furious when Netanyahu's government defied Obama and announced plans to construct new housing units in East Jerusalem while Biden was visiting Israel in 2010. Additional housing plans that year upended U.S. efforts to restart peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians. The tension between Obama and Netanyahu was laid bare in an unusually public manner during an Oval Office meeting in 2011. In front of a crowd of journalists, the prime minister lectured Obama at length on Israel's history and dismissed the president's conditions for restarting peace talks. Later that year, a microphone caught Obama telling his then-French counterpart in a private conversation that while he may be fed up with Netanyahu, 'You are sick of him, but I have to work with him every day.' Despite suspecting that Netanyahu was cheering for his rival in the 2012 presidential campaign, Obama tried to reset relations with the prime minister after his re-election. He made his first trip as president to Israel and the two leaders went to great lengths to put on a happy front, referring to each other by their first names and touring some of the region's holy sites together. An anti-Israel demonstrators wearing masks bearing the likeness of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and holding up 'bloody' hands in a protest outside the Washington Convention Center on Sunday . The healing period was to be short-lived. Another attempt at Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed. Israeli officials were withering in their criticism of Kerry, who had shepherded the talks, with the country's defense minister calling him 'obsessive' and 'messianic.' The Obama administration returned the favor last summer with its own unusually unsparing criticism of Israel for causing civilian deaths when war broke out in Gaza. The U.S. and Israel have hit rocky patches before. The settlement issue has been a persistent thorn in relations, compounded by profound unhappiness in Washington over Israeli military operations in the Sinai, Iraq and Lebanon during the Ford, Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations that led those presidents to take or consider direct punitive measures. Yet through it all, the United States has remained Israel's prime benefactor, providing it with $3 billion a year in assistance and defending it from criticism at the United Nations and elsewhere. 'We have brought relations back in the past and we will do it again now because at the end of the day they are based on mutual interests,' said Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and informal adviser to Netanyahu. 'The interests of Israel and the U.S. are similar and sometime identical and I think that is what will determine in the end and not feelings of one kind or another.'","President Obama is alleged to have thwarted an Israeli military attack against Iran's nuclear facilities in 2014 .

"Ukip's rise in popularity has been built on railing against rising immigration numbers . But Nigel Farage has conceded foreigners have brought one benefit to Britain: The food has improved. In an interview apparently designed to soften his image, the Ukip leader admitted he would 'not be very good' as Prime Minister and revealed how the pressure of fronting the party of 'DIY politics' means he does not have a normal family life. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage today admitted he would 'not be very good' as Prime Minister . Mr Farage is hoping to make big gains in the election on May 7, with some predicting Ukip could hold the balance of power. But while David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg slug it out to argue they should be in power, Mr Farage admitted he probably is not up to the job. When asked whether he would make a good Prime Minister, he told confessed: 'I don't think that's my role in life, I don't think I'd be very good at it either.' In an attempt to appear less reactionary than in previous media appearances, he tried to find the positive in a range of issues, including migration. He argued that for years British cuisine was dire and there were few good restaurants, but the arrival of chefs from around the world had transformed the nation's dining. He said: 'Just look at the food, I am just about old enough to remember when it was awful and going out was actually quite difficult.' But he could not resist making a political point, adding: 'If you control immigration sensibly and do it properly it can be a benefit to the country and it can enrich the culture too, no arguments about that.' He used a highly-personal interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain to show a more human side, and revealed the impact of politics on his family life and his relationship with his wife Kirsten. 'Ukip has been a DIY political party, I mean most of us have never been involved in politics before,' he said. The TV interview appeared designed to present a softer side to Mr Farage, with him seen walking wistfully along a beach in the shadow of the White Cliffs of Dover . As a result, politics caused problems in his marriage to first wife Grainne, which ended in divorce in 1997. He said: 'I was, I had been married once before and it didn't end very well but then that's life isn't it, we have our ups and downs in life. 'Politics had begun to impinge and that did not help. Of that there is no question at all.' His second wife Kirsten revealed last week how she has to stay at home and look after their children because her husband's job running Ukip means she is effectively a single mother. German-born Mrs Farage revealed that her husband did not even know where basic household equipment was kept. 'He just called me and asked where do we keep the ironing board as he needed to iron his shirt,' she said. 'I'm not that surprised. It is a bit worrying.' Today Mr Farage said his wife was 'somebody who was completely honest, with no particular side, who said pretty frankly what she thought and how she saw things and I quite liked that'. He went on: 'I mean to be honest with you, I think my whole family would rather I had never gone into politics, I'd stayed doing what I was doing, I can't even pretend to have a normal family relationship at this moment in time because I don't.' Asked about regrets in life, he said: 'I've thought about that a lot, I've thought a lot about that question and I think, frankly, if you do have regrets and if those regrets bother you, then you are not living now are you?' ITV said Mr Farage had chosen the location himself, because it was symbolic of his beliefs about Britain;s relationship with the rest of Europe .

"Thieves who target wealthy department stores should get lighter sentences than if they steal from a corner shop, a senior Labour MP claims today. David Lammy, an ex-Government minister and barrister, said the likes of luxury goods shop Fortnum and Mason could more easily absorb the loss. The London mayoral candidate wants the law to be changed so the seriousness of shoplifting is decided by the impact on the victim – rather than the monetary value of the item stolen. But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson today condemned the 'absurd' idea, insisting it was wrong to 'minimise shoplifting from swish, posh shops'. London Mayoral hopeful David Lammy says thieves who target wealthy department stores should get lighter sentences than if they steal from a corner shop . Experts also warned it would make shoplifters more likely to target supermarkets. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘Labour’s justice policies are pretty thin on the ground at the best of times, but this latest contribution hardly seems a sensible one. ‘All forms of stealing are wrong – and suggesting that some people are better able to afford being the victim of it sends all the wrong sorts of messages.’ Mr Johnson branded Mr Lammy's comments ‘absurd’. He told LBC radio: 'If he is seriously saying that we should discount or minimise shoplifting from swish, posh shops then I think he is totally wrong because it is a crime wherever it is committed. 'It’s important to crack down on it. Tesco’s have got oodles of money – or actually slightly less than they used to – but it doesn’t mean it’s right to nick stuff from anywhere. 'That’s why we are cracking down on burglary and shoplifting.' Currently, the law decides what constitutes a ‘serious’ shoplifting offence on the basis of an item’s value. In a pamphlet for the Policy Exchange think-tank, Tottenham MP Mr Lammy says: ‘The impact of a £150 theft, for example, would be far greater on an independent corner shop than on Fortnum & Mason, yet this is not reflected under the current Act. ‘It is self-evident that the impact of a £200 theft to a large retailer is much smaller that it would be to a small, independent retailer. 'Many rightly argue that the seriousness of shoplifting should not be based on the value, but on the impact to the victim.’ Less impact: The London mayoral candidate believes thieves should receive more lenient punishments for stealing from stores such as Fortnum & Mason than from corner shops . Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson today condemned the 'absurd' idea, insisting it was wrong to 'minimise shoplifting from swish, posh shops'. The idea will prove hugely controversial as, for the first time, it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing. Critics warn it is a slippery slope which might lead to other crimes – such as burglary – being added to the list. But Mr Lammy, whose constituency was hit by rioting in 2011, insists: ‘As with most types of property crime, the social costs of shoplifting are regressive – they hit poorest communities hardest. Mr Lammy's idea will prove hugely controversial as, for the first time, it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing . ‘Small local businesses in more deprived areas, operating on small profit/loss margins, are least able to absorb the costs of theft and are obliged to pass these costs on to their customers through increased prices.’ David Green, a criminologist and director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘What any sensible legal system is doing is weighing up the degree of moral responsibility of the person who perpetrated the act. ‘It is completely wrong to punish someone more severely because they stole from a poor person than if they stole from a supermarket. ‘It would encourage people to steal from supermarkets rather than elsewhere because they would know they would get a lighter sentence.’ Mr Lammy’s Policy Exchange report, which will be launched at a speech in London today, warns the police and the courts are turning a blind eye to property crime. Some one in three burglaries and nine in ten shoplifting incidents are not reported to the police because the victims have no faith the case will be properly dealt with. John Munroe, of the British Retail Consortium, said: ‘Any suggestion a crime against a retailer or staff should be treated any differently because of the type of store, or the place it’s in, is absolutely nonsensical. ‘Retailers are at the heart of every community, whether that’s a high-end shop in Knightsbridge or one in David Lammy’s constituency of Tottenham. ‘Crimes against them are not victimless, they have a direct impact on the local community. Wherever the crime takes place, shoplifters should be persecuted as they normally would be.’ Shoplifting has been repeatedly downgraded in seriousness by the authorities over the past decade. The process began when Labour announced that, where the items stolen were worth less than £200, the offender could escape with an £80 on-the-spot fine instead of going to court. In many cases, the offenders simply don’t bother to pay.","David Lammy believes law should be changed to consider impact of theft .

"Inhaling deeply, the BBC’s ex-royal correspondent tries cannabis as part of a TV experiment examining the effects of types of the drug on the brain. In another scene Jennie Bond, 64, is seen giggling and talking about how much she loves eating grapes after experimenting with hash. A trailer for tonight’s programme asks: ‘Has Jennie got the munchies?’ Scroll down for videos . Jennie Bond, who worked as the BBC's royal correspondent for 14 years, inhaled potent 'skunk' cannabis as part of a six-month scientific experiment for a new Channel 4 programme called Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial . The 64-year-old mother said she didn't like the experience of taking cannabis but 'certainly didn't hate it' Yesterday critics and experts accused Channel 4 of turning Drugs Live: Cannabis On Trial into little more than a stunt designed to boost ratings and glamorise the Class B drug. The programme sees 22 volunteers including Miss Bond, presenter Jon Snow and former Tory MP Matthew Parris take two sorts of cannabis – hash and high-strength skunk – plus a placebo. Each has tests including a brain scan, while changes to their mood, memories and emotions are monitored. Professor David Nutt, 63, who was sacked as the Government’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and nicotine, will appear as an expert, with University College London professor Val Curran. Professor Nutt’s charity DrugScience contributed funding towards the Channel 4 trial. She could be seen giggling with researchers at University College London where the six-month trial took place . Mary Brett, chairman of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Skunk is a dreadful drug and it is very irresponsible to have a show with such biased experts. It will be a platform for Professor Nutt to peddle what he thinks about drugs to an audience of young people.’ Julia Manning, chief executive of independent think-tank 2020 Health, said: ‘What I don’t think we should be doing is encouraging experimentation with substances when there is no doubt these substances have significant side-effects. This is not about science, it’s about viewing figures. The legislation we have seems to be deterring drug taking so why do we need to open the Pandora’s box and encourage more experimentation? ‘It’s glamorising and trivialising the issue.’ Snow, 67, who was given a brain scan after trying the drug, said: ‘I’ve worked in war zones, but I’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as I was when I was in the MRI scanner after taking skunk. I would never do it again.’ The scientific experiment, which has been approved by the Home Office, is being documented to try and demonstrate the effects potent 'skunk' cannabis has on the brain. Ms Bond said the drug made her feel 'floaty' In the footage, Ms Bond can be seen discussing her love of red grapes after inhaling the potent cannabis . But critics were concerned the programme would not show the long-term impact of cannabis use. Fay Watson, secretary general of Europe Against Drugs, said: ‘Placing someone into a MRI scanner when they are under the influence may be useful to assess the immediate impacts of cannabis, but it’s not going to demonstrate the long-term harms people are most concerned about. ‘Cannabis use is associated with a wide range of negative side-effects such as anxiety, psychotic episodes, depression, cancer, stroke, as well as IQ decline in young people.’ Cannabis, the most widely used illegal drug in Britain, has been linked to long-term mental health problems including schizophrenia, and is known to cause anxiety and paranoia. Users also find it difficult to concentrate. Skunk is a potent form of cannabis that now dominates 80 per cent of the British market. Some believe it is far more addictive than other forms of cannabis and can provoke paranoid episodes, psychotic symptoms and memory loss. Ms Bond (pictured with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) worked as the BBC's royal correspondent for 14 years . Broadcaster Jon Snow (pictured) also took part in the scientific experiment which was Government-approved . Channel 4 said Professor Nutt, a Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, and Professor Curran ‘are two of the world’s leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain’. A spokesman said the pair had ‘collaborated on this ethically approved six-month cannabis trial at UCL. ‘[They] will describe the chemicals in cannabis that are responsible for the effects seen in the brain. They will explain how they differ between the two forms of the drug, as well as looking at the risks and the potentially positive effects of cannabis.’ The spokesman added: 'It is absolutely not the case that the programme or scientific trial encourage people to take cannabis or glamorise it – they are giving people the facts. 'Anyone seeing the video of Jon Snow taking ""skunk"" in the trial will understand the potentially negative effects of the drug.' Mr Snow said that smoking the more potent cannabis 'outstripped anything' he had previously experienced . Jennie Bond (pictured) took part in the experiment for C4 programme Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial . I've been asked to do some pretty strange things in my time. Being buried in a coffin full of rats is just one of them. But I'm always up for a challenge, so when I was asked to take part in a drugs trial for Channel 4, I decided it would be both interesting and informative. The purpose of the trial was to show how skunk - the most common form of cannabis now sold on the streets - affects the brain and behaviour compared to weaker forms of cannabis. I was to be one of a number of volunteers to undergo the trial at University College London under the guidance of one of the world's leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain, Professor Val Curran. I smoked a bit of cannabis as a student at University. I enjoyed the mellowing effect, the relaxation and sometimes the uncontrollable giggling. So the idea of taking skunk didn't frighten me and I was intrigued to see how it differed from the weaker cannabis I used to smoke. I turned up for day one of the trial feeling nervous...mainly about how to inhale the stuff, as I gave up smoking more than thirty years ago. There was also the added twist of not knowing what I was taking. The trial was to be conducted over three separate days and I would be given skunk, low potency hash and a placebo. But I wasn't told - and still do not know - which I was given on each occasion. The first thing to say is that it wasn't in the least like the old days... lying back on velvet cushions in a darkened room, smoking weed and listening to Jimi Hendrix! The laboratory conditions, the camera in your face and the prospect of inhaling what seemed like gallons of the stuff through a vaporiser and a huge plastic bag was far from relaxing. It felt harsh in my throat and I had to inhale two whole bags of it. It smelled like cannabis and I felt a little dizzy. But, as I got used to the procedure, I felt no dramatic effects and decided this must be the placebo, which was rather disappointing. The next part of the experiment was to undergo a full MRI scan of the brain. Luckily I'm not claustrophobic (especially after being buried in a coffin in 'I'm A Celebrity') and find medical procedures fascinating. So,spending an hour in the scanner didn't bother me at all. In fact it was rather restful. During the scan I was asked to do a lengthy series of observation and memory tests. There was also a musical appreciation test, which struck me as rather odd but not too taxing. I felt fine, not at all stoned and I rather enjoyed the whole experience. The scientists were very encouraging, but I have no idea how well I did. I then had to inhale another huge bag of whatever it was and attempt another set of mental athletics. The tasks were straightforward enough: memorise a short report, select different coloured balls from jars you couldn't see, think of as many vegetables as possible. I was rubbish. I forgot almost the entire report, had no idea what I was doing with the balls and got fixated on vegetables beginning with the letter 'c' for some unknown reason. So was I stoned or just stupid? I still don't know - but I fear the latter! The second trial, a week, later, followed the same pattern. I felt I'd got better at inhaling and quite enjoyed the sweet smell. But, once again, I didn't feel particularly stoned. I suspected this was the cannabis of my University days. I do remember getting quite absurdly confused over the coloured balls test and finding it rather funny. And I was shocked that my blood pressure, normally quite low, had shot up to 150. Whatever I had taken clearly wasn't doing my body much good. When I arrived for my final trial, I was convinced I'd had the placebo and the cannabis...so this time it would be skunk. It seemed much harsher in my throat and I did feel quite stoned after the first two bags. It wasn't particularly pleasant; it made me rather dizzy but I also felt super relaxed. In the MRI scanner, the tests seemed no more difficult than before, but I had one hell of a job staying awake. After the third bag of whatever it was, I had an insatiable thirst and a love affair with a bunch of grapes! My memory was appalling again, but I don't think my concentration was badly affected. Once again, my blood pressure went through the roof. That scared me and made me realise just how dangerous drugs can be. I shall be intrigued to find out whether I was right about which substance I was given on each day. And it will be fascinating to see whether I was in fact a lot more stoned than I thought. It could be embarrassing!","Jennie Bond inhaled cannabis for experiment on Channel 4 documentary .

"A terrified woman who knew her sister-in-law had been murdered by their mother-in-law kept quiet about the crime for seven years because she was scared she would suffer the same fate. Sarbjit Athwal eventually found the courage to speak out about the so-called 'honour killing' and bring her murderous mother-in-law to justice. Now she has shared her story with the Crime and Investigation network show Britain's Darkest Taboos as she hopes her experience will encourage other victims trapped in violent marriages to speak out. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Sarbjit Athwal lived in fear of her murderous mother-in-law for years but finally spoke out . Sarbjit, now aged 45, was 19 when she had an arranged Sikh marriage and was sent to live with her new husband, Hardave, and his family in Hayes, Middlesex. She said she had no say in the decision and had huge reservations about her new family. 'I felt like I was being pressured and I had to think about my parents as well. I didn't want to let them down and I had to think about the honour or the shame I would bring to the family if I had said no. 'So, I accepted what was being offered and I said yes, and went ahead with it,' she explains. Sarbjit struggled to settle into her new home where her mother-in-law Bachan Athwal ruled the roost. 'Honour killing': Sarbjit, left, on her wedding day with her sister-in-law Surjit who was murdered by their mother-in-law and her husband when she tried to get a divorce . But she did find companionship in her new sister-in-law Surjit, 18, who was married to her husband's brother, Sukhdave. Both Surjit and Sarbjit were made to feel worthless and their lives were no longer their own. Sarbjit said: 'My role in the family after I got married was to cook and clean, take care of the family, take care of the extended family if they were coming round, cooking and cleaning and then accompanying our mother-in-law to other occasions. She was constantly in charge, and she did rule the house and she would tell us what to do instead of discussing it with us.' When Surjit and Sarbjit both had children, their mother-in-law took over their upbringing as well. Sarbjit recalls: 'There were times where we breastfeeding and she would look at us and she would say, ""‘the babies are not happy. Maybe we should put them on the bottle."" 'When we were out one day, I rushed home to feed my baby, and the baby was sleeping. I was going to wake her up and feed her, and she said, ""oh, I've already fed her."" 'That was really shocking for me. I really felt upset thinking, even that right has been taken away from me.' While Sarbjit felt powerless, her sister-in-law Surjit started rebelling against their treatment. She cut her hair, started wearing make-up and made new friends she started going out drinking with. Her husband and mother-in-law started beating her because they said such behaviour brought them shame - but Surjit remained defiant. She then told Sukhdave that she intended to leave him and wanted a divorce. Upon hearing this, Sarbjit said their mother-in-law was enraged and told her, 'your sister will have divorce over my dead body.' Sarbjit didn't realise quite how far Bachan would go to stop her daughter-in-law leaving her son until it was too late. Murderous matriarch: Bachan Athwal was jailed for life in 2007 for her part in Surjit's death . Bachan arranged for Surjit to go to India with her - but the young women never returned from the trip. Sarbjit said her sister-in-law had only gone because Bachan tricked her. She explains: 'My mother-in-law spoke to Surjit and said, ""before you have your divorce I want you to come to a family trip to India with me. I didn't want to go on my own, just come with me and meet the family out there. Do your duty as a daughter-in-law and then when you come back you can have your divorce.""' When Bachan returned from the two-week trip without Surjit, she and Sukhdave told Surjit's two children that their mother had run away and left them because she didn't love them. Sarbjit knew her sister-in-law would never do such a thing and confronted her mother-in-law. 'I kept saying, ""where's Surjit?"" She wouldn't speak at first. Then all of a sudden the power came back into her voice and she became that strong dominating woman again. She looked at me and said, ""Surjit's been taken care of."" 'She told me, ""Surjit was driven out in a jeep and Surjit was drugged, strangled and her body was thrown in the river.""' Sarbjit was shocked and horrified by the confession but she was too scared to go to the police and tell them what Bachan had told her. She now knew what her mother-in-law was capable of and was scared she or her children could be her next victim. She said: 'My normality was terror. A woman I once called my mum, she was actually a murderer.' For years, Sarbjit continued to live in fear and silence while Surjit's family tried to find out what happened to her. DCI Clive Driscoll, a senior investigator at the Metropolitan Police, took on the case after Surjit was reported missing by her family. But for years the case remained unsolved due to a lack of leads and no body. Sarbjit today, left, and right as a scared young bride forced into an arrange marriage at the age of 19 . It's only when Sarbjit finally realised that she must tell the truth that justice is served. After telling her parents what she knew, they arranged for her to meet DCI Driscoll. With the information Sarbjit supplied, he travelled to Punjab in India to try to find more evidence, advising Sarbjit to sit tight and not let Bachan and Sukdave know the police are on to them. Thanks to the people he met in India, who remembered Surjit's visit, and how her mother-in-law and husband tried to cover their tracks after her disappearance, he is finally able to piece together a picture of what happened to Surjit. He said: 'It is my view that Surjit was tricked into thinking she was going shopping. Along the way she was driven to an area close to the river. There she was strangled. Her gold was removed from her. She was then thrown into the river Ravi.' As the case grew stronger it was reported in the local press that the police had information that would soon lead to arrests. Bachan and Sukdave realise their crime could soon be discovered and Sarbjit could give evidence against them. So they decide to get rid of her too. Sarbjit reveals she was chilled to the bone when her mother-in-law told her, 'we're going to take a trip to India'. The mother has now trained as  PCSO as she wants to help others in need . 'I realised that I had to get out,' Sarbjit said she she fled to DCI Driscoll and urged him to arrest Bachan, and Sukhdave right away. In April 2007, the pair, then aged 70 and 43, were found guilty of murder following a long trial at Old Bailey, London, and jailed for life. Sarbjit said: 'After nine years we finally got justice. That felt good.' Now trying to rebuild her own life, Sarbjit lives with her children and has qualified as a PCSO as she wants to help the police stop similar cases happening again. She added: 'I want to set up my own charity and help other victims of similar situations, because I don't want them to go through what I did. 'I want to give the support and courage and help them get their voices to the police and seek justice. I know it's going to take time to get that but I've got to hope I can.'

"A father-of-six oral surgeon and his 21-year-old assistant were killed after their SUV fell from a bridge and into an icy creek in Texas. Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz were identified as the two passengers who died in the accident at Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, which happened around 9.30pm on Saturday. The car's driver, an unidentified woman, was injured but able to free herself from the vehicle and call for help. Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz, 21, were killed after the SUV they were riding in hit an icy patch and flipped into Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, Texas at 9.30pm on Saturday . Forth Worth Fire Department divers spent an hour trying to free Weinstein and Resendiz but  they were daunted by the freezing water, according to spokesman Lt. Michael Glynn. 'Within four to five minutes, they're very cold and having trouble functioning and coordinating their efforts,' he said. Glynn said that the temperature and darkness were the 'worst possible scenario' the divers could have had and that it was 'incredibly difficult' for them to operate in the conditions. Diver teams had to rotate every five minutes, according to the Dallas Morning News. Resendiz was eventually freed from the car, but passed away in the hospital.

Dive teams had to rotate every five minutes because the cold water impacted their ability to function and coordinate their efforts, according to a fire department spokesman . Firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free Weinstein from the vehicle. He died at the scene. Resendiz and Weinstein's cause of death was listed as drowning, with hypothermia and collision impact included as factors, according to WFAA-8. Weinstein's brother Loren said Robert and his two staff members were returning from Odessa, where they travel to every month to help other oral surgeons with high demand in the area. He said Robert's SUV hit a patch of ice on the way home and flipped into the creek. Glynn said Fort Worth police are still investigating what caused the accident but believe weather played a contributing factor. Resendiz and Weinstein's cause of death was listed as drowning, with hypothermia and collision impact included as factors . Dr. Charles Chilcoat, who worked with both Weinstein and Resendiz, said he was shocked to learn about their deaths. Chilcoat said Weinstein was 'like a brother to him', who traveled the world with his wife and was a 'mentor to me and a good friend', he told NBC DFW 5. He said Resendiz was a 'good kid' who was always helping him remain upbeat and optimistic. 'She'd say ""come on Dr. Chilcoat, we just have one more patient, you can get through it.""' 'She was just 21 years old, and that's so sad.'

"Karl Perryman allegedly stalked a female colleague after she spurned his advances, a court heard . A senior manager at an NHS hospital bombarded a female colleague with letters calling her a tart after she spurned his advances, a court heard today. The 'dark and spiteful' notes allegedly composed by head of complaints and legal services Karl Perryman, 52, accused Joanne O'Neill of cheating on her partner, dressing 'like a hooker' and 'sleeping her way to the top'. They also claimed the complaints manager had noisy sexual relations 'on hospital time' and warned ominously: 'You will reap what you sow.' A total of eight letters were sent to Miss O'Neill, her mother and other managers at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk. The letters began in December 2012 and were addressed to Ms O’Neill, her partner, her line manager, her mother and the human resources manager at the hospital. They were supposedly from an anonymous Christian woman who worked at the hospital and wanted to put a stop to the 'deplorable conduct' of Miss O'Neill and deputy director of ICT Michael Brown. But a jury was told they were all written by Perryman after Miss O'Neill rejected his attention and began a relationship with Mr Brown. Prosecutor Jude Durr said: 'These letters had dark and spiteful undertones. All concerned rank, status, sex, lying, cheating, flirting, dressing inappropriately and reaping what you sow. 'By the time she made a statement… these letters had already had a significant effect on her life. 'She felt genuinely frightened that she was being watched every time she attended a meeting or saw a colleague in the corridor. It was also affecting her home life. 'She didn't at that stage have any idea who could be so vindictive and hateful. The invasion of her personal, professional and private life caused a real devastating fear of escalation.' Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told. But Perryman is said to have called her afterwards to say he was 'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'. A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave. The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift. He then sent a friend request on Facebook under the name Earnest Jones, which she declined. Perryman was head of complaints and legal services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) in King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he allegedly bombarded colleague Joanne O'Neill with letters . At the time, her relationship with partner Phillip Twite, 39, was breaking down and she had begun a friendship with line manager Mr Brown. The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff. It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses… they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.' Two letters were sent to Mr Twite's home the following month in which the author claimed to have heard Miss O'Neill and Mr Brown having sex 'with my own ears'. One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians… one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.' A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage. It warned: 'You will reap what you sow… we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.' Another letter she received had biblical references and described her as 'Jo Jo Judas', while one to her mother, Margaret Titmarsh, claimed she had told people her father had sexually abused her. Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him. 'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde. King's Lynn Crown Court (pictured) heard Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital . 'He said if I went against him he would destroy me, destroy my credibility and my career. It's worked because I've moved hundreds of miles away. 'He said he had something on everyone and if I spoke out no one would believe me.' She added: 'I was frightened because someone had written to my home address and said horrible things. I was shocked. 'It was upsetting as I was going through a break-up and felt like someone had intruded and was saying lies about me, which upset us both. 'What was going on between my partner and me was private. I felt humiliated.' The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer. After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture. He denies one count of stalking and another of intimidating a witness. The trial continues.

"Prosecutors want panels of the boat in which Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding to be brought to court to show jurors what they say is his written confession. His lawyers want them to see the entire bullet-ridden boat. Prosecutors have said Tsarnaev scrawled the motive for the attack inside the boat. They say he referred to U.S. wars in Muslim countries and wrote, among other things, 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' Scroll down for video . Prosecutors say alleged Boston Bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev (right) confessed to the attack in a scrawled message inside the boat where he was taken into custody. A view of the bloodied and bullet-ridden message seen on the left in an image obtained by ABC . Above, another view of the boat message which reads in part: 'We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us you hurt us all.' Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, had been killed hours earlier during a shootout with police, but Tsarnaev escaped and was captured — bloodied and wounded — inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. During a final pretrial hearing Monday, Tsarnaev attorney William Fick objected to the plan to bring pieces of the boat to court and suggested instead that the boat be brought to the courthouse so the jury can see the entire boat. He argued that the jury would be seeing the writing out of context if the panels were brought into the courtroom. To see the whole boat would allow the jury to imagine Tsarnaev lying inside 'much like someone lying in a crypt making those writings,' Fick said. Attorneys for Tsarnaev want the entire boat where their client was arrested brought to court to the jury can see how torn up it was in the firefight with police . Above, a picture of the moment Tsarnaev was taken into custody outside of the boat in Watertown . Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb argued that it would be impractical to bring the entire boat to the courthouse and that there are photographs of it that can be shown to the jury. He suggested that the defense wants the jury to see the boat —which contains bullet holes, blood stains and broken glass — to gain sympathy for Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev's lawyers also asked Judge George O'Toole Jr. to exclude autopsy photos of the three people killed in the bombings. More than 260 people were hurt. 'These are highly sensitive, highly disturbing images,' said attorney Miriam Conrad. She said the defense will not dispute how the victims died. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said prosecutors have to prove that the victims died from the use of a weapon of mass destruction, which is among the charges against Tsarnaev.  She said the full-body autopsy photos are necessary because they show all the wounds. The judge did not immediately rule on the motions. Tsarnaev's lawyers made it clear during the hearing that they will portray Tsarnaev as an adoring younger brother who was coerced by his older brother into participating in the deadly 2013 attack. Although his lawyers had indicated they planned to argue that Dzhokhar, then 19, was influenced by Tamerlan, then 26, they used their strongest language to date to describe how they will depict the brothers' relationship and each of their roles in the attack. Tsarnaev's trial is set to start Wednesday and is expected to last about three to four months. Tsarnaev pictured above in court on January 15, 2015 . Tsarnaev attorney David Bruck said prosecutors are trying to show a 'completely distorted' picture of his client by asking the judge to limit the kind of evidence they can present during the initial phase of the trial, when the jury will be asked to decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 charges. Bruck, arguing that the defense should be entitled to present evidence of Tamerlan's role in the attack, called him the 'lead conspirator ... but for whom the Boston Marathon bombing would never have occurred.' Bruck said the defense should be allowed to present evidence that the motive 'may well have been the defendant's domination by, love for, adoration of, submissiveness to ... his older brother.' 'That is fair game,' Bruck said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty argued that the defense plans to try to include mitigating evidence during the guilt phase of the trial, when that should be reserved for the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — when the jury will be asked to decide Tsarnaev's punishment: life in prison or the death penalty. Opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial are scheduled for Wednesday. The trial is expected to last three to four months.","Defense attorneys for Tsarnaev petitioned to bring the entire boat where he was captured to court so jury could see damage from firefight .

"Relations between the UK and China took a significant leap forward with an historic meeting between its President Xi Jinping and the Duke of Cambridge today. President Xi, whose Communist party leadership was once derided by the Prince of Wales as 'appalling old waxworks' warmly shook hands with his son William and heaped praise on the British Royal family. The two men met in the imposing Great Hall of the People - home of the Chinese Congress - where the president highlighted their past interest in his country and told of how they had contributed 'positively' to co-operation between China and UK. He also extended an open invitation to the Queen and her family to come to China, which could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne. Scroll down for video . Prince William meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during his tour . The Duke of Cambridge visited the Forbidden City during his first day in China on what is one of his most important foreign tours . As the two men sat in a large marble clad room, President Xi, speaking through an interpreter, told William: 'The British Royal Family holds great influence not just in the UK but across the world. 'Over the years the Royal Family has shown great interest in, and support for Chinese/UK relations. And members of the Royal Family have done a lot and contributed positively to (the) changes and co-operation between our two countries in areas ranging from trade to environment protection...and cultural exchanges.' He added: 'I know this is Your Royal Highness' first visit to China. In China we have two sayings, first, hearing about something is not as good as seeing it. 'And the second saying is hearing about something 100 times is not the same as seeing it once. 'So I very much welcome your royal highness and other members of the Royal Family to make (a) visit to China and see more parts of China.' The president also passed on his good wishes about William's second child expected next month and 'congratulated' the Duke and Duchess on the imminent birth. He concluded by saying; 'I'm sure your royal highnesses visit to China will be a productive visit and a visit of building friendships, (it will) surely go a long way to developing mutual understanding and friendly ties between China and British people and I would like to wish your visit a great success.' In response William thanked the President 'enormously' for inviting him to the Great Hall of the People and said: 'It's been a long interest of mine, for many years, to come and visit China.' He told the Chinese leader he was going to have an informative few days adding: 'I look forward to as you say strengthening UK/China relations and building things for the future.' William, who is an Aston Villa fan, added: 'I also gather you're quite a football fan, I'm looking forward to learning about China's football!' The Prince - who has left pregnant wife Kate back in Britain - said the Forbidden City is 'beautiful and lovely' He looked relaxed during his day in Beijing, where the Royals hope he can foster good relations with China . Prince William, who is on a week-long tour of the Far East, flew into China last night from Japan for one of the most high-profile – and diplomatically sensitive – tours of his fledgling royal career. With China on course to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, the UK government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and William's visit is being seen as a key part of those efforts. Stepping foot for the first time on Chinese soil, the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the Royal family to visit the country since the Queen nearly 30 years ago. In truth, many had believed that William's father, Prince Charles, would be the first to stake that claim. The Queen's heir has been assiduously courting the Chinese in recent years on behalf of his charities, setting up a number of initiatives in the country, including The Prince's Charities Foundation (China) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture. He has also met with several senior Communist party leaders in the UK. However he has also made no secret of his personal, and deeply held, opposition to Chinese actions in Tibet, regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (reviled in Beijing as a dangerous separatist), to Clarence House. The Prince chats with a crowd of well-wishers outside the British Ambassador's official residence in Beijing . William admitted his Chinese is coming along 'slowly', and is mainly limited to greeting 'Ni Hao' The pair have even been photographed holding hands. After taking part in the formal handover of the former British Colony of Hong Kong in 1997 to China, Charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as 'appalling old waxworks'. Two years later he let it be known he was boycotting a Buckingham Palace banquet in honour of the then visiting president of China, Jiang Zemin. William's grandfather, Prince Philip, also has form in the country. During the Queen's 1986 visit to China he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of British students: 'If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty eyed.' Following his meeting with the president, William visited the exquisite Forbidden City – the ancient home of China's deposed emperors. The future king toured the former imperial palace – home to emperors and their households for nearly 500 years – on the first full day of his tour of China. Accompanied by Zhang Yaoguang, vice-director of foreign affairs at the Forbidden City and an interpreter, he was given a guided tour of the stunning 15th Century complex in dazzling sunshine. Also present was Barbara Woodward, Britain's new ambassador to China and the first-ever woman in the role and Sajid Javid, Minister for Culture, Media and Sport. They were joined by a large security detail as they crossed a bridge over a semi-frozen moat into the inner courtyard to take in several of the main palaces. William listened intently as his guide described the construction and history of the vast landmark. He said: 'The sheer scale of it is phenomenal.' As he posed for photographs in front of the imposing Hall of Supreme Harmony, he was asked how his Chinese was coming along. He laughed and replied: 'Very slowly.' William thanked the President 'enormously' for inviting him to the Great Hall of the People and said: 'It's been a long interest of mine, for many years, to come and visit China' The president also passed on his good wishes about William's second child expected next month and 'congratulated' the Duke and Duchess on the imminent birth . Responding to the Mandarin greeting Ni Hao Ma, he said: 'Ni Hao. That's about as far as I have got.' The Duke was shown giant bronze urns once used to burn pine-scented incense and fill the courtyard below the palaces with clouds of smoke, giving the impression the Emperor was sitting heaven. He said: 'It must have smelled fantastic.' He paused to admire an ornate throne room in the Hall of Central Harmony, where Emperors from the Ming dynasty onwards received ministers and officials. Above the intricately carved throne, flanked by statues of cranes – the symbol of longevity in China – hangs an imperial motto in ancient Chinese characters. Roughly translated it reads: 'Build yourself up in order to contribute to your nation.' William was told how each of the 'golden bricks' in the floor were baked from highly prized type of mud. Mr Zhang said: 'Unfortunately today we cannot make a replica of the bricks because the quality of soil in China has changed and we don't have the craftsmanship.' William joked: 'That's a shame, you can have them made of gold now.' Admiring the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the Forbidden City's 10m-high walls, he also noticed building work taking place across the skyline. He said: 'There is an amazing contrast between the old and the new here.' As he left to attend lunch with the Chinese Premier, William thanked his hosts. Mr Zhang told him: 'Welcome to China, we didn't have time to visit all of the Forbidden City today, just a small portion.' During a whistlestop tour of the Forbidden City, William admired the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the 10m-high walls . It came the Duke took part in a 'Shaun the Sheep' promotion at the British Ambassador's official residence . The Duke, whose whistlestop tour lasted just 35 minutes, replied: 'It feels like a very big portion. 'It's beautiful and lovely, thank you so much for showing me around. I hope that you manage to conserve it going forward. It's such a massive area.' Built between 1406 and 1420, the Chinese imperial palace was home to 24 emperors, 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty. The last Emperor, Puyi, abdicated in 1912 but was allowed to remain in the Inner Court until a coup in 1924. It is now a museum housing some 1.8million items and attracts more than 15 million visitors a year. It contains 980 buildings, including 90 palaces and courtyards, 8,704 rooms and is the largest collection of preserved wooden structures in the world, covering 150,000 square metres. Later today he will fly to Shanghai to embark on a concerted push to promote British business and culture when he opens the Government's GREAT festival of Creativity at the city's Long Museum. The festival is designed to showcase British innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health, technology, education and entertainment. It's a packed programme of engagements and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince's wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy, William has made the right noises so far, it seems.","Prince continues most diplomatically important tour of his royal career .

"A 61-year-old janitor has revealed how he walks 35 miles to his night shift job so he can afford to provide for his sick wife. Steven Simoff works at the Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, more than six hours on foot down the bleak Interstate Highway 35. In order to get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm and walks alongside four lanes of thundering traffic in sun, rain, wind or snow. Scroll down for video . Feet of endurance: Steven Simoff works as an overnight janitor at Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, Iowa - 35 miles away. To get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm . Devoted husband: Steven Simoff kisses his wife, Renee, goodbye. 'You've got to keep your job', he said. Simoff lives with his wife, Renee, who receives Supplemental Security Income and their 22-year-old grandson, Steven, who is currently unemployed. Money has been tight since Renee suffered a stroke nine years ago. She has also had a couple of heart attacks. Earning $9.07 an hour in his casino job, Simoff says his family can't afford to live closer to work  because their rent in Davis City is just $400 per month. Simoff owns a 2002 Ford Windstar minivan, but says he can rarely afford to buy gas for it. 'First of all, when you got a family, and you've got a job, you've got to be able to support your family. And you've got to keep your job — the most two important things I can think of,' he told the Des Moines Register. Simoff's daily trek beats that undertaken by James Robertson, 56, from Detroit who received a $350,000 from a GoFundMe campaign and a new Ford Taurus after his plight received national media attention. Although Simoff's journey is longer, he told the Register that he can typically catch a lift three out of five days. He works Thursday-to-Tuesday and says that Sundays are typically the worst for trying to catch a lift. His frugal approach has its drawbacks, however - he has to buy a new pair of shoes every two months. Different generations: Steven Simoff with his grandson Steven (left). Money has been tight since his wife Renee (right) suffered a stroke nine years ago. She has also had a couple of heart attacks . Going the distance: The extent of Simoff's commute is made clear compared to the scale of Iowa . On average Simoff spends nearly four hours a day walking to work. 'It all depends on weather and what people feel like that day, if they're going to stop and pick you up,' he said. On his way home, Simoff is able to hitch a ride most of the way home with a co-worker who lives in Leon, leaving him eight miles to walk. 'He's trying to earn a living,' said Emil Segebart, who has been giving rides to Simoff for a decade. 'That's how I look at it. You're trying to earn a living and doing what it takes. And this is what it takes.' Once in work Simoff has to spend his eight-hour shift on his feet cleaning the casino, except for two 15-minute breaks and a half hour for a meal. Despite his advancing years he says he's never been injured while walking to work and the only medication he takes is the occasional aspirin or Tylenol. 'If I don't get to work,' he said, 'bills don't get paid. As long as my two feet are good and my health is good, I don't think I'll change.'

"A federal judge blocked Nebraska's gay marriage ban on Monday, but the decision will not take effect for a week and the attorney general's office immediately appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska sued the state in November on behalf of seven same-sex couples challenging the ban, which passed with the approval of 70 percent of voters in 2000. In addition to prohibiting gay marriage, the ban also forbids civil unions and legalized domestic partnerships. The ban means that same-sex couples miss out on medical and financial benefits available to heterosexual married couples, U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon said as he issued the injunction. Legal fight: The ACLU of Nebraska sued the state in November on behalf of seven same-sex couples challenging the ban. ACLU of Nebraska Executive Director Danielle Conrad is seen speaking February 19 . 'All of the plaintiffs have further demonstrated psychological harm and stigma, on themselves and on their children, as a result of the non-recognition of their marriages,' he said in the 34-page ruling. 'The plaintiffs have been denied the dignity and respect that comes with the rights and responsibilities of marriage.' Bataillon rejected the state's argument that the ban reflects the will of a majority of voters and promotes family stability. He said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately endorse same-sex marriage rights, which have been upheld in four appellate districts. 'The notion that some children should receive fewer legal protections than others based on the circumstances of their birth is not only irrational — it is constitutionally repugnant,' he said. His order blocking the ban takes effect March 9. Bataillon previously struck down Nebraska's gay marriage ban in 2005, saying it violated the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians. An 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel reinstated the ban in 2006. According to the court's online records, the Nebraska attorney general's office filed an appeal straight after Bataillon issued the injunction. A spokeswoman for Republican Attorney General Doug Peterson said attorneys in their office were reviewing the ruling and would issue a statement later Monday. Missouri, Arkansas and South Dakota have appeals against stays on same-sex marriage bans pending before the 8th Circuit. Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said the majority of Nebraskans voted for the constitutional amendment. 'The definition of marriage is an issue for the people of Nebraska, and an activist judge should not substitute his personal political preferences for the will of the people,' Ricketts said. Opposition: Gov. Peter Ricketts, a Republican, said the majority of Nebraskans voted for the constitutional amendment which banned same-sex marriage . Couple: Susan Waters, left, and Sally Waters are seen February 24. They were legally married in California in 2008, are among the couples suing to overturn the ban . Susan and Sally Waters of Omaha, who have been together for 17 years and were legally married in California in 2008, are among the couples suing to overturn the ban. They returned to their native Nebraska in 2010. Sally Waters was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in 2013, and says that without formal recognition of their marriage, her spouse won't receive the same tax and Social Security benefits to take care of the couple's children and will have to pay an 18 percent inheritance tax on half of the property they share, including their family home. 'Today, Nebraska's motto of ""equality before the law"" rings true for gay and lesbian Nebraskans who seek to have their marriages recognized,' said Danielle Conrad, executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska. Gay marriage is currently allowed in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Supreme Court announced Jan. 17 that it would decide whether same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry everywhere in the U.S. A decision is expected by late June.","A federal judge blocked Nebraska's gay marriage ban on Monday .

"This is the moment one of Australia's deadliest creatures found itself at the mercy of yet another of the nation's venomous killers. A Victorian farmer was astonished to find an enormous red-back spider had lifted an eastern brown snake off the ground and 'hurled it' into its web under one of the family's car at the weekend. 'It's just mindboggling,' said Neale Postlethwaite, a farmer of 20 years from Gooroc, north of Melbourne. 'I can't believe it was actually able to stop it and then hurl it up backwards into its nest.' A Victorian farmer found this astonishing scene at the weekend, where a large red-back spider had managed to lift this baby eastern brown snake off the ground with its web and draw it up into its nest . Suspended above the ground, this eastern brown snake was caught in the spider web of a large red-back spider and lifted upwards. The snake was found dead overnight . Mr Postlethwaite found the baby snake suspended off the ground on Saturday evening, the large spider sitting on top. To his surprise, the snake was still alive at the time, with the farmer daring to place his finger nearby. 'I thought the snake was dead and went to put my finger there and the snake was still alive at the time,' Mr Postlethwaite said. The eastern brown snake is known for its potent venom, which can cause sudden death, neurotoxity, coagulation disturbances and nephrotoxicity, according to researchers. Mr Postlethwaite filmed video of the snake lolling around in its final hours . Eastern brown snakes - such as the one pictures - contain enough venom to kill 20 adults with a single bite . Australia is home to 20 out of the world's 25 most venomous snakes, including the eastern brown, which is found along the populous east coast . Redback spiders are found throughout the country and there more than 250 red-back bites each year which require the use of anti-venom, according to the Australian Museum . But this baby snake was presumably a victim of the spider's poison. The snake died overnight, with Mr Postlethwaite finding its corpse being devoured by ants in the dust the next day. Mr Postlethwaite told Daily Mail Australia his family often found redbacks on their property. This particular creature had been living under his wife's car. She is a little reticent about getting back behind the wheel, the farmer said. 'My wife doesn't want to drive her car until she can get an underbody car wash,' he joked.","Enormous red back spider lifts a baby eastern brown snake off the ground .

"A Good Samaritan van driver is fighting for life in hospital today after being dragged along a motorway by an opportunist thief he had tried to help. The 28-year-old victim stopped his VW Caddy van after seeing a lorry had overturned on the M602 motorway near Salford, Greater Manchester, at 8.30am yesterday. He got out on the hard shoulder - leaving his keys in his ignition - and walked over to see if he could help him. Good Samaritan: The driver stopped to help the driver of this overturned lorry but they then stole his van and dragged him along a motorway leaving him critically ill .

"The father of a two-year-old boy crushed to death when a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home says he felt helpless as he tried for hours to get to the bedroom where his son was trapped. Toddler Eli Marnock was killed during wild storms in Melbourne on Saturday night in a tragic accident that saw his five-year-old sister pinned under a wall and his grandfather trapped for hours as his parents tried desperately to get them out safely. Eli's father, Stefan Marnock, 41, described his anguish as he tried in vain to get to the boy after the tree destroyed the home at The Patch, in the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, just after 9pm. Scroll down for video . Toddler Eli Marnock, two, was killed when a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home during wild storms on Saturday . Eli's father Stefan Marnock says he felt helpless as he tried for hours to get to the room where Eli was trapped . Eli'  five-year-old sister Nicola pinned under a wall for more than an hour after the tree fell on the living room . 'I was trying to get to him - that was my only concern,' Mr Marnock told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had two storeys worth of debris and a tree on top of him. 'There was no hope, I just couldn't get to him. It was a complete feeling of absolutely helplessness.' The extent of the damage meant Mr Marnock and rescue workers couldn't access Eli's bedroom until after midnight. 'I stayed there until I got him out,' he said. 'I had the firies (fire service officers) with me, we ended up going through the wall in our bedroom cupboard.' And the tragedy could have been even worse. Mr Marnock said it was a nap in the car that saved the life of Eli's five-year-old sister Nicola – who wasn't tired and was on the couch watching TV instead of sleeping in the bedroom she shared with her little brother. The tree destroyed the home at The Patch, in the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, just after 9pm . Mr Marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his 'cheeky' little boy who was his 'little dude' Earlier that day the family visited Mr Marnock's father's grave as it was the fifth anniversary of his death. When the family was back at home that evening, Nicola was on the couch watching TV and Mr Marnock and Eli's mother Suzie Surridge, 37, had walked to the front of the house to investigate the storm. 'We had actually stood up to go and look out the front door because we heard the gust of wind,' Ms Surridge said. 'We opened the front door but had to close it immediately because of the wind. 'Nicola had stayed sitting in the armchair then all of a sudden the tree from above us just came down on top.' Ms Surridge said she and Mr Marnock were in an archway which protected them from the debris, but Nicola was trapped under a collapsed wall. From left: Eli's mother Suzie Surridge, 37, sister Jackie, 18, brother Blake, 11, brother Jesse, 13. father Stefan, 41, sister Nicola, five, and Eli . Emergency Services Minister Jane Garrett said it was the council's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe, amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree . 'We were able to get across over the debris to where Nicola was pinned, fortunately the angle of how things had gone down it didn't crush her upper chest or head,' she said. 'I was able to sit and speak with her and keep her talking the whole time.' Mr Marnock said Nicola was a 'little trooper' throughout the terrifying ordeal. 'She was just amazing,' he said. 'She got stressed out at times and she was a little bit concerned as to where Eli was - she knew she couldn't see their bedroom door.' It took an hour for rescue workers to free Nicola. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for injuries including bruising and a torn liver, but she did not suffer any broken bones or haemorrhaging. Mr Marnock's 13-year-old son Jesse, who was in a hallway when the tree came down and was not injured, ran up the street to get help from neighbours before the emergency services arrived. Ms Surridge said Eli's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard, and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy . Ms Surridge's parents John and Sue Surridge were at the rear of the property, where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling. Mr Surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before rescue workers got him out . 'He was absolutely amazing - he was able to go up into the back section of house where Grandma Sue was and was able to vocally communicate with Grandad John because we had no visual,' Mr Marnock said. 'He helped me so much, he was my legs. 'He was my star, he was just brilliant. For a 13-year-old kid to do that is just amazing.' Ms Surridge's parents John and Sue Surridge were at the rear of the property, where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling. Mr Surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before emergency services managed to get him out. Ms Surridge's 18-year-old daughter Jackie had been out at dinner with friends before she returned home to the devastation. Mr Marnock's 11-year-old son Blake was staying at his mother's house. Emergency Services Minister Jane Garrett said it was the council's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe, amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree, The Age reported. 'I just miss him,' Ms Surridge said. 'He was such a huge chunk of our world.' 'In light of the tragic circumstances of last night, we will be reviewing all of these processes and making sure that everything's being done to prevent a tragedy like this happening again.' Mr Marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his 'cheeky' little boy. 'He was my little dude, he was the definition of a little boy,' he said. 'He was a little monster with devilish charm. 'He was the cutest little kid with a cheeky smile. 'He'd just look at you and he knew he was doing something wrong but he'd look at you and just do it anyway.' Ms Surridge said Eli's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard, and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. 'I just miss him,' she said.

"With its breathtaking river views, neo-Gothic period features and world class location in the heart of London, the Palace of Westminster is the ultimate dream home. And if housing campaign group Generation Rent gets its way, this could become a reality for hundreds of Londoners, as well as saving the Government £120million over five years. The organisation has come up with a plan to transform the World Heritage site into 364 affordable flats in a bid to save taxpayers money and relocate Parliament to - Hull. As part of the stunt to raise awareness about the lack of social housing, the group said the move would create 500 jobs in a northern town and save millions in staffing costs. Housing campaign group Generation rent has proposed moving Parliament to Hull and converting the empty buildings into 364 flats . Flats would be available in the historic building for £258 per week for a one-bedroom flat (£1,118 per month), £299 for a two-bedroom (£1,297 per month) and £350 for a three-bedroom (£1,520) under the fantasy scheme. Architect Jay Morton has made the most of the high ceilings in the plans as these would be split to make room for three-bedroom maisonettes for families. Corridors will be transformed into one and two-bedroom flats with windows on both sides. The iconic debating chambers on the ground floor of the Grade I-listed building would be turned into a swimming pool and a library as the ground floor has been deemed a flood risk. Ms Morton, who drew up the plans, said: 'This redevelopment would provide a unique opportunity to renovate the existing fabric of the building and provide much needed accommodation for those who live and work in the city, while re-injecting a community back into the heart of the borough.' The Palace of Westminster's high ceiling  would be split to make room for three-bedroom maisonettes for families . The numerous courtyards within the Parliamentary estate allow many of the homes to be dual aspect . The campaign group is aiming to raise awareness about the lack of social housing and suggest cost-saving measures for the Government. It suggests relocating MPs and Lords to Hull which boasts the cheapest rent in England with £325 per month for a one-bedroom home. 'This is an idea that will save taxpayers money, help build houses in London and give a disadvantaged northern economy a welcome boost,' according to the plans. The proposal pointed out that 335 MPs rent second homes and claim expenses, costing the taxpayer £5.21million in 2013. Generation Rent also hopes it would create 5,000 badly needed jobs in the disadvantaged northern city. Corridors in the iconic building would be transformed into one and two-bedroom flats with windows on both sides . The flats in the World Heritage site would be available from just £258 per week for a one-bedroom flat . The iconic chambers on the ground floor of the Grade I-listed building would be turned into a swimming pool and a library . 'It also costs more to employ people in London. If Parliament were located in a cheaper part of the country, there would be annual savings of £20million in reduced employment costs, and the creation of 5,000 badly needed jobs,' said the plans. Selling  'the prestigious riverfront offices' of Portcullis House, currently home to MP's offices, could also provide a tax windfall of up to half a billion pounds. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent (the operating name of the National Private Tenants Organisation), said it would effectively illustrate  the rent crisis in the capital to MPs. 'Renters are being crushed by high rents, poor conditions and almost no security of tenure. 'With their generous rent allowances from the taxpayer, MPs are cocooned from the housing crisis so they're largely indifferent to the plight of renters. The proposal suggested relocating MPs and Lords to Hull which boasts the cheapest rent in England of £325 per month for a one-bedroom home . There is no set site for Parliament to be held in Hull, but the campaign group suggested a derelict site near the station . 'One way our politicians could bear their share of austerity is if we relocated Parliament to the least expensive part of the country. We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis.' The idea provoked a mixed reaction with some upset only that it will never happen in reality. Dan Bryant ‏tweeted: 'The idea of moving Parliament to Hull is just brilliant on so many levels.' Alan Smith, a member of Otley and Yeadon Labour party, said: 'I think face-to-face discussion is important. But I'd definitely vote for parliament moving to Hull. Referendum?' Sue Brown tweeted: 'Not sure if we want all the MPs to come here to be honest.' Tom Coles said: 'Unfortunately don't think this would ever happen.'","Campaign group proposed to move Parliament to Hull and convert building .

"Police say Jason Brown, whose license has been suspended 41 times, gave a fake name after being pulled over in Yaphank, New York, on Saturday after an officer noticed his minivan driving erratically . A man who has had his license suspended 41 times was nabbed again over the weekend in New York. A Suffolk County police officer pulled Jason Brown over on Saturday afternoon in Yaphank after noticing the suspect's minivan was being driven erratically. Police say even though Brown gave a fake name to Highway Patrol Officer Matthew DeWitt, the officer determined the suspect's New York State driver’s license had been suspended 41 times. Officer DeWitt also 'observed marijuana in plain view within the van'. At that point, Brown, 36, was taken to the 5th Precinct in Patchogue for processing. During processing, Officer DeWitt 'discovered Brown had hidden on his person quantities of heroin and cocaine'. Brown, of Mastic Beach, was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, criminal impersonation, unlawful possession of marijuana and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance. He was also given a traffic summons for failure to maintain or stay within a lane of travel and his van was impounded. After being held at the precinct overnight, Brown was arraigned at First District Court in Central Islip.","Jason Brown gave fake name after being pulled over in Yaphank, New York .

"A million women were raped by Allied soldiers in Germany in the immediate aftermath of World War II, a new books claims. ‘When The Soldiers Came,’ by historian Miriam Gebhardt, is hailed as the definitive account of the treatment meted out to the defeated women of Nazi Germany which they remained silent about for decades out of shame and humiliaton. 'At the very least 860,000 women and girls - and also men and young boys - were raped by the occupying Allied soldiers and their helpers. It happened everywhere,' begins the book. A new book claims Allied troops raped German women during the Second World War by manipulating them with gifts of chocolate and cigarettes. Above, a soldier takes a photograph of a German woman . Until now it was widely thought that only the Red Army, which advanced on Germany with rape as a weapon sanctioned by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, committed the mass rapes upon tens of thousands of women, many of whom committed suicide. 'Soldiers of the western Allies were also guilty,' said Mrs. Gebhardt, a renowned historian in Germany who tracked down some victims to interview them about their ordeal at the hands of Briish and American soldiers. 'I researched the book for over a year and-a-half,' she said.  'I wanted to tell the story of what 'happened from the perspective of the victims. I wanted to reconstruct the crimes as gently as I could.' She said the 'terrible crimes' did not only take place in the Soviet zones of occupation - long chronicled and well-known about - but also in French, British and American sectors. A familiar slogan of the times was: 'It took six years for the Americans to struggle against the German armies but it only took a day and a slab of chocolate for them to conquer German women.' But not all collaboration in the bedroom was voluntary, writes Gebhardt. German author Miriam Gebhardt made the claims in a new book . She said the false impression grew up after the war that German women gave themselves to western soldiers because they brought with them things they desperately needed - nylons, food, cigarettes, coffee. 'The impression grew that there was no rape in the west but rather a kind of prostitution grew up,' said the author. But in fact countless women were raped, she said, with soldiers believing they could treat the as they wanted after bearing coveted gifts. 'Post-war society was hardly ready to differentiate between voluntary and forced sexual contact. 'Between women who prostituted themselves out of emergency needs and those who had become victims of rape.' Added to the trauma of the western victims was the shame suffered by the children they bore from their attackers. 'Their fathers were, mostly, unknown, and the women received no financial help at all,' said Gebhardt. She said in parts of southern Germany, occupied by American troops, there were often 'free nights' where soldiers were encouraged to abuse women at will for up to 48 hours at a time.

"David Cameron has vowed to build 200,000 homes for first-time buyers . More than 30,000 people have registered for cheap 'starter homes' - less than 48 hours after a new scheme was officially launched. David Cameron today announced plans to build 200,000 new homes which will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate for under 40s who haven't yet bought their own home. Since a website promoting the scheme was officially launched on Saturday there has been a 'stampede' of first-time buyers showing an interest, Downing Street said. The revelation comes after Mr Cameron promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election. He announced that a Conservative Government would build double the number of subsidised starter homes to give 'more young people the security of owning a home'. The homes will be sold below market rate and won't be 'snapped up by buy-to-let landlords', Mr Cameron said. He promised the homes will be 'decent, well-built, homes – places to start and raise a family'. The House Builder's Federation, which runs the Starter Homes website, confirmed that almost 31,000 people have registered to receive information on starter homes being built in their area. The federation's Steve Turner said the stampede of interest in the last 48 hours revealed the pent-up demand for first homes. He said: 'The volume of registrations clearly demonstrates the need for schemes to assist people to buy their own homes.' He added: 'In recent years it's been very difficult, particularly for first-time buyers, to realise their ambitions of home ownership. Government schemes to help them do so are clearly welcome.' David Cameron today promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election . The Prime Minister's pledge to build 200,000 new properties for first-time was one of five election promises to help home owners. He said the Tories would keep mortgage rates low, build more homes, extend the controversial help-to-buy scheme and encourage more people to buy their own council house. Local councils will also be given more power to stop unpopular developments, Mr Cameron said. The PM said: 'There is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [but] too many people have been denied that security. 'The young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. 'The couple who want a child but can't afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn't be this way. 'Our goal is a Britain where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own.' Ed Miliband has promised to build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 - up from around 140,000 this year . But Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking at a People's Question Time in Hove today, said: 'David Cameron's plan on housing has failed Britain and failed families. 'Under this government we are building fewer homes than at any time since the 1920s and record high numbers of families are being forced to rent. 'For far too many people the dream of home ownership is disappearing into the distance. 'Labour has a better plan to build hundreds of thousands of new homes, ensure that local first time buyers are given priority and get a fairer deal for millions of families that rent.'","David Cameron today announced plans to build 200,000 'starter homes'

"The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms. The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat. Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked. The head of the Australia Chamber of Commerce announced her continuing struggles at a function on Monday . She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life. 'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television. 'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said. The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing. The battle with anorexia began when she was 12 or 13 and she gained an interest in boys and fashion . Her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms and saw her in and out of hospitals . When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe. 'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said. She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick. 'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart — and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said. Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians. The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention. 'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said. 'We have to adjust the system for early intervention which very quickly recognises this as a mental condition and brings in the right type of specialist support.'","The head of the ACCI outlined her struggles at a function on Monday .

"A high school freshman battling an eating disorder has died from a heart attack just a day after celebrating her 15th birthday. Lacey Smarr of Longview, Texas, died on February 2 after starving her body of the important nutrients needed for her heart to function. Lacey's eating disorder had begun just months earlier during the eighth-grade when friends had teased her about her curvy physique. Lacey Smarr of Longview, Texas, died on February 2 after starving her body of the nutrients needed for her heart to function . 'They would tell her that her butt looked big in the volleyball shorts,' mom Candy Miller told News Journal. 'That's all it took for Lacey. She's just that kind of person that takes it seriously.' Candy says the girls loved Lacey and didn't mean any harm but from that moment on her daughter became fixated about her weight. To begin with Lacey made a concerted effort to eat healthy and exercise but soon her family started to notice unusual behaviour. When Lacey would go to the restroom she would lock herself in and turn on the water in the sink. 'I asked her about it, and she said she was locking the door because of her little brother and that she couldn't use the restroom without the water running,' Candy said. 'I bought it. I didn't question it.' Mom Candy Miller had asked doctors if her daughter had an eating disorder, but instead they diagnosed an ulcer and prescribed an antacid . As her daughter started to lose weight, her mother became worried. At one point, the teenager was taken to hospital after fainting and hitting her head. While there, nurses observed Lacey eat then throw up her food. Candy asked doctors if her daughter had an eating disorder, but instead they diagnosed an ulcer and prescribed an antacid. The doctors refered Lacey to psychiatrists and counselors, but they also told Candy Miller that they didn't believe her daughter had an eating disorder. 'I blamed myself in the beginning (after Lacey's death), but she fooled doctors,' Candy Miller said. From weighing 126 pounds at her last athletic physical in eighth grade, Lacey had dropped down to 88 pounds at the time of her death. From weighing 126 pounds at her last athletic physical in eighth grade, Lacey had dropped down to 88 pounds at the time of her death . On the day of her death, Lacey had returned home early from school after complaining of not feeling well. She was found unresponsive by her stepfather, who tried CPR and called for an ambulance. On her birthday Lacey had eaten several meals, but her mom now believes that Lacey had thrown the food up afterwards. 'She's a very smart girl,' said Candy. 'She knew how to hide it.' In honor of her daughter, Candy Miller is in the process of launching the Lacey Foundation. 'I feel like if we can save just one family from the grief we're going through and the pain, then my daughter didn't die in vain,' Miller said. The foundation will help raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders as well as offer resources to families in need.","Lacey Smarr of Longview, Texas, died on February 2 after starving her body of the nutrients needed for her heart to function .

"You do realise you've walked into the best windsurfing centre in the world?' announces our instructor, Sam, at the beginning of our first lesson at Club Vassiliki. While these surfer dudes tend to lean towards hyper-enthusiasm (everything is 'totally awesome' or 'epic'), I think he may be right on this one. We can sense it the second we arrive at this windsurfing hotspot on the southern end of Lefkada island in Greece. Our welcoming committee of caramel-coloured instructors eye up the new arrivals through their Ray-Bans. Staying on her feet (for now): Francesca gets to grips with the art of wind-surfing in sunny Lefkada . When my friend and I wander down to the beach, we see an exhilarating display of one hundred windsurfers skimming across the water like dragonflies. We sit drooling on the sand and make a pact to be professional standard by the end of the week. How hard can it be? Everyone at Club Vass - a hotel and windsurf school - has the same obsession. And it's contagious. While the converted flock here annually for their fix, it's also the perfect training ground for beginners. Thanks to its position in a thumb-shaped inlet, enclosed on three sides by mountains, this watery playground has its own weather system, which runs like clockwork during the summer. A light onshore breeze sees the novices through until lunchtime. By early afternoon, the heat pressure behind the western mountain has built up so the wind whooshes down into the bay. Off come the rookies, on go the pros. There are numerous watersports centres along Vassiliki beach, but Club Vass, which has been here since 1987, is the place to be. It has more Royal Yachting Association advanced instructors than any other centre in the world. They are wonderfully sympathetic to our incompetence, despite some of them being ranked among the UK's top professional windsurfers (the hotel walls are lined with shots of them in action, including one of a chiselled freestyler above my bed which prompts a nightly sigh). On day one, Sam shows us how to climb on to the board, haul the sail up and do a static turn (wafting the sail across the back of the board to turn 180 degrees). I feel like a new-born foal trying out my legs for the first time. We all plop in the sea constantly, but it is bathwater warm with a sandy bottom. Sometimes I fall in on purpose. Mornings begin with Greek yogurt and honey before our lesson at 10.30am. We return at lunchtime to refuel, then it's back to the water to practise. More than 250 boards and sails are lined up for the taking, and when you traipse floppily off the water after your session, one of the beach staff magically appears to put it all back for you. It's not all about the windsurfing. There are mountain bikes, yoga classes, fitness sessions, paddle boarding and a bustling Kids' Club. Stroll along the beach to Vassiliki town for a competitive line-up of seaside tavernas offering tzatziki, fried courgette and giant meaty skewers, or nip eastwards to the pretty bay of Sivota where we gorge on fresh fish and watch yachts bobbing. The social scene at Club Vass is a big draw, says a university graduate, here for his sixth summer. Every evening, guests at the beach bar swap anecdotes about their windsurfing feats. I throw in a bit of lingo about 'heli tacks' and 'duck gybes', but give the game away on the water the next morning when a girl from my table at dinner glides past and waves. I return the gesture and topple off. On our final, gusty afternoon I'm first on the water. Leaning my full weight back against the sail, the board slices through the sea. I'm smitten. Not with my instructor (well, not just with my instructor), but with this utterly thrilling sport. A seven-night stay at Club Vass (0844 463 0191, www.clubvass.com) costs from £599 per person, including flights from Gatwick, transfers, windsurfing tuition, mountain biking and stand-up-paddle boarding.","Pretty Lefkada is one of the most northerly of the Greek islands .
Often lost in the shadow of Kefalonia, it is a destination of quiet charm .
It is also a great place to learn to wind-surf - as our writer discovers ."

According to the overall statistics China had the most nationals obtain the season 3 illegally, with a figure of 60,538 . Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios. Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music. Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'. The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year. Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads. Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice. Consumer advocacy group Choice has slammed the Code as 'frightening' and is calling for amendments . The breaches will be identified through technology which tracks activity on internet protocol addresses, and a notice will then be sent to the account holder to advise them of the suspected infringement. If offenders receive a a third warning, Internet Service Providers will be allowed to provide the customers details - a move that would allow the copyright holder to target the user directly. Choice campaign manager Erin Turner said that the new code could funnel average Australians into a frightening and confusing court battle. 'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia. The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code, released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. 'Ultimately we’re trying to strike a balance. We’re trying to ensure privacy and that personal details are protected, that any allegation (of copyright infringement) will be independently reviewed, that customers don’t face sanctions,' John Stanton from the Communication Alliance  told news.com.au. The discovery process means that ISP's would be obligated to aid 'rights holders'- such a Hollywood studios- to locate and take legal action against those suspected of illegally downloading content. In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones. Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones . Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups . 55% of Australians who downloaded content illegally, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above)  said it was because of a lack of access . While the statement also said that the code 'contains strong safeguards against any threat to the privacy of internet users' and that the consumer could appeal the final notice, Ms Turner said that Choice had serious concerns about the consequences for consumers. The ISP's- including Telstra, Optus, and iiNet- are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content. In a case earlier in February, the rights holders of the Oscar-winning film Dallas Buyer Club demanded that ISP iiNet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie. The ISP expressed concerns the rights holder would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter, reported news.com.au. 'They can't oppose it, they have to participate when the rights holders want to take consumers to court. We are very worried about the lack of protection provided to everyday Australians, who could face huge fines that don't match the crime,' said Ms Turner. 'The code is an uncapped system of fines, which means that there is no limit to what someone could be made to pay under the scheme,' she said. Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources . In Feburary, the rights holders of the Oscar-winning film Dallas Buyer Club (above) demanded that ISP iiNet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie . The ISP expressed concerns the rights holder of the Dallas Buyers Club (above) would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter . Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined. 'In the US, which also has an uncapped system, a consumer was sued by Sony BMG and fined $675,000 for downloading and uploading 30 songs,' said Ms Turner. 'This is why we are worried, this is a completely disproportionate system. We are not talking about a slap on the wrist, the punishment nowhere near fits the crime,' she said. The Communication Alliance maintains that while the scheme may not be a popular move with some customer, the industry body made genuine efforts to provide a reasonable balance between education and preventing further illegal downloading. Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them,' said Ms Turner . 'I don’t expect there to be universal acclaim, but it’s a scheme that’s fair, that’s not punitive and that balances competing interests,' he said. Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content. 'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner. 'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said. Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.' The code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which 'include continuing efforts of Rights Holders to ensure timely and ready availability to Australian consumers of lawful content alternatives.' However, Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed. Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code, and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy.","Australians downloaded the third House of Cards series more than any other nation per capita .

"A woman charged for her attack on a vision-impaired bus passenger on the Gold Coast has been spared jail time, despite an appeal from the Attourney- General for a harsher sentence. Footage of Larna Jane Watmough, 22, and her friend Layni Cameron attacking 77-year-old Paul Buttigieg caused national outrage when it went viral in February 2014. Former Queensland Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie appealed the two-month suspended sentence handed down to Ms Watmough, saying the punishment was ‘manifestly inadequate’. Scroll down for video . Remorseful: Ms Watmough is lucky to have avoided a jail sentence after former Attorney-General, Jarrod Bleijie, appealed for a harsher penalty . Judge Paul Smith agreed the sentence was inadequate given the vicious and unprovoked nature of the crime. Ms Watmough’s case was reviewed and although her sentence was tripled to six months, it remains wholly suspended. This means Ms Watmough has been spared jail time for the second time, with Judge Smith attributing this to her genuine remorse, limited criminal history, employment and rehabilitation. Ms Watmough has also reportedly stopped taking drugs. ‘I note that (Watmough) has been employed since the sentence; continues to report to the probation office; has paid the compensation ordered; and continues to see a psychologist,’ Judge Smith outlined in a written decision on Monday. The new six-month suspended sentence started in September 2014 and will expire in a fortnight. Ms Watmough penned a remorseful letter to Mr Buttigieg detailing her involvement with the elderly community and apologising for her actions. The 21-year-old presented a handwritten note to the court apologising to the man for the incident in February when footage went viral of Watmough and friend Layni Cameron attacking Paul Buttigieg on a bus in the suburb of Kirra . Despite showing 'genuine remorse' Ms Watmough has been the target for death and rape threats . Judge Smith says Ms Watmough has been subject to extensive public scrutiny after the attack which has negatively affected her mental health. ‘I note there have been death and rape threats against her. She has been depressed as a result of this."" The incident occurred after the two young women attended a racing event earlier in the day before catching the bus home from the Tweed Heads Bowls Club. Watmough's co-accused, Cameron, 18, received a three year sentence for her role in the attack. She was out on bail at the time of the attack for robbing a Surfers Paradise store with a knife.

"Kelly Jane Richards has been told she could face prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy . A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy. Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child. Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her. Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support. The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday. The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard. A second similar charge was left to 'lie on file'. Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'. Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you. 'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass. 'This is a serious matter. 'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.' She was shielded going out of the court by her husband. Richards will be sentenced on March 23. Richards was pictured with a hood covering her head arriving at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court this morning .
