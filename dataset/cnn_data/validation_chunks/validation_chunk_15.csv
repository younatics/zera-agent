"England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him. In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse . The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal . The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson . Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on . Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals . It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond . Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right . It was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor Norwich side in the Premier League last season, but having struck the equaliser against a talented Germany team he looks to be improving. Now a veteran of the Under 21 set-up, it will be difficult for Southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for Kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the Young Lions.","England recorded impressive 3-2 win over Germany in Under 21 friendly .

"Martin O’Neill says this summer’s friendly match with England is simply a means to an end for Republic of Ireland. Roy Hodgson takes the Three Lions to Dublin on June 7, six days before the Irish face Scotland in their decisive Euro 2016 qualifier. O’Neill, though, has played down the significance of England’s visit and prefers to focus his attention on the match with the Scots. Martin O'Neill says that Ireland's game against Scotland is much more important than the England clash . ‘England is (a means to an end) for me,’ he said. ‘I agree it’s a big match, but it’s not for me. The Scotland game is the be all and end all. ‘I don’t think we should overlook the fact that, for me, it’s a build up to the Scotland game. It will be intense and that might be a good thing. ‘But at the end of the day, if you want us to win a load of friendly games I’ll play the 700th rated team in Europe every single week and build it up.’ Roy Hodgson's side travel to Ireland on June 7 for a friendly match at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin . O’Neill and his team cannot afford anything other than victory against Scotland at the Aviva Stadium. They salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Poland on Sunday night thanks to Shane Long’ s injury-time strike. Failure to win, however, has left them three points adrift of the table-topping Poles with Germany and Scotland also two points better off. Gordon Strachan and his Scotland side are just above Ireland and the clash has been labelled as 'must win' The team have been praised for refusing to accept defeat against Poland, but also criticised for again having to rely on a last-minute rescue act. O’Neill said: ‘I’d rather get the first goal in the game and take it. We’ve been chasing some of the matches. ‘But overall I think the draw sets it up for Scotland. It’s probably a must-win game for us. ‘We’re still in the competition. It would have been a real blow to lose on Sunday. ‘But I thought we had spirit in abundance. We really cannot wait now for June.’ Shane Long (9) fired home a crucial equaliser against leaders Poland to keep Ireland in the hunt .","Martin O'Neill says the clash with Scotland is bigger than England .

"Chester City striker Oliver McBurnie has vowed to prove Scotland's Under 19s don't need Real Madrid superkid Jack Harper by firing Ricky Sbragia's youngsters to a winning start in their UEFA Elite Round against hosts Austria on Thursday. Sbragia's decision to omit the promising Bernabeu talent for the tournament has caused uproar, mixed with bemusement, after the former Sunderland boss' comments about Harper not being physically strong enough. Harper's replacement does not have Zinedine Zidane as a coach or the luxury of a five-year deal with Real. In fact, McBurnie is currently on loan from Bradford City at Football Conference mid-table outfit Chester City. On loan Chesterfield striker is ready to step up for Scotland Under 19s against Austria on Thursday . McBurnie in action for Scotland Under 19s against Holland Under 19s during an International Challenge match . However, the 18-year-old is in agreement with Sbragia that Scotland need to be physical in their three games which starts on Thursday in Vienna against hosts Austria, before facing Italy on Saturday and Croatia next week. And he's had plenty of practice playing for Chester against the likes of Alfreton Town, Dartford and Lincoln City's grizzled defenders. McBurnie said: 'Obviously, Jack hasn't made the squad, but it's good to know it' s not just about reputations. If they do come and watch you and you do well then you get the rewards for that. 'The boys are confident and we know we have quality in this team and an ability to hurt the opposition. If we stick to the game-plan and play how we know we can play we've got a chance. It's tough against the hosts, Italy and Croatia for that matter but we want to test ourselves against the best. 'They're all good sides and hopefully we can go out there and prove a point. They're going to be big and powerful sides but we see ourselves in that bracket as well. Hopefully we can cope with that and let our football do the talking. Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has been left out of the latest Scotland Under 19 squad . McBurnie says that he has had to toughen up playing against conference opposition . 'You have to grow up fast and it's very different to Bradford, although Chester like to try and play a bit to be fair. In the Conference it's tough to play football on some of the pitches against some of the teams. It's a great learning experience and just adds to my game. The defenders have definitely tried to rough me up. 'The worst was at Lincoln away. Both of their centre-backs were about 6ft 6in and I was playing up front on my own. That was tough. But we got through and won, so I enjoy testing myself against bigger and stronger players. It's a different experience.' But the Harper issue does bring back memories of a depressingly frank admission from Billy Stark, then Scotland Under-21 boss, in June 2009. A month earlier, Xavi and Iniesta had passed Manchester United to death during the 2009 Champions League Final at Rome's Stadio Olimpico. Recalling a community coaching forum at Hampden 24 hours before, Stark said: 'I was asked whether Iniesta and Xavi would have flourished and come through the Scottish system. 'It's hard to say because you're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not. The Spanish place an emphasis on sheer technique and movement. Our game is based more on power and pace. So there's an argument that they wouldn't have come through in this country to become the players they are now. Scotland Under 19s manager Ricky Sbragia claimed Harper is not big enough physically . Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future . 'But the Spanish approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied,' he added. Former Scotland manager Craig Brown has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under-fire Sbragia. 'I've the greatest of admiration for Ricky as a man and a coach,' said the 74-year-old. 'My friend Archie Knox speaks highly of him and he's also worked under Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. So I'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him (about Jack Harper). 'But I would say this: people are saying this young lad is a Real Madrid player. He's not; he's never played for Real Madrid. I was a Rangers signing but I never played for Rangers. 'Real Madrid will have hundreds of kids in their system. I'm not for a minute saying Jack Harper is not a good player. I haven't seen him so I don't know. Former Scotland boss Craig Brown (second right) revealed his admiration for Under 19 coach Sbragia . 'But I think people get hypnotised by the name Real Madrid. There's a frenzy going on but if (the same player) played for another club would there be the same impact?' Brown admitted it is an occupational hazard of a national youth selector to end up looking foolish. 'You can't get every player right,' he said. 'Here's my example: When I was Scotland Under 21 manager, I got a phone call from the late Alex Wright, manager of Dumbarton, saying he had a good player for me. It was Owen Coyle, and he was good, but I didn't think he was as good as Kevin Gallacher and Gordon Durie. 'I told Alex the only reason I would be picking Owen would be solely to prevent Ireland getting him – and that would be unfair. He would have been a bench player for Scotland. 'So the Irish picked him instead and our next game was against Ireland at Easter Road. My over-age centre half that day was Alex McLeish and Owen knocked the ball past Alex and stuck it in the roof of his net. 'I remember thinking 'I've messed up here'. But we ended up winning 4-1 and I think Durie scored three. But you can get egg on your face…'","Scotland Under-19s play Austria on Thursday as part of UEFA Elite Round .

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he feels sorry for Newcastle loanee Gael Bigirimana, but admits he should never have been signed by the Ibrox club. Burundi-born England youth cap Bigirimana has yet to feature for the Light Blues after being diagnosed with a mystery illness. He was one of five Magpies youngsters signed by former Light Blues chief executive Derek Llambias without being put through a medical - even though Bigirimana knew he was sick before signing for the Glasgow giants. Gael Bigirimana has not played for Rangers since his loan move from Newcastle . The 21-year-old has denied rumours claiming he is suffering from Hepatitis-C, but Gers boss McCall confirmed his condition means he will not be able to feature for his adopted club. The former Motherwell manager would love to have the use of the former Coventry midfielder's services, but believes he should never have been allowed to make the move north in the first place. 'Bigi has got a medical condition which is a personal matter,' said McCall. 'The doctor and consultant are all involved in that. 'I knew him at Coventry. I remember watching him and thought when I came into the job he will be a good one to bring in and give us a bit of energy. Unfortunately because of his medical condition he won't be able to play for us. Bigirimana signed on loan for Rangers alongside Haris Vuckic (middle) and  Remie Streete . 'But that is as big a blow to the kid as it is for us. It's not his fault, this [row] has been nothing to do with him. He comes in with a smile on his face each morning, he trains with the fitness coach as hard as he possibly can. 'So as disappointed as we are that we can't use him, you have to think of the boy in this matter because he can't go back, he can't play for anyone else. 'It's an unfortunate circumstance that really should never have happened.' Llambias - a close associate of Magpies owner Mike Ashley - signed off on the five Newcastle loan deals just hours before the January transfer window shut, but did not ask club doctors to check the players over. So far only Slovenian playmaker Haris Vuckic has played regularly. Bigirimana says he knew he was ill before he moved to Rangers . Defender Remie Streete limped off just half an hour into his debut and has not been seen since, while Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson has yet to even step foot inside Murray Park after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury. Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu has featured for Rangers' youth side but is 'nowhere' near being fit enough for first-team duty, according to McCall. The Gers boss cans sympathise with the players but hit out at the previous regime's decision to sanction some of the signings. Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he feels sorry for Newcastle loanee  Bigirimana . McCall said: 'Should these guys ever have been sent here? Well, with Bigi being unable to play that's a no-brainer. With Shane, he was on his way back but had a little setback. 'But I think if you look at it in all honesty, anybody who comes up for a six-month loan should have a medical - obviously that is not the case. 'If that had occurred, two or three of the loans may not have happened. 'But none of the players are at fault here. Shane has not been up but the rest come in and train as hard as they can. They are doing their utmost to be involved.'","Stuart McCall says Gael Bigirimana shouldn't have been signed by Rangers .

"Nathan Hines has little interest in any Aviva Premiership points target as Sale Sharks continue their quest to secure European Champions Cup qualification. Sale are currently seventh in the Premiership table - one place off sealing a guaranteed Champions Cup place next term - with five games left.

Nathan Hines has little interest in any points target as Sale continue European qualification quest . And while Sale realistically cannot afford any slip-ups during the season's closing stages, Sharks' former Scotland lock Hines is not looking beyond tackling Gloucester.

'I know it's a cliche to say one game at a time, but if you start spreading your focus around too many things, you will come unstuck.

"Wayne Rooney has warned Harry Kane not to let his full England debut be ruined by dirty tricks from Italy’s defenders. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed on Monday night that the young Tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight’s friendly in Turin. Phil Jones is expected to operate in midfield as Hodgson tinkers with a team who have won seven out of seven this season, and Theo Walcott could return to the starting line-up. England captain Wayne Rooney has warned Harry Kane not let his full international debut be ruined by Italy . Kane celebrates after scoring his first international goal during England's 4-0 victory over Lithuania on Friday . All eyes will be on Kane, however, and Hodgson spoke of the ‘magic touch’ which has helped him score 30 goals this season, including his first for his country — within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against Lithuania on Friday. But England captain Rooney, who is set to win his 103rd cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond, warned Kane what he should expect from the likes of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci. Rooney said: ‘With Italian defenders, they’re clever defenders. They do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that, and not be frustrated. ‘They’re a passionate country who love their football and they’re probably the closest in Europe to South American teams. They’ll do anything to stop you. They’re tough to play against, organised, make it as difficult to play against as possible. They’re the best in Europe at doing that. ‘Harry’s taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal. ‘That’s all he has to do,’ insisted Rooney, who hopes to match Tommy Lawton’s record of scoring in six successive England games, set in 1938-39. ‘I’m sure if he does that the way he has, he’ll be fine.’ Rooney insists Italy's defenders will do anything to stop the opposition and Kane must be aware . Kane will come up against Leonardo Bonucci (pictured) and Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday night . When Italy beat England at the World Cup in Brazil, no-one thought Kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress. Hodgson said: ‘It’s great to see people like Harry Kane come on the scene and it’s a fairytale for him at the moment. He’s got the magic touch. Within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut. It doesn’t get much better. This will be a tougher test, but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it. ‘Our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for Lithuania, but we lost Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck, which has changed my thinking. ‘We still have what I consider to be a very offensive line-up. It’ll be hard work for the front six, who have a hard job on their hands.’ England manager Roy Hodgson (left) confirmed Kane will start against Italy and 'hopefully play a large part' James Milner and Leighton Baines have also withdrawn. Meanwhile, Welbeck is facing a race to be fit for Arsenal’s crunch Premier League match against Liverpool on Saturday. He returned to north London after sustaining a knee injury in Friday’s win against Lithuania. It is a blow for Arsenal ahead of a game which could prove pivotal in the fight for a top-four finish.

"Relentless Robbie Neilson  celebrated Hearts clinching the Championship title in March — then ordered his team to smash Hibs’ second-tier record points total. An unexpected 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road yesterday left the Tynecastle side — who had beaten Falkirk 3-0 at Westfield 24 hours earlier — an unassailable 23 points clear of Hibs with 21 points left on the board. Neilson learned his team had secured a return to the Premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at Stirling University yesterday afternoon. Robbie Neilson wants his Hearts team to surpass Hibernian's second-tier points total . Hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3-0 win against Falkirk . Rangers beat Hibernian to give Hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league . But, despite the league being finally in the bag, the 34-year-old vowed there will be no let-up as Hearts hope to usurp Hibs’ record tally of 89 points, set under Alex McLeish in 1999. Should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches, the rampant Gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points. ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to win the league. It’s a great day for the club,’ said Neilson. ‘The objective for the season was to get promoted. We’ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season — but we need to keep winning games. ‘We’ve got seven games left and we want maximum points. We won’t be losing focus. If we could set a new record for points for the division, then that would be fantastic. ‘When you play for a club with the stature of Hearts, you have to keep winning games — and that’s what we need to do. ‘I will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games. We can’t be turning up at venues and losing games. We want to win, starting with three more points against Queen of the South at Tynecastle next weekend.’ Neilson believes his side’s 2-1 stoppage-time win at Ibrox against Rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign. But it wasn’t until a battling 2-1 victory at Queen of the South on February 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away. ‘I don’t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line,’ he said. ‘But I think that Queen of the South game was a big one for us away from home. We went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points. We eventually got there and, from then on, I thought we had a real chance of taking the league. ‘But that win against Rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans. A lot of times you can go to Ibrox, go ahead and then Rangers draw level and you’re then hoping to hang on for a draw. Hearts' Genero Zeefuik celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against Falkirk . The Hearts players celebrate as they beat Falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . ‘But we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season. It gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we’ve done it. ‘To finally get over the line is magnificent. The players have worked so hard and I couldn’t have asked for more. ‘We can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate. We’ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them. ‘It’s just a great day and it’s testament to the support we’ve had all season from the fans, the hard work of (owner) Ann Budge and (director of football) Craig Levein and all the players. ‘The fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks.’ Meanwhile, Hearts captain Danny Wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions-in-waiting. Hearts captain Danny Wilson revealed his joy after his side became Scottish Championship winners . ‘It has been difficult, you know,’ he said. ‘Since maybe late December and early January people have had us installed as champions. So it’s been tough, not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side. But we’ve done that. ‘The way the season has panned out, we’ve been going about our business in the right fashion. But if you had asked me at the start of the season whether I thought the gap would have been this big, I probably wouldn’t have believed you.’","Hearts won the Scottish Championship after Rangers beat Hibernian .

"Michael Vaughan believes Alastair Cook is 'clearly bitter', and must set aside his own World Cup disappointment for the good of his England team at the start of their Ashes year. Cook claimed on Wednesday that England's decision to replace him as captain with Eoin Morgan, at the 11th hour before the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, was proved 'probably wrong' by subsequent events. England made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of Bangladesh, before the knockout stages were under way. Alastair Cook was replaced as Engtland's one-day captain before this year's World Cup . Former captain Vaughan interprets Cook's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50-over role because of his continued poor batting form. Cook will nonetheless lead England in three Tests against the West Indies, on a tour starting early next month, before returning home to face first New Zealand and then Australia this summer. BBC pundit Vaughan said: 'He's clearly bitter. 'I think that's a bad mentality to have, when you think he's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks' time.' Cook led England to a Champions Trophy final on home soil two years ago, and the top of the world rankings, but their recent one-day international record under him deteriorated. Vaughan added: 'Alastair Cook's last six captaincy jobs in (ODI) series for England, he lost every single one. 'The only series they've won was away in the West Indies, when he wasn't the captain.' Michael Vaughan claims Cook is 'bitter' about the decision to replace him as captain . Cook could only watch from afar as England beat only Scotland and Afghanistan in their World Cup campaign under Morgan, but he sensed they were 'shell-shocked' and in need of 'real leadership'. Vaughan argues Cook must move on, and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record-breaking career. 'I don't think it's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he's clearly bitter. 'He's got to clear that out of his head, because it's so important that by the time he gets to the West Indies England need him scoring runs. 'He has to score runs in the Caribbean; he has to get runs against New Zealand - so by the time the Ashes arrive in July, no one is talking about Alastair Cook's position in the Test team. 'He hasn't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years. That has to change in the West Indies.'","Alastair Cook was replaced as England's one-day captain .

"Alastair Cook has slammed the ECB for the timing of his dismissal as one-day captain, claiming the World Cup shambles which followed has shattered the players' confidence. Cook's forthright views increase the pressure on head coach Peter Moores and managing director Paul Downton on the day the Test squad to tour West Indies was announced. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, where he is preparing to play for the MCC, Cook said defeats by Australia and New Zealand proved that the decision to axe him was, with hindsight, incorrect. Alastair Cook was removed as England one-day captain in December, before the cricket World Cup . England's cricketers were eliminated from the World Cup at the group stage by Bangladesh . Cook believes hindsight has proved the ECB wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament . Cook told The Daily Telegraph: 'I can't speak about what's gone on there in depth, but you always back yourself, and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken away from me. 'The selectors made that decision because they thought it was the best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong, but now it's very easy to say that.' He added: 'I wouldn't say all of it [confidence] has been [shattered], but a hell of a lot of it has been. You have to remember that it is a different format and you get a change, but all teams are grouped under the same English cricket umbrella, and we can't be naive enough to think that it's not. 'We have a repairing job to do, and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and start winning. 'We built that momentum a little bit after the Ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a slightly younger side, including the likes of Gary Ballance and Joe Root. There was a feel-good factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Test matches. Since then, it's been tough going. We've got to rebuild again.'

Cook (left) will lead England in three tests in the West Indies in April, before New Zealand visit in May . Cook feels the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament . Cook would have loved the opportunity to complete a challenge he was set when named Andrew Strauss' successor as ODI captain after the previous World Cup in 2011. 'I was there for three-and-a-half years trying to do a job,' he said. 'We got to No 1 in the world with a full-strength side and got to the final of the Champions Trophy. There were things I can be very proud of. 'As any captain will tell you, leading your country in a World Cup is a huge honour and one that can never be taken lightly. I was very much looking forward to that. 'I understand the pressure I was under. I wasn't scoring the runs I should, or could have been scoring so I understand that my position was in jeopardy. 'But I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament.

Cook believes that England would have made it out of their group at the World Cup if he had been there .

'Roy and I know that the seniors are in a good group position and he feels that the experience of going to the Czech Republic in the summer will be more beneficial to Harry than the two games he has got,' Southgate said. 'That is absolutely the case regardless of his displays between now and then. 'We are not short of good players in the seniors, but understandably for Harry to be there this time, against Lithuania, was merited. 'We still feel we can give the players the best possible preparation to go into the seniors and achieve success if they have got the experience of the European Under-21 Championships behind them.

"British No 1 Andy Murray is finally back-to his best after an injury-plagued and frustrating 2014, and is on the verge of rediscovering his best form – that's according to mum Judy Murray. It has been an electric start to the new season for Murray – his quarter-final win against Spaniard Feliciano Lopez last month was enough to see him pass Tim Henman for the most wins by a British player in the open era – it was the 497th victory of his career at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Murray was also a beaten finalist in this year's Australian Open by world No 1 Novak Djokovic back in January, while after reaching the semi-final in Indian Wells last week, Murray is now the second highest points scorer on the ATP Tour this year. Andy Murray poses with fans after his practice at the Crandon Park in Miami . Murray practices for his first match at the 2015 Miami Open at the Crandon Park . A look at the 'Race for London' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for Murray, with him ahead of Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, in that order. Mum Judy – the current captain of the women's Fed Cup team and star of reality television show Strictly Come Dancing – is convinced Murray's back operation in late 2013 severely hampered his performances across the last 12 months. And she feels son Andy, who is marrying Kim Sears on April 11 in Dunblane Cathedral, is only just starting to move as he did in 2013 when he lifted the Wimbledon title and challenged the supremacy of Djokovic as the world's best player on a near weekly basis. Murray  is put through his paces ahead of the Miami Open . Murray had a difficult 2014 due to a back injury but is back to his best now according to mum Judy . '2014 was a difficult year for Andy because he was returning from back surgery and any kind of surgery you just don't recover quickly from,' said Judy Murray, speaking at the SSE Arena at Wembley, where she is a mentor for SSE's Next Generation programme, which provides vital financial and development support to 100 young athletes from across the UK and Ireland. 'But I think when it's in your back it takes a long time to get it to the stage where you can put it through what you need to, to play tennis at the very top level and I think once he got into the back end of the season he finished it very strong. 'He won three tournaments, he qualified for the end of year finals and finished the year at six in the world, which is an incredible achievement considering he had what he would say was an inconsistent season. Amelie Mauresmo watches Murray during practice in Miami . 'But then he had a really good off season with his coach Amelie Mauresmo and played incredible tennis all the way through Australia and the preparation events. 'That was a really good sign and it was good to see him back moving well and happy and healthy and playing his best tennis. 'And I think we saw some of his best tennis again at Indian Wells, which was great to see, so I think he's back on track and he's happy and he's healthy.' Murray is hopeful of adding to his coaching team this week; with the appointment of former world number four Jon Bjorkman. The Swede will join as an assistant to Amelie Mauresmo sometime after he finishes his involvement in a Swedish television dance show. The arrival of Bjorkman to Team Murray is timely after Djokovic dismantled the world No.4 at Indian Wells; the defeat sparked a Twitter row with a disgruntled fan and highlighted the urgent improvements needed if the Scot is to challenge for Grand Slam titles again. But mum Judy has called on fans to be patient as Murray rebuilds his career; while she is convinced another major title is only just around the corner. 'I think you have to remember that Novak is the best player in the world presently and no match against him is ever going to be easy,' she added. 'Andy made the semi-finals of the French Open last year and has a good game for clay because he is a great athlete and has a great engine on him. 'Growing up, we trained a lot on clay in Barcelona. He played a lot on hard courts in Scotland, albeit indoors, so that will always be in my opinion his best surface. 'The grass season is very short and less of the top players play well on grass because they don't have grass courts in their country, so they are not used to it. 'So I think grass always presents itself a big opportunity for any British player. 'But I think Andy's goal is the same as it was when he was a little boy, he wants to win Grand Slams and he wants to be the best. 'He has a very good record in Grand Slams over the last four or five years so he will be out there and doing his best.'

"Harry Kane is 'loving every minute' right now as the Tottenham striker prepares to meet up with England for the first time buoyed by a maiden Premier League hat-trick. The 21-year-old's scarcely-believable rise continues apace, with the Chingford-born forward making it 29 goals in all competitions with his treble against Leicester on Saturday. Kane's performance helped inspire out-of-sorts Tottenham to a 4-3 win and saw him move top of the top-flight scoring charts - a remarkable feat considering the first of 19 league goals did not arrive until November 2. Harry Kane celebrates scoring the opening for Tottenham in their 4-3 win over Leicester on Saturday . Kane, who joins up with the England team on Sunday for the first time, taps in the give Spurs the lead . It capped a whirlwind few days for the striker, who on Sunday is meeting up with the England senior squad for the first time ahead of the matches with Lithuania and Italy. 'I can't wait,' Kane said. 'It has been a dream to be called up but obviously I want to go and play. 'There is great competition for places and hopefully I can just do my best whilst I am away and see what happens. '(I want to play for England) like any boy would. That's what I want to do. 'There is great competition and I have to keep working hard if I want to get a place in the team.' Kane insists he is able to savour such moments, despite so many things coming 'thick and fast'. It is form he wants to keep up and, as much as he wants to impress for England, retains a focus on club matters. Kane scores his 28th goal of the season on the eve of joining Roy Hodgson's England squad . Kane buries this penalty to record his 29th goal of the season as he overtook Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa . Saturday's win kept Spurs' hopes of a top-four finish alive and was the perfect response to their insipid display in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United. 'Obviously we all know that was a poor game from us,' Kane said, speaking to Sky Sports. 'There is no hiding away from that, but it is how you react. 'I've always said we've got a great bunch of lads here and again we've proved that. We've come back with a great win today. 'We have got a great squad, we all enjoy it. We're loving every minute, obviously we want to keep the wins coming and see how far we can get up the table.' The emotions those connected to Leicester are feeling could not be much different. Kane holds three fingers up after clinching his hat-trick in a perfect precursor to his international debut . Kane applauds the Tottenham supporters as he takes the match ball after the final whistle at White Hart Lane . The Foxes are seven points from safety with only nine matches left after the harsh defeat in north London. City's performance belied that of a side rock-bottom of the standings and manager Nigel Pearson praised his players' character afterwards. 'It's a very disappointing result for us because I think we deserved more,' he said. 'I don't think we deserved to be on the receiving end of a defeat today. 'To be 2-0 down after 13 minutes and really stretch one of the top sides away from home all the way to the end is a measure of the commitment that the players have shown today. 'To a man I thought they were really excellent in terms of how they went about trying to win the game.'","Harry Kane joined the senior England squad for the first time on Sunday .

"Gary Bowyer's final words to his Blackburn players will be very simple before they step out at Anfield on Sunday: 'Good luck.' The Rovers boss knows the odds for the FA Cup quarter-final are heavily weighted in their opponents' favour, and would have been before Liverpool hit the run of form that has seen them win nine of their last 11 Premier League games. 'It's David vs Goliath,' said Bowyer. Gary Bowyer knows the odds are against Blackburn ahead of their FA Cup clash against Liverpool . Jordan Rhodes hit his 13th of the campaign to help Blackburn to their first away win since October . 'Nobody's giving us a chance outside of our dressing room. 'I think they're the most impressive team in the Premier League at the moment and the football that they're playing is fantastic. Obviously full credit to the manager for the way he changed his formation. 'We've studied the videos, we've come up with a gameplan, and we've worked with the players on it. We'll go and take the challenge to Liverpool. 'We've been very organised and very disciplined in the previous meetings with the Premier League teams, and then of course along the way you need a bit of luck. Rhodes turns the ball in past Wednesday keeper Jason Steele to give the visitors the lead . 'The mood's one of excitement and rightly so. The lads have earned the right to play at Anfield with the performances in the previous rounds.' Bowyer said his team will go into the match high on confidence, and they can certainly take great encouragement from their performances in the last two rounds. Neither Swansea nor Stoke enjoyed their visits to Ewood Park, with Blackburn racking up seven goals across the fourth and fifth rounds. Although Anfield presents a major step up, it is a ground that holds the most special of memories for Rovers. Twenty years ago in May, Blackburn celebrated the best moment in their history when they lifted the Premier League trophy at the Merseyside ground. Bowyer believes his team will go into the match high on confidence following the win against Sheffield Wednesday . The achievement will be marked by a minute's applause in the 20th minute on Sunday as a tribute to their late benefactor Jack Walker. Bowyer said of the cup run: 'Financially it's been excellent for the club at a time when we've got a transfer embargo and money's tight. 'For the players and the staff and supporters, it's been a great journey so far. But we want it to continue. 'For the supporters it's going to be a great day out. They're going to bask in the memory of 20 years ago. I think there's something planned in the 20th minute, which is going to be really good, but the players are going to do a job.' Josh King scores for Blackburn during his side's memorable 4-1 victory against Stoke in February . Steven Gerrard is back in training with Liverpool but he won't walk straight back into the team . Bowyer is also taking pride in earning positive headlines for Blackburn after the most turbulent of times. Rovers became a club at war with itself following the takeover in 2010 by Venky's and less than two years later they were relegated from the top flight. They had got through three managers in a season and were heading towards another relegation when Bowyer, who joined Blackburn's backroom staff in 2004, began another stint as caretaker manager in March 2013. Jordan Henderson has scored twice in a week for an in-form Liverpool side . Bowyer believes Brendan Rodgers' side are the 'most impressive' in the Premier League at the moment . His reward for stabilising the club was to be given a chance as permanent boss, and two years later Rovers are finally a football story again. Bowyer said: 'The supporters have been through a hell of a lot over the last couple of years but we're starting to put foundations in place, we've done that over the last 20 months, and we're starting to make progress. We've got to continue that. 'It's a measure of how far we've come already the fact that we're at this stage of the competition, we've got some very talented footballers and they're going to excel in that environment (at Anfield).'","Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer believes his side can cause an upset in FA Cup sixth round match against Liverpool .

"Roy Hodgson should place his trust in Harry Kane and start the in-form Tottenham striker in England's upcoming fixtures, according to Alan Shearer. Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season, including a hat-trick against Leicester City on Saturday, and was handed his first call-up to the senior squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

'The form he is in, I think get him in there and he will score goals. He will be a great foil for Rooney and I am a big fan of his. 'I like his attitude and the way he scores all sorts of goals. I couldn't believe we aren't going to show his goals (during the analysis) but the editor said ""he only scored a tap-in, a deflection and a penalty"". I said ""is that all?"".

"Wigan manager Malky Mackay is adamant David Sharpe is the perfect man to take the club forward after the 23-year-old was appointed the Football League's youngest chairman this week. Owner Dave Whelan, 78, stepped down from his day-to-day duties at the DW Stadium after 20 years this week and entrusted those responsibilities to his young grandson. Although that succession plan had long been in the pipeline for the Whelan family, the fact Sharpe is coming into a position of power at such a tender age still raised eyebrows. David Sharpe is the new chairman of Wigan Athletic after taking over from his grandfather Dave Whelan . Whelan stepped down from his day-to-day duties at the club and handed over the role to his grandson . However, Mackay is familiar with Sharpe having worked closely alongside him since his appointment in November and the 23-year-old, who was only officially appointed on to the board on Christmas Eve, took on a more central role with chief executive Jonathan Jackson during the recent six-week ban imposed on Whelan by the Football Association. And Mackay has seen enough of Sharpe to be convinced the Sky Bet Championship outfit are in excellent hands. 'It's easy to have a throwaway line about a 23-year-old taking over a football club but he's been round about the football club since he was a young man,' said Mackay. 'He's here every day, is at every game and knows the inside of the football club. I look at the experience and the amount of time somebody has been at a football club. Malky Mackay is familiar with Sharpe and believes the 23-year-old will be a good chairman at the club . 'He's got good people round about him and I know the things that drive him, the things he's passionate about and they are good values for wanting a football club to go forward in terms of academy and recruitment.' Whelan had cited his age as the motivating factor behind his decision to step back and he will address Wigan supporters to say farewell before Saturday's home clash with Leeds. Mackay has only been at the club for a few months but paid tribute to the impact Whelan had made on the 2013 FA Cup winners, who he took from the fourth tier into the top flight, where they spent eight seasons prior to relegation two seasons ago. Mackay also paid tribute to Whelan for the work he did as Wigan chairman over the last 20 years . Whelan kisses the FA Cup after Wigan beat Manchester City at Wembley before being relegated in 2013 . 'He's put his heart, soul and life into this football club over the last 20 years,' added the Scot. 'I played at Springfield Park a long time ago and to then 20 years later have a team that have a beautiful stadium, a lovely training ground and have won the FA Cup and played in the Premier League is quite a story in anybody's book. 'He's manufactured and moulded that. It's a fitting tribute tomorrow to him.'

"Kevin Pietersen has paved the way for a summer of potential embarrassment for the ECB after agreeing to rejoin Surrey in an improbable bid to regain his Test place. Pietersen will be available for the county across all three formats but will focus on the four-day Championship as he attempts to force his way back into the England team following his sacking a year ago. Confirmation of his Surrey return is expected on Thursday. Another remarkable news cycle for the English game began with Pietersen telling Test Match Special listeners he would do ‘anything’ to play international cricket again. Kevin Pietersen will return to Surrey in the summer to play in the LV= County Championship . 29 - Pietersen’s average in the 5-0 Ashes drubbing in 2013-14, the last series he played. That is well below his Test average of 47. 20 - months since he last played a first-class match for Surrey . 19 - months since his last century in any form of the game, 113 against Australia at Old Trafford . 39 - his highest score in the T20 Blast for Surrey last season. In 12 innings, he averaged 22 . That comment prompted English cricket’s beleaguered powerbrokers to close ranks once more. Going into a summer in which England desperately need to reconnect with their fans and regain the Ashes, the ECB fear Pietersen will act as a non-stop, hard-to-silence distraction. Test captain Alastair Cook, in Abu Dhabi for the season’s curtain-raiser on Sunday between MCC and Yorkshire, was quick out of the blocks. ‘There’s been a hell of a lot of stuff happened with his book,’ he said, ‘so he is unlikely to come back into the team.’ England selector James Whitaker, who would have preferred to focus on Wednesday’s announcement of the Test squad for the Caribbean, told Sky Sports: ‘We haven’t had discussions at all about Kevin. This last 12 months we’ve been successfully rebuilding the Test team and he’s not part of our plans. ‘We’ve produced some good middle-order players with Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell continuing to perform well, so we are happy with where we are in the middle order.’ Pietersen has hinted he could change his IPL contract in a bid to push for an England place . Both Whitaker and ECB managing director Paul Downton — the man behind last year’s controversial sacking — have repeatedly insisted Pietersen will never play for England again, a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in October of his score-settling autobiography. But Pietersen, desperate to add his England-record tally of 13,797 runs and 32 centuries, seized on a stray comment made this month by new ECB chairman Colin Graves, who said the ‘first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket’. But Graves was simply stating the obvious: affiliation to a county is the minimum requirement for anyone with England hopes. But, emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering, Pietersen took every opportunity to state his desire to play for England once more. After playing for the Big Bash League's Melbourne Stars, Pietersen has signed with the Sunrisers Hyderabad . Surrey were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in June but Pietersen has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove. And the prospect of a hatful of Division Two runs as Surrey push for promotion prompted director of cricket Alec Stewart to bring him into a middle order alongside Sri Lankan veteran Kumar Sangakkara. County bowlers may not agree, but the move is a smart one. As long as Whitaker, Downton, coach Peter Moores and Cook remain in situ, it is inconceivable that Pietersen can resume his international career. But assuming he manages to extricate himself from his £200,000 IPL deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as a contract with St Lucia Zouks in the Caribbean Premier League, that means he could be available for most, if not all, of the county season. The nightmare scenario for the ECB officials who have stated their position so unequivocally is a glut of runs for the man they continue to consider persona non grata. Kumar Sangakkara appeared to confirm Pietersen's return to Surrey this season after Sri Lanka bowed out of the World Cup with a convincing defeat by South Africa . The call from his many fans on social media for Pietersen’s return would grow — especially if England fail to put a disastrous World Cup behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 Tests in 10 months. On Wednesday Pietersen told TMS: ‘If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England then it’s something I want to do. I love playing for England.’ His best hope is the sacking of all the men who object to him — and for that to happen England would need to perform terribly in the Ashes. In other words, the only plausible scenario that can rescue Pietersen is one he cannot be seen to hope for. Not for the first time, English cricket and Kevin Pietersen find themselves engaged in a tense Catch-22. Pietersen has not played for England since the Ashes tour of 2013-14 after which he was dropped .","Kevin Pietersen will line up for Surrey in the LV= County Championship .

The Brighton player, however, tried to allay any assumptions of a goal fest and believes patience could be key. Brighton defender Gordon Greer has warned against complacency ahead of Scotland's game with Gibratlar . The Scotland squad train ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier with bottom placed Gibratlar on Sunday .

'Obviously, if you score a lot of goals in front of your home fans and everything is great then it is a perfect afternoon.

They put men behind the ball in the Germany game, the same against Ireland and Poland, so I think it will be much the same on Sunday. 'You have 90 plus minutes in a game so at the end of the day when the final whistle goes you just want to have three points and hopefully the team puts on a good performance.'

Greer believes playing against such a stuffy side as the Irish were on the night was ideal preparation for a much more important game. 'The game the other night was a good test for us going in to the Gibraltar game,' he said.

"Jozy Altidore was by no means prolific in the Premier League, but across the Atlantic he scored two goals on his debut for Toronto on the opening day of the MLS season. The 25-year-old American scored one goal in 42 Premier League appearances in the red and white of Sunderland, while before that he netted just once in a season-long loan spell at Hull City. His time in England concluded with two goals in 70 Premier League matches - against Manchester City and Chelsea, to be fair - but upon returning to the league in which he began his career, Altidore scored twice to help Toronto to a 3-1 victory in their first game of the season. Jozy Altidore celebrates with his team-mate Jonathan Osorio after scoring his penalty against Vancouver . Altidore is brought down by Pa Modou Kah (left) in the dying moments of the game to win a penalty . The US international striker moved to Canada as part of a swap deal with Jermain Defoe, and got off to a flyer in his first game, netting a brace. Toronto went 1-0 down to Vancouver Whitecaps in the all-Canadian affair, before Altidore scored his first; one touch to take it round the goalkeeper, and one touch to fire home. Toronto took the lead through Robbie Findley, but Altidore was not finished. The USA striker scored once in 42 league games in England, but has already doubled that at Toronto . Altidore celebrates his one and only Premier League goal for Sunderland, against Chelsea in December 2013 . In the latter stages of the game, the former Sunderland man was brought down in the box by Pa Modou Kah, and opted to take the spot-kick himself. Not content with your average penalty, Altidore's confidence was evident when he produced a Panenka to secure a 3-1 away victory for his side. His dismal three seasons in English football will have done Altidore's career no favours, but if Saturday's performance is anything to go by, it'll be back on track in no time at all.","Striker Jozy Altidore scored one goal in 42 league matches for Sunderland .

"A mother has made a YouTube video telling a boy to stop asking her daughter out. Dr Lindsey Doe, a blogger under the name 'Doe Eyes' who specializes in sexual harassment, dedicated her latest clip to the teenager who has approached her daughter at school, on the bus, and with poems - despite multiple rejections. In a post titled Dear Boy Who Likes My Daughter, that has amassed more than 250,000 views, Doe explains that pursuing somebody without consent is harassment. Instead, she advises, he should write about his feelings in a diary. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Leave her alone': Dr Lindsey Doe directed a message to the boy who keeps asking out her daughter . Doe, who used to work for the University of Montana, says: 'I don’t like how you treat [my daughter.] Are you confused? You probably picked up messages from society about how when you want something, you have to ""try harder, go at it, do whatever you can to get it. Don’t give up!"" 'Maybe it’s for this reason that you repeatedly ask my daughter out. In the halls, on the bus, and you write her poems.' For his own understanding, she explains the appropriate way to act after asking a girl out. If she says 'I don't know', give her space. 'Maybe' prompts a conversation about her feelings of uncertainty. Only in the instance that she says 'ask me again later' should he ask again - but much later. Doe, who blogs on YouTube as 'Doe Eyes', explains that he is harassing her daughter with his requests . If he wants to express his feelings, she explains, he should write a diary or speak to a trusted friend . But her daughter, she says, has simply responded: 'no thanks', 'stop asking me', and 'no, no go away'. 'Person Who Likes My Daughter, this goes for all aspects of your life,' Doe says. 'If someone tells you ""no"" in any way and you ask again, it's not cool, it's not attractive, it's not respectful, it's harassment. 'My daughter has the right to change her mind and the ability to let you know if she does. 'Until then I expect that you do not ask her out, do not suggest a relationship, do not talk to her about her discomfort with you pursuing her.

"Bruce Jenner was seen moving into his new very private and roomy hilltop property nestled deep within the hills of Malibu on Thursday. And on Tuesday the inside of the $3.5m mansion was revealed. The home, his second since leaving Kris Jenner, has modern touches and sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean as well as a luxurious pool. Scroll down for video . On the move: Bruce Jenner was seen moving into his hilltop mansion in Malibu on Thursday . A look inside: On Tuesday a look inside the house, purchased for a little more than $3.5m, was made available; the property features four bedrooms, a three-car garage, and a pool/spa outside . According to sources quoted by Variety on Monday, Kris Jenner's ex bought the house for $3.575m, a bargain well below the $3.9m asking price. The light grey 3,500 square-foot home is far from modest and sits on 11 acres of land (as reported by People). Built in 2010, the concrete-and-glass structure came with four bedrooms, 3.5 baths, and 360-degree views of the surrounding hills. Views: In addition to 360-degree vistas overlooking the surrounding hills, the house's veranda and pool have unobstructed views of the ocean . The swimming pool and spa attached to the house also offer an unobstructed sightline to the ocean. A built-in grilling station and an outdoor fireplace are features out by the pool, located on a slightly raised wrap-around porch. Back inside, the kitchen has a centre island fitted with white countertops and cabinets, as well as stainless steel fixtures. White features: A large kitchen features white countertops and cabinets, as well as stainless steel features . Open plan: With no division between the living room (right) and dining room (left), glass walls give the house an open and airy feel . The main part of the mansion features an open-plan design, with a step-down living room with a fireplace and a dining room next to it. Hardwood floors and ornate glass doors mark the entryway. Even the master bath features mountain views from the bathtub - with no near neighbours this is still private - and a glass-walled shower. A bathroom with a view: Even the luxury bathroom allows for spectacular views from the tub . Outside areas: The house is surrounded by covered patios and verandas . Outside, covered patios surround the building that has a three-car garage attached. While the existing photos show the house before Bruce moved in, the E! reality star was spotted moving in several items, including a king-sized mattress and a bed frame. Bruce's son, Brandon, was on-hand to help - he took off his shirt to move bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence. Wider view: The E! star's new spread is surrounded by 11 acres of land . Move-in day: While more furniture and belongings undoubtedly came separated, Bruce and his son, Brandon, were spotted moving in a few items . Three-car garage: A fan of cars and other motorized toys, Bruce will likely fill his new three-car garage . Though it is large, the property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills until 2013. The Malibu residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home. Bruce may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately. Casual for the new place: The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star wore a blue striped golf shirt while Brandon went shirtless . Not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female (thanks to longer hair, painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by Spanx), but he was also the center of a fatal accident on Pacific Coast Highway on February 7. The father of model daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, was driving a dark blue Cadillac Escalade at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69-year-old widow Kim Howe of nearby Calabasas. She was in a white Lexus and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black Hummer smash into her, causing her to die. Several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital. Go daddy!: Brandon watched as Bruce went back into the home where he will no doubt be filming his new E! reality series . Good deal: Surrounding houses have been priced as high as $10m, making Bruce's new digs a steal .

"Make no mistake. A first trophy as Celtic manager was a huge, significant step for Ronny Deila. He took the old cup from Rod Stewart, skipped down the Hampden steps and refused to let go until the ‘Ronny Roar’ — his ceremonial bonding session with the club’s supporters. But this was a day when sobriety was the Parkhead watchword. Sober reflection, followed by a sober celebration. Celtic’s first League Cup since 2009 is the platform for Deila to become only the third Celtic boss to win a domestic Treble. But that’s it. A piece in the jigsaw, no more. The Celtic players celebrate on the podium with the QTS Scottish League Cup after beating Dundee United 2-0 at Hampden Park . Celtic manager Ronny Deila gets ready to lift the Scottish League Cup with his players as The Bhoys kicked off their celebrations . A Scottish Cup replay against Dundee United — who else? — beckons on Wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of Glasgow’s fast-food outlets cashing in on a Celtic team session last night. The players, captain Scott Brown included, were under orders to be in bed by midnight. ‘We should enjoy the moment,’ said a relieved Deila after an eventful, if unremarkable, final. ‘But there is not going to be any nightlife.’ We should have known Brown would be a key figure here again. The Celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards – both rescinded – when these teams met at Tannadice last week. His manager then overlooked the front-page pictures of a night of rabble-rousing in Edinburgh before the final. Yet the greatest let-off of all might have been here when referee Bobby Madden denied United – who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick. Popstar and devoted Celtic fan Rod Stewart hands Celtic captain Scott Brown the trophy after the 2-0 victory over Dundee United .

Kris Commons (left), who scored Celtic's first after 28 minutes, poses with the Scottish League Cup trophy on Sunday . Dundee United (4-3-2-1): Cierzniak 7; Dillon 6, Morris 6, Fojut 6, Dixon 5; Paton 6 (Erskine 72), Butcher 6, Rankin 6; McGowan 6, Dow 6; Bilate 6(Anier 59) Subs not used: Szromnik, Souttar, Telfer, Connolly, Spittal . Booked: McGowan . Sent off: Dillon . Celtic (4-2-3-1): Gordon 6; Ambrose 7, Van Dijk 7, Denayer 7, Izaguirre 7, Bitton 8 (Henderson 81), Brown 7; Stokes 7, Johansen 7, Commons 7 (Forrest 67); Griffiths 7 (Guidetti 67). Subs not used: Zaluska, Scepovic, Fisher, McGregor. Goals: Commons 28, Forrest 79 . Referee: Bobby Madden . Attendance: 49,259 . MOTM: Nir Bitton. Celtic were ahead at the time. They had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper Sean Dillon collided with Virgil van Dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches. He was gone for fully eight minutes. ‘I was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long,’ said manager Jackie McNamara afterwards. ‘It proved costly for us. ‘I had Blair Spittal ready to come on and I was going to put Ryan McGowan to right-back. Unfortunately, I don’t have a magic wand for those circumstances.’ Dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes. Thereafter, Celtic dominated, scoring again through James Forrest and emphasising why the Tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment. He wasn’t to blame for the insipid Paul Dixon free-kick which allowed Craig Gordon to gather and trigger a Celtic counter. But it was from his position that Anthony Stokes – who had a fine game - chipped a left-foot cross that was prodded towards goal by Kris Commons, changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of Jaroslaw Fojut. Somehow Rado Cierzniak in the United goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post, but Commons would not be denied, thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1-0. ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing,’ pondered McNamara. ‘If we had scored from that Dixon free-kick, everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time.’ There was more cause for United regret in 36 minutes when Ryan Dow, chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by Brown, a villainous figure through Tannadice eyes. Referee Madden had a good, long look then decided to turn the other way. Brown had ducked SFA punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another Tannadice gripe against authority. Not without justification, it should be said. James Forrest curls in the second goal for Ronny Deila's side as the Scottish Premiership leaders proved their superiority at Hampden Park . John Guidetti (left), on loan from Manchester City, celebrates Forrest's strike for The Hoops as they beat Dundee United . Celtic manager Ronny Deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble . Forrest roars in celebration with the Celtic fans at Hampden Park erupting after Deila's team prevailed 2-0 in the Scottish League Cup final . Predictably, Deila – perhaps seeing it through green and white shades – saw things differently. ‘It was hard to say, but, from what I have been told, it was a good decision,’ he claimed. ‘I think the referee was very good. We are after him whenever he does something wrong, but you have to give them credit when they do a good job.’ In contrast, United foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes. Last Sunday, Paul Paton and Dixon were sent packing. Paton’s proved to be a nonsense, but Dillon’s here was inarguable. The defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on Izaguirre. The Honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury. On the United touchline McNamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all. His side had lost the Scottish Cup Final against St Johnstone last May and they knew, now, another showpiece occasion was slipping away. Celtic’s extra man was telling. Dundee United captain Sean Dillon (right) is sent off for this late challenge on Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre . Dillon can't hide his devastation after the Dundee United captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at Hampden Park . In Stokes, Stefan Johansen and Nir Bitton, they had the best players on the pitch. In 67 minutes, Johansen got across Fojut to jab a Leigh Griffiths cross towards goal, the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow United escape. It was the last act for Griffiths before he made way for John Guidetti. James Forrest replaced the tiring Commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact. Forrest and Guidetti started brightly enough, the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the Swede teed up a Johansen cut-back. Their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time. Kris Commons managed to fire Celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first-half, as Deila (right) roars in celebration . Commons put The Bhoys ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with Celtic . Commons is congratulated by his team-mates having put the Scottish Premiership leaders in front during the League Cup final . Referee Madden showed no hesitation when Forrest was pulled back by Dixon. ‘He was very quick to point to the spot that time,’ said a caustic McNamara afterwards. Forrest grabbed the ball, resisting Guidetti’s determined and very vocal efforts to do the same. The winger placed the ball down, then placed a weak effort too close to Cierzniak, the United keeper preventing a third goal. An unimpressed Deila explained afterwards: ‘Both of the players who were going to take a penalty, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons, were off the park. It looks like it was the first to the ball, but I don’t like that they argue about that. Forrest earned Celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from Dundee United's Paul Dixon in the closing stages . Several Celtic players wanted Guidetti to take the spot-kick but Forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty . ‘It is stupid. That is not the team spirit I want.’ As the final whistle signalled a significant day for the Norwegian, Guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff, clearly furious. He was retrieved by Mikael Lustig, possibly on Deila’s orders. ‘There is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers, especially, want to score goals,’ he continued. ‘Again, we have to put the team in front of ourselves. It is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience. This is not team spirit. It is individual thinking - and I don’t want anything to do with that.’ Collectively, Celtic have much to excite them. A Treble hovers on the horizon. The late night celebrations can wait.

"When he’s not missing sitters, Arsenal adore him. When they’re not jeering and cheering the decision to replace him, the fans like nothing more than belting out his name to the tune of 'Hey Jude'. Olivier Giroud’s world is a little mixed up right now, but it is never boring. Having missed three months of the campaign with a broken ankle, he is making up for lost time by cramming in the emotions.

Giroud was guilty of missed good chances in the first leg of the Champions League tie and took the blame was his side lost 3-1 at home. It is hard to see them getting out of that particular fix, but he has set about making amends for a poor display by getting back in the goals. 'He is strong mentally,' said manager Arsene Wenger. 'He can take criticism and respond.' Giroud was on target against Everton on Sunday and opened the scoring in the 64th minute at Loftus Road last night with his 13th goal of the season, one which gave Arsenal control of this lively London derby. Alexis Sanchez added the second, his first in eight games, and Wenger eased three points closer to the total of 72 he thinks will be required to be safely back in the Champions League next season. As for QPR, the relegation woes deepen and it is beginning to look ominous for them at the bottom.

They may have enjoyed a sunshine break in the Middle East but they returned to London to find the gulf was still as it was, even though Charlie Austin pulled a goal back with a terrific strike on the turn, eight minutes from time. Austin must hope England boss Roy Hodgson had not gone home early. Other than that, QPR were left with nothing to show for a spirited performance and a bold opening. They were the better team during a high-tempo first half-hour, hustling in midfield, and attacking Arsenal’s centre-halves in the air. It was physical at times. Kieran Gibbs was felled by a stray elbow from Bobby Zamora as the pair jostled for a ball in the air, but no foul was given and there was no obvious intent. Gibbs was able to continue. Onuoha was forced off in the first-half and this time Giroud was not the problem but Steven Caulker. The team-mates clashed heads and Onuoha was left with cut near his left eye. Per Mertesacker and Gabriel Paulista coped well with QPR’s initial aerial attack, and goalkeeper David Ospina commanded his area well during this period. Gabriel limped off before half-time with a hamstring strain, and Wenger fears he may be out for three weeks.

QPR went into this game having not won in nine London derbies. They have another chance to stop the rot on Saturday against Spurs. Austin was the only real threat, looking sharp and hungry around the fringes of the penalty box and quick on draw, striking the ball cleanly and forcing saves from Ospina. He went close with a flashing drive from 20 yards, which faded an inch or two wide. Ramsey’s team, however, could not find the goal which might have galvanised them and, as the first half wore on, they faded. Arsenal enjoyed more comfortable possession and Rob Green came under threat for the first time. Green responded with three solid saves to frustrate Giroud and one to deny Santi Cazorla. Wenger’s team came out with more urgency and purpose after the interval. 'It was important to get the ball on the ground, not only fight but fight and play,' said the Arsenal boss. 'In the second half, we did that. We fought and played.' Tomas Rosicky set the tone, tearing past Sandro to deliver a cross from the right which clipped Mesut Ozil on the shin and flew clear. Ozil callled for a penalty and the replays suggested he had a strong case. Karl Henry pull him by the shirt. It went unseen and Henry, having been booked in the first-half, escaped. Just as Arsenal started to wonder if it might be one of those days, Giroud pounced. An overlap and low cross from Gibbs was blocked by Clint Hill and, when it spilled his way, the French centre-forward reacted swiftly to turn it past Green from an acute angle. The second came from the same area. This time, it was Sanchez who, having come to life after the interval, jinked inside from the left, dummied, jinked again and screwed a low shot into the bottom corner. For Sanchez, it was the 19th of his debut season in England and, if Green was annoyed to be beaten at his near-post, he then produced the save of the night, pushing a deflecting low drive from Ozil onto the post. Austin pulled one back, his 15th of the season, but it was the Arsenal fans who filed out into the streets of Shepherd’s Bush singing Giroud’s name, while QPR fans went home fearing their time in the Barclays Premier League might be ticking away. 'We’re in a pressure situation,' said Ramsey. 'We need to start winning to stay in the division.'

At the opposite end, Williams and his central defensive partner Federico Fernandez produced assured performance to earn a clean sheet and keep the Swans in the top half of the table. Swansea captain Ashley Williams talks to Bafetimbi Gomis during their 1-0 win at Villa Park . DEFENCE - John O'Shea (West Ham vs SUNDERLAND) 7 . After the early withdrawal of Wes Brown through injury, O'Shea stepped up and drew on his extensive leadership to marshal the Sunderland defence. Alas, they couldn't quite hold out and claim a precious point in Dick Advocaat's first game in charge. John O'Shea attempts to block an effort from West Ham's Diafra Sakho . DEFENCE - Neil Taylor (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA) 7.5 . A hard-fought win for Swansea in which Taylor's block of a close-range Gabriel Agbonlahor effort early in the second-half proved crucial. Taylor also delivered plenty of crosses from the left, setting up Bafetimbi Gomis, who would later prove Swansea's match-winner. Neil Taylor slides in on Aston Villa's Leandro Bacuna during Swansea's win at Villa Park . MIDFIELD - Charlie Adam (STOKE CITY vs Crystal Palace) 7.5 . Was his usual dogged self in the Stoke midfield but couldn't inspire a victory as Palace emerged from the Britannia with all three points. Charlie Adam slides in on Jason Puncheon during Stoke's defeat to Crystal Palace . MIDFIELD - David Silva (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8.5 . The outstanding player in City's comfortable win over West Brom, which cut Chelsea's lead to three points - at least temporarily. The Spaniard tormented the Baggies defence throughout and scored City's third goal when he turned in Stevan Jovetic's shot. David Silva shoots for goal during Manchester City's win over West Brom on Saturday . MIDFIELD - Nabil Bentaleb (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 7.5 . A crazy game at White Hart Lane but Bentaleb stood out for his performance in the Spurs midfield, protecting the defence and picking passes to free the front-runners. Was fortunate the referee didn't spot a slap on Leonardo Ulloa, however. Nabil Bentaleb holed off a challenge from Leicester's Matthew James during Saturday's 4-3 win . FORWARD - Wilfried Bony (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8 . A day to savour for the Ivorian, who opened his account for Manchester City with a well-taken goal after 27 minutes. Having been involved in the game-changing sending off after just two minutes, Bony broke the deadlock with a neat flick turn and finish. Wilfried Bony celebrates after opening the scoring in City's 3-0 home win over West Brom . FORWARD - Olivier Giroud (Newcastle United vs ARSENAL) 8 . A striker in a real purple patch, Giroud continued his hot streak with a double up at Newcastle to take his run to nine in his last nine matches. His first may have been a fortuitous deflection on Danny Welbeck's header but his second was an effortless header. Olivier Giroud celebrates after scoring the second of his two goals for Arsenal at Newcastle United . FORWARD - Harry Kane (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 8.5 . Undoubtedly the player of the day, Kane claimed his first Premier League hat-trick with a bravura performance against Leicester at the Lane. Taking his season tally to 29 goals - including 19 in the Premier League - Kane was simply unstoppable on Saturday.

"Stuart Lancaster has indicated it will be England’s forwards who will come under the selection microscope ahead of his side’s Six Nations decider with France. The England coach has ruled out wholesale changes for Saturday’s Twickenham clash but hinted at freshening up his pack in a bid to counter France’s muscular eight. Dylan Hartley’s position at hooker is under threat from Leicester’s Tom Youngs while his club team-mate Geoff Parling could replace Dave Attwood at lock after both men impressed off the bench against Scotland. Stuart Lancaster watches his team win against Scotland, but may still make changes for the final game . Tom Youngs is one of several forwards who could be in line to start against France next Saturday . Dave Attwood, who wasn't as good against Scotland as he had been against Ireland, could be replaced . Alex Corbisiero could come into contention after Joe Marler was twice penalised for scrummaging offences, although concerns remain over the Northampton Saint’s shoulder. The blindside flanker position will also be considered with Tom Wood vying with James Haskell for a starting spot. ‘Selection is based on the team we think is best suited to beat France and that will be the priority,’ Lancaster said. Dylan Hartley, seen here tackling Blair Cowan, could also be replaced as Lancaster shuffles his pack . Tom Wood is likely to compete with James Haskell for the position of blindside flanker against France . ‘I won’t be making wholesale changes. There were enough positives in that performance from players to show that there’s real potential there and the impact from the bench was strong.’ England’s management and players insist they have learned lessons from previous Championship deciders which have seen them fall at the final hurdle, including against Wales two years ago and Ireland in 2011 — before Lancaster took charge. ‘Getting the balance right in the week and making sure we don’t overdo it and play too early in the week is key,’ he said. ‘My experience two years ago was that when it came to the game we were probably emotionally beyond the point we needed to be.’ Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious.","England coach Stuart Lancaster could shuffle his pack .

"Daniel Vettori says it's 'pretty obvious' he'll play his last one-day international for New Zealand in Sunday's Cricket World Cup final. Vettori flew from Melbourne with his team-mates on Wednesday to prepare for the final against the winner of Thursday's match between Australia and India in Sydney. He will play his 295th one-dayer for New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, 18 years and four days since he played his first. Vettori made his debut for New Zealand against Sri Lanka in 1997, aged 18. He has since taken 305 wickets and scored more than 2,200 one-day runs and will retire, aged 36, as New Zealand's most-capped player. Daniel Vettori said it is 'pretty obvious' he will retire after Sunday's World Cup final in Melbourne . Vettori poses for a picture on arrival at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday with the New Zealand team . Vettori said 'it's not what I'm thinking about. It's about enjoying the game, enjoying the build-up to a World Cup final.' New Zealand booked their place in the MCG showpiece with a thrilling four-wicket victory over South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland. The co-hosts have won all eight matches so far in the tournament on their way to the final. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming heaped praise on current incumbent Brendon McCullum for leading the Kiwis into their first ever World Cup final. The Black Caps had on six previous occasions reached the last four, including twice under Fleming, but never made the final. Vettori and Grant Elliott steered New Zealand to a thrilling final over, four-wicket victory over South Africa . Fleming, one of New Zealand's most successful captains, knows the setbacks his country have endured in the global tournament and admitted his incredulity at their feat in his column on the International Cricket Council's website. He said: 'There is a dream-like euphoria mixed with a pinch-me feeling of disbelief throughout the country, given the Black Caps' success in winning their way through to Melbourne and Sunday's final has finally smashed that World Cup glass ceiling by banishing all the years of semi-final heartaches. 'As a captain who suffered two of those heartaches, in 1999 and 2007, to see a New Zealand side playing with the freedom and quality that Brendon McCullum and his players are producing certainly warms the heart.' New Zealand captain Brendan McCullum arrives at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday . Ross Taylor was all smiles at Melbourne Airport as New Zealand arrived for the World Cup final . Tim Southee signs an autograph for a spectator at Melbourne Airport after a flight from New Zealand . Fleming, who played 111 Tests and 280 one-day internationals, knows their supporters will be outnumbered, whoever triumphs in the second semi-final, but hopes they can reproduce the form that has got them this far. 'It will be a tough one to negotiate,' he added. 'Either way, New Zealand will know they will face a crowd in which their own supporters will be in the minority by quite some margin. 'I am not sure it matters who McCullum's men end up playing because either opponent at this stage of the tournament will be top-notch. 'But the quality the Black Caps have produced has been exceptional time and time again in this tournament and I just hope they can do it once more on Sunday.

"Leon McKenzie, the Premier League striker turned delivery driver, added another chapter to his remarkable story as he won his first title as a professional boxer by claiming the international masters belt at the iconic York Hall. It was 10 years ago next month that McKenzie scored for Norwich in a famous 2-0 win over Manchester United at Carrow Road. It has been a decade of ups and downs since for 'Big McK', who endured crippling depression which culminated in a suicide attempt in a Bexleyheath hotel room. But, in boxing, the former Premier League star has found redemption and has been building to this moment since turning professional in June 2013. And, after making a living from taking his chances on the pitch, McKenzie did not let this one pass. Leon McKenzie poses after winning his first title as a professional boxer by at the iconic York Hall . McKenzie won his first title as a professional boxer by claiming the international masters belt . The soon-to-be 37-year-old dominated Croatian fighter Ivan Stupalo during Saturday night's victory . The 36-year- dominated the 10-round super-middleweight contest against Croatian Ivan Stupalo, winning ever round on referee Marcus McDonnell's card, to claim the strap which makes him the mandatory for the southern area title. He said: 'Look at how far I've come. If you look where I was five years ago, I'm lucky to even be here. I want to thank my team, this is a journey not just about me but about so many other people. I want to thank God – this is my second chance, my second career. 'It was my first 10 rounder and I enjoyed it in there. I had to be cautious, I had to move around and use my jab. I stuck to the game plan and now I've got this belt and the journey continues. I'm 37 in May – how many 37-year-olds do you know who could do that?' Former footballer McKenzie celebrates his win with his family at the Iconic York Hall on Saturday night . Boxing talent McKenzie has made the venue is home having fought all but one of his fights there . Boxing talent is very much in the blood for McKenzie. His father Clinton, his trainer and cornerman here at York Hall, is a former British and European light-welterweight champion. His uncle Duke, meanwhile, remains Britain's only modern three-weight world champion. In fact his father made his professional debut in this very ring in Bethnal Green in October 1976. Then, in 1981, Clinton won his British title here too. It was also a happy hunting ground for uncle Duke, who won both of his fights in this famous corner of the East End. Now Croydon-born McKenzie has made this his home with all but one of his previous fights happening here while his opponent was beaten on his only other outing here, when he challenged Andreas Evangelou for the vacant international masters light-heavyweight title. Mckenzie wins his first title in the ring at York Hall and gives his mum a hug as his Dad Clinton looks on . Stupalo, of Split, has since dropped down seven pounds to the super-middleweight division and represented a real step up in class for McKenzie, who, for the first time, was facing an opponent with a winning record. But operating from behind his stiff southpaw jab, McKenzie dominated a cagey first round and occasionally found a home for his straight left to body. He maintained a composed pace in the second, evading Stupalo's rare forward forays. McKenzie forced the Croatian on to the ropes and ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory . In the fifth, McKenzie began to let his hands go and opened up a cut on his opponent's head with intelligent use of his backhand. It was not until the seventh road that Stupalo got through, but McKenzie just flashed a grin and got back to his business. By the eighth the man from Croatia was spending a lot of time on the ropes but McKenzie was unable to find a finishing blow and instead ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory. The fight was part of a Goodwin Boxing Promotion shown live and exclusive on Matchroom Fight Pass.","Leon McKenzie claimed his first title as a professional boxer on Saturday .

"Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini has revealed he does not like seeing foreign-born players on Italy's national team. The former Manchester City boss was responding to this weekend's call ups of Sampdoria's Brazilian-born striker Eder and Palermo's Argentine-born midfielder Franco Vazquez to Italy's squad. Vazquez's mother is Italian while Eder gained citizenship through more distant relatives. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini thinks that players not born in Italy shouldn't represent the national team . Speaking at a Serie A meeting Monday, Mancini said:, 'The Italian national team should be Italian. 'An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.'

"Twice winner Maria Sharapova and reigning champion Flavia Pennetta advanced to the third round of the BNP Paribas Open on Saturday, though in sharply contrasting fashion. Russian Sharapova, the second seed, made a fast start to overpower Belgian Yanina Wickmayer early on but then ran into much stiffer resistance before grinding out a 6-1 7-5 win after one hour and 45 minutes of baseline battle. Fifteenth-seeded Italian Pennetta overcame an initial bout of nerves to finish strong as she launched her title defence with a commanding 6-4 6-2 win over American Madison Brengle in the first match of the day on the stadium court. Maria Sharapova is searching for a third title at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells . Belgian Yanina Wickmayer put up some resistance before bowing out in straight sets . The world No 2 admitted having trouble in the second set before setting up a clash with Victoria Azarenka . Sharapova, champion at Indian Wells in 2006 and 2013, broke Wickmayer's serve three times to sweep through the opening set in just over half an hour, a crunching forehand crosscourt winner putting her ahead 6-1. However, the Belgian was a very different proposition in the second set which went comfortably with serve until a marathon 10th game where Wickmayer saved four match points before holding to level at 5-5. Sharapova held serve to lead 6-5 and finally converted a sixth match point in the 12th when the Belgian hit a backhand long. 'She's a tough opponent,' world No 2 Sharapova said in a courtside interview. 'She hits the ball quite hard and has an unbelievable serve. I started the match well but the second set was a different story.' Eugenie Bouchard made light work of her second round opponent Lucie Hradecka . The Canadian was ponly on court for just under an hour before breezing into the third round . The Russian will next meet Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who brushed aside Belgian Kirsten Flipkens 6-2 6-4. Pennetta, best known for her doubles prowess, broke Brengle's serve once in a tightly contested opening set and twice more in the second to wrap up victory in 75 minutes at a sun-drenched Indian Wells Tennis Garden. 'I was nervous in the beginning,' the 33-year-old from Brindisi, a winner of 10 WTA titles, said after ending the match with a rasping forehand crosscourt winner. 'Last year here, I played so well and I have such good memories. This morning I woke up and I was a little bit shaky. So I was trying to be focused on what I had to do, and not rush.' Pennetta will next face Australian Samantha Stosur, who beat American wildcard Taylor Townsend 6-4 6-2. Reigning champion Flavia Pennetta got the defence of her title off to a winning start against Madison Brengle .

"NFL star Tom Brady worried Patriots Nation and probably caused Bill Belichick to spit out his morning coffee on Saturday after he posted a video of himself jumping off a giant cliff. The 37-year-old, who was with Gisele Bundchen when he made the leap, shared the video on Facebook along with the message: 'Never doing that again! #AirBrady'. After the 15-year veteran shared the video on Facebook in the morning, video of him playing basketball with NBA legend Michael Jordan began to emerge on social media during the afternoon. Scroll down for video . Tom Brady posted a video of himself going cliff diving while he was vacationing during the NFL offseason . Brady was with supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen and their children when he made the leap in Costa Rica . The New England Patriots quarterback launched himself off the edge of a cliff and didn't look back . The 37-year-old star, who has won four Super Bowls during the course of his career, landed safely below . Brady posted the video on Facebook on Saturday and then was seen playing basketball with Michael Jordan . After Brady posted the video of the dive onto his Facebook page, he indicated it might be his last big jump . Brady and his family were recently in Costa Rica on a family holiday, NESN reported. The pickup basketball game, which also featured golfer Keegan Bradley, took place in the Bahamas, according to FanSided. Jordan, who won six NBA titles over the course of his career and is now the  majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets, can be heard talking trash during the video clip of the pickup game. Tom Brady (left) golfed with NBA legend Michael Jordan (right) and PGA pro Keegan Bradley (next to him) Before he was seen on the cliff or in the Bahamas, Brady hit the beach with Bundchen and their kids . The three professionals also played golf together at some point, as shown in a photo Bradley posted on Instagram. Brady is taking a well-earned break after guiding New England to a thrilling Super Bowl victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona last month. The 28-24 victory over Seattle at the University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1 clinched an elusive fourth Super Bowl ring for Brady, a decade after he won his third. The four-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has earned nearly $150million in salary alone over the course of his career, according to Spotrac. If Brady wins another title, he will be the only quarterback in history with five Super Bowl wins. He would have to win the big game two more times to equal Jordan's six. Jordan, 52, earned about $94million in salary during his 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association . Bundchen and daughter Vivian rocked their two-piece bikinis for the beach trip on the clear and sunny day . The tight-knit family took a walk down the beach shoreline just before sunset to end their day at the beach . The win in Glendale, Arizona, was Brady's fourth Super Bowl title and it might not be his last .","Tom Brady was with wife Gisele Bundchen when he took the daring dive .

"England coach Peter Moores should be removed from his current position and put in charge of the 'kids', according to former captain Michael Vaughan. Moores, handed a second stint as head coach last April, has come under intense fire since England's defeat by Bangladesh on Monday condemned them to an early return from the World Cup. Vaughan believes Moores' talents have been wasted: 'Moores was at his best working with the Lions (development team) many years ago,' Vaughan said in the Daily Telegraph. Peter Moores (centre) oversaw a disastrous World Cup campaign with England in Australia and New Zealand . Moores would be better off working with young cricketers, according to Michael Vaughan . 'The job of England coach has become about man management, helping with tactics and picking the right team. At international level you do not have time to coach. 'What is the best thing for English cricket going forward? I believe it is time to remover Peter Moores from his current position and put him in a job where he can have the biggest impact on English cricket.' 'I always say the best coach works with kids and development programmes between the age of 15 and 20.' Vaughan said England's conservative approach to the one-day game had resulted in them being left behind by the likes of Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India, while even Ireland, Vaughan said, were playing better one-day cricket. Vaughan played for England and oversaw some amazing success while he was captaining the side . Moores should be removed from his current position and put him in a job where he can have the biggest impact on English cricket, according to Vaughan . 'England started the tournament by picking a Test match batting line-up for one-day cricket ,' Vaughan said. '(Managing director) Paul Downton said last night England needed more players appearing in Twenty20 leagues around the world to gain experience. 'Well, Alex Hales has been doing that but England did not pick him. Ravi Bopara, Michael Carberry, Luke Wright, Ben Stokes and Jason Roy, they all played Big Bash cricket but were ignored. England should have looked at these guys last year. England vice-captain Jos Buttler looks disappointed after England were eliminated from the World Cup . A defeat by Bangladesh left England unable to progress from their Pool in the World Cup . 'You do not need five gears any more, you need eight. 'England do not get the fact that you need four Jos Buttlers, not one. You need four or five who have the ability to strike it at a rate of 120 per 100 balls.' Vaughan said the World Cup had been a wasted opportunity for England to change tack. 'I felt they had a free hand here, with no expectation of success,' he said. 'They had the chance to play expansive cricket and press 'G' for gamble. Instead they played the safest, and most timid way.'","Peter Moores was handed a send stint as England head coach last April .

"England's hopes of landing their first Grand Slam of Stuart Lancaster’s reign have been dashed again as Ireland deservedly earned a victory that leaves them red-hot favourites to retain their Six Nations title. Lancaster’s men rarely threatened reproduce the form that saw them open the Championship with wins over Wales and Italy as Robbie Henshaw’s second-half try, allied to 14 points from the boot of Jonny Sexton, inflicted a demoralising defeat on the visitors. England travelled across the Irish Sea with high hopes of making it three wins from three but were persistently penalised at the breakdown by referee Craig Joubert as they struggled to gain a foothold in the match. VIDEO - Scroll down to see clips from the game . Robbie Henshaw (left) goes over the line to score a try for Ireland and take the game away from England in the Six Nations .

England's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against Ireland and Henshaw . Henshaw (centre) is congratulated by his Ireland team-mate Jared Payne after scoring the try against England . While not as comprehensive as the 2013 defeat to Wales at the Millennium Stadium, or indeed their loss to Ireland on the same Aviva Stadium turf in 2011, in some ways this was just as demoralising in a home World Cup year. There were some fine individual performances from England, with Billy Vunipola outstanding at No8, but collectively the visitors were no match for Joe Schmidt’s unbeaten Irish. England, desperate for some silverware three years into Lancaster’s tenure, must now regroup to face Scotland and France at Twickenham but they will do in the knowledge their Grand Slam hopes have been shattered again. They retain a small chance of winning the Championship, but that will prove of little comfort in the light of this comprehensive defeat. Dublin was lashed by wind, rain and sleet in the hours before kick off but mercifully the weather relented to leave the Aviva Stadium pitch slippery but not treacherous. England had made two changes to their starting line-up from the side that beat Italy a fortnight ago with Jack Nowell preferred to Jonny May on the left wing and Alex Goode replacing Mike Brown after the Harlequins full back failed to recover from concussion he suffered against the Azzurri. Johnny Sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for Ireland's victory .

Ireland: Kearney, Bowe, Payne, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray, McGrath, Best, Ross, Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, O'Brien, Murphy. Tries: Henshaw . Penalties: Sexton (4) England: Goode, Watson, Joseph, Burrell, Nowell, Ford, Youngs, Marler, Hartley, Cole, Attwood, Kruis, Haskell, Robshaw, B Vunipola. Penalties: Ford (2) Drop goals: Ford . Referee: Craig Joubert . Attendance: 51,500 . Jordi Murphy was Ireland’s only change as he started at No8 in place of Jamie Heaslip, who is recovering from the broken vertebra in his back, caused by an intentional knee from France lock Pascal Pape which led to a 10-week ban. Ireland went into the game on the back of a nine-match winning run, including autumn victories over Australia and South Africa, while England were buoyed by a four-game unbeaten run against today’s hosts. England were desperate to avoid another slow start after going behind in both their first two games of the Championship but, following a lengthy pre-match build up which left the players on the field for several minutes prior to kick off, they were sluggish out of the blocks again. George Ford turned over the ball on the half-way line seconds after kick off and James Haskell infringed at the breakdown after Ireland whipped the ball wide down the left. Jonny Sexton kicked the penalty from 40 metres, with barely two minutes on the clock, before England conceded another penalty from the kick off and Ireland roared back into their opponents half. With the capacity crowd behind Ireland, Sexton hoisted an awkward cross kick which Nowell was unable to gather and the Irish forwards thundered at England with wave after wave of attacks. Another penalty was conceded under the posts, which Sexton converted, as England found themselves 6-0 down having barely drawn breath. The visitors finally gained some sustained possession and Ford was influential in stretching the Irish defence as Luther Burrell and Ben Youngs both made telling incursions before the England fly half slotted a neat drop goal on 12 minutes to get his side on the scoreboard. Ford missed a long-range penalty attempt and England blew another excellent chance after fine build-up play saw Ford kick a penalty to touch only for Dylan Hartley to throw straight to Devin Toner and allow Ireland to clear.

Dave Attwood (upper left) of England wins the line-out ball under pressure from Peter O'Mahoney (right) of Ireland . George Ford replied for England but Stuart Lancaster's side could not run Ireland close in the game at the Aviva Stadium . Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien was taken off after 24 minutes after he was seen lying prone on the floor before attempting to stand up, only to lurch and stagger alarmingly as he battled the medics to stay on. The flanker did not return. Sexton kicked his third penalty as Ireland went 9-3 in front with 30 minutes gone but the fly half could not stretch Ireland’s lead further when he missed a difficult penalty attempt after Anthony Watson was penalised for off-side. Ireland took a six-point lead in at half time as England clung on after 40 minutes that saw that repeatedly penalised by South African referee Craig Joubert. Ireland were fastest out of the blocks in the second half and a sharp break by Conor Murray saw Robbie Henshaw hack through only for Goode to save the day for England with some brilliant defensive work behind the posts. Joubert again penalised England at the breakdown on 47 minutes and Sexton extended his side’s lead to nine points with his fourth penalty and Ireland struck the killer blow when Murray chiped deep into England’s dead-ball area and Henshaw out-jumped Goode to touch down.

Both sides new that victory would give them the upper hand in the race to win the RBS Six Nations . England's players line up for the national anthem prior to the start of their game against Ireland at the Aviva Stadium . Sexton’s conversion made it 19-3 after 53 minutes and it was impossible to see a way back for England. Ford added his first penalty to chip away at Ireland’s lead after a bulldozing run by Billy Vunipola and gave his side hope after 67 minutes with another three points . It proved a false hope as Ireland held on. Even Jack Nowell’s late try attempt was chalked off when Joubert spotted a forward pass. It summed up England’s day.","Jonny Sexton led the way for Ireland with four penalties and Robbie Henshaw scored a try .

"Siem de Jong's injury-wrecked season has been cut short after John Carver confirmed the midfielder will return for pre-season training - following his recovery from a collapsed lung. The former Ajax captain who signed for £6million in the summer will miss the remaining ten games, having only made two appearances for the entire season. The Newcastle boss assured the De Jong that he wouldn't be rushed back from such a serious injury. Siem de Jong will miss the rest of the campaign and return for pre-season after suffering a collapsed lung . He said: 'Siem will be back in pre-season. It is one of those we just need to test the water with and see how he is. I've said from the start there's definitely no pressure on him.' Brought in by the cub to add some class and technical ability, the Dutchman managed only one start before suffering a serious thigh injury. De Jong's capture was seen as somewhat of a coup by the club and very much whetted the appetite of the Newcastle fans. But a series of injuries and bad luck have seen the supporters disappointed, with many labeling the club vice-captain a flop.

"Barcelona are thought to be looking at Douglas Costa of Shakhtar and will watch him when the Ukrainian club face Bayern Munich in their Champions League clash on Wednesday. The Brazilian is seen as the alternative to Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus - who recently signed a new deal with the German side. Mundo Deportivo say that Barca have been tracking the player for two years but face competition from Serie A giants Roma for his signature. Douglas Costa is being scouted by Barcelona as they contemplate making a move from the silky attacker . AS and Marca were keen to talk about Real Madrid's embarrassing defeat and Iker Casillas' performance at home to Schalke despite qualifying for the next round of the Champions League. Marca wrote, 'The fans pointed at Casillas and Bale and said goodbye to the team with a tremendous dressing-down,' this was following the goalkeeper's errors which led to a couple of the goals and a less than inspiring performance from the world's most expensive signing. Carlo Ancelotti's damning quotes: 'We won't get very far like this,' were a major talking point for AS and the Spanish goalkeeper wasn't scared to admit he played his part in the defeat, 'a great part of the blame is mine, but nobody is exempt.'

Porto qualified for the Champions League last eight after cruising past Basle in impressive style and their front pages were keen to praise 'the dragons.' Abola went for the simple headline of 'Fantastic dragons,' while Record called them 'Super' as they booked their place in the next round.

The Oscar winner and father of actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie does not waste time going after Obama either, saying almost right off the bat; 'President Obama does not love Israel.'

"A radical British Islamist who stabbed a football fan in the head with a pen and skipped bail to join ISIS has uploaded a new photograph showing him posing with a notorious German jihadi in Syria. Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, from Luton, fled the UK before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End. Since joining ISIS he has spent much of his time of social media posting provocative message aimed at his largely Western audience - including threatening MPs at the coming general election and attempting to justify the brutal burning to death of murdered Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh. Now he uploaded a photograph showing him posing arm in arm with notorious German jihadi Denis Cuspert, who had been a relatively successful rapper under the name Deso Dogg before trading in his faux-gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group. Militants: Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, from Luton has uploaded a photograph showing him posing arm in arm with notorious German rapper turned jihadi Denis Cuspert, 39 (right) Aziz, an ex office worker from Luton, previously told his followers on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir [non-believer] in the back of a head [sic] with a pen in London for insulting the Prophet Mohammed.' Threats: Abu Rahin Aziz, pictured in Syria, told his Twitter followers to attack MPs and servicemen . Last year he was sentenced to 36 weeks for the offence - but by the time the case came to court, he had already skipped bail and travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS. Aziz, 33, who tweets under the name 'Abu Adbullah Britani', is an associate of hate cleric Anjem Choudary who was once a member of radical group 'Muslims Against Crusaders'. Although his Twitter pages have been repeatedly removed  thanks to the Anonymous cyber activist group's #OPISIS campaign targeting jihadi social media users, Aziz repeatedly sets up new accounts, which he users to taunt the West. In January Aziz contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK. He wrote: 'Still deciding to what to do with my British passport, could burn it, flush it down the toilet.' Also in January, Aziz used Twitter to incite violence from jihadis who are still living in the West. 'Muslims in the West given instructions to strike the enemies of Islam and Muslims within their own countries,' Aziz wrote. 'Wonder who will strike first? 'Could it be UK first to be attacked? They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam. 'Maybe sit and wait outside TA offices? Maybe some other interests, maybe an MP. Hmm interesting. UK can blame foreign policy.' Jihadi: Aziz has posted several photos of himself on Twitter dressed in military clothes and holding a rifle . In another message, Aziz wrote: 'A call upon Muslims in Europe to carry out attacks whether by explosive devices, bullets, car, rocks or even stones.' A separate tweet  made a reference to British aid worker Alan Henning, who was beheaded by ISIS' executioner-in-chief, Mohammed Emwazi - also known as 'Jihadi John' - in October last year. 'All kufar [non-Muslims] even if they were good i.e. Alan Henning, Mother Theresa will burn in hell because they died upon disbelief,' Aziz wrote. Aziz's latest tweets showed him posing with German rapper turned jihadi, Denis Cuspert. The 39-year-old, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with militants before becoming the group's main propagandist. In February it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the Islamic State - was being spied on for the FBI by a Syrian woman he thought was his wife. The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, on Twitter which was captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.' Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013 . The spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his ISIS colleagues before escaping to Turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the US, according to the German newspaper Bild. The paper said German and American intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation, Fox News reports. The unidentified woman fled Syria after her handlers told her it was no longer safe to continue the mission as militants had began to hunt and flush out infiltrators. She is now thought to be in the US. German newspaper Bild believe Cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past. In Germany he fathered three children by three different women, including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an ISIS poster boy. Cuspert arrived in Syria in 2013 from a so-called German jihadi colony in Egypt. German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have joined the Islamic State . Radical: Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster (left) traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam . Rapping jihadis: Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers - including Germany's Deso Gogg (left) and America's Douglas McAuthur McCain (right)  have joined ISIS in recent years . Last month the US added rapper Cuspert to its list of 'global terrorists' - freezing all his assets under US control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future. The State Department said: 'Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks -– individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries.' Last November, Cuspert was compared to Nazi Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for his ability to appeal to young, disillusioned people in Europe while providing an alternative ideology. He spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam. He has been known to oversee the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region. It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'.","Ex-officer worker Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, skipped bail to join ISIS in January .

"New Rangers boss Stuart McCall admits he would never have landed the job if Mike Ashley was still pulling the strings at Ibrox. The former Motherwell manager has been put in charge until the end of the season. The decision to replace caretaker Kenny McDowall, who has now left the club, is the second major upheaval at the club in the space of a week following Dave King's boardroom coup last Friday. Stuart McCall has been named Rangers manager until the end of the season . McCall, like the club's new board, is a man the Light Blues faithful can trust following his trophy-laden stint as Rangers player during the mid-90s. But the 50-year-old does not believe the former regime, backed by Newcastle United owner Ashley's millions, would have welcomed him through the front door on Edmiston Drive so readily. He said: 'I don't think I'd have been offered the job if the new regime hadn't come in. 'I had a chat with John Gilligan yesterday and Paul Murray late last night. It was a whirlwind. 'I'm delighted for the people in charge of the club because I know how much it means to them. I'm delighted for the supporters because that is what they want. McCall will attempt to guide Rangers to promotion from the Championship to the Scottish Premiership . 'That's not to say the people on the board are going to be great successes. But whatever they do, it will be for the good of the club.' McCall hopes he can lead the club to promotion and claim the job on a permanent basis. But he acknowledges the task will be a tough one. The former nine-in-a-row midfielder - who will give up his coaching duties with Scotland while in charge at Ibrox - said: 'My first question was: What do they deem a success? 'You could turn things around slightly, get to the play-off final, get your goalie sent-off after five minutes and then lose on penalty kicks. These are the thin lines between success and failure. 'I think success would be if we could start putting results together, getting belief in everyone, smiles on faces and turn things around.'","Stuart McCall has taken over as Rangers boss until the end of the season .

"Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has been slammed by social media for his appearance in the new Oral B campaign, labelled the worst marketing campaign ever by unimpressed fans. It could have been the photo of him batting with an electric toothbrush, or holding a winning trophy labelled 'The Gnashes,' or even going undercover as a dentist for Oral B, but whichever it was, keyboard warriors acted immediately. He was mocked by being renamed 'Michael Plaque' and called a 'sellout' and 'money-grubber' as he is rumoured to be making £256,000 for the endorsement deal. VIDEO Scroll down to see Michael Clarke's Oral B advert . Australia captain Michael Clarke has been roundly criticised on social media for his Oral B TV advert . Clarke dropped the bat and picked up the toothbrush for his new 'True Blue Challenge' campaign with Oral B . Facebook has slammed Clarke for his endorsement calling him a 'sellout' and 'money-grubber' Clarke had donned these new pair of whites for a campaign called the 'True Blue Challenge,' aimed to boost Australia's oral health and overtake England by 'bowling them over.' 'This is outrageous Australia, the Poms are laughing at us, it's time to take action,' Clarke says in his Oral B adverts. 'I love beating the Poms on the cricket field, it's time to do it again with my oral health.' Social media trolls even furthered their displeasure by comparing his campaign with his performance on the cricket field. 'Can't score more than 40 in grade cricket...may as well advertise mouthwash,' one disgruntled viewer said. 'Glad to see he managed to get through the entire commercial without an injury!' said another. 'I love beating the Poms on the cricket field... It's time to do it again with my oral health,' Clarke says in advert . 'Michael Plaque' has been trending as Clarke's new name since the campaign was initiated . Facebookers have slammed the Australian cricket captain for the endorsement deal . Oral B initially began Clarke's involvement as a 'guess who' campaign with many fans recognising his tattoo . The 33-year-old even took to going undercover as a dentist for his Oral B endorsement deal . Clarke was made an ambassador for Spartan in 2012 which made much more sense to many of his fans . Clarke's tattoos have also received ridicule for their appearance in the adverts, especially the Arabic writing scrawled up his left arm, loosely translating to 'the pain of discipline is nothing like the pain of disappointment.' Viewers took to asking him to step down as captain due to the embarrassment of the endorsement deal calling him a 'goose' and a 'commercial whore.' Clarke has previously become an ambassador for Australian sport products company, Spartan, in 2012. He received mostly praise for this deal among fans. The 33-year-old will be aiming to hit back at his critics with an inspiring performance when the tournament co-hosts face Sri Lanka on Sunday.","Michael Clarke has been ridiculed on Facebook for new campaign .

"Southampton's early exit from the FA Cup means that Ronald Koeman's side have a weekend off, and the south-coast outfit headed to snowy Switzerland for a mid-season break. On Thursday, Koeman posted a picture of himself kitted out in full ice hockey kit, but now a video has emerged of the team in action... and they certainly shouldn't quit their day jobs any time soon. The Saints returned to winning ways on Tuesday night against Crystal Palace, but their recent form has seen them slip out of top four in the Premier League.

"Newcastle United have admitted that if they were look to elsewhere for a head coach, they would consider British or foreign candidates - but he'd need to be 'tactically astute.' During a fans forum meeting Managing Director Lee Charnley and Ambassador Bob Moncur were among the representatives, as the supporters grilled them on issues at the club. With John Carver failing to win over the fans with some dour displays from his side, Newcastle's hierarchy admitted that they could look to someone else for inspiration. John Carver (right) was handed the reins at Newcastle until at least the end of the current season . They said during the fans forum: 'In the event the board should need to look for an external candidate in the summer for the position of Head Coach, the board would not have to start the process all over again due to the level of detail and work which went into the initial search. 'The board would look for an individual who would fit into the club's structure, someone who is tactically astute, and who has a track record of developing young players and the ability to improve players. 'The club has no concerns over whether a potential new head coach is British or from overseas and deems other criteria far more important.' Carver addresses the officials following the clubs controversial defeat at home to Manchester United . With fans keen to know the prospect of who the club's next manager will be, Charnley was quick to reiterate that Carver was the best man for job until at least the summer. 'The board stated that it will not consider the matter again until the end of the season,' they added. 'The board went through a lengthy process in terms of speaking to a number of people about coming to the club as a potential head coach.

"Children aged 12 to 13 have made or been part of sexually explicit videos, research shows (file pic) More than one in ten children aged 12 to 13 have made or been part of a sexually explicit video, according to shocking new research. Nearly one in ten in the same age group are worried that they are addicted to porn, a survey of nearly 700 children for the NSPCC's ChildLine service found. And nearly a fifth said they had seen porn images that had shocked or upset them. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography. She said: 'Young people are turning to the internet to learn about sex and relationships. 'We know they are frequently stumbling across porn, often unintentionally, and they are telling us very clearly that this is having a damaging and upsetting effect on them. 'Girls in particular have said they feel like they have to look and behave like porn stars to be liked by boys. 'We absolutely have to talk to young people about sex, love, respect and consent as soon as we feel they are ready, to ensure that they gain a proper perspective between real life relationships and the fantasy world of porn.' Peter Liver, director of ChildLine, said children reported that watching porn made them feel depressed, gave them body image issues and put pressure on them to engage in sex acts they are not ready for. A report by charity ChildWise in 2013/14 revealed that website Pornhub was among the top five favourite sites named by boys aged 11-16. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography . And young people post approximately 18,000 messages regarding exposure to porn on the ChildLine discussion forums every month. Mr Liver said: 'The Government recently proposed plans for children aged 11 upwards to be taught about rape and sexual consent as part of PSHE in schools. 'This would include discussion around what they have learnt from watching pornography. 'Across society, we need to remove the embarrassment and shame that exists around talking about porn - which is why we have launched a ChildLine campaign to help young people to make more informed choices.'","Children aged 12 and 13 say they have been in sexually explicit videos .

"Clarke Carlisle previously threw himself in front of a lorry in a bid to take his own life, leaving him injured and the driver unable to get behind the wheel again . The lorry driver who struck former footballer Clarke Carlisle, who had thrown himself into the vehicle's path, has said he may never be able to drive an HGV again. Earlier this year the 35-year-old Premier League defender revealed how he had jumped in front of a lorry near his home on the A64, near York after battling severe depression. He was struck by Darren Pease who feared both would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. Mr Pease, 53, told the Daily Mirror: 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon.' The lorry driver, who had been travelling to Driffield in east Yorkshire at the time of the crash, said he spent Christmas wondering if Carlisle, who has three children, was going to survive. Mr Pease said he now struggles to leave the house and has not been able to return to work. He added: 'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this? What am I going to tell everybody? 'What do you say? It's unreal, the shock meant I couldn't stand or walk, I was in a wheelchair.' Mr Pease also struggles if images of Carlisle appear on the television and has to quickly switch it off. Carlisle was released from hospital last month, around six weeks after the accident on December 22. Scroll down for video . He said after he was released he realised he was unwell. He had been struggling after he was told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. Carlisle admitted he went straight to a casino and blew money he and his wife had saved, only hours later on December 20, to be charged with drink-driving. It was then that the former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association decided that his children could not have a criminal father and he decided he wanted to die. Carlisle was recently released from hospital six weeks after he was injured in a collision with a lorry . After the accident Carlisle said he had 'overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment.' He was taken to hospital and suffered cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. He is now having counselling. Mr Pease has had to take sick leave from his £19,500-a-year job and is receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Carlisle was the first player to win Countdown and in 2002 was awarded the title 'Britain's Brainiest Footballer' In 2011 he became the first footballer to appear on BBC's topical debate show Question Time (far left) After Carlisle spoke out about the incident sports personalities and football clubs posted messages of support. Carlisle, considered one of the most intelligent footballers of his generation with 10 Grade A GCSEs, made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs in a career that spanned 16 years. He was the first football player to win Countdown in 2002 and BBC Sport awarded him the title 'Britain's brainiest footballer.' He has also appeared on Question Time twice. Carlisle (left) played for Northampton Town in 2013 and was pictured (right) after the road accident . His most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division.

"England have denied that their worst ever World Cup has been the result of them being tied up in knots by an obsession with statistics and analysis. The lack of freedom in their batting and their apparent reluctant to think on their feet while bowling has been the biggest problem for England in a World Cup where they have failed to live up to even the most modest of expectations. And Peter Moores appeared to sum up their whole constipated approach when he said in the aftermath of England’s humiliating defeat by Bangladesh that he would have to ‘look at the data’ to see what went wrong. Paul Farbrace speaks to the assembled media ahead of England's dead rubber against Afghanistan on Friday . Ian Bell is pictured arriving at Sydney Airport following England's embarrassing defeat against Bangladesh . James Taylor reacts after he loses his wicket en route to a humiliating defeat against Bangladesh . Yet Paul Farbrace, the man who led Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup and the World Twenty20 titles last year before throwing in his lot with England, says that whatever has led to England’s shortcomings here, it is not statistics. ‘There has been a lot said about stats and team meetings,’ said assistant coach Farbrace. ‘But when I was with Sri Lanka we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than England do. There’s no question about that. ‘We had a team of six people working with Sri Lanka during the World Twenty20 who provided us with data straight after a game and the next day. Our preparation from fantastic statistics helped us win the final.’ It is Moores who is accused of being driven by the numbers. ‘It’s tough on him but he accepts the criticism and knows it comes with the territory,’ said Farbrace. ‘It’s unfair that Peter is the one in the spotlight. We’re all in this together and we’re all responsible for what has happened.’ The theory that England have been stifled by outdated plans has been given credence by the fact that captain Eoin Morgan, who was expected to be a free spirit here, has repeatedly brought up statistics in press conferences. ‘I can’t answer for them. I can’t say why they said that,’ said Farbrace of Moores and Morgan. ‘All I know is we’re not spending hours talking about statistics and numbers. We don’t do that. Bangladesh celebrate their shock victory over England in the World Cup earlier this week . Eoin Morgan was expected to be a free spirit at the World Cup but has been bogged down by statistics . ‘What we do is allow people to look at footage. Everybody has analysis of the opposition downloaded onto their iPads and it’s up to them if they want to look at it or not. There are lots of different ways that people like to learn. ‘For instance, Ian Bell is someone who is very well planned and methodical. He wants to know how many net bowlers we have, whether there’s a left-arm seamer, how many right-handers there are. And he probably studies the footage in detail. But Moeen Ali will come up to me and say ‘listen Farb, I’m not interested in what’s on my iPad, I just want to go and bat. And he has had praise for his approach. You have to cater for everybody.’ Farbrace has created an excellent impression around the England team amid the wreckage of this tour and, with his experience of leading Sri Lanka to limited-overs success, it would not be a surprise if he takes greater responsibility for the ‘new era’ of one-day cricket they have to produce. ‘There will be a lot of discussion and debate about how we move forward and what the next step is,’ said Farbrace. ‘We have the Caribbean series where there will be a few changes and Alastair Cook and others will come back. ‘We made good progress in Test cricket with the Indian series last year and we have to keep building on that. One-day cricket is a completely different story and we have to make sure that by the time we play New Zealand in 50-over cricket this summer we have clear direction. ‘There’s a fantastic opportunity now for players in county cricket to stick their hands up and say ‘there are spaces in that England team and I’m going to take my chance’. There has never been a better time for people to do that to be honest.’","England were knocked out of the World Cup after they lost to Bangladesh .

"Manchester United keeper David de Gea has revealed it is unthinkable for the club to finish outside of the Champions League places for two seasons in a row. United return to domestic action at home to Aston Villa on Saturday with two wins against top four rivals Tottenham and Liverpool having given Louis van Gaal's side some breathing space behind Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal. Now De Gea has underlined just how important it is for United to get back in to European football's blue riband competition after spending this season in the wildnerness. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (left) insists the club must qualify for the Champions League . De Gea has played an instrumental role in United's rise to the top four of the Premier League so far . 'We have to qualify for the Champions League, no matter what,' said De Gea. 'We already missed out last season, and a team like Manchester United cannot do that two years in a row.' While Van Gaal's team have struggled for consistency this season, De Gea has been outstanding yet again in goal. The Spanish international's own future remains in doubt as he only has one year left on his contract at the end of this season. The 24-year-old is currently on international duty with Spain, who play Holland on Tuesday night . De Gea is happy to have his countryman Victor Valdes (left) in the Manchester United squad with him . However, De Gea recognises how much he owes the English game for the manner in which it has enabled to improve his game in recent seasons. 'I'm a composed, calm type, which helps me in my profession,' he revealed. 'As a keeper, you need to convey a sense of calm to the rest of the team. 'But, truth be told, English football has changed me a great deal. 'I've developed a lot physically, I have greatly improved my concentration and have generally improved all aspects of my game.

"Andy Sullivan's bid to qualify for his first major championship ended in emphatic fashion on the second day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal on Friday. Sullivan needed to win his third European Tour title of the season or finish alone in second to climb into the world's top 50 before Monday's deadline to secure a place in the Masters in a fortnight's time. However, the 28-year-old from Nuneaton could only add a 75 to his opening 74 in Agadir, with his hopes extinguished courtesy of a quintuple-bogey nine on the par-four fourth, his 13th hole of the day. Englishman Andy Sullivan, pictured in action in Agadir, has failed in his bid to qualify for the Masters . 'There was a lot of pressure on my shoulders to perform,' Sullivan told Sky Sports 4. 'I tried to take it off as much as possible but came into it with not really enough preparation. 'I hit a lot of good shots but the bad ones really hurt me. That's golf and I am lucky to just have the opportunity to get into the Masters to be honest. If someone had said that at the start of the year I would have said 'no chance'. 'To have the opportunity to do it was amazing but it's golf, it comes back and bites you a lot of the time. I need to go away and work harder and bounce back from this, but I am not going to be too downhearted. I look back on the golf I have played this year and I have played well.' France's Alexander Levy, who needed to finish joint second or better to make the trip to Augusta, also looked to have missed out after a 75 left him three over par, two shots outside the projected cut. But England's Tommy Fleetwood had kept his hopes of claiming the required win alive with a 71 to finish three under, three behind the clubhouse target set by Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello following a second consecutive 69.

"Kell Brook successfully defended his IBF world welterweight title against Romanian Jo Jo Dan at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena on Saturday night. Brook defeated his challenger in four murderous rounds before fans joined him in calling out Khan for what Brook envisages as ‘the biggest fight out there for both of us.’ ‘Who do you want to see me beat next,’ he asked. ‘Khan, Khan, Khan’ came the crowd's response. Brook's triumph and return to the ring came just six months after surviving a machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg. Host commentator . Click the above link for Jeff Powell's full report on Brook's victory from Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena. Thanks for following Sportsmail's coverage of the big fight. It's all over and Kell Brook remains the IBF world welterweight title holder. JEFF POWELL: Brook's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger. Dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows. Make that a fourth, Dan falling a split second before the bell. American referee Earl Brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger's corner that enough was enough. 10-9. JEFF POWELL: Brook was looking for the finish but Dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back. The Brook attack was relentless and Dan reeled around the ring like a drunk, yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell. 10-9 . JEFF POWELL: There were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed. This time it was Brook inflicting the pain. One sharp sent Dan reeling. The next, an uppercut, put him down. The third sent him to the canvas again. Only a mix of gallantry and clinching got Dan through more punishment to the bell, which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him. 10-7 . JEFF POWELL: Dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan Sheffield crowd. He started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward, playing into Brook’s preference for counter punching. The home boy’s straight lefts over the Canadian based Romanian’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start. 10-9 . JEFF POWELL: The Motorpoint Arena was packed to the tank-full, waiting to welcome the fighter Sheffield believes can be its successor to Naseem Hamed. That atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the Steel City, Adam Etches, brutally knocked out by his veteran Belarus rival for the IBF international middleweight belt. The deeply experienced 40-year-old Sergei Khomitsky drew Etches into a clever trap midway through the third round, opening him up for the perfect right cross. Etches went down like an axed tree, crashing his head against the canvas as he landed, and there were no protests as referee Howard Foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance. Video-screening of Brook’s triumphs in the ring and his leg-slashed tribulations outside the ropes restored he mood of optimism. Special K came in to a thunder of expectation and to be greeted by famed Ready to Rumble announcer Michael Buffer. Defending world champion Kell Brook is announced by Michael Buffer and makes his way to the ring. The 28-year-old's Sheffield homecoming has finally arrived. Dan makes his way to the ring with a smile on his face and is looking calm and confident. Kell Brook has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown. Brook had been considered a convenient underdog when he went to California in August and surprised the incumbent champion Shawn Porter to wrest the belt by split decision. Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle said: 'Shawn Porter under-estimated Kell Brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him. 'There is no danger of Kell overlooking Jo Jo in the same way. Jo Jo has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title. Kell is looking for big fights ahead but Jo Jo sees no reason why he shouldn't get them too.' Kell Brook is talking about fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios — in no given order — before a Wembley blockbuster with Amir Khan sometime next year. Nothing wrong with ambition but the first question Brook has to answer comes in his home town of Sheffield tonight. It has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg.

"Serena Williams ruthlessly ended the challenge of 15-year-old wildcard CiCi Bellis to ease into the fourth round of the Miami Open on Sunday.

After emerging from administration in February and being forced to sit out the season-opening race in Australia due to IT infrastructure woes, the South Yorkshire-based team will race in Malaysia.

Manor's return to competitive action was always going to be an uphill struggle, and so it has proven, with Merhi and Stevens some way off the pace of those cars directly ahead of them. Assessing the situation, Booth said: 'We knew our first weekend of running would not be without its challenges. 'Although we had a positive day on Friday, it has been important to keep our expectations for qualifying in check.

"The 2015 Turf Flat season begins with Sunday’s Lincoln Handicap card at Doncaster. Racemail answers some intriguing questions. Can Godolphin finally regain the ‘fear factor’? Only one European Group One winner in 2014 — Charming Thought in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket — was an unacceptably thin return for Sheik Mohammed’s lavishly-funded Godolphin operation. Ol’ Man River among seven of Aidan O’Brien's horses in the first nine in the ante-post betting for Derby . Charming Thought’s trainer Charlie Appleby was fully aware of the need to do better when he said in October: ‘Ten years ago, we were at the top of the table and everyone was frightened of us. That’s where we will hopefully be again in a year or two.’ The organisation, badly tarnished by the 2013 Mahmood Al Zarooni drug scandal, has seen significant changes, with horses now spread beyond the Appleby-Saeed Bin Suroor twin Newmarket operation. Horses will race in the Godolphin colours from the stables of Jim Bolger and Michael Halford in Ireland, Andre Fabre in France and John Gosden in Britain while they have acquired Richard Hannon’s 2014 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder and a share in Roger Varian’s Dewhurst Stakes scorer Belardo. Top jockeys William Buick and James Doyle have been recruited and the Sheik spent another fortune on yearling talent. Appleby has cleaned up on this winter’s all-weather circuit but, given his ammunition, at times that has seemed like pitting Mitchell Johnson against a third XI batsman. The serious stuff is ahead for an organisation that has not punched its weight. Top jockey William Buick has been recruited by Godolphin . Is the Qatari juggernaut unstoppable? They may lag behind the horse numbers of Dubai’s Maktoum family but Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s Pearl and Qatar Racing now have almost 250 horses while Sheik Joaan Al Thani, who retains Frankie Dettori, has doubled his European string to 150, half of them based here. With the likes of Racing Post Trophy winner Elm Park and £800,000 buy Moheet, who scooted home on his Salisbury debut in October, in their team, a first British Classic win could arrive this summer. Expensive new sponsorships will also be rolled out for the first time at Newbury and Glorious Goodwood as the Qatari influence spreads. Is Aidan O’Brien nailed on for a fourth Derby? When Australia followed up the Epsom successes of Ruler Of The World and Camelot last June it was a historic Derby hat-trick for Ireland’s dominant trainer and a fourth successive victory looks highly likely. He already has a vice-like grip on this year’s race with favourites JF Kennedy and Ol’ Man River among seven of his horses in the first nine in the ante-post betting and Ladbrokes make it even money that an O’Brien horse wins the Derby. Jockeys title race likely to be the shootout between Ryan Moore and Richard Hughes (right) Will Jockeys Championship changes mean a new winner? Despite the marketing vandalism of shortening the title race from 2,000 Guineas day at Newmarket on May 2 to Champions Day at Ascot on October 17, it is likely to be the same shootout between Ryan Moore and the defending champion Richard Hughes, who retires at the end of the season. But do not rule out a hungry Silvestre De Sousa, freelancing and out to prove a point after being ditched by Godolphin. Richard Hannon to be champion trainer again? Sheer weight of numbers would suggest so. Hannon, with more than 250 horses in his care, has to be favourite. He has lost Olympic Glory and Toronado to stud but closest rival John Gosden has waved goodbye to Kingman and Taghrooda. Both have a clutch of Classic hopes. Roger Varian — with St Leger winner and Arc fourth Kingston Hill plus 2,000 Guineas hope Belardo — could narrow the gap but it is a blow that injury means filly Cursory Glance misses the 1,000 Guineas. A final Classic win for Barry Hills? Having retired in 2011, Hills, 78 next month, took out his licence again when son John died last year. He retires again at the end of the season but is overseeing a string of almost 40 horses owned by Sheik Hamdan. Among them are 1,000 Guineas hope Fadhayyil and 2,000 Guineas hope Nafaqa.","Aidan O'Brien has seven horses in first nine of ante-post betting for Derby .

'If we can get some real tempo and intensity and ask questions of them, then who knows what can happen? 'This is a game we have to try to win. If we sit back and are conservative, there's only winner. 'Toulon have lost games and they're not unbeatable, so you have to back yourselves.

"For Danny Cipriani and Billy Twelvetrees, this must have felt like a monumental comedown, eight days after they had participated in one of the great occasions at Twickenham. At least Cipriani had a win to savour, although the Sale fly-half finished Sunday's game in the sin-bin. For Gloucester captain Twelvetrees, it was a miserable result on a miserable day in Salford. Danny Cipriani kicked five out of five to help Sale Sharks to a comfortable victory over Gloucester . Both men had come off the bench as England thrashed France in the Six Nations finale only to miss out on the title again, but there was no residual goodwill as they clashed three minutes from time at the AJ Bell Stadium, before Cipriani was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on. Compared to a last day of the championship that was awash with audacious artistry, this was an alien form of rugby. It was wet and windy and chilly and Sale were more pragmatic and clinical in the difficult conditions. Gloucester had been in Tenerife for a week of warm-weather training, which wasn't ideal preparation for an arm-wrestle contest in the North West. After enjoying the sun, David Humphreys' side caught a cold and yet another defeat in this fixture has left Gloucester stuck in ninth place in the Aviva Premiership table. They continue to punch below their weight. The first half was grim fare. James Hook struck two penalties for the visitors but Sale snatched a try in the 22nd minute when Samoa centre Johnny Leota managed to ground the ball against the base of a post after Andrei Ostrikov had been held up short. Cipriani converted that and added three penalties either side of the break to put his team in control. As impressive as his kicking was Cipriani (centre) was all over the pitch and proved defensively solid . Just before the hour, the hosts claimed a second try and it was a gem. From a rolling maul on the right, the impressive Chris Cusiter broke infield and released Tom Arscott. The wing burst into the 22 and was tackled but from the ruck Cipriani's clever delayed pass sent lock Josh Beaumont over the line from close range. Cipriani added the conversion and Sale stood firm, despite Nathan Hines and Cipriani going to the bin, to ensure Mark Cueto celebrated his 300th game for the club with a win. Gloucester had plenty of attacking possession but not enough nous and precision. Brendan Macken failed to release Charlie Sharples for a clear run to the line and moments later, when the wing received a pass in space from Jonny May, he was scythed down well by Leota. Josh Beaumont crosses the line to score the final try for Sale and put them game beyond Gloucester . Sale's director of rugby Steve Diamond was satisfied but does not believe that his side — currently seventh — are equipped to push for a play-off place despite a favourable run-in. 'We're a good side here,' he said. 'The one area that we didn't have dominance was the scrum. In every other area we were in control of it. I'm really pleased. 'Our first goal is to qualify for the Champions Cup and to do that we have to finish sixth. I think we're probably a bit away from the top four. We can't compete with the super teams. On our day we can beat anyone here but we've got two difficult games away from home.' Humphreys defended Gloucester's preparations, saying: 'We had a very positive training week but we couldn't translate that into a performance today. We've been back for 48 hours to acclimatise again and we had a good training session yesterday in similar weather conditions to this.'

Among his four half-centuries in nine matches for the co-hosts was a destructive 77 off just 25 balls against England in Wellington. Dougie Brown, Birmingham Bears director of cricket, said: 'Brendon's dynamic performances in the ICC Cricket World Cup have demonstrated once again exactly why he is one of the most feared batsmen in the game. 'Securing his availability for our last seven games has to make him one of the biggest overseas player signings in the competition's history. 'His power at the top of the order and experience of playing in big matches are great assets to bolster our already strong squad as we look to win through to the quarter-finals and defend our NatWest T20 Blast title.'

"Jonny Brownlee sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the World Triathlon Series in Auckland on Sunday. The 24-year-old Olympic bronze medallist maintained a challenging position throughout the race after coming home fifth following a disappointing opening race in Abu Dhabi earlier this month. But, in New Zealand, Brownlee burst out of the second transition and established an immediate lead over world champion Javier Gomez of Spain and Frenchman Pierre Le Corre, while current world number one Mario Mola of Spain was a minute down by this stage. Jonny Brownlee sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the World Triathlon Series . Though the final stages of the 10-kilometre run brought with them heavy rain, Brownlee reached the final corner clear of his rivals and celebrated along with the crowd over the final few metres before crossing the line in a sprint finish with a time of one hour 55 minutes and 26 seconds ahead of Gomez and third-placed Le Corre. Jonny's brother Alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but, with Olympic qualification to be decided in August and September at the test event in Rio and the world series Grand Final in Chicago, none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon. Alastair is hopeful of a return in time for the fourth round in Cape Town late next month. Browlee was visibly delighted with victory and said: 'In (the previous round in) Abu Dhabi I made many mistakes, and I've been beating myself up about it for the last few weeks. I've been training hard because I didn't want to do that again, and I wanted to be able to show how good I was. 'I really enjoyed it, I felt good and I'm pleased to win.' The West Yorkshireman added on Twitter: 'Very happy to win #AucklandWTS today. It is a honest triathlon course. Just like the Yorkshire hill's!' Brownlee now takes up the world number one ranking which he carries to the next round on Australia's Gold Coast in a fortnight. In the women's race, Lucy Hall came home 17th to finish just under five minutes behind eventual winner Gwen Jorgensen of the United States. Leicestershire's Hall came home in a time of 2:14.10 but fellow Briton Jessica Learmonth suffered a mechanical issue during the bike ride and was forced to withdraw from the race.","Jonny Brownlee won the second round of the World Triathlon Series .

"Crystal Palace's James McArthur has been criticised by his manager Alan Pardew, who feels the midfielder should be 'embarrassed' about diving in Saturday's 2-1 win at Stoke. McArthur was booked early in the second half of the Barclays Premier League clash at the Britannia Stadium for simulation having taken a tumble in the box. And Pardew told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme: 'He dived. 'He should be embarrassed. He's a great professional and that's unlike him. I was surprised but it shows what pressure does to players. Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur (left) was booked for diving in the second-half against Stoke City . Alan Pardew told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme that MacArthur should feel 'embarrassed' 'I haven't spoken to him about it but I don't need to. He will see the replay and he will be embarrassed.' The win continued Palace's resurgence under Pardew, who took over in January after leaving Newcastle. Having been in the relegation zone at that point, the Eagles are now 11 points clear of it and up to 11th place - one spot above Newcastle. Pardew had a rocky relationship with the Tyneside club's fans and when his Newcastle side were beaten 1-0 at Stoke in September, several of the away supporters held up signs calling for him to be sacked. However, following a much happier return to the Potteries for the 53-year-old on Saturday, he insisted it was of no real significance to him that Palace had leapfrogged Newcastle in the table. And Pardew also indicated he is not about to take anything for granted in terms of survival. Palace - with 19 points from 10 league games under Pardew so far - have a total of 36, and he said: 'I'm still thinking about another couple of points.

'But nine wins (for Palace in the league over the season) going into this international break - I would have absolutely jumped at that when I arrived.' Asked if there was any significance for him to going above Newcastle, Pardew said: 'No, not really. 'The most important thing for me is that this club is within touching distance of Premier League status for next year. 'That is the only agenda I had when I arrived. We have done absolutely brilliantly. 'It (his previous visit to Stoke) was a difficult night, and I've had them as a manager. You have to show your mettle. 'But it was a different feeling on Saturday because we are in great form. You want to have more of those in your career, and hopefully I can as I continue with Palace.' Stoke midfielder Steven N'Zonzi (left) dribbles the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (right) Stoke, 10th on 42 points, are looking this season to better their Premier League records set last term of a ninth-placed finish and 50-point total. Saturday's result made it back-to-back defeats and manager Mark Hughes is keen for an impressive campaign not to fizzle out. He did, though, stress he thought the Potters' performance against Palace had been an improvement on the previous weekend's loss to West Brom. 'I thought performance-wise it was a marked difference from last week, which was pleasing, but we haven't got a positive result,' Hughes said. 'We are disappointed - we made mistakes, so maybe we didn't do enough to win. 'But we certainly deserved to take something out of it.'

"David Cotterill has revealed the first battle for him and Wales captain Ashley Williams ahead of their crunch Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel will just be getting off the ground. Both the Birmingham City winger and the Swansea captain have a fear of flying so will look to each other for support when the Welsh squad head to the skies on Thursday. Belgium’s match in Israel originally scheduled for last September was postponed until this month because of the Gaza conflict. But simply being 30,000 feet high will be of concern to Cotterill. Swansea and Wales defender Ashley Williams has a fear of flying . He laughed: ‘I’m a nervous wreck on every flight I go on, it doesn’t matter where it’s to. Normally when I’m flying I grab my two children’s hands. ‘When I’m on my own, Ashley Williams is across from me and he’s a nervous flier too, we just look at each other like we’re having a panic attack. ‘He’s a warrior on the pitch but when it comes to flying he’s a little baby.’ Cotterill has played an important part in Wales travelling to the Middle East with designs on topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group on departure. The 27-year-old came off the bench in the win over Cyprus earlier in the campaign to score a long-range free-kick, before starting the goalless draw in Belgium. ‘It was an amazing result for us. In previous years we would probably have gone over there and got beaten three or four nil,’ he told Sportsmail. Swansea defender Williams regarded as a fearless competitor on the pitch . ‘I think the squad has improved so much, and we have great confidence. Hopefully we can do something special by qualifying.’ Wales have not made a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup but sit second in Group B on eight points, one behind Israel having played a game more. Belgium are fourth on five points with a game in hand on Wales. Cotterill made his debut a decade ago as a 17-year-old, coming on to replace Ryan Giggs, so is well placed to chart the strides taken by this Wales team and how Gareth Bale has grown in dressing room stature. ‘We have great experience, he said. ‘Baley, Rambo (Aaron Ramsey) and (Chris) Gunter have a lot of caps for their age, obviously brought through from the days of (John) Toshack and (Gary) Speed. ‘A lot of us have been together for many years and that’s only benefitting us now. The group is a lot closer now than in previous years and it’s showing on the pitch.’ He added: ‘Baley’s signed for Real Madrid and he is one of our leaders. He does speak a lot more than he used to. Whatever he says he’s talking sense because he’s playing for one of the best managers in the world. He knows his stuff.’ Bale’s presence, despite his difficult spell at Real, encourages Cotterill to believe Wales can beat Israel, who have a perfect record so far. Birmingham winger David Cotterill (centre) will be part of the Wales squad flying to Israel . ‘We’ve got one of the best players in the world, if that doesn’t give you a lift nothing will. Most of our starting XI are in the Premier League playing week in week out. Our core is quality. We show respect but we have nothing to fear.’ Cotterill has enjoyed a bright season at Birmingham, revived under Gary Rowett, having moved from Doncaster last summer. He has eight goals from the right wing and seven assists, numbers that compete with any players in is position in the Championship. ‘I’m happy the way the season has gone, I’m hoping to score more goals and get to the double figure mark, hopeful add a few more assists,’ he said. ‘Then I could look back at a successful season.’","Ashley Williams and David Cotterill both have a fear of flying .

Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'. Haris Vuckic celebrates after scoring in Rangers' 4-1 victory against Cowdenbeath on Saturday . This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far. Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs. The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000. Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Loan signings Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete are unveiled at Murray Park last month . Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. Paul Murray (left) and Dave King are pictured back at Ibrox after the EGM earlier this month . 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'","Rangers will owe Newcastle United £500,000 if they win promotion .

"British Athletics performance director Neil Black has challenged his horde of young athletes to make names for themselves at the European Indoor Championships. A host of Great Britain's rising track stars, who make up the majority of a largely inexperienced team, carry medal hopes into the event, which gets under way at Prague's O2 Arena on Friday. Britain's 60 metres challenge is spearheaded by 21-year-old Chijindu Ujah on the men's side and 19-year-old Dina Asher-Smith on the women's, while the likes of Seren Bundy-Davies, 20, goes into her first major championships as European number one over 400m.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the most high-profile athlete in the team, is only 22 and, fired up by last year's injury frustrations, chasing her first major title in the pentathlon. Thirty-one of the 37 strong team are 25 or under and, in the absence of big names like Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford or James Dasaolu, Black is keen to see them handle the weight of expectation. 'We want to see people who cope with the circumstances, apply themselves well, perform well and out of that come medals, great performances, finalists and personal bests,' he said. 'We are really optimistic we can perform well. Seren Bundy Davies, Lawrence Clarke, Neil Black and Chijindu Ujah at a Prague 2015 press conference . 'For those for whom this is a critical competition to get the experience to demonstrate their progression, it's the biggest thing they've ever done. 'There's a real buzz within the team. It's great to have that combination of young people joining and feeling really good about it.' Sprint hurdler and team captain Lawrence Clarke, who finished fourth at London 2012 and one the most experienced members of the squad at 24, backed his young compatriots to thrive on the big stage.

Britain won 23 medals, including 12 golds, at last summer's European Championships outdoors, their best ever return. Black admitted it was important to keep the momentum going, with the World Championships in Beijing coming up this summer and the Rio OIympics the following year. But he refused to be drawn on whether his team could eclipse their best haul from a European Indoors, 10 medals and four golds from Birmingham in 2007.

'It would be pretty weird if we weren't here seriously competing with a view to doing well,' he said. 'We expect to perform well and I think it is important because we all thrive on doing well. We all enjoy it, feel more confident and generally seem to perform better from doing well, so I think it's important to keep that going. 'But I am not relating it to the past. I want to think more about here and now, and the future. I am interested about what these guys do and what they will go on and do in the future.'","Great Britain are taking a horde of rising track stars to compete in Prague .

"UEFA has moved to increase the financial rewards from playing in the Europa League by announcing prize money for the tournament will increase by 65 per cent. An increase in television money for UEFA will also see prize money for the Champions League go up but the disparity with the Europa League will not be so great from 2015-18. At the moment, clubs in the Champions League earn an average of four and half times as much as those playing in the Europa League, but in the future UEFA will fix the ratio at 3.3 to one. Solidarity payments to those clubs who fail to qualify for the group stages will also rise significantly. Real Madrid's financial reward for retaining the Champions League would be even bigger than last year . Chelsea's Champions League exit at the hands of PSG has cost them a share of more lucrative prize money . The prize money for the winner of the Champions League final will rise from 10.5m euros (£7.6m) to 15million euros (£10.9m), and the winner of the competition could earn a maximum of 54.5m euros (£39.6m) in prize money plus TV cash from their share of the market pool. The move comes following a new agreement with the European Clubs' Association (ECA), which is also to have two representatives co-opted onto UEFA's executive committee - one of whom is expected to be ECA president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Sevilla won the Europa League last season, and Europe's second-tier club competition is getting a cash boost . The likes of Tottenham will benefit from the extra Europa League cash, if they do not finish in the top four . UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said: 'UEFA is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, but also strengthens UEFA's solidarity principle, namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs. 'In this way, the new system provides a better deal for everyone, especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two UEFA club competitions. 'This is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of UEFA's key values.'","Europa League prize money to increase by 65 per cent .

"Title winner Robbie Neilson will this week start laying the groundwork for a crack at the Premiership’s top six - as he aims to take advantage of Hearts’ two-month head-start over Hibs and Rangers. The Tynecastle boss will summon in agents to draw up new deals for his out-of-contract stars in the team who wrapped up the Championship title before Easter, before turning his attention to luring new players for an assault on the top flight. The 34-year-old believes that by clinching the title so early he has gained a huge advantage over rivals like Hibs and Rangers, who will not know until after the play-offs – which run from May 9 to June 2 – what division they will be playing in next season. Robbie Neilson believes winning the Scottish Championship title so early has given Hearts a big advantage . Delighted to avoid such a scenario, Neilson believes Alan Stubbs or Stuart McCall will risk miss out on landing the best players available. Neilson said: ‘If you go into the play-offs, you’re looking at June 2 before you know if you’re going to be in the Championship or the Premiership. That’s a lot of time to take off your planning for the following season. With any decent players out there, if you’re having to wait until June before you can offer them a contract, the good ones will be away. ‘So I do think that winning the title so early gives us an advantage. We know where we are going so it gives us the opportunity to get going and get in some recruits. Our pre-season is all planned now, too. Jubilant Hearts players throw Neilson in the air after they confirmed their status as champions . ‘We’re going to speak to the guys who are out of contract, get their agents in and see what we can do. There’s a few coming in this week and the week after that as well. It’s important to try and get them tied up because they have given us so much this season. We want to push to get into the top six so if that means altering the squad a little, so be it. But everything falls into a budget.’ Hearts strolled to the Championship title, losing just once this season, at home to Falkirk in January. Yet while Neilson will keep faith with the core of the team who secured him his first trophy as a manager, he warned them they will need to up their game in the top flight. ‘We’re not getting carried away,’ he said. We’ve just won the Championship, but we’re stepping up to a higher league. We definitely need to recruit but the nucleus of the team will stay the same. There are great players here, players with great potential, young guys that are doing great and some older players who have been fantastic. The Hearts manager celebrates his side's league title with club owner Ann Budge, who got a standing ovation . ‘We’ve got guys now who have won a league and that experience will set them up well for the rest of their careers. But when you move up a level, you have to up your game a bit as well. A lot of preparation will need to be done. There are things we got away with this season that we won’t get away with next season. ‘It will be a different season next year. I don’t expect the kind of season we had this year. I wasn’t expecting to go so many games undefeated, to have so many wins in a row. It will be difficult next season but it’s my job to make sure we are ready.’ Neilson also praised the structure at Hearts in which he works as head coach under director of football Craig Levein, with chairwoman and owner Ann Budge making all the major non-football decisions. ‘To be in this structure is great,’ he said. ‘A lot of clubs are doing it down in England now. The majority of foreign clubs have been doing it for the last 10 years. So it’s probably the way football is going nowadays. Neilson believes that Rangers and Hibs are at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing for next season . ‘Long gone are the days when a manager makes financial decisions about what direction the club’s going to go in. There’s such a big infrastructure that a coach needs to focus on the football and not deal with the other stuff like board meetings. It gives me the opportunity to focus on the things that matter to the players and on their performance on a Saturday. ‘It was great to see Craig and Ann get an ovation from the fans at the end today. They’ve been fantastic. Ann’s come in and given the club a real direction, a togetherness. ‘The way she has handled everything, be it the media or the fans, even the football side of it, has been second to none. ‘She has put her trust in Craig to get the football department together. He has then put his trust in me to look after the first team. Everything has worked out well. We just need to use this as a springboard to go and push on. I want this to be the beginning of something really good.’ Alan Stubbs (pictured) and Stuart McCall have to wait until June to find out which division they will be in .","Hearts have already secured promotion from the Scottish Championship .

"Grassroots clubs are missing out on millions of pounds from the transfer of their former players. That is the fear of Wallsend Boys Club chairman, Steve Dale. His club benefited from the £2million transfer of Fraser Forster from Newcastle to Celtic in 2012 and have now landed another payment in light of his £10m move to Southampton in August. The windfall is all part of the ‘solidarity contribution’ mechanism set out in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was formerly registered with Wallsend Boys Club . Wallsend Boys Club is one of the country’s most famous talent factories and had the likes of Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley and Michael Carrick on their books . But because junior clubs have to make an application for their entitlement to the buying club within 18 months of the deal, Dale believes that millions could be going unclaimed by junior clubs worldwide. ‘I'd query how many junior clubs are actually aware of the regulations and what they could be entitled to,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It's always great to see former players go on to bigger things and everyone at the club is absolutely delighted to see Fraser playing at the top of the game, we all wish him well. ‘At the same time, if the clubs which played a part in his early career can benefit in some small way from his move, this makes a huge difference to the young people we look after week in, week out.’ Wallsend were entitled to payment from the transfer of Forster from Newcastle to Celtic in 2012 and from Celtic to Southampton last summer because the deals were made between different football associations . Former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer played for Wallsend Boys Club before joining Southampton's academy . Wallsend Boys Club chairman Steve Dale fears grassroots clubs could be missing out millions by not claiming money they are entitled to . English clubs only receive the payment when a player moves between clubs registered in different football associations (ie international transfers) and a fee is involved, as was the case with Forster when he swapped Scotland for England last month. It does not apply to domestic deals. Five per cent of every transfer fee between clubs in different associations is set aside to be distributed to any club – including professional - to which the player was registered between the seasons of their 12th and 23rd birthdays. The amount received is proportional to the time spent under their care, which is recorded on a ‘player passport’. For example, if a £10m player spent just one season at a junior club they would land around £25,000. Going forward, it could be an invaluable source of future income for the likes of Wallsend, who had England goalkeeper Forster on their books until he joined Newcastle at 15. The club is one of the country’s most famous talent factories and more than 70 of their youngsters have gone on to play professionally, including Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley, Michael Carrick, Steve Bruce and Lee Clark. A young Michael Carrick pictured at Wallsend Boys Club in 1994 . And, of their famed alumni, Dale added: ‘Unfortunately, not many of them played abroad! ‘It's increasingly hard for grassroots clubs at all levels to raise funds each year, so if any are fortunate enough to have a player transfer internationally in these circumstances later in his career, it is important to bear this in mind. ‘Wallsend is a registered charity so most of our income is still from donations, but I hope more junior clubs can benefit from similar situations in future.’ Any FA Charter Standard club which thinks it may be missing out can call The FA's free legal helpline on 0191 2117799 or email CSlegalhelp@TheFA.com.","Grassroots clubs entitled to payment when former player transfers abroad .

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger looks agitated as he watches his side face Newcastle last weekend .

"Kell Brook is willing to break with convention and give Amir Khan the lion's share of any payday in an effort to finally lure him into a blockbuster world title fight. Brook has the bargaining chip of a world championship belt but so far that has proved ineffective in drawing the Bolton welterweight into a fight that would attract huge British interest. Sportsmail understands Khan would pocket in the region of £4 million if he met the 28-year-old at Wembley on June 13 – a date Brook's promoter, Eddie Hearn, has penciled in with the national stadium. IBF world welterweight champion Kell Brook poses at a press conference at Montgomery Theatre, Sheffield . Amir Khan hits Devon Alexander during their welterweight bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena last year .

Brook has gone to claim he would be prepared to accept a smaller payday as IBF champion to make the fight. But despite sporadic positive feedback from the Khan camp, who told Hearn at a recent meeting in Blackpool that the bout 'will happen one day', the trail has since gone cold. Brook, who defends his title on March 28 against Jo Jo Dan, said: 'I think he is avoiding me like the plague. He said that I'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him? 'After I'm done with Amir Khan he will just be a mere memory. 'He wants to fight some of these kids who have been super-featherweights. I am a genuine big welterweight who can seek and destroy him.' Hearn added: 'We want the fight so badly. We don't believe we should take anything less than 50-50 but until we talk maybe we do. Kell has not been in a mega-fight and has masses of monster paydays in front of him. If he has to give Amir a little something to knock him out he probably will.' Khan's fight in Sheffield on March 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in Tenerife last September that could have cost his life. At the very least it has meant a major delay in Brook defending his world title for the first time. He intends on three more fights this year, though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao than he does of landing a Khan bout that would draw enormous domestic interest. Brook hits the bag during a media workout session at Bary's Gym in Las Vegas in August 2014 . Brook lands a punch on Shawn Porter on his way to becoming world champion in August 2014 .

A Khan fight is so easy to make. All the signs are there for it to be an unbelievable fight. 'I have seen clips of him saying, 'Win a world title', 'Do this, do that'. I have come through everything he has said and still nothing. 'I think people around him are blowing smoke up his **** and he is believing all the hype. Don't get me wrong he is a good fighter but I would take him out. 'We are ready to go with this fight. But I will fight anyone. I have only wanted to fight the very best.

"It was a familiar feeling when David Strettle found himself being towered over by the 6ft 6in Per Mertesacker at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground. The Saracens winger, who was on the books of Manchester City as a teenager, had to give up his ambition of becoming a professional footballer because he was ‘too small’ to make the grade. Ironically, the dream of playing at Wembley transpired through rugby, but an afternoon with Mertesacker, Olivier Giroud and Wojciech Szczesny provided a taste of what might have been. David Strettle (far left) poses with Saracens team-mates during a visit to meet Arsenal players . ‘They all dwarfed us, but gone are the days where you have people like Julian Dicks and Vinnie Jones running around in midfield,’ said Strettle at a sponsors’ cross-code challenge day. ‘I was always a better footballer at school — Andrei Kanchelskis was my idol — but I wasn’t big enough to make it with City. That’s when rugby took over at about 16. ‘It’s funny how both games have changed. Now you’ve got your Iniestas and your Messis: small guys who are so skilful.’ Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud signs a doll for Strettle during a visit to London Colney on Friday . David Strettle scores a try to help Saracens to LV= Cup glory over Exeter Chiefs last weekend . Strettle draws comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere games, highlighting the superior skillset of forwards in New Zealand and Australia. Their lighter emphasis on the breakdown, he says, forces the big men to stand out in the backline and become more clinical in attack. The record-breaking final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations bucked the trend and, having seen England beat France in a 90-point thriller, Strettle feels more needs to be done to spice up the competition. ‘You need to bring in the bonus point to discourage that conservativeness,’ he said.

"Amir Khan says he would love to fight Adrien Broner in his next bout. The Bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather but the pound-for-pound king will instead meet Manny Pacquaio in a $300million mega-fight on May 2. And now it seems Khan has set his sights on facing the man dubbed by many as the new Mayweather. Amir Khan (left) says he'd love to fight Adrien Broner after the American said he'd be ready this month . Broner, a former three weight world champion, won a unanimous points decision over John Molina on Saturday as he continued to rebuild his reputation after losing his undefeated record two years ago to Marcos Maidana – who then twice fought and lost to Mayweather. So comfortable was the Molina fight for Broner that on Tuesday he said he would be ready to face Khan 'at the end of this month'. Writing on Instagram, Broner said: 'No disrespect to Virgil Hunter he is a great coach and I got endless love for him but me and Amir Khan can fight at the end of this month I haven't taken any punishment I'm back in the gym and ready to make a fool out of anybody #AboutBillions #ABonNBC' Khan appeared to laugh off Broner's claims on Twitter before going on to tweet: 'Would love to fight @AdrienBroner next! #KhanvsBroner lets make it happen.' Broner won a unanimous points decision on Saturday but says he copped little punishment and is in the gym . On Monday, Broner even suggested he would be prepared to come to England to fight Khan. 'I can't wait. I'd even fight him at Wembley,' Broner told BoxingNews24. Last year Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared and told him to prove his credentials by beating Broner on the undercard of his first fight with Maidana. Floyd Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared but chose to fight Manny Pacquaio . Mayweather tweeted: 'I don't have an easy fight on May 3, 2014, so I can't overlook @ChinoMaidana but @AmirKingKhan, if you and @AdrienBroner end up fighting each other on my show and you win (which you won't) ... I'll fight you.' The fight never materialised then with Khan instead going on to beat Luis Collazo and then Devon Alexander. But with no opponent named for his next fight, the proposition of fighting Broner may now appeal to Khan.","Adrien Broner said he can fight Amir Khan as soon as the end of the month after defeating John Molina Jr by a unanimous points decision on Saturday .

"Mike Brown has been in the wars in recent weeks and he has the scars to prove it. But he insists he is ready to battle for his World Cup starting place and is also determined to inject some much-needed confidence into club-side Harlequins' stuttering season. Twelve months ago Brown concluded a Six Nations campaign that ended with an identical result, a second place in the table behind Joe Schmidt's Ireland. But he was also a winner, edging out retiring legend Brian O'Driscoll to be named player of the tournament, with four tries underlining his commitment to the cause. Mike Brown in action against France in the final Six Nations game of the tournament . This time around, there were no personal accolades to dull the disappointment of a fourth consecutive runners-up place. However, Brown believes the manner of England's memorable 55-35 victory over France is a reason to be optimistic ahead of this autumn's Rugby World Cup. But he refutes suggestions by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie that another second place was 'unacceptable'. 'I haven't done too much reflecting but it's massively disappointing to end the way that we did,' said Brown, speaking at the Rosslyn Park HSBC National Schools Sevens - the world's largest schools rugby tournament. 'It was great how we went about the game and how we won but it's disappointing that we didn't achieve our goal of winning it. It's the fourth time I've been involved where I've come second but luckily I don't get bitter. Brown was disappointed with how the Six Nations ended, but says there were positives to take . 'We'll keep going as a squad, keep using things like this to develop us. There are still positives to take out of it and we have to look at the bigger picture.' The free-scoring, free-flowing nature of last weekend's classic at Twickenham was compared by many to a rugby league game. Brown is an admitted fan of the 13-man code and Quins famously released a statement titled 'Brown stays with rugby' when he briefly flirted with a switch. However, Brown believes he has done enough in recent weeks to cement his place as Stuart Lancaster's first choice full-back, ahead of rival Alex Goode, who deputised when he missed the defeat in Dublin after picking up a head injury early in the win over Italy. 'I was very happy with my tournament. When I actually played, I thought I did well,' added Brown, who was casting his eye over the next generation of stars at Rosslyn Park – an event that has previously produced the likes of Gareth Edwards, Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Carling, and Ugo Monye. 'I think my game has come on loads this season. Last year it was all about my running game but I think I've shown that my kicking game has come on alongside my passing game and my defensive game. As long as I can keep improving, I will be happy. Brown will not be in action for Harlequins when they face Saracens at Wembley on Saturday . 'It's just a shame that I did take a knock and missed one a three quarter games, including the big one in Ireland. 'We've spoken about competition for places and 15 is definitely one that is strongly contested. Alex did well, unfortunately he was in that losing team against Ireland but he did well with his opportunity. 'Saying that, I don't want to give him too many opportunities – he is a great player so it is good to have that rivalry and push each other in training. 'Maybe before people might have said he had a better kicking game but I think after this tournament, people can see my kicking game isn't too bad either.' Brown and Goode should be going head-to-head at Wembley this weekend when the two sides clash in front of what is expected to be a world record crowd for a club rugby match. Brown talking to young rugby players at the Rosslyn Park HSBC National Schools Sevens . But Brown is sidelined again due to another concussion precaution, after picking up a knock late in the famous win over France. 'We're being a little cautious with that and we're giving it time to recover,' he said. 'After a head knock it's always a big thing to come back playing, especially with two internationals it can be tough. 'I've got next week off because we don't have a game so it's a good two weeks down time. 'It's not been a good campaign for Harlequins and this game could hopefully spark our season. We've worked well at times but we haven't been consistent and don't deserve to be up there. 'That's something to look at in the off season but there's still games to go where we can put ourselves in a good position to be in Europe for next year and that's definitely where we want to be – at the top table of European rugby.'

"James Collins is set to play a key role in Wales' Euro 2016 campaign but manager Chris Coleman admits he chose Cardiff's busiest shopping centre for peace talks between the pair so things could not turn ugly. Collins will win his 45th cap in Wales' crunch qualifier against Israel on Saturday night with Hull defender James Chester sidelined by a dislocated shoulder. But it was not so long ago that the West Ham defender's international career appeared over after player and manager fell out following Collins' withdrawal from a Wales squad. James Collins was all smiles as he trained with the Wales squad in Cardiff on Wednesday ahead of their trip to Israel for a Euro 2016 qualifier . Collins contradicted Coleman's claim he had turned down the chance to join the squad as a late call-up prior to the World Cup qualifier against Serbia in September 2013 and the pair had a tense public rapprochement in the middle of Cardiff. 'We had a coffee in the middle of St David's Shopping Centre so it could not kick off!' Coleman revealed. 'There were too many people around so we had to be civil. 'We had our spat, but I have known him since he was a kid and always liked him, and when he has been with us he has been right in the middle of everything. His presence and personality are going to be very important going forward.' Collins has had to bide his time to regain his place at the heart of the Wales defence with Chester having developed an excellent understanding with skipper Ashley Williams since making his international debut last summer. Chris Coleman (right) has cleared the air with Collins as he instructs his backroom staff during training . The 31-year-old has yet to feature in a campaign which sees Wales unbeaten after four games and within a point of Group B leaders Israel. But asked if falling out with him has made Collins value Wales more, Coleman replied: 'Yes, absolutely. I think that is the case. 'This is an opportunity for 'Ginge' now. He was brilliant in the last camp, as were Danny Gabbidon and Sam Ricketts who did not play but were great round the dressing room in Brussels. 'That is great for the younger guys because it is good to have advice from senior players. ''Ginge' likes the challenge and the atmosphere we will find ourselves in, it will be a dogfight which he enjoys.' Collins has earned a recall to the Wales team after impressing in defence for West Ham this term. Here he celebrates a win over Sunderland with team-mate Stewart Downing . Wales are unbeaten but a point behind Israel in Group B, with the table toppers also having a game in hand having won all three of their opening Euro 2016 qualifiers . Coleman also played down security concerns ahead of Wales' first trip to Israel since the two countries met in a play-off qualifier for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Israel have a game in hand on Wales as their September fixture with Belgium was postponed because of the political situation in the Middle East at the time but that match will now be played next Tuesday. 'We have not got any extra security to my knowledge,' Coleman said. 'I did the journey from the airport to the hotel when I was out there last month and we will treat it like any other game. 'We know a lot is going on in certain quarters but there are no worries, there are no extra precautions that we would not usually take.'","James Collins and Chris Coleman fell out in September 2013 .

"Ryan Mason thinks Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino should take a great deal of credit for the role he played in helping him earn his 'dream' England call-up. Mason was drafted into the England squad following the withdrawal of Adam Lallana and could make his debut in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or the friendly in Italy next Tuesday. If selected, Mason would regard it as the proudest moment of his career. Ryan Mason tracks Raheem Sterling in training after winning his first England call-up this week . Mason says it would be his dream to be handed a first England cap against Lithuania or Italy this week . The Spurs midfielder has been in superb form this season, prompting Roy Hodgson to select him . 'It's every boy's dream to represent their country at any level, so hopefully I can get that and it would be a great achievement personally,' the 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder told TheFA.com . 'It's the pinnacle of your career to represent your country.' Mason's route to the top has been far from straightforward. He signed for Tottenham's academy as a 16-year-old and just 12 months later he made his debut in a UEFA Cup match against NEC Nijmegen. But he then had to wait another six years until he made his Premier League debut. Former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp farmed Mason out to Yeovil, Millwall and Doncaster, where he had three loan spells. Redknapp's successor Andre Villas-Boas then sent the player to French club Lorient but he returned without having made a first-team appearance. Kane made his Spurs debut six years ago, but has spent the intervening time on several loan deals . Neither Harry Redknapp or Andre Villas-Boas saw a place for him in the first team, but he is now showing form . Mason started last season on loan at League One Swindon and did not feature under Tim Sherwood at Spurs once Villas-Boas had been sacked. Mason is grateful to Pochettino, therefore, for finally giving him a chance at White Hart Lane this season. 'I've always had confidence in my own ability, but it also comes from a manager who trusts you and is willing to back you. There is nothing like that as a footballer,' said Mason, who has played 29 times for the Argentinian this year. 'The fact that the call-up has come so early in my Premier League career is a great feeling. It's amazing and has been a bit of a whirlwind over the last few months . Mason thanked Mauricio Pochettino for the faith the Argentinian manager has shown in him this season . Last year Mason was on loan at Swindon in League One, but has made remarkable progress since returning . 'It was unfortunate that I didn't kick on at a younger age, it took me a bit longer to establish myself. 'I had a lot of injuries and perhaps went out on loan at the wrong times. 'There were times when players were getting opportunities in the UEFA Cup and I was out on loan. It just never really worked. But now I've got a manager who trusts in me and believes in me, and he came in from day one and said that. 'To have a manager like that it gives me a great deal of confidence. 'Now I'm playing regularly I'm more than happy.' Mason has been pinching himself this week after training alongside some of his heroes at St George's Park. 'I've been a football fan for so long, and the fact that I've been watching these players in the squad who I'm training with now is a great feeling,' he said.","Ryan Mason has been handed his first England call up after strong season .

"Chelsea's Lewis Baker has spoken of his pride at captaining England's under 20 side and believes he is only just setting out on his journey with the Three Lions. The 19-year-old, who is currently out on loan at League One side MK Dons, featured for England in their 1-1 draw with Mexico at Barnet on Wednesday night. Aidy Boothroyd's team won the penalty shoot-out 4-2 after Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom won and then scored a penalty in normal time to cancel out Jose Ramirez's opener. Lewis Baker in action for England's under 20s in their international with Mexico on Wednesday night . The midfielder was appointed captain by Aidy Boothroyd at the beginning of the season . On the responsibility of being captain, Baker told Sportsmail: 'It's a great honour for me. Aidy chose me to be captain at the start of the campaign and that was a massive lift for me personally. 'But everyone in the team, we're all captains on the pitch in the game and we showed today that we can be a team and stick together through the bad times. 'I try to lead by example in what I do on the ball and off the ball. Everyone's aim to get to the under 21s and the seniors. 'All we can do is keep working hard, keeping doing what we can do and give your best.' Although England looked the more likely to score after Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino was sent off for fouling Akpom for the penalty, they had been second best for much of the friendly at The Hive. As they look towards the Toulon Tournament at the end of the season, Baker believes there is some room for improvement, starting with Sunday's friendly with the United States at Plymouth. Baker celebrates scoring for Chelsea in last season's Under 21 Premier League final with Manchester United . England under 20s coach Aidy Boothroyd smiles during Wednesday night's match at The Hive . England's under 20s are in action again on Sunday when they play the United States at Home Park in Plymouth. Ticket information can be found here. 'We didn't perform today at the level we have performed at in previous games,' he admitted. 'They were a good side; I thought first-half they had the upper hand and could have scored a few goals but we kept persevering, stayed in the game, had a little talk at half-time on how to get better and we got the result.' Akpom, who has been on the fringes of Arsene Wenger's first team all season, took his England under 20s tally to four when he drilled home his 78th minute penalty. And Baker appreciates his game-changing qualities: 'When Chuba goes through on goal, everyone gets out of their seat because they know Chuba is a great goalscorer. He's done well today, getting the penalty and he scored in the shoot-out as well.' Chuba Akpom of England scores their equaliser from the penalty spot for England Under 20s . England players celebrate during the penalty shoot-out against Mexico on Wednesday night . On a personal level, Baker has scored two goals in five appearances for the Dons since arriving from Stamford Bridge and is set to play a pivotal role as Karl Robinson's men push for promotion. He said: 'I've been playing under 21 at Chelsea for a while now and so the next step was to go on loan and at MK Dons now I'm under great care with the manager and the players. 'With the talent we have got at MK Dons there's no reason why we can't get into the play-offs or even gain automatic promotion.'","Baker captained England under 20s in 1-1 draw with Mexico .

"As Gareth Bale's season at Real Madrid continues to turn sour, the former Tottenham forward is continually being linked with a move away from the Bernabeu. Manchester United and Chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world's most expensive player back to the Premier League. Sportsmail asked Chelsea fan Cody Taylor of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to the champions elect. Gareth Bale has been criticised by supporters for his performances at Real Madrid this season . Bale performs his trademark celebration as he scored twice during Wales' 3-0 win against Israel on Saturday . Gareth Bale could be available this summer if various transfer reports are to be believed, so naturally Chelsea are being linked with an eye-watering bid - but we have to ask ourselves the question, is he necessary? On the face of it Bale is a good player. At Tottenham he dragged an average team out of hole after hole, but it's easy to be a big fish in small pond. As he's found out in Spain it's much harder in the big pond and that's what it will be like at Chelsea too. Overall he's not had the impact that the world's most expensive player should. There are plenty who would give up everything to have him, but we really don't need to be wasting time on a player that won't be a noticeable improvement, or even fit. Bale holds his hands to his head after Real Madrid were beaten by Barcelona 2-1 in La Liga . Bale leads the wild celebrations after he nets his second of the game against Israel in the Euro 2016 qualifier . Even with his array of qualities, for the money, Bale just isn't worth it. As good a player as he is, he wasn't worth the world record £86m Real paid for him in 2013, after what was effectively only one explosive season. He still isn't worth the £75m that the Spanish giants will allegedly settle for now. There's simply no room for him at Chelsea. Jose Mourinho already has a plethora of young, similarly able attacking players. Willian is not as glamorous as the rest, but even he is a crucial part of the team and the fans love him. The Brazilian doesn't score as many goals or provide as many assists as others, but he is the one above all else that never stops working hard and that type of attitude and passion is more important than everything. Bale reacts with disbelief after having a goal disallowed during the Clasico on March 22 . After the defeat by Barcelona Gareth Bale's car was attacked by angry aupporters . If Bale arrives he is unlikely to do the same and it would negatively change the whole balance of the side which Mourinho has worked hard to build. There is also Juan Cuadrado to think about. The Colombian hasn't shown anything like his best since arriving in January and isn't likely to before the end of the season. He is still settling in and just needs a bit more time before fans will eventually see the player that lit up last summer's World Cup. There's absolutely no point replacing someone before they've even started. Bale is being linked with move back to the England with Manchester United and Chelsea reportedly interested . The former Tottenham player attends an event with with young Jewish and Arab children in Israel on Sunday . Even just a few games away from claiming a well-deserved Premier League title though, any Chelsea fan claiming there is no need to improve with summer additions is a fool. The season has been far from flawless, but the key areas that need strengthening are defensive. If big money is to be spent it has to be used to address real issues, not bringing in additional unnecessary luxury. We are more in need of a centre-back, maybe a full-back, Paul Pogba even, but certainly not Bale. Mourinho has the good sense to see that and Bale in blue is highly unlikely. Besides, if he has any ambition to show himself to be anything other a massive flop, he should reject all offers and do his utmost to prove himself in Spain.

"Slaven Bilic was approached by an angry fan towards the end of the game as the home supporters showed their disgust at going out of the competition - but the former West Ham man looked far from intimidated. Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo scored a double to help Club Brugge progress with a 5-2 aggregate win over Besiktas. The 19-year-old cousin of Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to punish the Turkish side who were pushing for a winner. Tom de Sutter had earlier taken advantage of some lax goalkeeping to add to his goal from the 2-1 win in the first leg, meaning Ramon's fine strike for the Turkish side was merely a memory by the time the final whistle blew - with Besiktas down to 10 men after the late loss of Olcay Sahan.

Lukaku's cousin clearly turned a few heads after his impressive cameo performance off the bench . Brilliant Fiorentina stunned Roma with an early goal blitz to seal their spot in the quarter-finals at the expense of their Italian rivals. Roma might have held a narrow advantage after drawing the first leg 1-1 in Florence but any hopes of progressing were sunk inside 21 minutes on Thursday as Gonzalo Rodriguez, Marcos Alonso and Jose Maria Basanta all netted for Fiorentina. Sorry Roma finished with 10 men following Adem Ljajic's late dismissal. Jose Maria Basanta celebrates after scoring the third goal for Fiorentina as they eased past Roma . Sevilla remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow Spanish side Villarreal. Having done most of the damage with a 3-1 first leg win at El Madrigal, Sevilla finished things off at home with a 2-1 victory courtesy of second-half goals from Vicente Iborra and his replacement Denis Suarez. Villarreal had netted in-between those strikes through Giovani dos Santos' fine free-kick but almost immediately had centre-back Eric Bailly sent off as they tumbled out 5-2 on aggregate. On-loan Barcelona player Denis Suarez (centre) heads home the winning goal against ten-man Villarreal . Napoli are also through after a hard-fought goalless draw against Dinamo Moscow in Russia. The Italians held a 3-1 lead from the first leg and that proved sufficient as they survived a second-leg onslaught from Stanislav Cherchesov's men. Zenit St Petersburg qualified for the quarters despite going down 1-0 to a late headed goal from Torino's Kamil Gilk at the Stadio Olimpico. Zenit arrived for the second leg in Italy with a two-goal cushion, and it proved just enough for Andre Villas-Boas' team to progress after a bruising encounter. Kamil Glik (right) heads home the winner for Torino but it wasn't enough to see them go through . Finally, Yevhen Konoplyanka's extra-time score booked Dnipro's spot on away goals after they claimed a 2-2 aggregate 'win' over Ajax. Riechedly Bazoer fired Ajax ahead in the 60th minute and levelled the tie at 1-1 after Dnipro had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg, however neither side could find a winning goal before the 90 minutes were up, meaning the game went into extra-time. Dnipro took the advantage when Konoplyanka calmly broke to the left edge of Ajax's box before unleashing a shot which found the bottom right corner, meaning that Mike van der Hoorn's goal late in extra time served little purpose. Yevhen Konoplyanka (10) fires home the winner deep into extra-time to put Dnipro into the quarters .","Slaven Bilic was approached by a Besiktas fan following the defeat .

"Their plight was summed up on the whistle. After a game Millwall just had to win in order to retain any hope of survival, the supporters warmly applauded as they trudged off. The fans realise what dreadful circumstances interim manager Neil Harris has pitched up in. It was better but ultimately not enough. The Lions looked every bit a side to have scored just three goals in their previous eight games; plenty of huff, but very little puff. Had Brighton’s Joe Bennett not crashed the bar from 25 yards and later blazed wildly over, it might’ve been worse.

We’re just trying to give them the belief, to get the fans back onside.’ Harris believes this is already a side the fans can identify with again after disaffection under Holloway. ‘I wasn’t always the best player on the pitch here but I played with my heart on my sleeve,’ he added. ‘We maybe lacked a little bit of creativity in the final third and we’re searching for a goal to kickstart us. ‘The league table doesn’t lie - games are running out. You have to start somewhere. We need to add to that. ‘We’re in a difficult position but we’ve got games to win.’ This isn’t fair on the young boss.

These were small steps in a mission to rejuvenate themselves, and something Chris Hughton has noted. ‘They started well,’ the Brighton boss said. ‘I expected that. They’ve got a very good club man in the job at the moment. Everybody here respects him.’ Respect means Harris won’t be implicated in the probable relegation, and for now he’s just intent on putting smiles back on some faces.

"Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao still 'has faith' that he could stay with the Old Trafford club next season.

He has also worked as a director for both the Football League and Wembley Stadium Ltd. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (left) chats to England head coach Stuart Lancaster at Twickenham . Ritchie was brought on board by the RFU following England's disastrous 2011 World Cup campaign . During his six years in tennis, Ritchie managed the installation of the Centre Court roof and two new show courts. He took credit for modernising the famous grass tournament, before being lured across south-west London to Twickenham. His most notable achievement with the RFU was to act as behind-the-scenes broker for the new television deal for European club rugby, saving the domestic game from isolation. Ritchie is hoping to use this year’s World Cup to galvanise English rugby — boosting the grassroots game and emphasising the sport’s ‘core values’ — while maximising TV audiences and ticket sales.

"Kyle Lafferty hailed Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill as the best manager he has played for after yet another match-winning performance at Windsor Park. In recent months Lafferty has been transformed from an infuriatingly erratic performer to the spearhead of his country's unlikely push for a place at Euro 2016. He netted both his side's goals in Sunday's 2-1 win over Finland, a sweetly-hit volley and a deft header, taking Northern Ireland to 12 points from a possible 15 and his scoring tally to five in as many qualifiers. Kyle Lafferty hailed Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill as the best manager he has played for . Lafferty netted both Northern Ireland's goals in Sunday's 2-1 win over Finland in Belfast . It is all a far cry from O'Neill's first campaign, where Lafferty contributed more red cards (one) than goals (zero). And the 27-year-old, currently on loan at Rizespor from Norwich, knows who to thank. 'The last campaign I let everyone down, but Michael had a word with me and it really hit home. I'm probably glad he did that,' said the man who now occupies second place on Northern Ireland's scoring charts with 14. 'Michael is the best manager I've played under and he gets the best from me and pulls me to one side before every game. What he says inspires me and gets me up for the games. I'm buzzing playing for him.' Lafferty has been named man-of-the-match in all four Northern Irish wins, away in Hungary and Greece and at home against the Faroe Islands and Finland. But while he grows increasingly comfortable with being the side's headline grabber, he is equally keen to share the plaudits. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill (left) and Corey Evans applaud the home support after the win . O'Neill has seen Northern Ireland take 12 points from a possible 15 during qualifying in Group F . 'I don't like calling myself a hero, I think all the boys were heroes out there,' he said. 'There could have been five or six players who deserved to be man of the match in the game. 'I thought Jamie Ward, for example, was superb. I scored two goals which is brilliant for me personally, but if I don't score another goal in the campaign and we qualify I'll be happy enough.' A place in France next summer would be a remarkable achievement for a side who have never reached a European Championship before, last made the World Cup finals in 1986 and placed fifth in their 2014 group. But belief is starting to turn to expectation before the players' eyes. 'We can't get ahead of ourselves but if we keep playing like we are now, it would be a disappointment if we didn't get there,' he said. We still have five games to go and everyone is beating everyone. 'The next game in June is going to be massive for us against Romania because it's a top of the table clash.'

"Michael O'Neill believes his Northern Ireland side are one win away from turning their Euro 2016 dream into a reality. O'Neill's men have been one of the surprise packages of the qualifying campaign, with Sunday's 2-1 defeat of Finland making it four wins from five matches. That leaves them second in Group F, four points clear of Hungary and just a point shy of table-topping Romania. Michael O'Neill (left) believes his side are one win away from turning their Euro 2016 dream into a reality . Kyle Lafferty of Northern Ireland blows a kiss to the home support after their Euro 2016 qualifying win . Anghel Iordanescu's side come to Windsor Park on June 13 and O'Neill believes success then would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years. 'The message is simple. We have given ourselves a fantastic chance, and we have to make sure we take our chance again in June,' he said, after Kyle Lafferty's brilliant brace in Belfast. 'The Romania game becomes massive now. If you can win that game, then it would be hard to think we won't get to the Euros. It takes on extra significance. Do we feel 18 points will be enough? Possibly. 'If we can get to 15 points with four games to go, that has to be our target at this moment in time. We will have the chance to go top of the group against Romania.' The game comes at an awkward time, with the English and Scottish seasons having broken up for the summer, but O'Neill hopes that does not have a major impact. Lafferty scores with a header to make the score 2-0 during their win over Finland in Group F . Northern Ireland are currently second in Group F, behind Romania, and have 12 points from five games . He is relying on dedication from his players and two friendlies - one against Qatar on May 31 and another against Wales - to get his side in shape. The Wales game has yet to be confirmed by the two associations, but O'Neill is already treating it as a done deal. We have two good warm-up games before that so preparation will be excellent,' he said. 'Our preparation in June will be vital, and the warm-up games against Qatar and Wales will be crucial. But players finish their seasons in May, and there is an onus on certain players to maintain their own fitness.' If fit Aaron Hughes is sure to become his country's most capped outfield player in that run of fixtures, with his current tally of 95 leaving him level with David Healy. He had to make do with bench duty against Finland, with O'Neill making the tough choice to pair Jonny Evans and Gareth McAuley in the middle while favouring Conor McLaughlin at right-back. O'Neill believes a win on June 13 would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years . They are second in Group F, four points clear of Hungary and just a point shy of table-topping Romania . 'Leaving out Aaron was maybe the most difficult decision I have had to make in my three years, in terms of team selection,' the manager confessed. 'Everyone knows what Aaron Hughes is about and what his qualities are as a player and individual. I sat with Aaron a few nights ago and talked about his situation at Brighton. 'He hasn't played much club football in recent tines, and he fully understood where I was coming from. And Aaron being Aaron, he took it in his professional style. He is still a huge part of this squad, but now we have competition for places which is good. 'Jonny (Evans) showed what a top class player he is, and he showed it at Hampden against Scotland the other night. So it is good.

"For Dave King, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over. The resignation of Ibrox chairman David Somers on Monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board. Yet, the hard work starts here as King and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration, then liquidation, visited Govan. Here, Sportsmail looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in King’s packed in-tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years. Dave King is set to take control of Rangers after chairman Dave Somers resigned from post on Monday . 1. Appoint a new executive team . With the repayment of Mike Ashley’s £5million loan, and running costs of upwards of £25m over the next two years, Rangers need a top-class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club’s financial future. After Friday’s extraordinary general meeting, King will install his allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan as directors. The two remaining current plc directors, Derek Llambias, Rangers’ chief executive, and Barry Leach, director of finance, are not expected to tender their resignations. But King’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost. Not surprisingly to those following this rapacious Rangers saga, Llambias and Leach have both just been awarded bumper contracts, complete with lengthy notice periods. 2. Appoint a manager . Kenny McDowall tendered his resignation in January and the uncomfortable-looking 51-year-old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of Rangers a minute longer than he absolutely has to. Under his management, performances have been poor with Rangers winning just two of their last six games. But it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the Ibrox side to be overtaken by Falkirk and Queen of the South for a place in the play-offs. Stuart McCall is being viewed as the favourite for the post, while fans would love to see King bring back Walter Smith, even in a short-term capacity. But whoever the new manager is, the speedier the appointment, the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion. What is unarguable is this: the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by Ally McCoist and McDowall if Rangers are to overcome a Hibs side that has swatted them aside with ease in the Championship this season. Interim Rangers manager Kenny McDowall does not want the job a minute longer than he has to . 3. Player recruitment . There are 12 Rangers first-team players out of contract in the summer. Captain Lee McCulloch, plus Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller, Jon Daly, Bilel Mohsni, Darren McGregor, Richard Foster, Steven Smith, Sebastien Faure, Ian Black, Kyle Hutton and Steve Simonsen all see their deals run out on June 1, 2015. The sheer volume of out-of-contract players makes it easy for the new boss to carry out a mass cull of what was described by Ibrox legend Richard Gough as ‘probably the worst ever’ team in Rangers history. Yet from such a late starting point, the clock is ticking for the new regime to make wholesale changes. And with out-of-contract players free to speak to suitors since January 1, Rangers are already behind the eight ball in recruiting Bosman signings. 4. Mike Ashley and onerous contracts . Mike Ashley's crisis loans kept the Ibrox club afloat in recent times in exchange for security over pretty much everything bar Ibrox, not to mention an increasingly large share of retail revenues. The contracts with Ashley’s Sports Direct are currently the biggest drain on income at Ibrox. Analysis by the Union of Fans suggests that for every £10 spent on merchandise, Rangers receive an eye-wateringly poor 75p. The suggestions are that these onerous deals are watertight but King’s team need to find out if there is room for manoeuvre. They will also need to go through everything they find with a fine-tooth comb to ensure Ashley is not leaving behind any nasty surprises. Mike Ashley's crisis loans kept Rangers afloat but in exchange for a large share of retail revenues . 5. SFA fit and proper tests . Having won the war to take control at Ibrox, King now needs to convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to become a director of Rangers. A member of the club board under Craig Whyte that eventually saw Rangers liquidated in 2012, tax offences in South Africa saw King fork out £44m in settlement in 2013. That raises issues because the SFA’s professional game board look at whether a proposed director has been convicted within the last 10 years of ‘(i) an offence liable to imprisonment of two years or over, (ii) corruption or (iii) fraud’. The Hampden board also considers whether the applicant has been a director at a club within the five years preceding an insolvency event. King’s prolonged struggle with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has been raised repeatedly by the current plc board. But SARS has imposed no restriction on King acting as a company director and he remains ‘confident’ of passing the SFA’s fit-and-proper-person tests. Paul Murray, who was sacked from the Ibrox board by Whyte, must also convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to be a director. 6. Infrastructure . Rangers fans regularly complain about the decrepit state of Ibrox. Cash is needed to bring it back up to acceptable standard, especially with fans likely to return through the gates in numbers to support the popular new regime. The club’s Murray Park training base at Auchenhowie, which opened 14 years ago, is also badly in need of renovation. Furthermore, Rangers will have to fork out to appoint a team of talent spotters given that the club’s scouting network was scrapped when Neil Murray left in April 2013. Former boss McCoist previously described the need for a scouting system at Rangers as: ‘My No 1 priority for the club moving ahead.’ Money needs to be spent on bringing Ibrox back up to an acceptable standard .","David Somers resigned as Rangers chairman on Monday morning .

"Scotland’s title winners were handed a new incentive to reach the Promised Land of the Champions League after UEFA confirmed large increases in the cash sums on offer. Champions for the last three season, Celtic earned £12.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14. The same performance next season would bring in at least £16m under the new figures announced by Europe’s governing body — and that does not include ticket sales. Confirming the cash ‘cycle’ for the next three years, UEFA will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to Champions League and Europa League clubs. A Scottish club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of £4m. Significantly, however, the three Scottish clubs that enter the Europa League qualifiers will now cover their costs via a solidarity payment of £150,000 – even if they crash out at the first hurdle. Celtic failed to make the Champions League this season, crashing out to Maribor in the qualifiers . Craig Gordon saves against Inter Milan in the last 32 Europa League clash at the San Siro . Celtic line up against Inter  but the Parkhead club will be greedy for the Champions League rewards . Yet, the Europa League remains very much the lesser of UEFA’s tournaments and Ronny Deila, who failed to navigate Celtic to the Champions League this season, will now come under increasing pressure to deliver qualification – and bigger rewards - this summer. Currently top of the league table and chasing four-in-a-row, the Parkhead side can expect to make over £10m if they retain their title and reach next season’s group stage – even if they fail to win a point - an increase from £6.4m. Broadcasting pool revenues will also rise while the prize for a win will increasing to £1.1m and a draw will bring in £362,000. The rewards for reaching the last 16 – as Celtic did most recently in 2012 – will now leap by a whopping £4m. The biggest winners – as always – will be the English Premier League clubs with their huge broadcasting pool. If an English side were to win next season’s Champions League, they would earn around £74m from central UEFA funds alone. Yet what is good for the elite — and what is good for Celtic — is not necessarily good for Scottish football. Most – outwith Aberdeen - assume the Parkhead side will retain their title at the end of this campaign and will have another crack at the Euro elite. Becoming champions of Scotland is no guarantee of Champions League participation, of course, yet the prospect of a £16m-£20m windfall is a strong incentive to get it right this time. For Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell, it’s an imperative. The fear is that more UEFA cash only widens the gap between the aristos and the proletariat. Not only in Europe, but in countries like Scotland where more European money allows Celtic to lord it while the others eat cake. Giorgios Samaras scores in the Nou Camp for Celtic in their 6-1 loss in the 2013 group stages . Celtic enjoyed a glamour tie against AC Milan in the group stages of the 2013 Champions League instalment . UEFA said the changes are a bid to address this, to narrow the gap between the elite competition and the Europa League — the level SPFL clubs realistically aspire to — with general secretary Gianni Infantino insisting: ‘UEFA is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the Champions League and Europa League but also strengthens UEFA’s solidarity principle, namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs. ‘In this way, the new system provides a better deal for everyone, especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two UEFA club competitions. This is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of UEFA’s key values.’ For every pound UEFA give to clubs in the Europa League currently Champions League clubs receive £4.30. From next season that ratio will narrow. Crucially, where clubs like Aberdeen, Inverness, St Johnstone or Dundee United are concerned, there will also be the new solidarity payments for those who crash out of the Europa League at the qualifying stage. This has long been the norm for Scottish clubs, their pain heightened by the cost of flying to far-flung remote outposts in Russia, Belarus or Moldova. Potentially very good for Celtic, then, UEFA's announcement should also make European football more appealing and rewarding to those further down the food chain. Charles Barnett, partner of the Sports Group of BDO, told Sportsmail: ‘What UEFA are saying is that from next season the revenues from the two competitions will be put into one pot and distributed to all the clubs participating. ‘So there is more money going to the Europa League and, let’s be honest, when you are thinking about Scottish clubs now that’s what you are really talking about. ‘There is more money now coming into the Europa League and more potentially available to Scotland’s participants via solidarity payments if they don’t make it to the group stage. ‘In the Champions League, which might affect Celtic, they are going up 60 per cent. ‘But more pertinent to Scotland is the fact that solidarity payments for failing to reach the Europa League will be higher. ‘What that should ensure is an end to the scenario where Scottish teams knocked out in the early qualifying rounds of the Europa League lose money when they are sent to the furthest corner of Eastern Europe. ‘Some Scottish clubs like Motherwell have lost money spending fortunes chartering planes. ‘To make £150,000 just for getting knocked out in the first qualifier plus revenue from the home tie should cover the costs of the away leg.’ That covering the costs of defeat has become a Scots priority is mildly depressing. Yet Celtic used the Europa League group stage as a parachute after Champions League failure last season. And, as Barnett explained: ‘The group stage of the Europa League will also offer a substantial increase of 65 per cent. Participation could see clubs make £4m now.’ For Rangers, much of this will be a source of anguish. With a stated goal of competing with Celtic as soon as possible, the gap becomes more and more difficult to bridge every year their rivals win the Scottish title and have another crack at the Champions League. On a day they announced more financial losses, the Ibrox board – and others around the country - can see just how difficult it will be to challenge the Parkhead side as the country’s dominant force. Barnett argues differently, however, and added: ‘Celtic could make £3m to £4m for reaching the group stage and for a club like Celtic, playing in Scotland, that is big money. ‘But that barely pays for another striker, never mind his wages. It could affect competition if they were winning the league and qualifying season after season after season, but will that really destroy competition? I’m not sure. ‘It’s good to see, but I’m not sure it will widen the gulf in Scottish football. ‘If anything, we will see other Scottish clubs earn more cash via the Europa League and, therefore, the teams finishing second, third and fourth in the SPFL Premiership have more opportunity to earn more money. ‘We are talking about more money being made available to clubs that don’t make it into any competition.’","Celtic earned £12.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14 .

"Kevin Durant, the NBA's reigning most valuable player, will miss the rest of the season as he needs another foot surgery, dealing a blow to the Oklahoma City Thunder's playoff hopes, the team said on Friday. The six-time All-Star will have surgery on his ailing right foot next week and is expected to return to basketball activities in four to six months, according to the Thunder. His loss is a massive blow for a Thunder team hanging onto the final playoff seed in the Western Conference, three games ahead of ninth-place Phoenix, with 10 games to play.

Durant, who had averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 27 games this season, had surgery last month to alleviate soreness in his foot caused by a screw that was inserted in October during a procedure to repair a fracture at the base of his small toe. But after he visited two specialists this past week and held several conference calls with a specialist team, it was determined that the fracture, which had shown significant healing previously, was demonstrating signs of regression. 'The bone graft is the standard procedure for the five to eight percent of Jones fracture surgeries that do not initially have success or experience setbacks sometime within the recovery period,' the Thunder said in a statement. 'While everyone is disappointed that Kevin falls into that group, we are encouraged that the bone graft procedure has historically demonstrated long-term health and stability.'

Durant, a four-time NBA scoring champion who starred on the gold medal-winning U.S. team at the 2012 Olympic Games, had been inching his way toward a return before the team removed him from basketball activities last week.

On the verge of adding the domestic Treble to the championship he won a year ago, the 24-year-old is also a forerunner for the player of the year awards. Celtic boss Ronny Delia believes Premier League clubs will soon come calling for midfielder Stefan Johansen . And, speaking to a Norwegian TV station this week, Deila was asked how long he could keep the player at Celtic Park. He replied: ‘It’s clear it’s difficult. He is good enough to play in the Premier League but then it is a question of whether he wants it. ‘I think Stefan is very fond of Celtic and it’s a much bigger club to play for than for example West Bromwich. ‘Stefan made a wise choice when he chose to go to Celtic. Here he is allowed to develop, not least physically. He has been playing regularly at a high level.’ Johansen, who also spoke with the Norwegian broadcaster TV2, was adamant that he had no immediate desire to leave Celtic, though. The 24-year-old is adamant he has no immediate desire to leave the Scottish giants at present . ‘The reason why I’m doing so well now is that I enjoy where I am,’ he said. ‘I see no reason why I should change clubs. I’m at a club that will win trophies, who have the ambition to play in Europe.’ Meanwhile, Queens Park Rangers are monitoring Jason Denayer’s situation. The Premier League strugglers have had the Belgian watched several times recently with a move to a summer transfer. Deila has stated that he’d like the defender to return to Glasgow for another year-long loan from Manchester City even though the player’s preference is a return to his parent club. QPR boss Chris Ramsey remains hopeful of persuading Denayer to switch to London – regardless of what league his side are playing in.

"Stephen Curry had 33 points and 10 assists as the Golden State Warriors pulled away from the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers in the second half for a 122-108 victory Tuesday that clinched the team's first division title in 39 years. Andre Iguodala came off the bench to score 21 points for the Warriors, who won their seventh straight to push their record to an NBA-best 58-13.

"LaMarcus Aldridge believes his Portland Trail Blazers side have learned from last season's NBA play-off heartbreak to become serious contenders for this year's Finals crown. Last season, Portland reached the Western Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2000 - before losing to eventual champions the San Antonio Spurs in five games. Fast-forward 12 months on and the Trail Blazers are set to qualify for the post-season play-offs once more. Portland Trail Blazers power forward LaMarcus Aldridge believes his side can win the NBA title this term . Terry Stotts' side currently sit fourth in the Western Conference standings having won 44 and lost 25 matches this season. Despite a recent horrible run of form, that has seen Portland lose five on the bounce, power forward Aldridge believes his team are a force to be reckoned with. 'I think the team this year is really good. The team has had its ups and downs - winning streaks and losing streaks are just a part of the NBA season,' he said in a teleconference call with media from Asia on Tuesday night. 'But I think we’ve all grown from last year. I've got better, Dame [Damian Lillard] has got better, every player that was on the roster last year has got better. 'We have an opportunity to win this year, but we have to play a lot better and maximize our time out there. Aldridge (right) was part of the Portland team that lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the semi-finals last season . 'I think we learned a lot from our play-offs series versus San Antonio. We saw how well they executed, we saw how they never stopped playing, how dialed-in they were. They were very particular about the things they did and how hard they played. They were just locked in. 'I think we saw that they we weren't on that level last year but I think every player understands what it takes to win and we saw how they beat us up close and personal. 'So I think we get it. I think this team is probably a little bit better than last year as far as experience goes, from the guys we had being in those moments last year. Then Arron [Afflalo] came in and Steve Blake, they gave us more experience and they make us better, too.' Aldridge, a four-time NBA All-Star, is one reason why Portland have enjoyed a good season so far and are a dangerous opponent in the West. The 29-year-old (left) has helped the Trail Blazers to sit fourth in the Western Conference standings at present . The 29-year-old is enjoying a breakout season with career highs in points, free throws and free throw goal percentages - something the Dallas-born star attributes to maturing as a player and working hard in the off-season. 'It's just getting older. I’m more comfortable out there, I’m in my prime offensively so I think in the last three years I’ve just gotten better, I’ve just felt more comfortable every year,' he added. 'And with the three points, I focused on it last summer, I got a lot more shots. In the off season I’ve tried to become more comfortable with the three. 'I think with our offence, I can take more threes on the floor in games, so I think it’s just a little bit of the hard work in the summertime, and being more comfortable with the offence, and just being in my prime and feeling confident out there.' Aldridge will be hoping his efficiency on the court can help Portland's five-game losing streak when they travel to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.

"Sam Twiston-Davies says Rocky Creek is in flying form as it emerged that the Crabbie’s Grand National hopeful could have been given a big advantage by the handicapper. Trained by Paul Nicholls, Rocky Creek — last seen when impressively winning the BetBright Chase at Kempton in February — was among 74 horses after the latest forfeit stage for the Aintree showpiece on April 11. Lord Windermere, the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner trained by Jim Culloty, heads the weights on 11st 10lb, but Rocky Creek could have 9lb in hand. Sam Twiston-Davies rides Rocky Creek to victory in the BetBright Chase Day at Kempton . Twiston-Davies poses with his ride and trainer Paul Nicholls (right) after winning at Kempton . Twiston-Davies schooled the nine-year-old at Nicholls’ Ditcheat base on Monday as preparations stepped up a gear, while Shutthefrontdoor — the 8-1 ante-post favourite — was put through his paces at Southwell under AP McCoy. While public sentiment will be with McCoy for the big race, Phil Smith, the BHA’s Head of Handicapping, warns that dangers to Shutthefrontdoor lurk all around, not least from Rocky Creek, who is available at 12-1. Champions jockey AP McCoy exercises ante-post favourite Shutthefrontdoor at Southwell . Smith said: ‘Rocky Creek was very impressive when he won at Kempton. If I was framing the weights now, I’d have him 9lb higher. I’d also have The Druids Nephew (a winner at the Cheltenham Festival) 10lb higher.’ Rocky Creek will be one of six bullets that Nicholls aims at the £1million race, which he won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges, and the horse has been trained with Aintree in mind — he finished fifth 12 months ago to Pineau De Re. Twiston-Davies added of the gelding, who has run only three times this season: ‘Fingers crossed, the horse seems to be in good order. Hopefully he’ll get there in one piece. I schooled him and he was very good. He did it well at Kempton and let’s hope he’s ahead of the handicapper. Twiston-Davies believes Rocky Road has a good chance of winning the big race at Aintree . ‘When he ran in the Hennessy (in November and was pulled up) it was really bad ground and I would just write that run off altogether. We have to go to Aintree with an open mind.’ As for Pineau De Re, his trainer Dr Richard Newland could require a new jockey as the veteran chaser bids to become the first horse since Red Rum in 1974 to win back-to-back Grand Nationals. Leighton Aspell, who did the steering a year ago, could be claimed to ride Many Clouds. Newland said: ‘I might have a few calls to make. It is Leighton’s ride if he is available. It is pointless getting worried at this stage. I’m sure there will be a few interested jockeys if Leighton isn’t available.’","Rocky Creek impressively won the BetBright Chase at Kempton, February .

"Coneygree became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup. The eight-year-old, trained by Mark Bradstock and ridden by Nico de Boinville, took the blue riband prize of steeplechasing on only his fourth race over fences.

Coneygree (7-1) held on up the hill by a length and a half from Djakadam (10-1), with Road To Riches (8-1) two lengths away in third. De Boinville said: 'It's the best feeling ever, I'm lost for words. 'I never thought they shouldn't have run in this, it was a great plan. 'The weather gods were looking down on us and the ground was ideal. AP McCoy looks dejected after Carlingford Lough finished ninth at the Cheltenham Gold Cup . 'He's so deceptive, even when he gets in tight he's brilliant, it's all thanks to the Bradstock family, it's a great family effort. 'I must thank the owners and the Bradstocks for keeping the faith in me. These horses only come once in a lifetime.' Sara Bradstock, wife of the winning trainer and daughter of the late Lord Oaksey, who bred Coneygree, said: 'He (Lord Oaksey) is not here, but he's here in spirit. 'I'd been saying to people, when we win the Gold Cup we'll win the lottery, it's that amazing.' 'It's only his fourth run over fences, but he had so much time off and he's wise in his own way.' Lady Oaksey said: 'I've been asking myself what decision would John (Oaksey) have made? As it turned out, it was a very good decision after looking at Vautour and Don Poli (in the novice chases). 'To win this now - you dream and it's absolutely amazing.' It was the 19-times champion's final ride in the Gold Cup before his retirement . Mrs Bradstock added: 'All the people quoted stats at us, but this horse knows how to jump and how to gallop and he showed them. 'We were forecast real rain, which made the decision for us, and it was an open Gold Cup. 'It's so unbelievable, I've been in the yard from 6am until 10pm and it's all for this. 'All the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses and our mare cost £3,000. 'People were asking after Newbury (when Richard Johnson rode in the Denman Chase) if Nico would get the ride back, but of course he would - he rides him beautifully, he'll be a great jockey. 'It's a little bit back to work later as my favourite person, Carruthers, runs tomorrow (at Uttoxeter), but I might not be at my best! 'It shows anyone can do it, you don't need millions . 'He didn't know he's a novice.' The winning trainer said: 'I'm numb, it's wonderful. It won't sink in for a while, but it's great. Zara Philips (right) was in attendance for the Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase . 'We've done it before in smaller races and we'll still keep doing it, but it's fantastic to do it on the big stage. 'I can't remember where I watched it as I'm not very good at watching races. 'The decision was very tricky because the weather forecast was so up and down and obviously we were liaising very closely with Simon Claisse (clerk of the course) and walking the course. But we made the right decision. 'He's a gorgeous horse and it's so tragic that Sara's dad (Lord Oaksey) wasn't here today to see it.' Rich Ricci, owner of the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, said: 'He's run a stormer, I thought we had him but fair play to the winner, to run in this race as a novice and to do that from the front was spectacular. 'He'll be back next year. We've had a great week.' His rider Ruby Walsh said: 'He's run a blinder. He made a few little jumping errors, but he's run a blinder for a six-year-old. 'He stuck his head out and gave me everything he had.' Mullins said: 'We had a fantastic run and I was just commending the winner's brave decision to run in the Gold Cup. It paid off and the winner did it the hard way in front. 'I was delighted with my horse. He ran well. He jumped great and got a good position. I don't have any excuses and Ruby doesn't either. Ruby Walsh (centre) had to contend with second place as Djakadam finished a length and a half behind Coneygree . 'Our fellow is only a six-year-old and the winner's an eight-year-old. In those conditions, when stamina comes to the fore, age will always beat youth. We'll go on to Punchestown.' Noel Meade said of Road To Riches: 'He ran a great race. We're delighted and disappointed. What other way can you be? 'We thought we had a chance at the last. It's possible the ground was a disadvantage to us. Maybe it wasn't, but we think it might have been.' Richie McLernon, rider of fourth home Holywell, said: 'He stays all day and you can't ask any more. He gave me his all today.' His trainer Jonjo O'Neill said: 'We're delighted with our little horse. It was a brilliant race really. 'We had to put a lot of effort in with his jumping. He'd be better on better ground, but today the best horse won. 'Our horse ran a blinder and we're thrilled to bits with him. 'The winner is a fantastic horse and they couldn't catch him.' Paul Nicholls, trainer of the vanquished favourite Silviniaco Conti, who was seventh, said: 'Noel (Fehily) is not really sure. My view is that the ground might have been deep enough for him. It was a bit more testing than we thought. 'Watching that I suppose he is better on a flatter track on better ground. If he's fresh and well we'll probably head to Aintree with him now.' Tony McCoy was ninth on Carlingford Lough in what was his final ride in the Gold Cup before retirement. The 19-times champion said: 'I knew when we got here this morning we were in trouble. He's a horse that likes good ground and for a horse that's slow but has a bit of speed at the end of his race, he doesn't like it when it turns into a drag.' Paying tribute to the winner, McCoy said: 'Fair do's to the Bradstocks for running him. It was an unbelievable performance from a novice chaser. 'He got them at it early and stuck at it well. All credit to them. It's fantastic.'","Coneygree is the first novice to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup since 1974 .

"Failure has become a formality for London Welsh and relegation became a reality after they suffered their 18th consecutive Aviva Premiership defeat in a dire meeting with Bath. This was more ‘Sloppy Sunday’ than ‘Super Saturday’ as torrential weather conditions dictated an arm wrestle that confirmed the end of the Exiles’ short-lived spell back in the top flight. For Welsh coach Rowland Phillips, on his first game in charge since taking over from Justin Burnell, it spelt the beginning of a long and painful rebuilding process to get the Oxford-based franchise back to where they want to be. ‘We have to learn our lessons,’ said Phillips. ‘There is honest ambition throughout the club and the mindset has to be about improving.

"Sampdoria striker Samuel Eto'o has revealed he was the victim of racism during his time at Chelsea. The Blues have been in the spotlight recently after five supporters were ordered to appear in court over an alleged racist incident on the Paris Metro. A Paris Saint-Germain fan appeared to be prevented from boarding a train before his side took on Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash. Samuel Eto'o trains with Sampdoria amid claims he was the victim of racism while in London . Eto'o celebrated his 33th birthday with his team-mates after a trainign session on Tuesday . Five men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 in connection with the incident in Paris. Eto'o spent last season at Stamford Bridge and scored nine goals in 21 Premier League appearances, but has revealed there was one unpleasant event during his time in west London. 'I went to go buy a watch at a jewellers, not too far from my house,' he told CNN. 'The watch I wanted to see was expensive. And I asked the saleswoman - who was also black - ""Could you show me that watch please?"" 'I saw her turn to her co-workers like, ""Uh, what should I do?"" Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, ""OK, I’ll buy it."" I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined. I asked her, ""Was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted?"" Eto'o spent last season at Chelsea, scoring nine goals in 21 Premier League games .

'My brother told them, ""My brother can afford this and the way you’re treating him shows that you think just because he’s black, he can’t afford this watch."" 'The woman then slipped up and said, ""No, it’s just that we had some Nigerians in the store the other day who came in with fake credit cards."" 'I don’t know if you can imagine the weight of what she said. If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all.

"Sam Allardyce admits he was wrong to claim Winston Reid had been tapped up after the West Ham defender finally penned a fresh contract with the club. Talks between the Hammers and Reid had been ongoing for several months, with reported interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal leaving many West Ham supporters on tenterhooks over the future of their New Zealand international. Allardyce said in January that it was 'highly unlikely' Reid had not already verbally agreed to leave Upton Park given that he was yet to sign a new contract and went on to suggest earlier this month that he needed to rope in the questioning techniques of Jack Bauer from television's '24' to get an answer out of the player. Winston Reid signed a new six-and-a-half year deal West Ham last week after it appeared he would leave . Sam Allardyce had said it was unlikely that Reid had not verbally agreed to join another club . But the 26-year-old, who will miss Saturday's trip to Arsenal through injury, has now signed a six-and-a-half-year contract to keep him tied down to the east London outfit - with Allardyce quick to admit he had misread the situation. 'I was wrong, so I admit that,' he said when asked if he was surprised to see Reid sign a new deal having questioned whether he had been tapped up. 'For me, if somebody's out of contract like that it would have all been done and dusted by the end of the season, even though it might not have been done and dusted from a paperwork point of view. 'His agent would have sorted out a deal somewhere or other in this country. I was probably more concerned about abroad because it could have been a pre-contract. The central defender had been linked with the likes of Tottenham and Arsenal before penning new contract . 'One of the bigger clubs in Europe could have seen what Winston has done here and said ""he's the one for us"" and taken him abroad so I was obviously wrong.' Allardyce believes a strong showing for West Ham this season would have helped convince Reid to stay put - insisting no club bigger than the Hammers had looked like making a move for his signature. 'It was the longest negotiation ever,' he added. 'I think that in the end both parties are very, very pleased with the outcome. I think the big pull for Winston signing this time around is that we've had a good season up until now that we need to finish off as strong as we can. Reid fights for the ball with Tottenham striker Harry Kane during the recent match at White Hart Lane . '(We are) moving to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, so where else is he going to get bigger than West Ham United? 'Probably because nobody of a greater status than West Ham has actually taken up his position, he signs up with us, which we're both delighted about. 'Winston has now been in that position for a considerable amount of time and he now sees West Ham as the best way forward for him and we're absolutely delighted with that because it's been a long, hard negotiation for him. 'It's been well into more than a year of trying to come to an agreement in terms of the contract. Now the contract is secured for a period of time that takes Winston along and hopefully the club along to better things.'","Winston Reid signed new six-and-a-half year deal with West Ham last week .

Defenders scored both Portuguese goals as Ricardo Carvalho and Fabio Coentrao netted in each half, either side of a spectacular equaliser from Nemanja Matic with an overhead kick.

"She's a key aide to Ed Miliband and has campaigned tirelessly to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour. Yet Karen Buck’s son is an amateur gangster rapper who pens lyrics about ‘spreading out the kush’ and ‘blazin’ - colloquial references to cannabis use. Ms Buck, who has worked to reduce drug misuse in her constituency Westminster North, has been Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary since April 2013. Cosmo Buck-Taylor, 21, has posted several videos on his YouTube channel, CuzzyOfficial, in which he appears to be smoking the illegal drug. Rapper: Cosmo Buck-Taylor, 21, has posted several videos on his YouTube channel, CuzzyOfficial, in which he appears to be smoking the illegal drug . His raps, Don’t Like Freestyle and My Reality, show a teenage Mr Buck-Taylor wearing a tracksuit and smoking alongside marijuana paraphernalia. Surrounded by friends dressed in hoodies and caps, Mr Buck-Taylor is filmed rapping in front of graffitied garages and walking through housing estates. Although the videos were uploaded around two years ago, the rapper appears to still promote the Class B substance. Private matter: MP Karen Buck said her son's video had nothing to do with her role in public life . In his newly released single ‘Young Livin I Fade’, he raps ‘we get high everyday’ and ‘we just smoke weed till our eyes get red’. His mother has held the seat of Westminster North since May 2010 and is defending a majority of 2,126 votes at the general election on May 7. The 56-year-old withdrew her son from one of Tony Blair’s flagship city academies - Paddington Academy - in 2006 after he allegedly received barely any education for a year. Mr Buck-Taylor, who was 12-years-old at the time and had only been at the academy for a term following its opening, was switched to a nearby comprehensive school. When questioned about his rap videos, Mr Buck-Taylor said: ‘This is none of your business. This is my personal life, you have no right to interfere in my life. This was when I was 18-years-old. I was not smoking a joint.’ But when questioned about what substance was in the cigarette, he said: ‘No comment’. Ms Buck, who first became an MP in Westminster in 1997, said the video had no bearing on her position in politics. She said: ‘As far as I’m aware this is some time ago. It’s a private matter and I don’t see that it has anything to do with my role in public life.’ Ms Buck, who has been an MP since 1997 when her seat was called Regents Park and Kensington North, made her name while a councillor at Westminster when she was involved in exposing fraudulent behaviour of Shirley Porter and the Homes for Votes scandal. She caused a stir in her ward in 2014 when she infuriated one of her non-muslim constituents by twice sending him a card celebrating an Islamic festival. She admitted that her staff went through the electoral register picking out people with ‘Islamic’ names.","Rapper pens lyrics about 'blazin' - a colloquialism for cannabis use .

"Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos has defended team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo following his apparent strop during the 2-0 defeat of Levante on Sunday, saying: 'It is difficult to be Cristiano'. The Portuguese superstar was criticised for his cold reaction towards both of Gareth Bale's goals as he failed to score himself before disappearing directly down the tunnel as his team-mates applauded fans after game.

"Henry Slade enjoys a challenge. The lavishly gifted Exeter threequarter has already overcome more hurdles than many encounter in a lifetime. Stand his ground with troubled foster children? Naturally. Ignore advice from coaches that he was too small for rugby as a teenager? Absolutely. Battle Type 1 diabetes to forge a burgeoning professional rugby career? No problem.Outshine Jonny Wilkinson on his first European appearance? By a distance.Be included as the wild card in Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad? Just maybe. Exeter playmaker Henry Slade (right) is being touted as a potential wildcard for England's World Cup squad . The 22-year-old has been in superb form for Exeter this season and could slot in nicely in the England set-up . For his many talents, Slade, 22, named Aviva Premiership player of the month for March, remains humble, grounded and reluctant to talk up his World Cup prospects. But his consistently high-quality displays in the Exeter midfield are making his case hard to ignore. The only player name-checked by Lancaster as a possible World Cup bolter after impressing on attachment to the squad during the Six Nations, the lithe left-footer from Plymouth has been told he will definitely feature in England's pre-World Cup camp where he can stake a claim for inclusion. Many believe he could yet prove England's missing midfield link as a physically robust, footballing 12 of enormous potential. 'It's nice to have that knowledge that I'll be there and have a chance to stake my claim,' he said. 'Everyone likes to feel they're ready for that next step. I feel I'm capable but it's not up to me. It doesn't get any bigger than a home World Cup and of course I'd love to be involved. Who wouldn't? But I realise I'm still some way down the pecking order and have plenty to do.' Slade's humility is evident as we sit and talk in Sandy Park's main stand enjoying the milky Devonian spring sunshine. On the field, he has more of a strut; confident in his skills and sure of his intent. A first international cap is a matter of when, not if. But just like the Exeter club he joined as a teenager, Slade refuses to get carried away by success. He is wise beyond his years, having lived with diabetes since a chance diagnosis at the age of 18. Standing up for his younger brothers when his parents took on foster children also opened his eyes to a world beyond the rugby field. 'Mum used to own a hairdressing salon but sold it when she had kids and became a respite foster carer instead,' he said. 'It puts things in perspective seeing kids my age who'd had such difficult upbringings or had been taken away from their parents because they weren't fit to look after them. It's not nice. 'When they started kicking off you'd have to stop them but I'd always try to take a minute to sit back and think, 'Bloody hell, they've had it tough' and think about why they'd be reacting in that way. It was a pretty good life experience.' Slade has overcome many challenges in his career, including diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes aged 18 . A less welcome experience has been the daily injections of insulin and regular blood tests required to check his blood sugar is not at dangerous levels. Typically, Slade considers his glass half full, not half empty. 'Getting the diagnosis at 18 was pretty tough to take,' he said. 'My dad had it as well so I knew how it would affect my life and how organised I was going to have to be. Still, while the other lads get their supplements and beetroot shakes before a match I get a nice big cup of jelly babies, so it's not all bad.' Thriving under the tutelage of director of rugby Rob Baxter at the upwardly mobile Aviva Premiership club, Slade is making a name for himself by stepping up to every challenge put in front of him. He first made the headlines as a 20-year-old in 2012 with an outrageously composed display against Jonny Wilkinson and his Toulon team-mates after being called on as a first-half replacement for Gareth Steenson. Five years earlier, he would have been excused for giving up the game. 'I went for a county under 15s trial and was told I was too small,' he said. 'I was devastated but it made me work harder the following year. Hitting my growth spurt probably helped too.' Now standing 6ft 2in and weighing in excess of 14st, Slade has proved his defensive mettle countless times this season, most notably against Leicester early in the season when he proved a match for his hulking opposite man Manu Tuilagi on a string of occasions. Similar in style to Wallaby maestro Matt Giteau, Slade has taken heart from the performances of fellow 'lightweights' Jonathan Joseph and George Ford during England's Six Nations campaign. 'I obviously understand and respect that winning collisions is a massive part of rugby but there still has to be space for players like George Ford and Jonathan Joseph,' he said. Slade kicks a penalty during the Aviva Premiership match between Exeter and Bath at Twickenham . 'JJ is not the biggest of players but his footwork and the way he beats defenders is top class. It's the same scenario as we had here with me and Sam Hill in the centre. Two different styles who can play to each other's strengths and cover every base. It's the beauty of having a ball player and a physical, trucking-up type centre.' Comfortable at fly-half or centre and an outstanding left-footed goal-kicker, Slade would be a more than useful squad player. If he can make the cut, indications are he has the temperament for international rugby. 'I've always relished the challenge and found the bigger the occasion the more excited I get by it and the more I enjoy it,' he added. So, what money Slade at No12 when England play Fiji at Twickenham on September 18? It is still a long shot, but he has already made a habit of defying the odds.

"Hein Verbruggen will be asked by the UCI to resign his position as honorary president of cycling's world governing body after an independent report accused him of colluding with Lance Armstrong and other riders to conceal doping offences. The man who stood as UCI president between 1991 and 2005, and remains in a senior position in the organisation as well as an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, was accused of being complicit in one of the biggest cover-ups in sporting history in an independent report into cycling's doping past. Here at the UCI headquarters in Aigle today the current president of the organisation, Brian Cookson, said he would be writing to Verbruggen personally to call for him to stand down. Hein Verbruggen is being asked to resign from his position as honorary president of the UCI . Verbruggen (left with Lance Armstrong in March 2003) is alleged to have interfered in doping issues to protect his star riders such as the disgraced former American superstar . Brian Cookson, the current UCI president will write to  Verbuggen personally calling for his resignation . 'I am very concerned by what I have seen in the report and I will be writing to him asking him to consider his position as an honorary president, which was awarded to him by the Congress of the UCI when he retired as president,' said Cookson. 'Not everything Hein did was bad or wrong. He built this organisation into a strong organisation. But clearly, as is shown in report, decisions were made at that time which were about protecting the reputation of the sport rather than the integrity of the sport. 'There were serious errors of judgement and Hein really should consider his position now.' If Verbruggen refuses Cookson said it would then become a matter for the UCI Congress. 'The UCI Congress was the body that awarded him that status and maybe it would be that they reconsider that in September,' he said. Matt Lawton's exclusive scoop on the Armstrong doping scandal, Daily Mail back page from November 18 . Cookson also accepts the CIRC report is right to suggest that doping remains a serious problem for the current professional peloton. 'One of the things it says is that things have improved substantially in terms of doping in cycling,' said Cookson. 'But it does still say that there is room for further improvement. 'I think what they have said is a pretty accurate reflection. But there is some interpretation there. There are a whole range of contributions, some of which have been picked up by the media. For instance, one person said 90 per cent of the peloton is still doping. Others have said the problem is much much less than that. I'd like to think that it is the latter rather than the former. But there will always be people who will cheat.' Reports allege that the UCI acted favourably to Armstrong by not target-testing him despite suspicions .","UCI honorary president Hein Verbuggen has been called to stand down .

"Yaya Toure has suggested he may be about to step away from international football, after claiming 'my target is done'. Toure captained his country to this winter's Africa Cup of Nations, their first major trophy in over two decades, and could now follow his brother Kolo in retiring from Ivory coast duty. Toure said he would take a couple of days to decide, but suggested that the Elephants' new generation should be allowed to flourish. Yaya Toure has hinted that he might step down from international duty with the Ivory Coast . Toure was in action during the draw with Equatorial Guinea in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on Sunday . 'My future?' he asked, when questioned by the BBC. 'You have to wait. Now, my target is done. We have to wait for a couple of days and see what we can do. 'My brother has retired, and Copa (Barry, the long-standing Ivorian goalkeeper) as well. The time of the youngsters will come soon. We need to let them. 'It's always beautiful when everything is going in the right way. I'm delighted with the trophy of 2015. Now we just want to focus, I will wait a couple of days before we decide my future.' The comments will be good news for Manchseter City, who struggled in Toure's absence during the Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. Toure said 'my target is done' after leading his country to the Africa Cup of Nations last month . The news would be good for Manchester City, who have struggled in Toure's absence .

But with the next World Cup more than three years away, Toure, 31, doesn't see the tournament as a realistic prospect, so is considering his future with the national team.

"Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was left smiling at the end of a difficult weekend by watching the club's new Major League Soccer franchise make a sparkling start to life at Yankee Stadium. The sight of Manuel Pellegrini's men crashing at Burnley on Saturday wouldn't have been easy for Al Mubarak to stomach as hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League title receded. But he was sporting the broadest of smiles after David Villa inspired NYCFC to see off the New England Revolution and ensure a perfect beginning to their temporary stint in the Bronx. David Villa scored New York City's first home goal in MLS against New England Revolution on Sunday . Villa celebrates in front of a mammoth crowd exceeding 43,000 at Yankee Stadium in New York . The Etihad supremo, along with chief executive Ferran Soriano, did the rounds in the locker room after the match and spoke to members of Jason Kreis' squad, thanking them for their efforts. Al Mubarak told Sportsmail: 'I was really pleased how the team played. It was great to see. 'The first game is always going to be tricky. We were at home, New England had got the to the final last season but it was a great performance. Khaldoon Al Mubarak (centre) did not have a good start to the weekend, but was all smiles on Sunday night . A view of Yankee Stadium during the match, as over 43,000 spectators watched NYC's first home game . 'I was particularly pleased with the second half. The crowd were great.' Spanish superstar Villa was the hero, scoring one and making another for former Revs midfielder Patrick Mullins at the death to seal the triumph in front of a crowd which exceeded 43,000. 'It's very simple. We have a very special player named David Villa,' Mullins said. 'We make good runs and he's going to find us. If we put it away, we're going to score a lot of goals this year.'

"David Villa has graced the grandest stages of them all. World Cup and Champions League triumphs sit proudly on a superb CV. His spell at New York City FC may not be on the same level, yet the unbridled joy displayed at creating history with the new Major League Soccer side’s first ever goal on the hallowed turf of Yankee Stadium was there for all to see. It was his presence which attracted a healthy and encouraging 43,507 here. And  it was his typically busy display which ultimately was the difference. David Villa fires past Bobby Shuttleworth to score the first goal for New York City FC at Yankee Stadium . The Spaniard finished off a neatly-worked move with Ned Grabavoy to put the hosts on the way to a well-deserved victory . Yankee Stadium played host to a whole new ball game as the MLS expansion franchise won its first game in the Big Apple . A packed Yankee Stadium watches as the two teams battle it out in the second game of the MLS season . New York City: Saunders; Williams (Facey 79), Hernandez, Wingert, Brovsky; Velasquez (Shelton 66), Diskerud, Jacobsen, Grabavoy; Villa, Nemec (Mullins 84). Booked: Wingert, Williams . Goals: Villa 19, Mullins 84 . New England Revolution: Shuttleworth; Alston (Barnes 59), Farrell, Goncalves, Tierney; Kobayashi, Dorman; Rowe, Nguyen (Caldwell 71), Fagundez; Agueldo (Davies 65). Booked: Agueldo, Dorman . Sent off: Goncalves . Attendance: 43,507 . His first goal since moving to the US this summer was a clinically taken strike on 20 minutes and, on another day and without the seemingly impenetrable Bobby Shuttleworth standing in his way, the 33 year-old would have bagged a hatful. Yet he still managed to retain his composure and cross for Patrick Mullins on 84 minutes to nab the killer second and prove the former Barcelona and Atletico Madrid striker brings much more to the table than just lightning quick reactions in front of goal. Of course, it's not all about one man and, in truth, Manchester City’s newest fledgling entity were decent value after securing their first win against a New England Revolution side who were harshly forced to play with 10 for the last 23 minutes following Jose Goncalves’ straight red card. City have aggressively marketed their brand new adventure in Manhattan, hammering home the fact that they – and not the New Jersey based Red Bulls – are the true team of New York. The numbers swilling around outside before kick-off suggested it had done the trick. Yankee stadium, no matter how resplendent an arena it is, will never be a perfect fit for the beautiful game. Yet NYCFC and their freshly conceived, enthusiastic fanbase did their best to make it feel like home. The makeshift pitch which has already got the baseball players fretting ahead of their season opener in three weeks time, was certainly passable. There was a decent atmosphere though here in the Bronx. The rarest of sightings in this vast country - away fans - played their part too. It was hard to gauge exactly at what stage Jason Kreis’ side were at in the opening day draw with fellow newcomers Orlando City. They are still in an embryonic stage after just a handful of games together. New York City FC celebrate after Patrick Mullins wrapped up the first victory of the MLS season for the team .

Villa shakes hands with New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio as Chris Wingert looks on before the victory at Yankee Stadium . New York City FC fans wait for the start of the game during the inaugural game of the MLS franchise . New England, who were denied the title last season by Robbie Keane’s LA Galaxy, would certainly provide a much clearer yardstick. And so it proved. Villa buzzed around early on, teeing up frontman Adam Nemec who shot straight at Revolution keeper Bobby Shuttleworth before the Spanish was ace was denied on 15 minutes following a typical jinking run into the box. The former Barcelona man was, by far and away, the most potent player on the pitch. And on 19 minutes came his first MLS strike. It was a classic Villa moment. A sweet exchange with Ned Grabavoy opened up the visitor’s backline and as Villa bore down on goal, there was only going to be one outcome. His finish was assured, calm and clinical. When Frank Lampard arrives in the summer, the added quality will ensure City will be hugely competitive. Yet in the land of single entity leagues and the desperation of ensuring level playing fields, weaknesses in other parts of the pitch are harder to plug. The home side’s defence looked particularly creaky with New England knocking on the door with increasing regularity following Villa’s opener. The best chances fell to Juan Agudelo, the first on 36 minutes when a weak flick dribbled the wrong side of the post before he somehow headed straight at Josh Saunders from four yards out.

Twice Villa was set free, twice he failed to apply the finishing touch. It was fast becoming the Shuttleworth and Villa show - the Revolution keeper brilliantly tipping over a fierce 12 yard volley from the Spanish superstar. The visitors were soon reduced to ten men on 67 minutes after centre-half Jose Goncalves was handed a straight red for hauling down substitute Khiry Shelton. Yes, he was the last man. Yet contact was minimal if that. It was left to that man Villa though to have the final say when he crossed for Mullins to make it two. Villa has wasted no time in making an impact. He is already the big man in the Big Apple.","Villa finished a lovely move in the 19th minute, slotting past keeper Bobby Shuttleworth .

"An American student has created a Batman-style suit that can withstand assaults from punches, baseball bats and even knifes. Jackson Gordon, an industrial design student from Philadelphia University, constructed the armoured suit with money raised through Kickstarter – a global crowd-funding platform designed to aid creative endeavors. Hoping to raise $1000 to begin the project, Jackson received backing from 17 enthusiasts and raised $1255 – more than enough to begin assembling the suit. Without breaking a sweat: Jackson Gordon holds his hands behind his head as his friend tests the suit with some heavy punches . Made from Kevlar and silicone moulds, the Batsuit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21-year-old from Wayne, Pennsylvania five months to complete from start to finish. Videoed testing the final product with a friend, Jackson  is featured being repeatedly punched in the chest, back and sides while wearing the suit. Despite  Jackson flinching slightly under the impact of the punches, the suit is remarkably durable and the young designer even calls for his friend to hit him harder and with both hands. Made from Kevlar and silicone moulds, the Batsuit is able to withstand the heavy punches that repeatedly rain in . The suit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21-year-old five months to complete from start to finish . Laughing as the blows rain in, Jackson showcases the strength of the soft plates on the side and shoulder area alongside the harder ones, which also hold up well against the impact. Smiling at the camera in admiration for his suit, The student says: ‘I could do this all day. I can’t even feel it.’ This is the second batsuit created by Jackson, who previously made one based on Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy a year before.

"It was the match Martin O’Neill needed to win to convince the many doubters that this qualifying campaign is not destined to end in failure. For regardless of substitute Shane Long’s stoppage-time equaliser amid a frenzied finish, it was a performance and result which again raises more questions than answers. O’Neill will protest that the second-half display was better – it could not have been worse than their sorry first-half showing – but this was supposed to be the making of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium, a venue which is yet to produce any iconic nights for the boys in green. Substitute Shane Long celebrates his 90th-minute strike which secured a crucial draw for the Republic of Ireland in Dublin .

But therein lay part of the problem, for those in green were outnumbered by the partisan Poles, who celebrated Slawomir Peszko’s first-half opener by firing scores of fluorescent red flares. Thanks to Long’s late intervention, however, Ireland’s hopes of automatic qualification have not gone up in smoke, for now at least. But scrutiny of O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive tenure will intensify. They trail table toppers Poland by three points with world champions Germany and Scotland two ahead. It is, you feel, now a shoot-out between Ireland and the Scots – who meet here in June – for the third-placed play-off berth. ‘Scotland now is very, very important. I think we will have to beat them. If the second-half showing is anything to go by then I think we’re capable of doing that,’ said O’Neill. ‘This might just prove an important point. We are still in the competition.’ Poland's Tomasz Jodlowiec tackles Republic of Ireland and Stoke City forward Jonathan Walters in the early stages of the contest . Republic of Ireland defender Marc Wilson (left) clashes with Poland's Maciej Rybus . Wes Hoolahan (left) and Poland midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak speak to referee Jonas Eriksson . O’Neill admitted before the game that defeat would have ended their hopes of finishing in the top two places. Long’s last-gasp effort at least spared the manager that trauma, but his celebration of a ‘terrific’ second half which perhaps deserved more was misplaced. ‘We started off tentatively. We were a little bit nervous. We conceded a poor goal and that put us on the back foot,’ he reflected. ‘But our second-half performance was terrific. We deserved at least a draw and we could easily have won it. We bossed it. ‘We got the momentum going and the crowd stayed with us. So overall I’m pleased. ‘Whatever we may lack, courage and spirit are not among them. It’s no fluke we’ve scored late goals in three games.’ Veteran Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane (left) takes on Poland defender Kamil Glik . Poland fans light flares in the stands during their side's clash with the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin . O’Neill had named an attacking line-up – at least in terms of personnel – but a 4-4-1-1 system did little to inspire an early offensive zeal. His decision to play winger Robbie Brady at left back was already looking like an error of judgment before the mistake which led to Poland’s breakthrough on 26 minutes. Surrendering possession on the fringe of his area, Brady could only watch in horror as Maciej Rybus and Peszko combined with the latter smashing beyond Shay Given. O’Neill’s response to an uninspiring half was to switch to 4-4-2 with Jonathan Walters – wasted on the right-hand side of midfield – moved forward to partner captain Robbie Keane.

Republic of Ireland midfielder Glenn Whelan takes a big tumble after he collided with Arkadiusz Milik . They would have been level but for the width of a post when Brady’s deflected centre spiralled above and beyond a panicked Lukasz Fabianski and cracked the woodwork on 52 minutes. But it was the introduction of substitute James McClean which sparked the revival. He burst down the left within moments of his arrival and landed a cross on the head of Keane whose cushioned nod bounced back off the post. McClean was again the provider for Seamus Coleman but the right back lashed woefully wide from 14 yards as the hosts poured forward in search of parity. And they had to wait until the second minute of injury-time for Long to pounce with a close-range poke when the ball dropped at his feet from Brady’s corner. The goal may have stolen a point, but O’Neill and his team still have a point to prove.","Slawomir Peszko fired Poland into the lead in the 26th-minute with a powerful left footed strike .

"Assuming Northern Ireland don’t now stumble on the road to France, they will owe a big debt of thanks to their big No 10 for firing his country to a major championships for the first time in 30 years. Not since the 1986 World Cup have the Northern Irish graced a big stage. Indeed, they have never qualified for the finals of the European Championships. But after Kyle Lafferty scored twice against Finland at Windsor Park to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games, Michael O’Neill’s side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders Romania following their fourth win of the campaign. Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty celebrates after scoring against Group F rivals Finland at Windsor Park .

Star man: Kyle Lafferty . Northern Ireland remain just one point behind Group F leaders Romania . The two countries meet here in June when Northern Ireland will have a great opportunity to go top. Even if it all goes wrong, this result puts them eight points clear of fourth-placed Finland and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place. ‘We’re in a really strong position, there’s no doubt about that,’ said O’Neill. ‘Will 18 points be enough? Possibly. But Belfast in June is as far as we’re looking ahead.’ Finland simply couldn’t handle Lafferty, the 6ft 4in striker on loan to Turkish club Caykur Rizespor from Norwich after a frustrating spell at Carrow Road, who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions. He had already caused central defenders Joona Toivio and Niklas Moisander plenty of problems before putting Northern Ireland in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes. The first goal came from a freekick after Lafferty was fouled by an exasperated Moisander in the 33rd minute. Finland cleared Oliver Norwood’s inswinging free-kick but Niall McGinn nodded the ball back to Lafferty 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky and into the far corner. Ireland looked most dangerous down their right-hand side and when Jamie Ward and Conor McLaughlin combined once again in the 38th minute, Lafferty met Conor McLaughlin’s pin-point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner. Lafferty celebrates with his Northern Ireland team-mates during his side's 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier against Finland . Premier League stars such as Jonny Evans (centre left on back row) and Chris Brunt (centre right on back row) started for Northern Ireland . It was no surprise to see Toivio hooked at half-time in favour of the more muscular Paulus Arajuuri – ‘a tactical substitution,’ was the curt response from Finland boss Mixu Paatelainen afterwards – or Lafferty receive a standing ovation when he was replaced by Josh Magennis 11 minutes from time. He is now second only to David Healy in the list of Ireland’s all-time leading goalscorers. ‘Kyle was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals,’ added O’Neill. ‘He’s going on the pitch believing he’s capable of scoring every time he plays. ‘It’s a little bit like the David Healy situation where things at club level aren’t going as well as he would like. But he’s showing what he’s capable of against top-class European defenders.’ Finland substitute Berat Sadik pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish, but Ireland held on and the celebrations told their own story.

"Two years after his death, a remarkable twist of fate has meant a loving Navy father's message has finally reached his 10-year-old son. Joseph Torrez passed away two years ago, aged 41, after succumbing to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable neurological disorder. The rapidly-progressing terminal illness eats away at the brain - causing dementia, memory loss, anxiety and psychosis - and affects motor skills and physical movements.

Adu appears to be philosophical about the move after quoting former Prime Minister Winston Churchill on his Twitter account, saying: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts!' KuPS finished seventh in the 2014 Veikkausliiga and will be hoping that the American can help them challenge the likes of HJK and SJK in the coming season. The modest club have pulled off  a transfer coup by attracting Adu who will join compatriot Stephen McCarthy in the squad. Once labelled as 'the next Pele' during the early stages of his career, the Ghanian-born forward has played just 59 minutes of competitive football since the end of the 2012 MLS season. Adu made his breakthrough after signing for MLS side DC United as a 14-year-old . Former US star remains the only player to have scored hat-tricks at the U-17 World Championships .

In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008-09 season. The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010. Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later. Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013. He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek. Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which led to a trial with Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar before his move to Serbia. The 25-year-old is now at his 11th club, having played for sides including Monaco and Benfica (above) The US prodigy posted an image of his time with FK Jagodina where he failed to make a single appearance .","Freddy Adu hasn't lived up to expectations since teenage breakthrough .

"A man with taste for the unusual has become the newest internet hit in China due his bizarre outfits. Guo Li, who is believed to be around 50-years-old, regularly roams his hometown in Zhengzhou, central China, wearing a brightly coloured bra over a jumper, a pair of tights and women's ankle boots. In a series of pictures covered by the People's Daily, the man has attracted huge public attention ranging from his bizarre appearance to his story behind him. Unusual: Guo Li fills his bras with two dried steamed buns. He told Chinese media that he used to use apples but people stole his apples all the time . 'Bra Brother' is well-known in Zhengzhou in central China. He often goes to parks or does shopping in his signature outfit . Mr Guo is billed by the Chinese as the 'Bra Brother' and is well-known in Zhengzhou for his bizarre appearance. He told one reporter that he only covers the bra up if it is raining or if it's too cold and he needs to wear a coat. It seems that nobody knows why he dresses up like this exactly, but previous posts suggested that he might have been traumatised by a marriage in his early years. Mr Guo declined to go into details of his back story. But he told the reporter that after he was divorced, he has been detained based on allegations of a girlfriend. He said he is a big fan of ballet and has always liked the idea of tights. After he was released he started wearing women's clothes. Despite being detained several times by the local authorities due to his unusual appearance, Mr Guo said he won't give up his freedom of expression . 'I wear what I like, it's my right!' Mr Guo said. Despite being detained several times by the local authorities for his outfit - and on one occasion being dragged off to a mental institution – Mr Guo said he will never give up his right to freedom of expression. Mr Guo's ensemble often also includes a flower in his hair, and a garishly coloured umbrella usually carried regardless of whether or not it is raining. In his bedroom, Mr Guo keeps many classic Chinese literature, including a Chinese historiography . Mr Guo wears bra every day except when it's too cold and he has to wear a big coat . Perhaps in order to make a good imitation, Mr Guo used to stick apples inside the bra but he said people often stole these apples. That's why he has decided to replace apples with dried steamed buns. 'People laugh at me, and point, but it only makes me even more determined to dress like this. 'I just like to do what makes me happy and dressing like this is my main pleasure.' 'Bra Brother' also bring an umbrella every day to complete his look .","Guo Li roams the city of Zhengzhou wearing a bar over a sweater every day .

"From suggestive remarks to wandering hands, Britain’s offices have long been home to the occasional oversexed boss. These days, however, there is one big difference – the manager ogling junior staff may well be a she. And instead of harassing their female co-workers, men appear more likely than ever to be the ones being fondled or wolf-whistled at. Power: Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette - an issue famously portrayed by Demi Moore in the 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure . Experts say the trend is being fuelled by the growing number of women in positions of power – some of whom feel it is ‘payback time’. The issue was famously portrayed in 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure, in which Demi Moore plays a sex-hungry boss who pursues her male colleague, played by Michael Douglas – then sues him for harassment when he turns her down. Yesterday, communication and body language specialist Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette. She added that the thrill of being in charge affects their behaviour, with some viewing it as revenge for years of sexual inequality in the workplace. Others think nothing of touching a colleague’s bottom, she said, and believe male co-workers should be glad of the attention. Pests: The issue has more recently been shown in the Horrible Bosses films - and is apparently on the increase, according to Miss James, who advised firms on office behaviour . Miss James, who advises firms on office behaviour, added: ‘If I go into a company and someone’s bum’s being mentioned, or pinched, or there’s noises or looks as they walk past, I’d say these days it’s more likely to be a woman boss.’ Horrible Bosses 2 is out on Blu-ray and DVD now.","Judi James claims women bosses  more likely to flout workplace etiquette .

"To most eyes she was just a little girl doing no harm to anyone as she made her way to school with her father. But to the local police, Sophie Lindley was a law-breaking menace... because she was riding her bicycle on the pavement. An officer stopped the four-year-old and threatened to confiscate the purple bike, which is fitted with stabilisers, if she did not get off and walk. Scroll down for video . Left in tears: Sophie Lindley had been cycling with stabilisers on the way to school in Grantham, Lincolnshire . 'Daft': The girl's father Dale Lindley (pictured) had to carry his daughter, who was now in tears, and her bike . Sophie, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, was wearing a helmet and her father Dale was holding a lead attached to the bicycle as she rode to school. They had paused to feed the ducks when the policeman warned her it was against the law to ride on the pavement. Former soldier Mr Lindley, 34, said: ‘At first I thought he was joking but he looked deadly serious. ‘I said, “You must be kidding. What do you want me to do, make her ride on the busy road? It’s rush hour.” ‘He just shrugged and said, “She must get off the bike and walk and I’m going to sit here and make sure you don’t put her back on it. If you do, I’ll confiscate the bike.” I was gobsmacked.’ The officer kept watch as they began the one-mile walk uphill to West Grantham Academy St John’s school. When Sophie arrived at school she was in floods of tears, Mr Lindley said. Traumatic experience: By the time Sophie was in school, 'she was so upset a teacher had to calm her down' ‘The poor thing thought she was going to be put in jail. I’m absolutely outraged that a policeman can act in this way. Surely the police have better things to do than pick on parents taking their kids to school?’ Sophie’s mother Emma Stephenson, 33, said: ‘When Dale came home and told me what had happened I couldn’t believe it. ‘How on earth is my daughter riding her little bike with stabilisers to school a criminal offence? Surely there needs to be some common sense applied. ‘You can’t expect a four-year-old to ride in the road – it’s not exactly safe. ‘I am trying to teach her that they [the police] are friendly. Now that has all gone out the window.’ Lincolnshire Police have now apologised to the family, admitting that common sense should have prevailed, but Sophie’s parents are considering making a formal complaint so no other child is treated in the same way. 'Absolutely outraged': Mr Lindley (left) said his daughter Sophie 'thought she was going to be put in jail' 'Unbelievable': Sophie's mother Emma Stephenson (above) accepted it was illegal to ride on the pavement, but added that it was 'ridiculous to think a four-year-old is not allowed . Cycling groups criticised the officer’s actions. Roger Geffen of CTC, the national cycling charity, said: ‘Everyone lets their children ride on the pavement. It is perfectly normal and not criminal.’ A CTC spokesman said: ‘A four-year-old child should be encouraged to cycle and not be deterred. It is good exercise and gives them a sense of independence. Police officers should use their discretion – this child wasn’t causing any danger or distress.’ Cyclists are told in section 64 of the Highway Code that 'you must not cycle on a pavement' - which is backed up in law by section 72 of the Highway Act 1835. The penalty for cycling on the pavement is a fixed penalty notice of £30 under section 51 and schedule 3 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. However, children under 10 cannot be charged with committing a crime, although they can be given a local child curfew - an overnight ban from being in public without an adult. Last year cycling minister Robert Goodwill told police that cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road. He urged police to remember official guidelines from 1999 which state that fines are not aimed at those using pavements out of ‘fear of traffic’, provided they show consideration for pedestrians.","Sophie Lindley was cycling with stabilisers in Grantham with her father .

"At last, Jimmy Greaves has made it into Tottenham Hotspur’s Hall of Fame. It only took 11 years and 41 others - including Steffen Freund and Paul Allen - to come before the club’s greatest ever goalscorer, with 266 goals in 379 appearances, was rewarded. Depending who you speak to, the long wait is down to Greaves declining the offers, or the club not forthcoming with them. Jimmy Greaves (left) is the highest ever scorer for Tottenham with 266 goals in 379 appearances . Greaves (centre) joined Tottenham in 1961 and won the FA Cup twice and the European Cup Winners Cup . Greaves (second right) holds the European Cup Winners Cup aloft after Tottenham's 1963 triumph . Greaves was signed for Tottenham from AC Milan by Bill Nicholson for £99,999 . The truth lies somewhere in between, with Greaves understood to have turned down informal invitations in the past but accepting, according to sources close to the former striker, their first formal request last week. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how he got there. He is there now; number 42. Despite claims to the contrary, Greaves has been back to White Hart Lane on many occasions since he left the club in 1970. He went back for the funerals of Bill Nicholson and Bobby Smith and launched his autobiography ‘Greavsie’ at a dinner there. He just hasn’t been back for football matches. But he’s only been to one football match - a Chelsea game with his Chelsea-mad grandson - since he quit playing 35 years ago. Wherever he goes, he is constantly asked by Tottenham fans why he is not recognised as one of their greatest by the club. ‘For all the fans who have asked me when I will be in the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame, I am delighted that we now have a date,’ Greaves said upon the announcement on Monday. ‘I am looking forward to returning to White Hart Lane for this very special occasion.’ Greaves, now 75, joined Spurs in 1961, signed by Nicholson for £99,999 from AC Milan to alleviate the burden of being the first £100,000 English player. In the preceding nine years, he would go on to win the FA Cup twice, FA Charity Shield twice, the European Cup Winners Cup and finish runner-up in the old First Division, scoring 220 goals in 321 league matches. He was gutted and angry when he was eventually sold to West Ham, but that’s not why he doesn’t go back to White Hart Lane for matches. Greaves just likes watching games on the telly. In response to accusations that he turned down an invite to the League Cup final when his two former clubs Chelsea and Tottenham met on March 1, he replied: ‘At no point did Spurs invite me to the game. I wouldn't have gone if they did, but I was not invited. ‘I've got a lovely giant screen HD TV, a lovely dog and a warm fire. That's where I watch sport including football and it's very nice. I'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold. I love it on TV.’ Greaves (right) played for Tottenham for nine years and is to be inducted into the Hall of Fame on May 13 . Greaves is also England's fourth-highest scorer, netting 44 goals in 57 games for his country . Now 75, Greaves chooses not to attend football matches, preferring instead to enjoy them at home . Greaves also loved playing, and is still England’s fourth-highest scorer with 44 in 57 appearances, but he has not shunned Spurs matches, or those of any other club, with any malicious intent. ‘I don't go to games, I never ever have,’ he added. ‘When I was young I played all the time. I've never supported one team over another and I don't apologise for that. I enjoy watching at home on TV.’ Regardless of the rows or the disagreements or how he got there, when Greaves is inducted on May 13, he will finally be in Tottenham Hotspur’s Hall of Fame .","Jimmy Greaves joined Tottenham in 1961 and became their greatest scorer .

"Kell Brook reduced the mandatory challenger for his world title from Jo Jo Dan to Yo Yo Dan in four murderous rounds and then threatened to bounce Amir Khan on and off the canvas ‘as soon as he gets in here with me.’ Brook sent Dan crashing to the brink of oblivion four times and after referee Earl Brown administered a mandatory count eight for the last flattening a split second before the bell ended the fourth stanza of pain, everyone had seen enough. The US official and the now desperate Dan’s corner men agreed to call a merciful halt. VIDEOS Scroll down for Kell Brook's reaction post-fight and his thoughts on Amir Kahn . Kell Brook celebrates stunning return to the ring with his partner Lindsey on Saturday night . Brook retained IBF welterweight world title by beating Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield . This was all Brook could have hoped for after having his left thigh slashed to the bone by a machete wielding hooligan barely six months ago. Having feared either dying or being crippled, he came back fitter and stronger, just like the Six Million Dollar Man of old. There was not a trace of anxiety, a flicker of hesitation or an inkling inconvenience as smashed Dan to pieces. Kell Brook returned from an horrific knife attack to win his first IBF welterweight world title defence in style . Kelll Brook floored Romanian challenger Jo Jo Dan four times in four rounds on Saturday night . Brook    Dan . Round 1:     10           9 . Round 2:     10           7 . Round 3:     10           9 . Round 4:     10           7 . TOTAL        40          32 . This was an exceptional performance by Special K and the Motorpoint Arena rose to anoint Brook as Sheffield’s rightful heir to the throne of Prince Naseem Hamed. The faithful joined him in calling out Khan for what Brook envisages as ‘the biggest fight out there for both of us.’ ‘Who do you want to see me beat next,’ he roared. ‘Khan, Khan, Khan’ came the deafening, blood-thirsty response. Six Million Dollars may be an underestimate for what they both could earn now from a stadium fight in late summer. Brook, already the IBF world champion stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division and will go to Las Vegas next month pressing his case for fighting the winner of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. But the Khan fight later this year is a more realistic option. Not that Khan would provide such a willing target as the Canadian-based Romanian who went through a world of pain. Brook was defending his IBF world title belt for the first time since beating Shawn Porter in LA last summer . Brook's range-finding left set up a hurtful right and then Dan was put down by a sharp uppercut . Not only did Brook win every round but he inflicted deadly punishment with a right hand which could not miss. The Motorpoint Arena was packed to the tank-full, waiting to welcome the fighter Sheffield believes can be its successor to Naseem Hamed. That atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the Steel City, Adam Etches, brutally knocked out by his veteran Belarus rival for the IBF international middleweight belt. The deeply experienced 40-year-old Sergei Khomitsky drew Etches into a clever trap midway through the third round, opening him up for the perfect right cross. Canada-based southpaw Dan had entered the ring a heavy underdog with a record of 34-3 with 18 early wins . Etches went down like an axed tree, crashing his head against the canvas as he landed, and there were no protests as referee Howard Foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance. Video-screening of Brook’s triumphs in the ring and his leg-slashed tribulations outside the ropes restored he mood of optimism. Special K came in to a thunder of expectation and to be greeted by famed Ready to Rumble announcer Michael Buffer. Dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan Sheffield crowd. Brook showed maturity to be patient, with 10,000 baying fans on their feet in his home town . Brook was dominant from the first bell and was ahead on the scorecards when the fight was stopped . He started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward, playing into Brook’s preference for counter punching. The home boy’s straight lefts over the Canadian based Romanian’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start. There were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed. This time it was Brook inflicting the pain. One sharp sent Dan reeling. The next, an uppercut, put him down. The third sent him to the canvas again. Only a mix of gallantry and clinching got Dan through more punishment to the bell, which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him. Special K stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division . Brook was looking for the finish but Dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back. The Brook attack was relentless and Dan reeled around the ring like a drunk, yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell. Brook's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger. Dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows. Make that a fourth, Dan falling a split second before the bell. American referee Earl Brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger's corner that enough was enough.","Kell Brook returned from an horrific knife attack last year to win his first IBF welterweight world title defence in style .

"Jimmy Walker will take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Valero Texas Open after carding a three-under-par 69 at TPC San Antonio on Saturday. The 36-year-old San Antonio resident, a one-shot leader at the halfway stage, is nine under ahead of Sunday's final round - four shots clear of fellow American Jordan Spieth. Billy Horschel is third on three under par, a shot clear of a five-strong group including Zach Johnson and Brendan Steele. Jimmy Walker sits on the third tee as he waits to hit a shot during his third round in San Antonio . Walker hits his third shot on the 18th hole as he takes a four-shot lead going into the final day . Kevin Na and Chris Kirk complete an all-American top-10, with Australian Aaron Baddeley the highest placed non-American alongside them on one under par. Walker started on the front nine and wasted little time in building on his lead by birdieing the par-five second. Successive bogeys at the third and fourth hampered Walker's progress somewhat but he made amends by picking up shots at the sixth and eighth holes to reach the turn in 35. A second bogey on the 12th was almost immediately wiped out as Walker birdied the 14th, before finishing strongly with further birdies on the final two holes for a three-under-par score for the day. Spieth carded six birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey to lie second, while Horshel helped himself to third by birdieing the final three holes.

Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson, meanwhile, was even par after a 74 which featured an eagle, a birdie, three bogeys and a double bogey. Walker played the conditions extremely well to extend his lead by three shots ahead of Sunday's deciding round and admitted that he exceeded his own expectations. 'It's a tough golf course,' Walker told the PGA Tour website. 'I thought coming into today that even par or maybe one under would be a good score. 'You definitely want to find a way to extend the lead, but you have to be smart about it.' Jordan Spieth tees off on the 16th hole before finishing the day in second place behind Walker .

"MH370 man: The sister of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah has defended her brother in a statement . The sister of the MH370 pilot has urged everyone to stop blaming her brother for the aircraft’s disappearance ahead of the anniversary of the tragedy this week. Sakinah Shah has released a statement in defence of her brother, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who headed the crew on the missing jet, where she claims there is no proof of 'wrongdoing'. Her statement comes as Malaysia’s Transport Minister has admitted that if the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is not found by May search efforts will go ‘back to the drawing board’. Ms Sakinab's statement on behalf of the family was released through The Star in Malaysia, just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of MH370 on Sunday. ‘As things stand today, with no tangible evidence to show no-one, be you politician, scientist, aviation expert, plane crash investigator, pilot, retired pilot, media or whoever else, none of you have the right to blame Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah for any wrongdoing.’ Ms Sakinab recalled how on March 8 2014 her life and the lives of all the families and friends of passengers an crew of the aircraft changed for ever. She recalled how at the time of the ‘tragic occurrence of MH370’ her brother, a father-of-three, was 53 years old and married to his childhood sweetheart Faizah Khanum. Ms Sakinab described her brother as a 'doting father, generous, kind and cool with a warm sense of humour. He had a passion for life, for family and above all for flying. ‘I wasn't kidding when I said that if he could he would have attached wings to himself. He had as much as a man could possibly want in his life; a professional career, family, friends, health and a more than comfortable life. ‘He was very open-minded, coming from a family with a pretty wide range of nationalities through intermarriages. He got on extremely well with family members. The younger ones simply adored him... their Uncle Ari. ‘He was very savvy at DIY. He could fix anything; garden fixtures, floor tiles, old doors, etc. My home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day; framed pictures, leaking windows now repaired, a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled, a new TV installed... I could go on and on. 'Back to the drawing board': Malaysia’s Transport Minister Seri Liow Tiong Lai has said that the  search area would be extended if the missing MH370 jet is not found by May . Missing: This Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of flight MH370 . Still lost: The Boeing 777-200 Malaysia Airlines plane was carrying 227 passengers and a crew of 12 when it suddenly disappeared off the radar on March 8, 2014 . ‘The rollercoaster ride since March 2014 has never really stopped, except perhaps momentarily. I want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed. ‘His presence during every family function never failed to light up the occasions. He was always sought after by sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews alike… a man of integrity. He was a generous brother and uncle who often came bearing gifts from his overseas trips. 'Ari was a simple village boy of humble beginnings but had high ambitions of becoming a commercial pilot. 'With the current chatter about MH370 involving big name media organisations like National Geographic, I feel compelled to divulge some information about Captain Zaharie's scholastic ‘prowess’ and academic achievements. ‘I am doing this with some regret knowing that he would not be too happy at this disclosure. Throughout his secondary schooling he was by no means a student genius. In fact he was just an average student. Such being the situation, he certainly didn't have the right foundation to be able to figure out a scheme to hijack his own plane and then to disappear into thin air without leaving a trace. ‘Without a doubt he had a strong sense for loyalty towards Malaysia Airlines (MAS). His aviation training in the Philippines was sponsored by MAS. It was there he served as a pilot and later as a training captain. He had an unblemished flying record of eighteen thousand plus hours, I am proud to say. It is sheer dedication to this profession that prompted him to set up his own home flight simulator just to equip himself in order to give a better teaching experience to his students, all at his own expense. ‘As a training captain he often expressed joy and satisfaction with the camaraderie he shared with all his students. Following March 8th 2014, we received feedback from many of these students, both locally and internationally, all in praise of his accommodating ways and generosity at sharing his knowledge. ‘I know for certain Zaharie opted to remain loyal to MAS despite a few challenging offers from other airlines that came his way. It was his love for family that made him want to remain with MAS until his retirement. ‘When the devastating news of MH370 was broadcast, like everybody else, we were also in a state of shock and disbelief. ‘The last time we met with Zaharie was some two weeks prior to March 8th when we were together for dinner. He was no different from his normal, usual self. He was loud, jovial, and full of chuckles with his share of jokes. ‘We continue to pray and hope that this bizarre mystery will unravel soon. We stand firm in the belief that no matter how long the night, dawn will still break.' Ms Sakinab's statement was released as Malaysia’s Transport Minister Seri Liow Tiong Lai suggested that the search area would be extended if MH370 is not found by May. This means that once again, the search will be carried out from the southern Indian Ocean to the Himalayan Mountains, as far west as the Maldives and as far east - and beyond - as the South China Sea. Mr Liow’s admission is unlikely to provide any comfort to the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the Boeing 777 when it vanished on March 8 last year about an hour into a six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Search efforts: Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this week that the search for MH370 off the coast of Australia might have to be scaled back after the year-long-search . He told the New Straits Times that any decision to re-strategise the search - or look again at the methods employed - would only be done if the current scouring of the ocean floor in the southern Indian Ocean did not find the aircraft’s wreckage. ‘It is important to continue the search and hopefully we can complete it by then,’ he said in a reference to May. ‘If the plane is not found we will have to evaluate the figures and rely on the experts to guide us on what to do next. ‘We are confident that the plane is situated in the identified search area in the south Indian Ocean and we are looking forward to finding it,’ said Mr Liow, speaking in Kuala Lumpur. He was responding to a comment by Australia’s Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who said this week that the search and recovery effort might have to be scaled back after the year-long-search. ‘There is no discussion on the issue to stop the search,’ said Mr Liow. ‘This is because as far as we are concerned, it is a tripartite decision (between Australia, Malaysia and China) that has made a commitment to complete the search in the 60,000 square kilometers. Therefore it has to continue.’ Australian search director, Paul Kennedy, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation today that ‘we’re scanning continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 'They’re out there for six weeks at a time. And as we search the ground, we analyse the data and we’re just looking everywhere for the plane. Eventually, we’ll find it.’ Mr Kennedy admitted that the search team had a ‘massive responsibility’ to give closure to the families and everybody else who flies on an aircraft. Theories of where the Malaysia Airlines aircraft ended up have covered numerous seas and countries, the reasons for the plane’s disappearance ranging from the credible to the crazy. Despite the massive search currently taking place in the southern Indian Ocean and requests for coastal villagers to keep their eyes open for debris that might have washed up on beaches, not a single piece of evidence from the aircraft has been found.","Sister of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah release emotional statement .

"Martin Johnson has offered to help NFL teams with their tackling. Rugby has been used by Super Bowl-winning coach Pete Carroll to 'take the head out of the game' and its influence could be further felt. Johnson, the fearsome World Cup-winning captain and former England coach, says former rugby professionals could assist the college game and the NFL. Martin Johnson rampages through the Australian rearguard on that glorious day in November 2003 . 'It depends if it becomes the vogue but I can see a glut of former rugby players offering themselves up as tackling gurus to the NFL and college game. I think in the world we live in now, every team will want to be seen to do the right thing and I think the NFL teams will consider getting rugby guys in,' he told Britviewnfl.com. The NFL faces a class action lawsuit from former players over hiding the effects of concussion. Chris Borland, a highly-rated 49ers linebacker, was so concerned the safety of the game that he announced his retirement aged 24. 'I would always offer my knowledge to NFL teams if they want to talk to me about tackling. I’m not saying I’m any sort of guru but I would be willing to talk to them if any of the NFL teams were interested. It’s very real from now on with that Borland news, if it wasn’t already.' Chris Borland (left) pursues Seattle's Doug Baldwin. The 24-year-old retired this week due to health concerns . Johnson also spoke of Seattle Seahawks' adoption of rugby techniques to make his team tackle better - and safer. 'I think it is very rare for American sport to look outside of American sport so for them to look at another sport and for Pete Carroll to show videos of rugby, that makes you say, ‘Oh, OK, that’s interesting.’ I’ve seen the Seattle guys training without helmets at times and that’s great because then you really do have to think about your head and your technique, because you have to get that technique right.'","Johnson says ex-rugby players could advise NFL teams on art of tackling .

"Scotland's Richie Ramsay recovered from seeing a three-shot lead disappear in the space of two holes to win the Hassan Trophy after a rollercoaster final round on Sunday. Ramsay made a blistering start at Golf du Palais Royal, carding four birdies in a row from the third to move into pole position in pursuit of his third European Tour title. The 31-year-old from Aberdeen then three-putted the seventh and ran up a triple-bogey six on the eighth, where he came up short of the green off the tee and saw his first two chips fail to negotiate a steep slope and roll back to his feet. Richie Ramsey poses with the Hassan Trophy after winning the event at Golf du Palais Royal in Morocco . Ramsay reacts after his second shot on the tenth hole during the final round of the Hassan Trophy . That left Ramsay two shots off the lead but he battled back superbly with a hat-trick of birdies from the 12th to reclaim the lead on his way to a closing 69 to finish 10 under par, one ahead of France's Romain Wattel. Wattel chipped in for par on the 15th after duffing his fourth shot just a few feet and birdied the 17th to get within one of Ramsay, but was unable to chip in for another birdie on the 18th to force a play-off. Six players shared third place on eight under, including South African George Coetzee, who had needed to win to move into the world's top 50 and qualify for the Masters. England's Tommy Fleetwood could also have secured a trip to Augusta with victory, but finished joint 17th after a closing 69. An emotional Ramsay, who had missed the cut in four of his five events this season and withdrew from the other after three rounds due to illness, dedicated the win to his wife Angela and brother Robin.

'I've gone through some tough times with injury but kept believing and they were at my back and said just go out there and play golf and that's what I did today. It was so much fun out there.' Asked about his triple bogey on the eighth, the former US amateur champion added: 'I just didn't execute the shot exactly as I wanted to. Hit a poor chip, rolled back into a divot, didn't come out, hit it back on, two putts, easy six. It's one of those courses that has so many holes like that. 'I knew I was still in the mix and walking down nine I was still level par for my round and I knew the back nine was very scoreable. I made great putts on nine and 10 just to keep the momentum going and then I stood over a putt on the 12th and felt my putter feels absolutely great.

"Bill Cosby has released his first video message since nearly three dozen women accused him of sexual assault and has insisted: 'I'm far from finished.' In the 10-second video, which ABC News showed on Monday morning, the embattled comedian can be seen speaking on the phone as he encourages someone to come to one of his shows. 'You know I'll be hilarious,' he says in the clip, in which he wears his pajamas. 'Can't wait.' He also released a short message accompanying the video. 'Dear Fans, I hope you enjoy my wonderful video message that's filled with LAUGHTER,' he said in the statement, shared by ABC News. 'Hey hey hey, I'm Far From Finished.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bill Cosby has released a 10-second clip showing him speaking on the phone and encouraging someone to come to his show, saying: 'You'll know I'll be hilarious' The statement echoes earlier messages that he has released to the public. He made no direct reference to the accusations or the scores of women making them, but the 77-year-old comedian has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. It comes as Cosby continues to tour the U.S. with his stand-up comedy show. His next appearances are in Wheeling, West Virginia and Lexington, Kentucky this weekend. Although the shows have continued to attract fans, they have also garnered protesters. Among the demonstrations, 100 people stood outside a Denver theater in January shouting: 'Rape is no joke!' Cosby has also canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances amid the allegations, many of which exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. Just last week, Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson joined the 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the The Cosby Show star to say she had also been assaulted by him. She says the beloved actor pressured her into performing a sexual act on him when she was a 17-year-old aspiring model in 1988. She had met him through her New York modeling agency. When Ms Thompson's story was originally revealed in November 2014, Cosby's lawyer Marty Singer called it 'absurd' to publish an 'unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person'. Promotion: Cosby, pictured on stage in Florida last November, promoted his live shows in the video . Speaking out: Last week, Jewell Allison, pictured left with Cosby and right today, wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post how she felt pressure as an African-American not to tell anyone about the abuse . And in an op-ed published on Friday, former model Jewel Allison detailed how Cosby invited her to dinner and slipped something into her wine, before grabbing her hand and putting it on his genitals. As an African-American woman she said she felt pressure not to speak out, she said. 'Telling my story wouldn't only help bring down Cosby; I feared it would undermine the entire African American community,' she wrote. Last month, Cosby's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz - accusing him of sexual offenses. Tamara Green, a 56-year-old California lawyer, says Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s. Therese Serignese says Cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in Las Vegas around 1976, while Linda Traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a Southern California beach in about 1970. The former star of The Cosby Show hasn't been charged with any crime. In their defamation lawsuit, the accusers, all of whom have stepped forward in recent years to detail the alleged abuse, said Cosby's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence. Support: Cosby's wife Camille, pictured in November, is standing by her man amid the multiple accusations . But Cosby's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self-defense as his character was under attack. 'The law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked,' the lawyers argued in their 38-page filing. 'Instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims.' Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the three accusers, said his clients disagree with that position. 'We believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual, it must be truthful,' he said. 'We look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful.' Lawyers for the three accusers have until March 20 to file a reply to Cosby's motion to dismiss the suit.","In the short clip, the beleaguered comedian speaks on the phone to someone about his stand-up show, saying: 'You know I'll be hilarious'

"As speculation mounts over whether Tiger Woods will compete at the Masters next month, the former world No 1 has spurned the chance to play in the Houston Open, the final PGA Tour event before the year's first major. Woods' name was conspicuously absent when the list of players for the  Houston event next week was posted on Friday. Should Woods decide to tee it up at the Masters, which starts on April 9, he would do so after not competing for 63 days. Woods, the 14-time major winner, has struggled to find any form this year . A four-time Masters champion whose ranking has plummeted to 96th, Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour and said he would not return until his game was 'tournament-ready'. He missed the Masters last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation next month is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness. Woods posted the highest score of his professional career, a mind-boggling 11-over-par 82, to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open in January, and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping 'yips'. He withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back, and he is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career. Woods is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 Ryder Cup . Earlier this week, Woods' good friend Notah Begay III rated the former world number one's chances of taking part in the Masters as '50-50'. 'It's literally a 50-50 chance right now from what I can tell,' said Begay, a television analyst with Golf Channel who played with Woods on the Stanford University golf team. 'That's far better odds than what it was, say, three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I would have said there was maybe a 1-in-10 chance of him playing at Augusta.' One thing in Woods' favour is his huge comfort factor at Augusta National where in 2010 he tied for fourth at the Masters after not playing competitive golf for five months. He took an indefinite break from the game in late 2009, as his private life spectacularly unravelled, to try to repair his marriage amid revelations about his extra-marital affairs. 'He knows his way around the Augusta,' Northern Irish world number Rory McIlroy said earlier this month. 'If he feels ready to play and he does play then he knows what to do when there.'

He has his first ride over hurdles on Egyptian Warrior at Limerick on Sunday after which he will travel to the Curragh to ride work after racing.’ Joseph, winner of two of the last three Derbies on Australia and Camelot, has a string of big race mounts potentially lined up for him with Gleneagles favourite for the 2,000 Guineas and JF Kennedy currently front runner of clutch of Derby possibles. Should Joseph have to turn his back permanently on the Flat, Moore, the three-time British champion, would be favourite to take more rides for his father’s stable. Teaforthree, the Rebecca Curtis-trained Grand National third in 2013 who got as far as The Chair last year when joint favourite last year, is out of next month’ s race. Teaforthree clears the last fence on the way to victory at Bangor-on-Dee racecourse last month .","Joseph O'Brien insists he will ride on the Flat this season .

"George Coetzee staged a superb fightback to keep his hopes of qualifying for the Masters alive in the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal. Coetzee needs to win in Agadir to book a trip to Augusta National for the year's first major championship in a fortnight's time, but found himself six shots off the lead after a front nine of 39 on Saturday. However, the South African carded five birdies and one bogey on the back nine to card a 71 and finish six under par, which proved enough to lie just one shot off the lead as the leaders stumbled on the closing stretch. George Coetzee staged a superb fightback to keep his hopes of qualifying for the Masters alive . South African carded five birdies and one bogey on the back nine to card a 71 and finish six under par . Scottish pair Richie Ramsay and Andrew McArthur share the lead with France's Romain Wattel on seven under, with Coetzee part of a seven-strong group which includes former champion David Horsey, Ireland's Kevin Phelan and Argentina's Emiliano Grillo. Coetzee, who won the Tshwane Open on his home course in Pretoria a fortnight ago, told European Tour radio: 'I am quite happy. I'm quite surprised the guys haven't gone lower. 'I've been battling away the last couple of days but happy to be in the mix. I made some silly errors, mental errors, but I feel like I am still in a good space so (I'm) happy with the comeback today and hopefully (it) puts me in good stead for tomorrow. Coetzee of South Africa in action during the third round of the Trophee Hassan II Golf at Golf du Palais Royal . 'I've got a bit of mental game plan going at the moment and when you make mistakes you focus on doing the mental stuff correct and it kind of takes care of itself. 'The big change came yesterday on the fifth. I hit it left and was going to hack it when my caddie said there's three par fives on the back nine, let's take our punishment, take a drop and work from there. That kept reminding me about the back nine so it always keeps you in a good frame of mind.' England's Tommy Fleetwood also needs to win on Sunday to qualify for the Masters, but is five shots off the lead after struggling to a 73 which included a triple-bogey eight on the fifth. Just four shots separates the top 29 players and Coetzee added: 'There are so many guys in the mix you can't say that you can control it. You just have to go out and play well.' McArthur and Wattel both carded rounds of 67 to move through the field on Saturday, with Ramsay starting the day in a share of the lead but having to settle for a 71 containing five birdies and four bogeys, the last of which on the 18th cost him the outright lead. Romain Wattel waves to the crowd on the 18th hole as his caddie Darren Reynolds looks on . 'It felt pretty good, it just sort of crept up on me,' said McArthur, who is making just his third European Tour start of the season. 'I am delighted. 'I have accepted I am not striking it as I want to but I have found something to get it in play and try and get it pin high, hole a few putts and you never know. 'I played well in Joburg (finishing joint 18th), moved myself up a lot on the last day. I putted well so hopefully that continues on Sunday.'","George Coetzee staged a superb fightback to keep Masters dreams alive .

"Wasps will consider an appeal against the three-week ban handed to Nathan Hughes after their star No 8 was found guilty of recklessly kneeing George North and told he can’t play against Toulon. Hughes was shown a red card in Friday night’s Aviva Premiership clash with Northampton for an incident which saw North suffer his third confirmed concussion in less than four months, leading to calls for him not to play again this season. An RFU disciplinary panel upheld the red card shown to Hughes by referee Craig Maxwell-Keys and banned him until April 28, meaning he will miss Sunday’s European Champions Cup quarter final clash with the two-time champions. Nathan Hughes has been banned for three weeks and will miss Wasps' game against Toulon . George North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens after scoring a try . Sir James Dingemans, chair of a three-man panel with Aidan O’Brien and Martyn Wood, said: ‘This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found. However, there was recklessness meaning that, notwithstanding the harm, it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record.' Speaking before the hearing Wasps director of rugby Dai Young made it clear he did not believe his star forward should be punished further and indicated he would appeal any ban. ‘I don’t think it was a red card,’ said Young. ‘The sending off certainly penalised us enough on the night. If there is a ban we can appeal it. If there’s a ban we’ll have to sit down and decide what to do with Nathan because he needs to be part of the process.’ It is understood any appeal would be heard before Sunday’s clash, meaning Hughes could yet feature. The incident left North concussed in the act of scoring his second try of the match and has led to calls for the Wales and Northampton winger to be rested for the rest of the season over fears for his long-term welfare. North was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with Hughes during Saints' win over  Wasps . North was unable to continue and has been advised not to play again until the World Cup in September . Hughes was understood to be distraught after the game and sought North out to apologise. ‘I know Nathan,’ said Wasps club captain James Haskell. ‘I don’t think he meant to do it. I think anyone knows he didn’t mean to do it. I don’t think it should have been a red card at all. I think he tried to slow down, he catches George but it is a contact sport. ‘That is what happens. I think they have changed the wording now to say something about being reckless but rugby is reckless. The whole game is reckless. If you are worried about that, I don’t really know what we should be doing. ‘Maybe we should all just wear foam suits and just play touch.’ Young said after the game that he believed the repeated replays on the big screen at Franklin’s Gardens, allied to a partisan home ground, had pressurised the match officials into sending Hughes off. Haskell also has recent experience of the impact of replays following the second-half yellow card he was shown for a trip in England’s Six Nations clash with France by referee Nigel Owens after he viewed footage on the big screen. ‘I don’t think it helps with the crowd getting on top of referees,’ he said. ‘With Nigel Owens, we (England) had set for a scrum. It was a yellow card, there is no arguing that, but the fact they replayed it seven times and the same with Nathan, replaying it, I don’t think it helps. If you slow anything down it will look worse than it is. ‘I just think that those TMOs are there, they have all the angles to see it. It is down to their job, I don’t know why you have to share. Replays are good but any contentious stuff, why would you let emotion (come into it) because we are all fallible. The fact I made a mistake shows I am fallible. Nathan tried his best to slow down and caught the guy.’","Wasps will consider an appeal against the three-week ban handed to Nathan Hughes .

"A college basketball star who was found dead in her dorm room in January died from a blood cell disorder, not from choking on gum in her sleep, as police first believed. The Washington County coroner announced Shanice Clark's cause of death on Monday, nearly two months after the 21-year-old was found inside her room at California University of Pennsylvania. She was found unresponsive at 3.03am on January 18. She was rushed to Monongahela Valley Hospital but she could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 4.10am. California borough police said that a preliminary report from medical personnel indicated the death appeared to be accidental and there were suggestions she had choked on gum. Tragedy: Shanice Clark, 21, was found unresponsive in her dorm room at California University of Pennsylvania, where she played basketball, in January. She passed away from a blood cell disorder . But Coroner Tim Warco blamed it on sickle cell trait, a blood cell disorder that often does not have any symptoms but can lead to sudden death in extremely rare cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. University officials said they were 'deeply saddened' by the death of the 6-foot senior forward, who had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season. Athletic director Karen Hjerpe called Clark 'a bright student and talented player' and said 'her smile and personality will be missed'. Clark, a communications major, had hoped to become a broadcaster and chose the school because of its good facilities after transferring from Santa Fe College in Florida. But friend Cleveland Clunis told the Toronto Star that she would often joke that she had gone to the university for a different reason. Talented: The 6-foot senior forward, from Canada, had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season . Loss: Clark, who was from Toronto, was a communications major at the California University of Pennsylvania, pictured, and had dreamed of becoming a broadcaster, devastated friends and family said . 'For Shanice, it was, ""There's a good hairstylist"",' said Clunis, the founder of a non-profit basketball program she had attended. 'When she shares that with you, you can't help but laugh.' He said that this sense of humor had made her popular among students and staff. 'She could start a conversation with you from morning and still have you laughing and interested till sundown,' he said. Geraldine M. Jones, interim university president, said in a statement after her death: 'Our thoughts today are with the family of Shanice Clark, a senior from Ontario, Canada, who passed away early this morning. 'On behalf of California University of Pennsylvania, I extend my deepest sympathy to all of Shanice's family and friends. She will be missed by her teammates and coaches, her classmates, and by the entire campus community.' Clark left behind her mother, Kashaeka Fearon, and a younger sister. Sickle cell trait means someone is carrying a gene for a serious condition called sickle cell disease, which can cause red blood cells to change their shapes, potentially causing pain and infections. If someone has sickle cell trait, it does not mean they have sickle cell disease. Instead, they are a carrier of the trait and can pass it on to their children. If they were to have children with someone else carrying the trait, that child has a 25 per cent chance of being born with sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell trait have red blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs and returns carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs) but they have enough normal hemoglobin for red cells to successfully carry oxygen around the body. While it is extremely rare for sickle cell trait to cause any complications, there can be problems in conditions of severe physical stress, including low oxygen conditions, severe dehydration, severe physical exercise or very high altitude. In these situations, cells can change their shapes, causing pain and further complications. Sickle cell trait, which is more commonly found in African-Americans than other races, is diagnosed with a simple blood test. Couples planning to have children may want to find out if they have the trait to see if their kids might inherit sickle cell disease.","Shanice Clark, from Toronto, was found unresponsive in her room at the California University of Pennsylvania in the early hours of January 18 .

"Paul Lambert has only 'good things' to say about Aston Villa, the club he left last month after a disappointing run of games. The 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of the Premier League club in June 2012 but following a poor run of results, which left Villa in the bottom three, the club parted company with the Scot and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor. He told BBC's Football Focus: 'I don't have any bad things about Aston Villa. It's a brilliant football club as everybody knows. Paul Lambert says he only has 'good things' to say about Aston Villa despite his sacking in Feburary . Lambert believes Villa are in a healthier position than when he arrived, particularly in terms of their finances . 'I came in at really, probably a tough time and obviously when the financial reports came out, their losses are way down now so from that point of view the club is in probably a lot healthier position than when I went there. 'It's a great club with great people at it, and great people left behind. 'There's things when you look back and think ""maybe I should have done that better or different"" but I've got nothing but good things (to say) about the club.' Since leaving Villa, Lambert has spent time in Germany with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund working towards his UEFA Pro Licence. Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.' Lambert said he had no desire to follow Real Sociedad head coach David Moyes in managing abroad . Lambert praised the work of Klopp and said that working with his Borussia Dortmund side was eye-opening . Sitting and talking with Guardiola was said to be a great experience for the former Aston Villa manager . Lambert praised the work Jurgen Klopp has done at the German club and admitted working and talking with the Dortmund coach and Bayern's Pep Guardiola was eye-opening. He added: '(Guardiola) and Jurgen Klopp are probably the best I've seen working. Just the way they can get the best out of people. 'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'

"Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner is due in England before the end of the week as he presses ahead with plans to sell the club.

And Sportsmail understands Lerner is expected to fly into Birmingham over the coming days for further discussions regarding a sale. Randy Lerner, pictured in 2011, is speaking to a consortium over a proposed £150million sale of Aston Villa . Talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and Lerner’s decision to fly into England is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal. The consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover, though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league Villa are playing in next season. Christian Benteke is pictured scoring for Aston Villa in their 4-0 thumping of Sunderland last month . Lerner wants to receive his full £150m asking price . Lerner’s expected arrival in the Midlands comes after it emerged Lerner’s Midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover. The farmhouse, located in Bodymoor Heath, is understood to be worth in the region of £3m. Lerner has been keen to sell Villa for some time, a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch. The sacking of Paul Lambert and subsequent arrival of Tim Sherwood has helped stimulate the club, as has their pending FA Cup semi-final. But Villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987. Lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full £150m asking price.

"Hull have been fined £30,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players against Leicester on March 14. City initially denied the charge but were on Friday found guilty of 'failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion'. The incident was brought about by the reaction of a number of Hull players after Alex Bruce was booked by referee Jon Moss following a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. Hull City were charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion . Alex Bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee Jon Ross for a  challenge on Riyad Mahrez . The findings are something of an embarrassment for Hull, whose manager Steve Bruce criticised the Leicester players for their conduct during the nervy 0-0 draw. He was unimpressed by what he perceived to be attempts to persuade Moss to penalise his son. 'I saw everyone surround Alex (asking) for a red card for his challenge,' he said in the post-match press conference. 'The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whingeing and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that's not right.' Hull City manager Steve Bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of Leicester's players . Hull were handed six bookings in the match, two of which led to Tom Huddlestone's sending-off. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson tersely described Bruce's version as 'not a fair assessment' and the FA's independent regulatory commission were in agreement, attributing blame to the Hull contingent. Their statement read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Hull City have been fined £30,000 after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven.
