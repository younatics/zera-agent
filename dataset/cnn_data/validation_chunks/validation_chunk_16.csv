"The Premier League has never been richer, with the most recent combined annual income for the current 20 clubs soaring past £3billion for the first time. But a review of the books by the Mail on Sunday also shows club debts standing at more than £2.5 billion. Much of that poses no imminent danger to the clubs encumbered with it. Chelsea’s parent company owes Roman Abramovich £958million, for example, and he is showing no sign of demanding it back any time soon. Manchester United have debts of £342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago by the Glazers but can service it comfortably, while Arsenal have ‘good debt’ of £241m, borrowed to fund their stadium. Taking their cash pile into consideration they had only £33m of net debt at the end of the last financial year. Roman Abramovich is owed an astonishing £958million by Chelsea's parent company . West Bromwich Albion, on the other hand, are nearly debt-free after being sensibly run over a long period . But a group of clubs including Aston Villa, Hull, Leicester, Newcastle, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham have each racked up debt of around £100m, much of which is owed to their owners. And in an era when the Premier League has never had so much cash it is bewildering so many clubs remain financially unstable and potentially in peril should they get relegated. The ‘boom-and-bust culture’ of unsustainable spending in an attempt to buy success underpins the phenomenon, according to the chief executive of one of the clubs most sensibly run over a long period, West Bromwich Albion. ‘The easiest thing to do when you reach the Premier League is over-reach,’ says Albion’s Mark Jenkins, whose club have just posted their latest set of profitable accounts and are close to being debt-free. Manchester United have debts of £342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago . West Brom played Harry Redknapp's Portsmouth in the 2008 FA Cup - a team guilty of 'boom and bust' ‘Everyone puts you under enormous pressure to just chuck endless money at it,’ he adds. ‘You’ve got to be strong enough to withstand that pressure and the flak that comes with it if you don’t have the spending level. ‘You can get sucked into a boom-and-bust culture. That’s drained the pockets of many a star-struck or misguided owner.’ Examples of clubs that aimed for the stars but have ended up in administration or other self-inflicted fiscal turmoil are numerous. Leeds, QPR, Birmingham and Coventry spring readily to mind. But it is another example, Portsmouth, that most irks West Brom, who lost to a ‘financially doped’ Pompey in the 2008 FA Cup semi-finals. Portsmouth went on to win the trophy before a spectacular meltdown caused by the unsustainable spending undertaken to assemble and pay Harry Redknapp’s squad at that time. Portsmouth were flying high and eventually won the FA Cup, but are now mid-table in the fourth division . West Brom say they are still frustrated at losing to a team Portsmouth 'basically couldn't afford' ‘It still pinches us at West Brom that we lost our last FA Cup semi-final to a team the opposition basically couldn’t afford,’ said Jenkins. ‘Our fans went home miserable that night. Theirs were jubilant. I suspect they would want to swap places now though.’ Pompey are now mid-table in the fourth tier. West Brom are looking increasingly likely to be safe in the top flight for a fifth year running. Some of their fans may feel they should be taking more risks with bigger-name players but Jenkins insists stability is key. ‘We have shown — along with one or two other clubs — that it is possible to compete in the PL by building, building, building — sensibly, year on year,’ he says. ‘You’re adding to the squad, the club’s infrastructure, sticking to your business plan, trying to get right as many decisions as you can while knowing that some things will go wrong because that is the nature of football. ‘The key thing is if and when that happens you are not so over-stretched that it becomes a catastrophe.’","CLICK HERE to find out about your club's financial health .

"Hull have announced their intention to appeal against an Football Association charge of failing to control their players during the goalless draw at Leicester on March 14. The charge arises from a 68th minute incident in which Tigers players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss after Alex Bruce was booked for his challenge on Leicester's Riyad Mahrez. The club's announcement comes as no surprise in the wake of strong comments made by boss Steve Bruce about the incident on Friday. Hull City have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion . Bruce declared his club would 'vigorously defend' the charge, adding: 'The frustration was that he (Mahrez) was blatantly trying to get somebody sent off. 'We surrounded the referee because it was a perfectly fair challenge'. The appeal will be heard by an independent regulatory commission.

"Colin Graves says he wants to 'jazz up' Test matches by reducing them to four days . Colin Graves has risked offending cricket’s purists, saying he wants to ‘jazz up’ Test matches by reducing them to four days from the traditional five. Graves, who takes over as ECB chairman from Giles Clarke on May 15, believes Test cricket faces an identity crisis. And, while he was expressing his personal views only, it seems probable they will get an airing when he meets his international counterparts in the ICC boardroom. ‘You can’t continue to leave Test cricket as it is,’ Graves told the lords.org website. ‘If you look at it worldwide, Test cricket is shrinking in the number of people who are watching it on TV and in the grounds. ‘Somehow, somewhere, there is a way to improve Test cricket. It’s the bastion, but we’ve got to modernise it. We’ve got to jazz it up. ‘I think we should look at four-day Test cricket and play 105 overs a day starting at half past ten in the morning, with the ground drainage you’ve got now, and finish when you finish, as all the grounds now have lights. ‘Every Test match would start on a Thursday, so you have two days for corporates, and two days for families. From a cost point of view you’d save that fifth day, which would save a hell of a lot of money from the ground’s point of view and the broadcasters. ‘In reality, there’s not many people who turn up and watch it on the fifth day.’ Graves’ formula would trim a total of only 30 overs off a Test: the current format is five days of 90 overs each). But it leaves little wriggle room in case of bad weather – a perennial problem during the British summer. And, while he has a point about poor fifth-day attendances, his plan would risk sacrificing some of the thrilling finishes Test matches have witnessed over the past few years. Only last season the games against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and Headingley both came down to the final over. Stuart Broad celebrates taking the wicket of Dimuth Karunaratne during day five of last season's Test match . An attempt to squeeze in an extra 15 overs a day would not be without its drawbacks either: Test teams habitually struggle to bowl the current minimum of 90 without making use of the extra half-hour allotted to them. Cricket would also lose one of its enduring charms: the deteriorating fifth-day pitch, even if these are less common than they used to be. And that’s all before the broadcasters have their say. At least Graves’s thought process suggests the kind of open-mindedness too often lacking among cricket’s administrators. Too many have harrumphed ineffectually over the future of the Test game in those parts of the world that favour the shorter formats – only then to announce the formation of yet another domestic Twenty20 tournament. A few weeks ago, Graves insisted Kevin Pietersen, who recently joined Surrey, must be playing county cricket to stand any chance of appearing for England . Whether or not his comments amount to anything other than a personal opinion, they confirm the view that Graves will be very much his own man once he replaces Clarke, who will assume the new role of ECB president. That much was evident a few weeks ago when Graves appeared to offer a route back into the England team for Kevin Pietersen, saying he needed to be playing county cricket to stand any chance. Graves has been perplexed by the spin placed on those comments, insisting England’s stance on the Pietersen issue has not changed. But, with six weeks still to go until he assumes office, Graves is already carving out a reputation as a man who means business.","Colin Graves takes over as ECB chairman from Giles Clarke on May 15 .

"Jon Walters is the kind of footballer who holds up an imaginary substitutes’ board when a referee goes down injured, who picks up a matchday programme hurled in his direction and has a flick through. During Stoke’s victory at Aston Villa last month, his reaction to referee Roger East’s attack of cramp was more comic than concerned. It was similar when an irate Newcastle fan chucked the makeshift missile as celebrations followed Peter Crouch’s equaliser. ‘A referee with cramp! Can you believe it?’ chuckles Walters. ‘He needed to come off, didn’t he? The programme was a good read. 10 out of 10. You’ve got to enjoy yourself. When need be, I’ll get stuck in but I play with a smile. Jon Walters spoke about many subjects, including his desire to play in Euro 2016, in a revealing interview . The Stoke City star takes his football seriously but also has a a fun side as his on-field antics show . The 31-year-old striker/winger claims he has mellowed since being involved in a ruck with Roy Keane . ‘It’s the best job in the world, if you don’t enjoy it there’s something wrong.’ That encapsulates Walters, one of the Premier League’s unlikely lads; tough yet funny, revelling in his fifth year as a Premier League player. He is delivering one-liners on the radio that amuse and slightly frighten, suggesting in the wake of the Jonny Evans-Papisse Cisse flare-up that any player who spat in his face will be ‘eating his supper through a straw’. He is laughing about his appearance in Roy Keane’s book during their final fraught days together at Ipswich — ‘a bust-up… effing and blinding’ — having buried the hatchet at Republic of Ireland camps. ‘I knew what was going to be written… it could have been worse,' he says. And he is pleased by having had such a good season after an inauspicious start. Walters became the first Stoke player to score a Premier League hat-trick with his right-foot, left-foot, header combination against Queens Park Rangers in January and was shortlisted for Ireland’s player of the year award. All this after losing his place at Stoke side last summer. His appearance in Ireland’s dramatic 1-1 draw in Germany in October meant he had completed more minutes for country than club: 180 to 139. ‘We were losing games and I wasn’t getting on, that made me worry more than anything,’ admits Walters, 31. ‘I was going away with Ireland asking a few of the lads how many games they’d played. The Championship lads were saying, “15, 20...”. I’d played two. Jesus! ‘Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane showed a lot of faith to play me. Then I came on (for Stoke) against Swansea when we were chasing the game and I scored. Since then I’ve stayed in the team.’ Walters flicks through a matchday programme thrown at him after Peter Crouch scored against Newcastle . The Potters joker found the funny side when referee Roger East was forced to withdraw with cramp . Walters carries the match ball after becoming the first Stoke player to score a Premier League hat-trick . Listening to soothing sounds has helped. ‘Before kick-off, I’ll have my earphones on and be tuning into some classical music,’ Walters says. He lists Pachelbel’s Canon in D Major and material by pianist Ludovico Einaudi as favourites. He should be listening to some strings before playing against Poland in a game Ireland need to win to further their Euro 2016 ambitions. His participation was in doubt after he suffered a fractured cheekbone a fortnight ago but surgery and a protective mask make him available. ‘It’s a massive game,’ he says. ‘It’s a difficult group but it’s in our hands. There will be ups and downs. Germany was a high, scoring in the last minute. The Scotland defeat was a low. Qualifying is the main thing, it doesn’t matter how.’ Walters’s career has been in the ascendancy since he left then League Two side Chester in 2007. He is Stoke’s top scorer in a season that could still lead to a record-breaking points total and Premier League finish. Impressive when you consider the reshaping done by manager Mark Hughes since succeeding Tony Pulis when Walters’s profile seemed not to quite fit. Whether operating up front or, more frequently, on the wing Walters has crafted his game to suit the passing style now employed under Hughes. ‘In terms of evolving I’ve done that my whole career, from youth at Blackburn, then Bolton, going down the leagues and coming back up,’ says Walters. ‘You have to change your game constantly. ‘There are going to be technically better players. You see some very gifted players down the leagues who just haven’t had the luck. ‘I’ll always work hard but I’m not just here on hard work. You have to have a certain amount of ability. I was taught as a striker, all my runs, my movement, getting in the box. I’ve only really taught myself to play as a winger.’ Walters has forced his way back into Martin O'Neill's thinking for the Republic of Ireland . The striker celebrates with John O'Shea after the captain scored a dramatic late equaliser against Germany . Walters gestures to former Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski (right) as he appeals for a penalty . Walters is listed as a midfielder in the Premier League’s fantasy football game. ‘You get the clean sheet bonus, don’t you?’ he quips. That flexibility has certainly aided Walters, who was bought by Pulis for £2.75million in 2010. He believes Stoke are like that, too, able to alter their game to suit situations in a way that Everton, his boyhood team, find tricky. ‘Mark Hughes came in with different ideas and from day one everyone bought into it,’ he says. ‘We play a slightly different way but still retaining that steely grit. ‘Certain teams we play against, sometimes we have to go a bit more direct. We can dig in. Having all those strings to your bow is massive in this league, teams can figure you out. We can change during a game, me included.’ Walters’s view on the game has been coloured by the health issues suffered by his eldest daughter Scarlett, who was born with gastroschisis, a condition in which the intestines protrude outside the abdomen. In 2005 he switched from Championship side Hull to League Two Wrexham so as to be closer to his family on the Wirral when Scarlett needed surgery. ‘I asked to leave to go back home with her as she was so ill,’ he said. ‘I was living in a hospital for three months. It was tough.’ Scarlett, 10, is better now, with a sister and brother aged six and four. Walters has picked himself up too, joining Ipswich in 2007 before Stoke came calling. That move was the reason for his fallout with Keane, who details in his autobiography how Walters did not believe him that no enquiry had been made. ‘There was a bit of shoving,’ writes Keane. ‘I got carried away and Jon got carried away.’ Walters' goal against Swansea City in October saw him cement a regular starting place in Mark Hughes' team . Walters has adjusted his game to make an impression both domestically and internationally this season . Walters had felt compelled to send in a photograph of his vomit to prove he was sick enough to miss an earlier League Cup game. Here, sitting in an armchair at Stoke’s training ground, he smiles knowingly. The pair shook hands after Keane became O’Neill’s assistant. ‘When he first came to Ireland we spoke about it and had a laugh. I get on really well with Roy. I know he can be hard but he’s pretty spot on in what he says.’ Walters tends not to mince words either, choosing that rather graphic turn of phrase to air his views on spitting. He knows though, with team-mate Stephen Ireland’s horrific leg wound in mind, more serious things happen on a pitch. ‘It’s an insult to spit,’ he says. ‘Anything that threatens a career, breaks bones, or seriously injures someone has to be worse.’ Feigning injury does infuriate him. ‘To see people rolling round when they get touched is poor. What annoys me is to think about if two people are going head to head in the street, would one fall over like they’ve been shot?’ Walters has made up with former Ipswich manager Roy Keane after the pair's infamous bust up . The Potters forward nets against Tottenham in November, he has 10 Premier League goals this term . Walters is made from stern stuff and hates it when players feign injury on the football pitch . One creeping concern is his contract, which expires in the summer of 2016. ‘It’s always at the back of your mind. We haven’t had any talks yet. I’m a realist. They’re always looking for someone to replace you. It’s been no different since I’ve been here. ‘The strikers we’ve had in: Eidur Gudjohnsen, Michael Owen, John Carew, Kenwyne Jones, Cameron Jerome, Crouchy is here, Mame Biram Diouf. If the club want to keep me, they will come to me.’ Walters is recently over a mystery knee injury that had troubled him for more than a year and believes he can play until he’s 38. ‘Fitness-wise I tend to do more running, more high-intensity sprints, more recoveries than anyone. We have heart-rate monitors every day. You have to look after yourself off the pitch through diet. I feel great. I have six, seven years, without a shadow of a doubt.’","Jon Walters is Stoke's leading scorer in the Premier League this season .

The couple are reportedly interested in a 9,000 sq ft apartment in the Big Apple, which would cost them an incredible £64,000 ($95,000) per month.

"Kevin Pietersen is still on track to play in this summer's Caribbean Premier League for the St Lucia Zouks. Organisers confirmed the schedule on Tuesday, in a press release which lists Pietersen as one of its stars - alongside West Indies big-hitter Chris Gayle, Martin Guptill and Jacques Kallis among others. Pietersen negotiated a release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad next month and in May so that he could agree a new contract with Surrey. Kevin Pietersen negotiated a release from his IPL contract so that he could agree a new contract with Surrey . Pietersen has been in Australia for the Cricket World Cup and this picture  suggests he is struggling with jetlag . The superstar batsman, sacked by England last year after their Ashes whitewash defeat, is hoping a return to four-day county cricket may yet pave the way for a Test recall. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has hinted that could be a possibility, if Pietersen performs well. The 34-year-old has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again, and dreams of being back for this summer's Ashes rematch - a series which runs from July 8 to August 24. Pietersen agreed in the close season to return to play for the Zouks, as he did last summer. His commitments for them may, however, clash with part of the Ashes - or his hopes of continuing to press his claims with runs for Surrey. The South African-born batsman hasn't given up on receiving a call-up for the Ashes Tests this summer . The CPL season begins on June 20 and ends on July 26 and the tournament's international director of cricket, Tom Moody, is confident Pietersen will be there. 'At this stage he sees himself very much as part of the CPL, he's made the commitment and will have played a lot of county cricket at that time,' he told the CPL's official website. 'We don't see that changing, he hasn't indicated that's going to be the case (to pull out) but if he's suddenly picked in an Ashes Test match that's all going to change very quickly. 'I think that is probably not a realistic target for him unless something dramatic happens between now and then. It's going to be hard for him, there's a lot of hurdles to be overcome; one, form, which will be his easiest hurdle; two, his fitness and three is his building bridges. There are many to be built after what has been said from both parties over a long period of time.'

"Javier Hernandez has voiced his disappointment over a lack of playing time at Real Madrid. The Mexico international, nicknamed Chicharito, joined the European champions last summer on a season-long loan from Manchester United and has made just one Primera Division start. Real have an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season but the 26-year-old forward is unlikely to remain at the Bernabeu stadium. Javier Hernandez says his lack of playing time has been frustrating since he joined Real Madrid on loan . First team opportunities have been thin on the ground for the Manchester United striker during his loan . 'My situation is frustrating,' Hernandez said in an interview with Fox Sports which will air on Monday evening. 'I cooperate, I help and give my 100 per cent in training but in the games the opportunities are slim. 'I'm in a team but left out of what is important, which are the games. 'At times my confidence is rock bottom although I try for it to be sky high, thanks to the people that are always there with me and support me.' Hernandez, who joined United from Chivas de Guadalajara in 2010, feels he has delivered for Real when called upon. He has scored three goals and provided one assist in 13 league appearances for Carlo Ancelotti's side. Hernandez, who scored for Mexico in a friendly this week, has just three La Liga goals this season .

"Harry Kane may have taken the impact debut to another level with his goal after 79 seconds but he was not the first new cap to make a quick impression in England colours this season. In October, Fabian Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed . He was booked less than nine minutes into his first England start as he launched a series of tackles. For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution. Fabian Delph of England speaks to the media during the England press conference ahead of the clash with Italy . Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed bite to Roy Hodgson’s midfield . Delph  cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years . The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday. He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country. ‘You’ve got to be more careful,’ said Delph. ‘I like to tackle and I’ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I’ve been pretty clean. I’m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage! ‘It’s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I’ve been able to do that so I’m quite proud.’ Harry Kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at Wembley Stadium . Both Kane and Delph shone for England as Roy Hodgson's side swept Lithuania aside at Wembley . Even so, his natural aggression lifted England in Switzerland, where a 2-0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the World Cup. ‘I remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong, but it didn’t faze me,’ said Delph. ‘It was one of those things. I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.’ Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18. Lithuania's Tomas Mikuckis tracks Aston Villa and England midfielder Delph during the game at Wembley . ‘Those games did get quite tasty,’ said Delph. ‘I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I’m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.’ This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions. ‘It’s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,’ he said. ‘At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it’s worked out well. I’ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.’ As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. ‘She’s my hero,’ said Delph. ‘We didn’t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.’ Delph speaks to the media at an England press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Italy . Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for £6million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries. ‘I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,’ said Delph. ‘I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times. I did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles; the left ankle, the right ankle a few times. It was a rollercoaster ride. It made me stronger. It made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong. I worked really hard in the gym. Aston Villa midfielder Delph has a pop at goal during England's clash with Lithuania at Wembley Stadium . ‘I was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions. Is he going to get back to his best? Is he going to be the same player?’ As it turned out, he did get back, won his place back in the Villa team and took his England opportunity in the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. He missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into Hodgson’s team but bounced back again, signing a new deal which ties him to Villa Park until 2019. At 25, Delph is a regular in the England midfield. He is still making an impression, five months after his explosive full debut, and he has the cards under control.","Harry Kane's goal after 79 seconds grabbed the impact debut headlines .

"Martin Crowe can 'happily live with' New Zealand's World Cup final against Australia being potentially the last match he ever watches. Former Black Caps captain Crowe, 52, is suffering from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. He made an initial recovery after being diagnosed with the disease in 2012 but wrote on Twitter last September: 'After a brilliant year of self discovery and recovery I have more work to do. My friend & tough taskmaster Lymphoma is back to teach me.' Former New Zealand cricketer Martin Crowe is suffering with lymphoma, cancer of the immune system . Crowe says the cricket World Cup final between New Zealand and Australia could be the last game he sees . Australia captain Michael Clarke (left) poses with New Zealand leader Brendon McCullum . He has since undergone chemotherapy but even as his health fails, he cannot contain his excitement about the prospect awaiting his country and its near neighbour. Crowe wrote on ESPN Cricinfo: 'On Sunday, in front of a packed house at the one and only Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia and New Zealand go to war once again. This time not as brothers in arms but as fierce rivals, a rivalry all the more meaningful for our long history together. 'We are brothers and will always be. On Sunday one sibling will upset the other. As one of those proud brothers, I am stunned by the prospect. 'Without question, this will be the personal cricketing highlight of my life, and I sense for New Zealand too. 'My precarious life ahead may not afford me the luxury of many more games to watch and enjoy. So this is likely to be it. The last, maybe, and I can happily live with that.' Brendon McCullum's attacking batting and captaincy has led New Zealand to the final, while Martin Guptill rewrote the World Cup record books with his unbeaten 237 against the West Indies in the quarter-final, while the bowling attack has also been in form.

Crowe continued: 'To see the two sons I never had, Ross Taylor and Marty Guptill, run out in black, in sync with their close comrades, drawing on all their resolve and resilience, will be mesmerically satisfying. 'I will hold back tears all day long. I will gasp for air on occasions. I will feel like a nervous parent. I will, like so many Kiwis making the short trek across the Tasman, feel this to be the greatest cricketing time of our lives. 'Four million dare to believe, while 11 (and back-up) dare to achieve.

"Liverpool players past and present painted the town red on Sunday night following the All-Stars charity match at Anfield. Among the stars to revel in the moment at the Hilton Hotel in Liverpool was Steven Gerrard, who had earlier captained one of the teams in a 2-2 draw in front of a sell-out crowd in the game organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation. Joined by a host of Liverpool legends, the Anfield faithful were once again graced with the presence of the likes of Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa, Dirk Kuyt and Pepe Reina, and gave a particularly warm welcome to familiar faces Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres. Steven Gerrard (left) embraces former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina during the night's celebrations . Fenerbahce forward Dirk Kuyt (left) was also among the familiar faces in Liverpool on Sunday . Jose Enrique (right) and Alberto Moreno (left) pose for a photograph with their partners after a spot of dinner . Enrique posted this picture showing an ice sculpture dedicated to the match earlier on Sunday afternoon . Also joining in with the celebrations was Liverpool left-back Jose Enrique, who said it was a 'great party after the game.' Posing for photographs for his Instagram account, Reds captain Gerrard celebrated a successful afternoon that saw him net twice from the penalty spot to cancel out Mario Balotelli and Didier Drogba's goals for the equally star-studded XI skippered by former team-mate Jamie Carragher. Reflecting on a day which will see all proceeds given to various local charities - including not only Liverpool's official charity but also Alder Hey Children's Hospital - the former England captain expressed his pride following the afternoon's events. 'I enjoyed the day. It was brilliant being a part of it,' Gerrard said. 'The main reason we were here today was for the charities, to help give something back to the city. Me and Jamie [Carragher] were keen to do another event and with a big help from the club we've made it happen. We've done it in an enjoyable way.' Enrique and Croatian defender Dejan Lovren (right) smile for the camera at the All-Star after party . Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho (left) and Liverpool captain Gerrard soak up the atmosphere . Back in familiar surroundings was former striker Torres, who scored 65 goals in 102 appearances for the Merseyside club. 'Amazing [to be back]. So emotional after many years to come back here,' Torres said. 'The love of the people is amazing. Everybody knows Liverpoool supporters are different class. For me today is an unforgettable day. 'Amazing [reaction from the Kop]. My best memories in football are playing here at Anfield.'

"Talk about making an entrance. The teams were out for the second half, the spectators were seated and the referees were ready to get going but there was one problem: two players were missing. So Anfield waited patiently, expectantly and then they got what they wanted: emerging from the tunnel, wearing No 7 and No 9, came Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres, two of this stadium’s most revered former sons. This was an afternoon for nostalgia, a chance for Liverpudlians to embrace the past and pay homage to some returning heroes and they grabbed their chance when Suarez and Torres took to the field for this All-Star Charity match, between teams captained by Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. Steven Gerrard (third left) is congratulated by former Liverpool strikers Fernando Torres (second left) and Luis Suarez (third right) at Anfield . Suarez, Torres, Luis Garcia, Xabi Alonso, Gerrard, Dirk Kuyt, Pepe Reina and Alvaro Arbeloa pose for a photograph after the game .

Gerrard converted a penalty to bring his team back into the game on a sunny afternoon at Anfield in the all-star charity game . A second penalty of the afternoon followed for Gerrard in the second half and he duly converted that one too to level the scores . Steven Gerrard's XI: Jones (Vigouroux 78 mins), Johnson, A Gerrard (Dann 46), Terry (Williams 46), Riise (Warnock 46), S Gerrard (Teixeira 81), Alonso (Teixeira 32) (Adam 46), Nolan (Spearing 46), Babel, Sinclair (Torres 46), Henry (Suarez 46).

Jamie Carragher's XI: Reina (Gulacsi 61), Flanagan (Moreno 32), Carragher, Kelly, Arbeloa (Clichy 46), Lucas (Maguire 72), Shelvey (Noone 46), Kewell (Borini 46), Downing (Bellamy 46), Drogba (Garcia 46), Balotelli (Brannagan 46). Manager: Roy Evans . Attendance: 44,903 . Torres, who was sold to Chelsea for £50million two days after Suarez joined Liverpool in January 2011, had admitted to being unsure what kind of reception he would receive, given the circumstances in which he had left. There was also the fact that his last touch on this ground came on April 27 last year, when he slipped the ball past the stranded Simon Mignolet to Willian. The upshot, of course, was the Brazilian scoring and Chelsea blowing a hole in Liverpool’s title challenge. He need not have worried. His name was cheered before the game, he was hailed on to the pitch and his was the first name sung in the second half of a ‘contest’ that should see local charities benefit to the tune of more than £1m. It wasn’t just about Torres, though. This was an opportunity for many big names from Liverpool’s past to say proper goodbyes, for men like Xabi Alonso, Pepe Reina, Suarez, Jon Arne Riise and the non-playing Dirk Kuyt to bring closure to certain chapters in their respective careers. Alonso, for one, had waited six years for this. He could have had a reunion last October with Real Madrid in the Champions League but he had been sold to Bayern Munich two months before. Alonso found out about the emotional draw moments after completing his medical in Germany. He, clearly, enjoyed the 30 minutes he was on the pitch, as did everyone else involved in the game, which came from an idea Gerrard had to say thank you to Liverpool as a city before he starts his new venture in Los Angeles.

Harry Kewell plays a pass with his left foot as Chelsea captain John Terry and Liverpool captain Gerrard, playing on the same team, watch on . Balotelli opened the scoring at Anfield after just eight minutes, getting ahead of opposition captain Gerrard to slam in a long-range shot . Carragher and his Sky Sports colleague Thierry Henry share a laugh and a high five after the former defender thwarts his friend's chance . Drogba doubled the lead after deceiving goalkeeper Jones with a step-over and then coolly finishing into the empty net at the Kop end . Chelsea's Ivorian centre forward has scored 11 goals against Liverpool during his long career so it was no surprise to see him score at Anfield . Take John Terry and Didier Drogba. For so long these two Chelsea stalwarts have been regarded as the enemy but both were given generous receptions for helping the cause, particularly Drogba when he scored the second goal of the game for Carragher’s team on 31 minutes. The first had been scored by Mario Balotelli and a cracker it was too, the Italian whipping a 25-yard drive that fizzed into the corner of The Kop net on nine minutes. He wasn’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class. At one stage it looked as if Carragher’s side, managed by Roy Evans, would saunter to victory but Gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his Liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat. He scored two penalties, one in the 36th minute after Martin Kelly had adjudged to trip Jerome Sinclair and another just after the hour when Carragher quite clearly barged Luis Suarez over. Some would say the Sportsmail columnist was lucky not to make it into Lee Probert’s book. The icing on the cake would have been a goal for either Torres or Suarez but, despite the best efforts of the Uruguayan in particular, it never arrived. No matter. A draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day. The smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that.

Bayern Munich midfielder Alonso leaves the field at Anfield to a warm ovation and an embrace with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . Jerome Sinclair was brought down by Martin Kelly inside the Carragher XI penalty area to give Gerrard the chance to pull a goal back .

There were times I didn't know who to pass to. People have gone out of their way to come here. 'It has been absolutely magical. Every player who was asked to come here did, whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights.'

"Man of the moment Harry Kane will be handed his first international start for England in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Turin. The Tottenham striker continued his sensational breakthrough season by scoring after just 79seconds when he came on as a second-half substitute in England's 4-0 rout of Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday. The 21-year-old's goal scoring feats, along with injuries to the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck, have seen Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson opt to play Kane from the start against the 2006 World Cup winners.

Speaking to reporters ahead of the game at Juventus Stadium, Hodgson refused to follow Italy coach Antonio Conte by naming his starting line-up but did confirm Kane would play up front alongside captain Wayne Rooney. 'I understand why Antonio has done that because this is a friendly match and it's a time to experiment with players,' he said. 'I'm able to (name my team) but I'm not going to. I can tell you that Harry Kane will make his full debut, playing from the start and Wayne Rooney will captain the team.

'I think it's nice to see the two of them (Rooney and Kane) on the field together,' he added. 'They've played a lot in training and the other night they could have but they didn't because Harry took Wayne's place. 'So I am pleased to see them playing together in this game and Harry certainly deserves his chance.' 'We're looking forward to the game and we are taking it very seriously.

Negotiations with Sterling have reached yet another impasse and it is understood that even if Liverpool offer £180,000 a week he will not sign. Sterling, who has turned down a number of offers from Liverpool, believes his best position is in the three forward positions and is becoming increasingly concerned about his position at wing-back.

"England were warned they would be ‘foolish’ not to consider Kevin Pietersen for an Ashes Test return — by an Aussie. Pietersen, 34, signed a contract with Surrey on Wednesday to play county cricket after IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad agreed to release him from the majority of his contract. Sunrisers coach Tom Moody, a former Aussie Test star who also played for Worcestershire, admires Pietersen’s bid to relaunch his England career. Pietersen was axed by England following their 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter . He said: ‘There’s a lot of water that has to pass under the bridge first, and that includes him showing he’s going to be regularly fit for long periods of time. He also needs to prove his form. ‘If you put those two things together, I think England would be foolish not to consider him as a genuine option. You can’t help but admire his motivation to try to scale Everest again in Test cricket.’ Pietersen was sacked by England following the 2013-14 Ashes defeat but has been tempted back to Surrey after incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted he could return to the Test arena by scoring heavily in county cricket. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches for Surrey to impress England's selectors . He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes . Moody, whose Sunrisers will get Pietersen back if they reach the IPL knockout stage, anticipates a successful return to The Oval for Pietersen. ‘I think there is a small chance,’ he said of a Test recall. ‘But I think that’s enough to motivate him. ‘He’s got an agenda — to score as many runs as he can to make it near-on impossible for the selectors to ignore him. Sunrisers Hyderabad coach Tom Moody believes England would be 'foolish' not to welcome back Pietersen . Surrey’s director of cricket Alec Stewart is happy to welcome back the batsman on a contract initially for Championship cricket which could evolve during the season. Stewart said: ‘He has ambitions to play for England — and to do that, or even be considered, he has to score big runs. ‘That’s why we’ve signed him (so that) he gets those hundreds, those double-hundreds. After that, it’s down to the selectors.’ Pietersen, who will donate his Surrey wages to his charitable foundation, insists he will have no problem working with England captain Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores. Pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash . ‘Even if this does not work out and I do not get back in the England team, I will at least end my career knowing I gave it another shot,’ Pietersen said in his Daily Telegraph column. ‘I would kick myself for a long time if I walked away now, without having a go. All I am looking for is a fair opportunity to play for England again. I just want a blank sheet of paper, and to be judged on merit. ‘I will be meeting Mr Graves face to face. I think he is open to discussing drawing a line in the sand in terms of what’s gone on.’","Kevin Pietersen signs with Surrey for the County Championship .

"Hristo Stoichkov has lambasted Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal by insisting the Dutchman is 'garbage'. Stoichkov played under Van Gaal during his second spell at the Nou Camp before leaving the Spanish outfit for CSKA Sofia in 1998. Bulgarian legend Stoichkov was far from impressed with Van Gaal and has blamed the Manchester United boss for his premature departure from the Catalan giants. Former Barcelona forward Hristo Stoichkov, pictured in 1997, has blasted Man United boss Louis van Gaal . Stoichkov (left) played under Van Gaal (right) during his second spell at Barcelona in the Nineties . Stoichkov, speaking to Sport Sunday, said: 'I have no respect for him, he’s garbage. 'One day, when I was injured and I was with my wife at the Nou Camp. He went up to her and asked ""how was possible that she married someone like me?"" 'It was the fault of Van Gaal that I moved on to CSKA Sofia.' In contrast, Stoichkov - who played a major role in helping Barcelona to four consecutive league titles during his first spell at the club - had nothing but good words to say about Van Gaal's former assistant Jose Mourinho.

The forward will be hoping to lead his country to victory when they host Serbia in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night, as well as adding to his tally of two goals in qualification so far. Former Chelsea duo Tiago and Ricardo Carvalho both took part in Tuesday's session alongside fellow stalwarts Joao Moutinho and Nani.

Fernando Santos' men currently sit second in Group I on six points - just one behind leaders Denmark who have played a game more. Santos will be hoping his side can continue their recent good form which has yielded an 100 per cent record from their last three games including a 1-0 friendly win over Argentina on November 18 at Old Trafford. On Monday it was announced that the 60-year-old coach had won an appeal to cut his ban for misconduct at the World Cup while coaching Greece. However, he will still be barred from contact with his Portugal stars in their next few matches. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said it halved an 'excessive' eight-match ban imposed by FIFA, with two matches of the sanction deferred for a six-month probationary period. Winger Nani (left) was also training with the national squad ahead of games vs Serbia and Cape Verde Islands . CAS added its panel found Santos guilty of 'improper conduct' during Greece's second-round loss to Costa Rica last June in Brazil. Santos was sent from the dugout after extra time, which finished 1-1, as Greece lost the penalty shootout. The court said Santos was 'protesting against the referee and casting doubts on his impartiality.'

"Lewis Hamilton secured the 40th pole of his grand prix career at a rain-hit Sepang on Saturday but the question afterwards was whether Nico Rosberg had attempted to block him in qualifying. And both men were asking it. At the Mercedes press conference, Rosberg put his hand up. Lewis Hamilton shakes hands with Sebastian Vettel after qualifying with Nico Rosberg in the background . Rosberg has been accused of attempting to block Hamilton during qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix . Click here to read Jonathan McEvoy's report as Hamilton secures pole ahead of Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg . 'Nico Rosberg, Mercedes AMG Petronas,' he started, imitating a journalist. 'There are a lot of comments on Twitter saying Nico blocked you. Is it true he blocked you on your second timed lap?' Hamilton replied, smiling: 'I think you should probably ask him. I think he'll have a good opinion on that.' The room laughed, but Rosberg appeared to be annoyed. He shook his head and twice said: 'That's not funny.' Rosberg, going slowly, appeared to stay on the racing line as Hamilton was on a flying lap in the final qualifying session. Hamilton (right) was on a fast lap when he approached the back of Rosberg who had already slowed down . Rosberg (left) remained on the racing line despite his Mercedes team-mate being on a quick lap . Hamilton (right) overtakes Rosberg. It was claimed hat the German had intentionally blocked his rival . But it made no difference because, as it transpired, Hamilton already had pole position sewn up. Rosberg was third fastest. The German was then asked by a reporter if he did indeed intentionally block Hamilton. 'You best ask Lewis about that, he said. 'No, it is not even a relevant discussion because we were both on slow-down laps at that point in time. And that was very, very clear.' Informed Hamilton had set a personal best in the first sector, Rosberg said: 'Yeah, but if you bail out of a lap it turns into a slow-down lap, doesn't it?' It was then suggested to Rosberg that Hamilton only slowed as he came upon the German, to which he said: 'That is not true. He backed off way before coming up on me.' Hamilton mastered the difficult conditions in Malaysia to secure the 40th pole of his grand prix career . The Briton will start ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel as he bids to secure his second straight victory . Although the next question was on a different subject, Rosberg chose not to let the matter drop and remarked: 'How do we make that a fact, that he bailed out before he came across me? 'That is the interesting one because me just saying it isn't going to bear much weight. So, we need to think of one, which I don't have an answer for to make that a fact for you. I will have to think about something later on. Or you can ask Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss) who is coming. That is maybe a good one. That will give some more weight to it.' Unfortunately for Rosberg, Wolff was unavailable for his session, and so could not offer an opinion. It is not the first time Rosberg has been accused of blocking Hamilton in qualifying. At last year's Monaco Grand Prix, Rosberg appeared to scupper his team-mate's best shot at pole by deliberately running off the circuit. Yellow flags were subsequently deployed, and Hamilton, running behind his rival on the track, was forced to slow down.

"When Sporting Lisbon forked out their biggest transfer fee of the season on an unknown Scottish teenager, you could have expected Ryan Gauld to feel the spotlight burning fiercely on him following his arrival in Portugal. The Scotland Under-21 international insists, however, that he feels under less pressure at his new club than he did at Dundee United. Gauld secured a dream £3million move to Sporting from Tannadice last summer after long being tagged with his ‘Mini Messi’ nickname on these shores amid endless hype about his ability. The Portuguese giants have blooded him slowly into their side, giving the 19-year-old plenty of time to adjust to his new life. After playing in several League Cup ties, he was finally unleashed in a league game against Rio Ave in January. Sporting Lisbon's Ryan Gauld (centre) says he feels at home in Portugal after his move from Dundee United . And Gauld — who starred for Danny Lennon’s Scotland Under-21s during their win in Hungary this week — admits he is delighted at the way he has settled into his new surroundings, highlighting the way he has been able to learn ‘behind the scenes’ as the reason for his successful transition. ‘Of course there was a bit of pressure on me going to Portugal,’ he says. ‘But I was excited at the thought of a new beginning. ‘There was a lot of focus on me in Scotland — a lot of talk about me and what I was going to do. Youngster Gould (right) is currently back in his home country with Scotland Under 21s . ‘But I wanted to escape that. That’s why I was delighted to sign for Sporting because it was like starting again. That was part of my thinking behind the move. To get away from it all and develop as a player behind the scenes. ‘People might think the pressure would increase going to a bigger club in a bigger league. But for me it was almost the opposite. I can relax more at Sporting. I was delighted to get out of the limelight that I had at United. When I was there, there was so much talk about stuff I didn’t like to read about or hear. ‘So going over to Portugal was the right move for me, in terms of development. I knew I wouldn’t go straight into the first team. It took Gauld a while to settle into his new surroundings, but now he feels at home in Lisbon . ‘I was always going to have to play for the B team first but that was perfect for me to learn. There was no pressure on me. I could get on with it behind the scenes.’ Gauld admits it wasn’t all straightforward and that it took some time to settle into life in Lisbon. However, he believes he has finally adapted to both the change of football style and lifestyle and loved making his bow for Sporting, where he was widely praised by coming off the bench and inspiring a 4-2 win at home to Rio Ave. ‘I’m in a good place right now, definitely, in my football and in my life,’ he continues. ‘I’m at a really good point in my career. I’m playing games every week and I’m enjoying it. I feel more settled in Lisbon now than I did six months ago. It was a big move and it was always going to take time to adapt. Gauld (left) played in an international challenge match for Scotland Under 21s against Hungary this week . ‘If I’m honest, it did take longer than I expected it to. But now I’ve been there nine months and I feel totally at home in Portugal. ‘That’s my first year nearly up and it’s flown by. I’ve settled well and I’m really happy. The main thing to begin with was adapting to the way the Portuguese play because it’s very different to what I was used to. ‘It took a lot of games for the B team before I felt comfortable with Portuguese football and the way they play. But I’ve been rewarded by a couple of substitute appearances for the first team, so everything’s going well right now. Gauld has long held the nickname 'Mini Messi' but he feels out of the spotlight playing for Sporting Lisbon . ‘The night when I made my debut in the league was brilliant. It was against good opposition in Rio Ave. ‘To get around 25 minutes and see the tempo the game was played at was a great experience. I was playing with top players. ‘The crowd seemed to take to me. A big deal was made when I went over to sign, so the fans were eager to see what I could do. I think they were quite happy to finally see me in action. Hopefully I’ve not disappointed them.’ Gauld (second left) moved to Sporting Lisbon for £3million from Dundee United (pictured) And while not quite completely fluent in Portuguese yet, Gauld has integrated well with the rest of the Sporting squad. ‘I’ve picked up a fair bit of the language recently,’ he adds. ‘I can now have conversations and stuff off the pitch. I’m maturing as a person over here. Living in a different country by myself and not knowing the language has made me grow up. I’ve matured a lot. ‘I had to learn loads of things and do it on my own. It has made me come out of my shell because I was quite shy before I came. Gauld (right) stretches with Under 21 team-mate Billy King at St Mirren Park this week . ‘There are a couple of Portuguese phrases that I’ve heard the boys saying, so I tried to pick them up. But I can’t seem to get a grip of them and they’re giving me a hard time about it! ‘It’s not swear words, just slang saying like we’d say in Scotland: “What’s happening?” or “what’s up?”. ‘It’s just a casual phrase. I think I’m saying it the exact same way as them but they tell me I get it wrong. Maybe it’s my Scottish accent!’ Gauld (front right) leads the way as Scotland Under 21s arrive at Glasgow Airport on Wednesday . The focus for Gauld now is to get more game time and figure more prominently in manager Marco Silva’s plans. ‘Between now and the end of the season, my aim has to be to be more involved in the first team,’ he says. ‘I’ve had a spell where I was in a lot of squads but now I’m back in the B team. They want to dip me in and out. It’s to make sure I continue to work hard and know what it takes to make the A team.’","Ryan Gauld left Dundee United to join Sporting Lisbon last summer .

"A peaceful religious protest has taken place outside Windsor Park in opposition to Northern Ireland's first ever Sunday fixture on home soil. The Irish Football Association has never before staged an international game on a Sunday but was forced to break new ground by UEFA's 'Week of Football' initiative . Euro 2016 qualifiers are now spread throughout the international period, with dates allocated automatically by computer, and the hosts take on Finland on Sunday. Members of the Tyndale Free Presbyterian Church protest against Northern Ireland's Sunday home fixture . A man hands out religious tracts against the backdrop of a George Best mural on Sunday . The Tyndale Memorial branch of the Free Presbyterian Church has criticised the IFA for failing to seek dispensation and declining to inform local church groups. Reverend Raymond Robinson, whose congregation held placards and handed out leaflets on Donegall Avenue, told Press Association Sport: 'Our opposition is to the breaking of observance of the Lord's day. 'We believe in the Sabbath being kept holy. It seems more and more that the football agenda is being driven by the television companies and not what God says, or what public opinion is. A Northern Ireland football flag is flown as the protester hands out tracts near Windsor Park . Banners are displayed in opposition to Northern Ireland's first ever home match on a Sunday . 'A delegation met the IFA and expressed our concerns. We found it interesting that the likes of Gibraltar and Spain had special circumstances (within the UEFA schedule) but the IFA couldn't have the same for observing Sunday as the Lord's day. 'We were also surprised at the IFA not contacting local churches about the fixture, which we felt would have been common courtesy. 'They did say they would seek to accommodate us and help out but if we had never mentioned it that would never have happened.'

"For one, this was a case of treading fresh ground. Quite literally. For others, it was about settling back into roles that were once familiar. Something old, something new. And something surprisingly blue, in the hue of Northern Ireland’s jerseys. Thankfully for Scotland, there was no off-colour outcome. A win is a win. Even when it comes after the typical drudgery that international friendlies can bring. Let’s just say that no-one who sat through this 90 minutes will be feverishly petitioning for the return of the Home Internationals. Matt Ritchie made his first appearance for Scotland against Northern Ireland on Wednesday night . Not that there weren’t points of interest prior to Christophe Berra’s late winner. At least three featured in Gordon Strachan’s starting selection. A debut for Matt Ritchie was the headline act. A supporting cast of talking points came via Craig Gordon’s return in goal and Darren Fletcher being given the nod as captain. In a squad that has a settled core of certainties, Strachan’ s aims are all about fine tuning ahead of the remaining Euro 2016 qualifiers. Ritchie’s admission that he had never actually set foot north of the border caught the attention when he was called up last week. Yet there was also no mistaking the pride felt by the Hampshire-born Bournemouth winger, who qualifies for Scotland through his father Alex - originally from Edinburgh. An instant first cap deepened the family delight. The 25-year-old has been an integral part of his club’s highly promising bid for promotion to the land of milk and honey that is the Barclays Premier League. We will have to wait a bit longer for an accurate assessment of his worth as an international, but this was far from the worst start. He already has an assist to his name after plonking the match-winning corner onto Berra’s head. Ritchie operates on the right but is almost all left foot. That quality was seen early on when he dropped anchor to deceive Daniel Lafferty and fired a curling delivery deep beyond the back post. It was tailor-made for Shaun Maloney, hardly noted for his aerial prowess, but his header back across came to nothing. Bournemouth winger Ritchie qualified for Scotland through his father Alex . The former Swindon man has 11 goals for Bournemouth this season and offered a glimpse of that direct threat just after the hour mark. Working an exchange with Steven Naismith, he hammered a blistering drive wide from 25 yards out. Another, less powerful, effort was comfortably grasped by Michael McGovern. While the Hamilton goalkeeper was just about the busiest man in Michael O’ Neill’ s line-up, the polar opposite was true for Gordon. He had played the second half of the 3-1 friendly defeat from England at Celtic Park to earn a 41st cap, but this was his first start for the national side in more than four years. For long enough, it had seemed that 3-0 win over Faroe Islands at Pittodrie in November 2010 might just have marked the end of his Scotland career. Here, though, was further confirmation of a remarkable revival. At club level, Gordon could well end up achieving an historic domestic Treble with Celtic this year. Having come through a gruelling rehabilitation to fully recover from a complex knee injury, his free transfer signing stands as one of the bargains of this or any other season. Yet he openly admits the dream of returning to a Scotland shirt provided another level of motivation on the long road back to fitness. Now that has been achieved, he has his sights set on a place in the Hall of Fame. Eight more caps are needed. Christophe Berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for Scotland . To grab them, he will have to hold off the sizeable challenge presented by David Marshall and Allan McGregor by continuing to impress. Not that there was much chance to do so last night. In his 45-minute outing, Gordon was so under-deployed he could have scribbled out autographs to the supporters sitting behind his goal. The most excitement he got was a brief sprint out of his area to intercept a long through-ball and feed a pass to Craig Forsyth. Hardly enough to have his heart racing. The biggest danger to Gordon was contracting a chill through inactivity, but that even that threat was removed when he was allowed to watch the second half from the bench, wrapped in a warm jacket. McGregor took his place, so what odds Marshall now being given the nod against Gibraltar on Sunday? Given the opposition, the real decision about who is the new No.1 can almost be deferred until the crucial trip to Dublin in June. The same might well be said of the captaincy. This was only Fletcher’s second start under Strachan and, with Scott Brown on the bench, he was always going to take the armband. Like Gordon, there were once doubts whether this scenario would return. His fight against the ravages of ulcerative colitis has been well documented but, following surgery last year, this is the first season in many in which he can be considered fully fit for action. It is also the first of his professional life away from Manchester United. Fletcher’s January move to West Bromwich Albion has provided him with the opportunity of regular first team action that was always going to be problematic as Louis van Gaal reshaped his squad at Old Trafford. His influence has been rapidly felt at the Hawthorns, particularly as Tony Pulis immediately installed him as captain. Back on show at Hampden, he produced typical Fletcher fare. Nothing flashy, but a calm assurance in keeping the team ticking over. Win the ball, pass it wisely, cover space, repeat. Like Scotland as whole, he simply got the job done.","Matt Ritchie made Scotland debut in 1-0 victory over Northern Ireland .

"Christophe Berra dedicated his third Scotland goal to Dave Mackay – the day after the Hearts and Tottenham legend was laid to rest. Berra came through the ranks at Tynecastle where the legendary midfielder ruled supreme in the late 1950s. Hampden paid tribute to Mackay with a minute's applause before Wednesday night's game with Northern Ireland - and Ipswich defender Berra, who replaced Russell Martin at the break, ensured the night also had a fitting ending by heading home a winner with five minutes remaining.

Berra celebrates his late goal, which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity . The Ipswich Town centre back celebrates with his team-mates after securing the win five minutes from time . 'I met him a couple of times when I was at Hearts,' Berra recalled of Mackay. 'He was a confident person. I think it was the way he played, he wasn't shy and had a great career with Scotland, Hearts and Spurs. 'A great deal of respect has been shown to him in football, especially British football. 'So I'm especially pleased I scored tonight. He was strong and could bully people and was a player people could relate to. He had a great career and that minute's applause was great for him and his family. 'It was good to get a goal. That was my first Scotland appearance in a long time and it meant a lot to get 45 minutes. To also score a goal was even better. 'I'd almost scored from a corner five minutes before the goal when I had a header at the front post. I maybe should have done better. 'I said to Matt (Ritchie) to hang it up a bit and it was there to go and attack. I stuck my head on it and thankfully it went into the back of the net. The teams observed a minute's applause for the late Dave McKay before the game at Hampden Park . 'It's my third goal for Scotland and my sixth of the season. As a defender, it' s good to add goals to my name.' Despite heading his second career goal against Northern Ireland, Berra believes he will return to the bench when Gibraltar come calling on Sunday. 'Obviously I am down the pecking order,' he added. 'I just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again.' Until Berra's late intervention, it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one. Steven Fletcher, without an international goal since his one and only strike against Iceland almost six years ago, saw a couple of decent chances come and go. Had the occasion been anything other than a friendly, he would have been beating himself up about it. But perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against Gibraltar on Sunday allowed him a degree of comfort. 'I'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible,' he said. 'It' s been a while. For me, tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt. 'I've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there. It doesn't prey on my mind. If I wasn't getting chances, I'd be complaining but I' m getting them so I just need to start taking them.' Crowds clap whilst the Hearse carrying the coffin of Dave Mackay leaves Tyncastle Stadium for his funeral . Asked if becoming the first Scotland player since Colin Stein to net a hat-trick come the weekend was an added incentive, Fletcher quipped: 'I need to get a goal just now never mind a hat-trick. Listen, if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them. 'If that means one of us getting a few then great. First and foremost, we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table.' So much for two Celtic nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining Euro qualifiers. Friendly was what it said on the ticket and, by heavens that is what we got. At the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it. But, despite the lack of goals, Fletcher believed it was the perfect work-out ahead of Gibraltar on Sunday. Scotland captain Darren Fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four . 'It was good preparation,' he insisted. 'A few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes. 'It's another win which keeps the momentum going. There's another big game on Sunday which we are all looking forward to. 'If we'd got an earlier goal, it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one. It's good. 'We could have been ahead earlier. We'd a few chances in the first half – I'd a few myself. 'I'm going to blame the goalie for the one I missed and not myself. In fairness, he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did. But the win keeps us going for the weekend. 'Both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend. You could see that with the changes that were made. 'Both managers wanted to keep everyone's legs fresh. Both nations have got two big games coming up.' Fletcher attempted to temper the expectation that Sunday's game will be a total formality. 'We're not going in there thinking we're going to run them into the ground,' he insisted. 'We just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win. 'Goal difference doesn't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence. We've got a massive game against Ireland in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days.'","Christophe Berra headed home against Northern Ireland in the 85th minute .

"Roger Federer set up a blockbuster rematch with world number one Novak Djokovic by beating Milos Raonic to reach the final of the BNP Paribas Open. Following Djokovic's comprehensive 6-2 6-3 victory over British No 1 Andy Murray, Federer reached his 40th ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final with a 7-5 6-4 defeat of Canadian sixth seed Raonic at Indian Wells.

'I think it's very exciting for both of us, and also for fans, to see a rematch of the great final from last year,' Federer, who lost to the Serbian in three sets in the Californian desert back in 2014, told bnpparibasopen.com. 'I'm looking forward to it, and I hope I can keep up my good play.' Federer earned a break point in the fifth game but Raonic saved it with an ace before holding. The Swiss soon broke for a 6-5 lead and wrapped up the set.

Earlier on Saturday, Djokovic ended world number four Murray's fine run to a first Masters 1000 semi-final in two years by extending his head-to-head advantage between the pair to 17-8 with a sixth successive win. The Scot elected to receive serve after winning the toss but stumbled as Djokovic quickly reached 4-1 before ruthlessly clinching all three of his break points in the set to prevail. The current Wimbledon champion broke Murray again in the second game of the second set and saved two break points to go to 4-1 and 5-2. Then, after his opponent slipped from 30-0 up to 40-30 down, Djokovic gladly served the match out. Murray said: 'The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets. 'Novak didn't give me any free points at the beginning of either set and I made a few too many errors early on.

For the world of football, it is positive that Walcott recuperates totally to his top level.'

"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has claimed he has only love for his French footballing life, amid the fall-out from his outburst earlier this month. Ibrahimovic will face a French Football League (LFP) disciplinary commission hearing on April 9 over comments he made after PSG's 3-2 loss to Bordeaux on March 15. The Swede was at the time caught on camera saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Zlatan Ibrahimovic swore loudly as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's defeat to Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic, during his rant, claimed France was 's***' but has now insisted that he likes the country . French sports minister Patrick Kanner had called on Ibrahimovic to apologise, which he later did in a social media post, and the mercurial forward has once again played down the impact of his rant. At a press conference ahead of Sweden's Euro 2016 qualifier against Moldova, Ibrahimovic, in quotes reported in the Swedish media, said: 'I like it in France. 'I would not have played there for so long and I would not have renewed my contract if I did not like it. All the others, all that b******t, they just want to pull me down from the top but I will not go. I like it on top. That's where I'll stay.' Ibrahimovic faces a disciplinary hearing over the comments he made after the Bordeaux game on March 15 . The Sweden striker has called for greater emphasis on referees, noting that they do not get punished . Ibrahimovic does, however, want a greater emphasis placed on referees, adding: 'We the players are punished, but not the referee.' While Ibrahimovic did score a hat-trick for PSG against Lorient in the last round of Ligue 1 fixtures before the international break, he is set to miss their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona after his sending off against Chelsea. His tackle on Oscar earned him a straight red, though PSG did progress in the end, but Ibrahimovic feels the Brazilian had played his part in the referee's decision. 'Play-acting does not belong in my world and I play to win,' Ibrahimovic said. 'I will do anything to win, but play-acting? Not that. 'It is out there, I do not know if it has become part of the game, but I hope not.'","Zlatan Ibrahimovic faces a disciplinary hearing over comments he made .

"Roger Federer defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-0 and Milos Raonic outlasted Rafael Nadal 4-6, 7-6 (10), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour marathon to set up a semi-final showdown at the BNP Paribas Open on Friday. Federer improved to 15-1 this year, with his only loss coming against Andreas Seppi in the third round of the Australian Open. Federer avenged that defeat in the same round at Indian Wells. He earned his first straight-set win over Berdych since 2011 in Paris and just his second 6-0 set ever in 19 career matches against the Czech. 'I'm not the kind of guy who takes great joy out of bageling opponents, to be honest,' said Federer, seeking a record fifth title in the desert. Roger Federer beat Tomas Berdych in straight sets at the Indian Wells Masters in California on Friday . Federer has only lost once this year - at the Australian Open - and took just 68 minutes to beat Berdych . He needed just 68 minutes to advance to the semis against the sixth-seeded Raonic. 'It was one of his very tough performances,' Berdych said. 'He was doing pretty much everything perfect.' Top-ranked Serena Williams plays No 3 seed Simona Halep and No 18 Jelena Jankovic faces 24th-seeded Sabine Lisicki in the semi-finals. Williams is trying to reach the final for the first time since 2001, when she won as a 19-year-old and was heavily booed, leading to her 14-year boycott of the tournament. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic takes on fourth-seeded Andy Murray in the other men's semifinal on Saturday. It was the first time Berdych has lost to Federer in straight sets since 2011 . Raonic beat three-time Indian Wells champion Nadal for the first time in six career meetings, firing 18 aces and hitting 48 winners to 25 winners for Nadal, who had 22 unforced errors. They dueled in the second-set tiebreaker, when Nadal held three match points but he committed errors on two of them and Raonic smashed a winner on the other. Raonic had plenty of chances in the tiebreaker, too, finally converting on his fifth set point when Nadal netted a shot. Neither gave an inch in the third, staying on serve until the 11th game. That's when Raonic earned the only break of the set, hitting a shot on the baseline that Nadal chased down but sent a backhand long. Raonic dropped just one point on his serve in the final game, winning on another backhand error by Nadal, who lost to a Canadian player for the first time in nine career matches. Milos Raonic will face Federer in the semi-final after beating Rafael Nadal in three sets . Had Nadal won the top four seeds would have made the semis along with Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic . Nadal's defeat prevented Djokovic, Federer, the Spaniard and Murray - the world's top four-ranked players - from reaching the semifinals at the same tournament since the 2012 Australian Open. Federer had 21 winners, equaling the number of unforced errors by Berdych. Federer won 13 of 14 points at the net, never faced a break point on his serve, and broke Berdych four times in the match, including three times in the second set. 'I was really able to utilize the court much more, play more angles, play with variation, spin and slice. I did that very well,' Federer said. 'Because I was serving well and moving well, so maybe there is not going to be that many chances for him on the return.' Federer served two love games in the first set, when he lost just five points on his serve. 'When you feel that he's in control right from the beginning, then of course you have to come up with your best game from the beginning of the match,' Berdych said. 'There is a very thin line in between that and overdoing it. Today I stepped a little bit over it.'","Roger Federer beat Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-0 at Indian Wells Masters .

"Roger Federer cruised into the third round of the BNP Paribas Open, dismissing Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 6-2 at Indian Wells, to set up a rematch with Andreas Seppi. Federer, hoping to capture an unprecedented fifth Indian Wells title this week, brushed past the world No 63 Schwartzman in just over an hour on Sunday - and then gave an intriguing insight in to how he has kept himself at the top of his sport for so long. The 33-year-old world No 2 will now face Seppi, who beat him 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) at the Australian Open back in January. Roger Federer beat Diego Schwartzman in straight sets to reach Indian Wells third round . Argentine Schwartzman was comfortably swept aside 6-4 6-2 by dominant Federer in California . Federer hardly broke sweat in progressing and will now face Andrea Seppi in the next round . And Federer feels his decision to not just 'chase money or more tournament victories' over the years has allowed him to stay competitive. 'The idea was always (about) trying to be around the game for a long time,' he said. 'And for that in 2004, when I became world No. 1, I took a decision with my fitness coach at the time that we're going to plan long-term. Whatever we will do, we will plan long-term. 'Sure, we can chase money or more tournament victories. We can play more frequently, train harder, whatever we will do. But we decided we will try to stay around 20 tournaments during the year, which is a lower number.' Ominously for his rivals Federer believes such an approach has led to him playing some of the best tennis of his career. Federer believes that despite being 33 he is still playing some of the best tennis of his career . For world No 63 Schwartzman, it was a tough afternoon at Indian Wells as he was outclassed . Federer showed off his full range of skills and movement as he comfortably swept aside his opponent . Federer celebrates his win by hitting balls into the crowd at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden . He said: 'I'm happy the plan worked, that at 33 I'm still being super competitive and healthy and happy to be on tour. 'I still believe I can improve my game ... I think you have to try to reinvent yourself. Tennis is actually one of those sports where I feel like you can always do better.' Against Schwartzman, Federer was as impressive as ever - utilising his net skills to win 13 of 14 points, hit eight aces and faced no break points during the rapid win. The 17 time Grand Slam champion will need to replicate such form against Seppi, however, whose surprise victory over Federer was a first triumph in 11 meetings with the Swiss maestro. Seppi advanced to the third round after dispatching Victor Hanescu 6-4, 6-4.

"Newcastle United striker Adam Armstrong has revealed how an impromptu pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney inspired him to score three times for the under 18s last week. The 18-year-old grew up idolising the Manchester United star, who was only too happy to share some tips on the art of goalscoring when the two met at St George's Park. And the advice clearly sunk in as Armstrong went on to score three times in two friendly matches against Switzerland. England under 18s striker Adam Armstrong received a pep-talk from Wayne Rooney last week that inspired him to three goals in two friendly matches against Switzerland . Armstrong celebrates scoring in England's 6-1 friendly win over Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday . Armstrong's first goal was a well-taken volley (pictured), while his second was a direct free-kick . Rooney delivered a team talk to the whole of Neil Dewsnip's under 18 squad before having a one-on-one chat with Armstrong afterwards. And the Geordie hotshot said: 'I played against him at Old Trafford and he said he liked the way that I always got across the defenders. 'He said that the Manchester United team had watched me in the clips before the game - that was a massive confidence booster for me to have someone like that say that.' Armstrong added: 'He came into our meeting and answered questions from all the lads and then I managed to speak with him one-on-one. 'The lads were all getting photos with him and I just stayed behind after that, and the manager Neil Dewsnip asked if I could ask him a few questions about my game.

'I asked him what I can do for myself to improve as I try to play in the same way as him. 'He gave me loads of tips and advice, which was an unbelievable experience for me. Being such a young lads playing in the first-team, he told me that I always need to have confidence when I play and never be afraid to get my shots off. 'As a striker, he just said that I always need to have the belief to go again if it wasn't happening for me and the only way to reach the top level is to continue working hard every day. 'It might sound daft, but I've still got his poster on my bedroom door at home, so it was just class.' While Rooney was scoring for the seniors in England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania, taking his international goal tally to 47, Armstrong improved his record for the Three Lions youth teams to 19 in 24 games.

"It emerged on Monday that Raheem Sterling could be prepared to turn down as much as £180,000 per week as contract talks with Liverpool continue to stall. The England international's current £35,000-per-week deal has another two years to run at the end of this season and Sterling has so far turned down a number of offers from the Anfield club. Sterling has become increasingly concerned by his constant switching of positions in the Liverpool side and has even been utilised at right wing back by Brendan Rodgers. Here, Sportsmail answers five key questions on the Liverpool star’s future. The Liverpool forward was in action for his country on Friday night in a European qualifier . Raheem Sterling is prepared to turn down a mammoth £180,000-a-week deal at Liverpool . 1) What is Sterling’s issue with the deal on the table? Brendan Rodgers dug himself a hole by claiming Sterling is the one of the best young players in Europe. Someone of that stature is worth, at least, £100,000-per-week. Your moral views on whether a player so young should be paid so much is irrelevant. You pay your best players the going rate. Sterling, arguably, is Liverpool's best player meaning he should be, at least, on a par with Daniel Sturridge's £150,000 per week. Likewise, there are issues with Sterling's role in the team at the moment. He's been shifted around the pitch by Rodgers - even utilised as a right wing back on occasions. He sees his best position as being through the middle. Sterling's current £35,000-per-week deal has two years to run at the end of this season . The 20-year-old scored for England in their 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley on Friday night . Sterling impressed as part of England's front three but he has been used at wing back by Liverpool . 2) What would it take to get him to sign a new deal? Certainly an improvement on the £90,000-per-week deal they've offered but even that may not be enough for him to sign. Qualifying for the Champions League will also help matters. A player of Sterling's rising stock wants to be plying his trade on the biggest club stage of all. Playing in the Europa League next season is nowhere near as glamorous. Assurances over his role in the side may help, too. 3) Are Liverpool losing patience with their star man? The fans are starting to get a little restless. The longer this drags on, the more agitated supporters become. Fans believe there will be a resolution but that optimism isn't shared by those in the corridors of power at Anfield. They know there's a real danger of Sterling point blank refusing to sign any sort of contract. Liverpool chiefs need to keep negotiations amicable. It's a delicate juggling act for them. There will be no shortage of suitors for Sterling should he leave Liverpool - in the Premier League and Europe . Sterling takes on Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas during the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley . 4) What is the likelihood of Sterling leaving Anfield in the summer? It remains in Liverpool's hands. The fact of the matter is Sterling will still have two years left on his current £35,000-per-week contract this summer. They could sit tight and maintain he isn't for sale. But whether Liverpool want to risk their prized-asset entering the final year of his contract remains to be seen. Also, will Rodgers want a player who has made it clear he doesn't want to stay? If there is no agreement over a contract, Sterling is likely to leave this summer. 5) If he was to go, what are his options? Clubs across the continent will be clambering for his signature should Liverpool decide to sell. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are both monitoring the situation carefully. Likewise, Manchester City will be hugely interested in the forward. Arsenal are also keeping tabs on Sterling's situation but the greater finances of their rivals mean they are likely to be outsiders. Sterling has performed well for Liverpool but he is yet to sign a new deal to keep him at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers must convince Sterling to sign a deal that could be one of the biggest in club's history .","Raheem Sterling's current deal has two years to run after this season .

"John Barnes claims he is struggling to get a job in management because he is black. The former Liverpool star's last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked. The 51-year-old has previously been in charge of Celtic and the Jamaica national team. Barnes insisted that had he been white he would have got another job. John Barnes has claimed that the colour of his skin is holding him back from another management job . The former England star made an ill-fated introduction to management with Celtic in 1999 . 'A white manager loses his job and gets another job, he loses his job, he gets another job. Very few black managers can lose their job and get another job,' he told John Barnes: Sports Life Stories, to be broadcast on ITV4 on Tuesday. 'What I can judge it from is by looking at society. How many black people are there in the higher echelons of any industry? We can talk about journalism, we can talk about politics. So why should football be any different?' Barnes' first job in management, at Celtic for the 1999-2000 season, ended in the wake of an embarrassing Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness. But he denied that job was too much too soon. Barnes was sacked as Tranmere manager after a run of two wins from 11 league games . Barnes starred for Liverpool during a 10-year spell at Anfield in his playing career . Barnes found some success as manager of the Jamaica national team in 2008-09 . He said: 'Well, if it comes now at 51, I don't think it will be any different. It's more to do with the perception of my ability to do the job, because there's a certain perception of who can make a good manager.' Barnes' former England team-mate Ian Wright agreed that the colour of his skin was counting against Barnes. The former Arsenal man said: 'With someone of John Barnes' ability and stature, to not have worked more in the game with something that he's desperate to do. I don't know what else it can be?' Former England team-mate Ian Wright agrees that skin colour is limiting Barnes' opportunities . Barnes also talked about the guilt he felt after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Barnes, who attended the funerals and met the families of victims following the tragedy, said: 'I felt this guilt that they were coming to watch me. 'I know that they were coming to watch everybody else, and it's Liverpool Football Club. It's an irrational thought. 'So I felt this guilt. And I wasn't sure how they would react because had that been my loved one, I wouldn't want to go and meet footballers or the football team, or ever watch football again.'","John Barnes claims he is being held back from a management job by the colour of his skin .

"Jann Mardenborough has been released from hospital after the accident in Germany on Saturday that resulted in the death of a spectator and has left the British racing driver 'very distressed'. Mardenborough was competing in the VLN1 event at the Nurburgring Nordschliefe when his Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 flipped up in the air as it crested a rise in the circuit. The car eventually landed on its tail further down the track before bouncing over the catch-fencing into a crowd of people. A spectator died at the Nurburgring on Saturday after a crash involving a British racing driver . The Nissan of Jann Mardenborough flipped into the air and crashed into a crowd of spectators . Mardenborough's car started to lift into the air as it crested a rise in the circuit in Germany . The Brit's Nissan remained in the air for about 30 metres with the front of the car facing the sky . Mardenborough is a 23-year-old who is currently competing in the  World Endurance Championship . Mardenborough, the 23-year-old from Cardiff, is renowned for his epic rise into motor racing just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project. In 2011, he won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers. Over the past few years Mardenborough has competed in sportscars and single-seaters. Nissan recently confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The incident resulted in the death of one fan, with two others injured, whilst a seemingly-unharmed Mardenborough, a 23-year-old from Cardiff, was taken to hospital for routine checks following an initial examination at the circuit medical centre. An investigation is under way to determine the cause of the crash. An update statement from Nissan read: 'After the terrible events during yesterday's VLN race, Nissan is pleased to have received information that the two injured spectators have been released from hospital. 'Jann has completed a series of medical tests and has also been released from hospital. Naturally he is very distressed about the outcome of yesterday's accident. Mardenborough's car crashed into barriers on the outside of one of the turns at the Nurburgring . The car took off and flipped over catch-fencing and into the crowd, leaving a spectator dead . 'The vehicle has been impounded by the German authorities and Nissan has offered full co-operation in their investigation. 'Everyone at Nissan would like to again extend their deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased and to the spectators who were hurt.

"Hearts were the source of all of Gary Locke’s childhood dreams. The chance to play, captain and manage the club ensured that, for long enough, the love affair was requited. A year ago, though, a long-standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud. Widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near-certain relegation, the 39-year-old awoke one day having to digest one of the game’s great truths: No one is indispensable. Gary Locke is currently manager at Kilmarnock after leaving his post at Hears last year . Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season . Brutally axed as Ann Budge and Craig Levein made way for Robbie Neilson, Locke licked his wounds before returning to Kilmarnock, initially as assistant manager to Allan Johnston. What’s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties. Neilson’s side romped to the Championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with Locke’s services. Yet, in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from Johnson last month at Rugby Park, Locke, in turn, has underscored his dug-out credentials and then some. Would Hearts have won the Championship title with him still at the helm? We shall never know. But, as he puts the finishing touches to a new long-term deal in Ayrshire this week, the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong. ‘I don’t think I have proven a point to Hearts,’ Locke insisted. ‘I didn’t feel I had anything to prove. I did a good job there. ‘It is like any football club. When new people come in, if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do. ‘I am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well. ‘But my focus now is Kilmarnock. All I want is the best for them. Hopefully, we can finish the season strongly.’ Privately for Locke, the irony of what’s gone on at Tynecastle over the past year or so won’t be so much painful as excruciating. Locke insists his focus is on Kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the Scottish Premiership . Last season, boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo, he played the kids. Fledglings like Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker featured in sides that were routinely thrashed. Some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but Locke knew what he was doing. To say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement. Supported by a string of more experienced campaigners, those little boys lost have flourished under Neilson’s tutelage. Might it be said that the club which binned Locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks? ‘You probably have to ask people at Hearts,’ he added. ‘I think the young lads certainly learned the hard way. A lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready. ‘I think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them. They have had a fantastic season, they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals. ‘Yes, I’ve been in touch with couple of them. They didn’t thank me and I didn’t want them to. ‘I’m just glad to see them doing very well because I knew they all had fantastic potential. ‘It’s good to see them all fulfilling it.’ A consummate professional all his days, Locke’s dedication to Kilmarnock is now absolute. And yet, when the prospect of returning to Tynecastle next term is put to him, the broad grin on his face says it all. Locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in Edinburgh after working with them last year . ‘It will be strange going back,’ he conceded. ‘I went back as a Kilmarnock player and all I want now is for Kilmarnock to win games. ‘You’ve got to be professional. I was very fortunate in life in that the team I grew up supporting, I managed to play for, captain and manage. ‘There’s not a lot of people who can say that. ‘But my only focus now is Kilmarnock football club. I’m employed here and I want to very best for them.’ Be that as it may, does what happened in Gorgie getting on a year ago still rankle with him? ‘Not at all. It’s football,’ Locke insisted. ‘One of my best mates in the game, Davie Weir, is at Brentford. You see the job he’s done there with Mark Warburton yet they are leaving at the end of the season. Nothing surprises you. ‘It’s a game that’s great to be involved in but it can be tough, as well. I’m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself. You’ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward. Fortunately for me, I got a great opportunity back here and hopefully I can take it.’ That new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest. The 39-year-old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club Hearts next season . Finally, without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners, Locke is relishing the chance to lead the Rugby Park side unhindered. Diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see Kris Boyd assume a playing/coaching role next term but it’s evidently part of Locke’s plans. ‘Obviously I played with Kris, he’s a friend of mine and possibly because I was sitting beside him at Ibrox on Saturday, someone saw me,’ he said. ‘He’s very much a Rangers player and his focus is obviously trying to get Rangers back in the top flight. ‘It’s not for me to speculate on other team’s players as they have a lot of big games ahead. ‘It wouldn’t be right of me to comment on Kris Boyd. I’m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals. ‘If we had a striker contributing that, we might be in the top six. I know Boydy well and I’m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season, he will score goals because that’s what he does.’ The prospect of Boyd returning to Kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the Rugby Park faithful. The striker may have endured a poor season second time around at Rangers but, at 31, still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one. For Locke, too, Rugby Park has largely been a very happy second home. For all his strong Tynecastle links, it was in East Ayrshire that he spent seven years as a player. And, after being cut-adrift by Hearts last summer, it was Killie that offered him a way back into the game. You sense that’s something that will never be forgotten. Locke was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park . ‘I played at Killie for seven years and I know what they are capable of,’ he added. ‘The facilities here are fantastic. I spend a lot of time down here and I see what the club is doing in the local community. ‘There are kids here every single night of the week, which is fantastic to see. Things are really positive. ‘When I played here there were a lot of Celtic and Rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of Killie ones so that’s encouraging in terms of the future. ‘Hopefully, we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great. ‘The club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward.’ GARY LOCKE was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park. Over 700 children from 16 schools are expected to be involved in this year’s programme across East Ayrshire.","Gary Locke was let go by Hearts last season and is now at Kilmarnock .

"George North has been warned he could put his career in jeopardy if he plays again this season after suffering a third confirmed concussion in the space of four months. The Northampton and Wales winger, who sustained two head injuries against England in February but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents, was knocked unconscious again on Friday night in Saints' Aviva Premiership win over Wasps. Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder indicated after the game that the 22-year-old could still be considered for next Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont, but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season. 'George needs to be given an extended rest period to figure out if this is something that he has just not recovered from or whether there are genuine issues,' World Rugby concussion advisor Professor Willie Stewart said. George North was knocked out after colliding with Nathan Hughes' knee during the win over Wasps on Friday . 'I think he personally needs to say, 'No, I'm not playing again this season'. If he does play again too soon it could be the end of his World Cup or even his career. 'The people looking after him, including Northampton and the Welsh Rugby Union, should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out. 'No-one should be talking about playing him next week. That's just ridiculous. I know at this time of year we're getting into the thick of it for trophies and championships but it's also getting into the sharp end for George's brain. 'I would be surprised if he makes another appearance. 'The people who are minding him and looking after his career should be saying to him that in World Cup year, even if he feels 100 per cent better in six weeks, it is not worth risking his chance on the highest stage.' North was immediately knocked unconscious following the contact during Northampton's win over Wasps . The Northampton and Wales winger is treated by medical staff before leaving the field on a stretcher . North missed Wales' win over South Africa last autumn after being concussed against New Zealand and was given three weeks off in February after the outcry over the way his double head knock against England was handled. A Northampton statement read: 'After the game George North was conscious and in the Saints' changing room with the rest of the team. He has been into the club for treatment and will continue to be monitored by the Saints' experienced medical team throughout the weekend. 'As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints places the highest importance on player welfare, and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.' England full back Mike Brown, rested for a month during the Six Nations after being knocked out against Italy on February 14, missed Harlequins' Wembley clash with Saracens after experiencing further concussion-related symptoms in recent days. Earlier this week former Wales international Jonathan Davies said he feared for Leigh Halfpenny's career if the full back did not improve a tackling technique that contributed to him being concussed in his side's final Six Nations win over Italy. The North and Brown cases have again raised questions over rugby's return-to-play protocols, which can permit concussed players to play again within six days if they are shown to be symptom free. In professional boxing, a sport with a concussion rate comparable to professional rugby's, any fighter who loses consciousness for less than a minute faces a mandatory 90 day stand down. A loss of consciousness of more than a minute leads to an enforced 180 day rest period. North was also knocked out twice during Wales' Six Nations defeat by England earlier this year . The winger played on that day but missed the next match as Wales medics were criticised for their decision .","George North has been told not to play again this season after suffering a third concussion in four months against Wasps .

"As Gareth Bale guided a shot past Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano in the 77th minute on Saturday evening, Wales fans could be forgiven for getting a little carried away. Not only with their side's impressive victory - a 3-0 win over the Group B leaders away from home - but with the continuing brilliance of their two-goal talisman. Bale's double in Haifa and assist for Aaron Ramsey sent Chris Coleman's men top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group to give supporters hope of a first appearance at a major finals since 1958. Gareth Bale celebrates scoring his first goal of the game during Wales' 3-0 victory against Israel on Saturday . But as well as strengthening Wales' chances of a trip to France next summer, Bale's performance served to further enhance his reputation as a Dragons legend in the making. After months of criticism in Spain, the Real Madrid forward reminded everyone of his ability with a clever header to set up Ramsey, stunning free-kick to make it 2-0 and powerful finish to kill Israel off. Still only 25, Bale already has more goals (16) than Wales greats John Charles (15) and Ryan Giggs (12). And with a place at the European Championships at stake, the former Tottenham man has the perfect opportunity to surpass both in the hearts of fans, too. Ryan Giggs celebrates during his playing days with Wales team-mates having scored for his country .

They reached the quarter-finals on that occasion, losing narrowly to eventual winners Brazil as Pele grabbed the only goal of the game. Charles, who scored in a group stage draw with Hungary, missed out on the last-eight clash after being injured against the same opponents in a play-off. Bale plays football with a group of children from Arab and Jewish communities in a training session in Haifa . Bale fires homes with a brilliant free-kick as Wales won 3-0 in Israel in the Euro 2016 group B qualifier . But such was his influence on the team that Wales manager Jim Murphy remarked: 'with John Charles in the side we might have won'. It was a view backed up by Charles' former international team-mate Terry Medwin in an interview last year. He told BBC Sport: 'Had he (Charles) been fit enough to play, I'm not saying we would have won, but he was such a great player.' Similarly, it would be hard to imagine where Wales might be without the injection of quality which Bale brings. Former Manchester United favourites Ryan Giggs (right) and David Beckham (left) vie for possession . Bale (centre) leads the celebrations after his second-half free kick put Wales 2-0 up against rivals Israel . John Charles won 38 caps for Wales from 1950-1965, helping them win the 1960 British Home Championship . Would they have beaten Israel without him in the team? Possibly, but there's no chance it would have been as comfortable a victory as we witnessed on Saturday night. Giggs can also claim to be among Wales' finest players, having pulled on the famous red shirt on 64 occasions during his distinguished club career with Manchester United. But he could never quite replicate Charles and drag his country to a major tournament. Giggs, in action for Wales versus Italy, never managed to qualify for a major tournament with his national side .

Charles (centre) rises highest to out-jump England defenders during a World Cup qualifier in Cardiff in 1953 . Wales would have made it to the 1994 World Cup had they beaten Romania in their final qualifier in November, 1993, but they lost 2-1 at Adams Park. And a decade later they missed out on a place at Euro 2004 after losing 1-0 to Russia in a two-legged play-off. Speaking after watching his side go top of their group on Saturday, Wales boss Coleman said: 'We nearly did it in 1994 and 2004 and now we have the opportunity to go a step further. 'People say it's a golden generation but we need to earn it. We're doing it but we've not done it yet. 'We want the chance to prove since 1958 this team is as good as anything that's gone before.'

"George North should be stopped from playing rugby until the World Cup in September after suffering his third bout of concussion in four months. That is the view of former Scotland full back Rory Lamont, who fears for the Wales and Northampton winger’s long-term health after revealing his own battle against depression as a result of multiple head injuries. North was left unconscious in Friday night’s Aviva Premiership fixture against Wasps and Lamont, knocked out 12 times during his career, is convinced the 22-year-old has been ‘let down.' Rory Lamont reveals he battled depression after suffering 12 concussion during his rugby career . The weight of impact required to cause a bout of concussion reduces the more times a player suffers head injuries. Yet there are indications that North could still play against Clermont Auvergne in the Champions Cup quarter-final on Saturday. ‘It’s a complete disgrace that it’s got to this stage,’ Lamont told Sportsmail. ‘George has been let down. That a player can still be exposed to this at the top level is crazy. They’ve tipped him over the edge now because he’s had too many concussions in a short period of time. He should take six months out, but even then he will be increasingly susceptible. ‘I’ve got metal plates in my jaw, cheekbone and eye socket, but it’s the unseen damage that worries me. There are still moments during the day when I can’t remember my best friend’s name. I went through depression, irritability and lack of form after these knocks. George North was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with Nathan Hughes of Wasps . ‘I nearly walked away from the game in 2008 and, if I’d had the same information that’s mainstream today, I probably would have. If the brain is gone, you’re just left with an empty vessel.’ North, who was concussed when playing against the All Blacks in November, remarked that ‘rugby is not tiddlywinks’ after he was knocked out twice against England last month. ‘There’s this standard bravado attitude,’ said 32-year-old Lamont, who believes there is a cultural problem that needs to be addressed. ‘George is right: it’s not tiddlywinks. But this is brain damage we’re talking about and it can lead to early onset dementia. Lamont has been knocked out 12 times and has suffered because of the multiple head injuries . 'Players don’t want to dig in and face up to the dangers. They have committed themselves to this career and they love it — it’s so much fun. There’s a wilful ignorance because you don’t want to accept the thing you love might end up killing you. ‘I know an England international who suffered a few concussions in one season and now, as a result, he suffers panic attacks. But he’s still playing because the thought of stopping is too scary. The money is coming in and he’s hanging out with his mates every day. ‘The players just aren’t educated: a lot of my friends are still playing and their knowledge of the long-term implications is shocking.’ North was unable to continue and Lamont thinks that he should be prevented from playing until the World Cup . North’s latest concussion occurred when he was caught by the knee of Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes, who was shown a red card and will face an RFU disciplinary panel this evening. After the game Northampton issued a statement, saying: ‘North will continue to be monitored by the Saints’ experienced medical team throughout the weekend. ‘As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints place the highest importance on player welfare and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.’ Wales medical manager Prav Mathema has also been in dialogue with Northampton’s doctors over the weekend. There was immediate concern for North after the incident and Hughes was shown a red card for the clash . Any subsequent decisions will be highly scrutinised, with North’s double blow against England becoming one of the most controversial incidents of the RBS Six Nations. The WRU were cleared of any wrongdoing after North was allowed to stay on the field but Lamont, whose countryman Tim Visser signed for Harlequins yesterday, feels the World Rugby body need to take a more pro-active stance. Return-to-play protocols permit players to be available for selection within six days if they are symptom free, while boxers face a mandatory, 90-day stand-down if they lose consciousness for less than a minute. ‘We need to preserve George’s career and life after his career,’ said Lamont. George North suffered concussion against England in the Six Nations but played on for the rest of the match . ‘But I just don’t know if rugby is going to manage him properly. Even if he passes all the assessments, they are far too flawed. There will be great pressure to get him fit for the business end of the season but you’re playing with fire. He needs to be protected from his club and country. Independent experts need to make the decision. ‘Far too much faith is put in the protocols. When a player gets concussed it should be an absolute minimum of 21 days’ rest. There’s no way they should be playing six days later. A bruised leg doesn’t recover in six days and a bruised brain certainly doesn’t. ‘Because we can’t see a bruised brain, people don’t look at it the same way. It’s utter nonsense and business aspects are prioritised above player welfare. There is no room for error.’","Rory Lamont thinks George North shouldn't play rugby until the World Cup .

"When it comes to four-wheel grand prix racing, Britain’s future looks in good hands. Lewis Hamilton is the Formula One world champion, and judging by the form he showed to win the Australian Grand Prix, he looks in good shape to become the first ever British driver to retain his title. But glance towards two-wheel grand prix racing and you will find Britain is still dining off championships and even race wins from the late great Barry Sheene. Britain's Cal Crutchlow will be riding for the LCR Honda team during the 2015 MotoGP season . Crutchlow hopes to hit the front of the MotoGP grid with Honda after a disappointing year with Ducati . MotoGP has arrived in Qatar to kick off the 2015 season on Sunday, and while Britain is looking for its first premier class victory since Sheene triumphed in Sweden in 1981 – its future also looks intriguingly bright. YEAR . 2014 . 2013 . 2012 . 2011 . TEAM . Ducati . Tech3 . Tech3 . Tech3 . PLACING . 13th (74 pts) 5th (188 pts) 7th (151 pts) 12th (70 pts) In fact, the talent coming through is arguably showing greater promise than that seen in F1 right now. Bradley Smith, 24, and Scott Redding, 22, impressed during 2014 and will be targeting podium finishes as a realistic possibility this season. For Cal Crutchlow, he’s been there before – often narrowly missing out on the top step of the podium in 2013. But following a terrible season at Ducati last year, the Coventry born star once again looks in a position where he could sneak on an opportunity to end Britain’s 34-year wait for a premier class race win. In 2015, Crutchlow will be on a Honda bike not too far off the specification ridden by double world champion Marc Marquez, who dominated the 2014 campaign after winning the opening 10 races on his factory Honda. Crutchlow tests his LCR Honda around Malaysia's Sepang circuit during a pre-season test for his new team . The Brit has also been testing at Qatar's Losail circuit - posting impressive lap times . Riding for the satellite LCR Honda outfit, race wins are not expected but they certainly won’t be ruled out. It’s very much the same scenario that Crutchlow was in at Yamaha’s Tech3 team in 2012 and 2013 and one the 29-year-old is aiming to return to. ‘So many guys could get on the podium.’ Crutchlow told Sportsmail. ‘There are 15 guys that are all so close at the moment. ‘I’d like to say my chances of getting on the podium are more than they were last year. If I could get back to where I was in 2013 and 2012, I’d be quite happy because we were competitive enough there when I finished fifth and seventh in the championship. They were good years.’ Crutchlow sounds upbeat. There’s a positive tone to his voice and a calmness to him which suggests he is much happier now than when I spoke to him at Silverstone last August, shortly after his Ducati departure following just one season was confirmed. Ducati was always going to be a tough monster to tame. Even the great Valentino Rossi gave up on the bike following two highly uncompetitive years. Crutchlow reflects that while he has no resentment towards the team, he was constantly on the back foot following a big crash in just his second race on the Desmosedici. 'The Austin crash wrecked the season for me,' Crutchlow added. 'From that point on it was a downward spiral because I was riding injured for a long time but up until Texas I was riding good and was really confident. Cal Crutchlow rides his Ducati around Aragon during practice for last year's grand prix . Crutchlow would on to clinch third behind Aleix Espargaro (left) and race winner Jorge Lorenzo during the Grand Prix at Aragon late in the season which would prove to be his only podium with Ducati . ‘When I crashed at Texas, it was through no fault of my own. It was of the biggest crashes that I’ve ever had when I really hurt my hand but I came back too soon. The other two Ducati riders were riding really well at the time and it was like a double whammy. ‘We came back towards the end of the season and we started to ride very strongly, but I enjoyed my time at Ducati and they look to be doing a great job this year.’ Crutchlow referred to the testing times that saw Andrea Dovizioso top the time sheets in a pre-season Qatar test, but it’s not just the Italian outfit that are on resurgence. Having ridden much of 2014 injured, Crutchlow states that he is going into the new season with no problems and that includes on his unfamiliar Honda where he aims to get more potential out of a bike which has already produced encouraging testing times in Malaysia. ‘I feel good, I feel strong and my physical condition is no problem. But racing a motorcycle is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world and people don’t really realise that. ‘It’s more than twisting the throttle and braking. We have average heart rates of 192-200BPM over 45 minutes. ‘When I was at Yamaha it was different [learning a new bike]. I was coming from World Superbikes and the bike was completely different to anything I knew at all. The second and third years were quite similar to where I am now. Crutchlow has previously mixed with the top guns in MotoGP, finishing second behind Marc Marquez (centre) and Valentino Rossi (right) in the 2013 German Grand Prix at the Sachsenring while with Tech3 Yamaha . Crutchlow claimed four podium finishes with Tech3 Yamaha in 2013 including a second place at Le Mans . Crutchlow lifts the front wheel of his Tech3 Yamaha during a 2013 pre-season test at Jerez . ‘Last year was a little tougher for me to get used to the Ducati, but I was still quite confident even then. ‘I‘ve been happy enough with my testing times, but I haven’t taken advantage enough of the new tyre which I thought I would take. But that’s just the way it is. The Honda you don’t take advantage as much as you would with the other bikes. ‘But learning to ride the bike is more important. It’s been encouraging, the long run I did in Malaysia was ok, and of course I didn’t do the long run in Qatar because of the rain.’ The subject of the British Grand Prix comes up. Considering Silverstone is a venue where Crutchlow’s crashes see him visit the medical centre more than the podium in recent times, even he can admit that the circuit stepping in for the next two years to cover for the lagging Circuit of Wales project is a good thing. Silverstone is the familiar home of the British Grand Prix in Formula One, but the circuit has also stepped in to replace Donington and the Circuit of Wales to host MotoGP for the next two years . ‘It’s good. It should never have left us - not when there is not a circuit to go to. Silverstone have put is so much time and effort to get us there in the first place and they really listened to the riders. ‘Then they said it was going to Donington because the Circuit of Wales was not built and I didn’t think that was right. They might as well have kept it at Silverstone so it’s good to be back there.' So with a British Grand Prix in place (where an impressive 138,000 fans attended over the 2014 weekend) and talent clearly coming through the system – why has Britain struggled so badly to find a premier class winner? With a hint of frustration, Crutchlow states that the money being poured into MotoGP over in Italy and Spain is harming the opportunity for Brits to land top rides. ‘We don’t get the opportunity. There’s been no British riders on factory bikes. The year I was in a factory team, the bike wasn’t capable of winning, we saw that. There’s not been a chance to get on a factory Honda or Yamaha when it’s winning and that’s down to the system I feel. ‘There’s not enough money going to the riders like there is in Italy and Spain, and it’s just endless.’ The 2015 MotoGP season gets underway on 29th March in Qatar, you can watch this race and all the other action throughout the year exclusively live only on BT Sport.

"Looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a George Clooney look, Darren Clarke signed on for his first official engagement as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain. There are 550 days to go before Clarke takes his golfing monument men to Minnesota to try to bring back the trophy — and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the Sofitel at Heathrow’s Terminal Five. No doubt Clarke may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about Rory McIlroy and other pertinent matters, including one surprising comment regarding the Ryder Cup. Darren Clarke will captain Europe at next year's Ryder Cup in Minneapolis . The former Open champion holds aloft the trophy on his first official appointment as captain . After the comprehensive win at Gleneagles last time in 2014, the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but Clarke is considering one small change to the blueprint. He plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two. Of course, there are arguments both ways. He might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right. Even this far out Clarke is unequivocal, however, about who will be the team leader — it just has to be McIlroy. Clarke has known the 25-year-old Ulsterman since before McIlroy was even a teenager. ‘Rory always was special as a kid and a golfer,’ said Clarke. ‘He was different from everyone else and still is.’ Clarke has backed his compatriot Rory McIlroy to complete his grand slam of all four majors . The world No 1 travels to Augusta in a fortnight needing only the Masters to complete his set . The skipper is excited to see how McIlroy fares at the Masters next month but is adamant about one thing: Rory will complete the career Grand Slam one day. ‘If he doesn’t win it this year, he will win it next year,’ he said. ‘He’s just too good not to win it, with all his gifts and on a course made for his game.’ What sort of captain will Clarke be? Given his emotional personality, it is hardly surprising he picks out the Ryder Cup ships run by Ian Woos-nam and Sam Torrance. ‘Sam once said to me that playing in the Ryder Cup is like having your first child, that you really can’t describe it until you’ve gone through it, and that’s always stuck with me,’ he said. ‘I was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win, but for me the pressure of the Ryder Cup was far greater. ‘And I will be a player-friendly captain. Some might think I’m too close to the players but I will not shirk my responsibilities.’ Clarke is keen to foster that community feeling that marked Paul McGinley’s team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations. ‘It was interesting seeing that from the outside at Gleneagles,’ he said. ‘I was working for Sky but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial.’ Players celebrate with former captain Paul McGinley after winning the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles last year . Clarke had a well-publicised falling out with McGinley but, thankfully, both are keen to present a united public front. ‘Of course I will be taking up his offer to talk with him,’ said Clarke. ‘Paul couldn’t have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk. I intend to speak to all the captains. How can that not be a help?’ The first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but Clarke was composed and confident, and enjoyed some light-hearted football banter. After Sir Alex Ferguson’s motivational talk at Glen- eagles, would Clarke the Liverpool fan ask keen golfer Steven Gerrard to speak in Minneapolis, given he will be playing in America by then? ‘After yesterday, what a time to ask me that!’ he said. What price Tiger Woods pulling out of the Masters next week just as he did last year? Whatever happens, it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace. Now down to 96th in the world, Woods is certain next Monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 13, 1996. Tiger Woods is set to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 1996 . ‘I have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym, which is disappointing. I want to stay fit because . . . well, I shall be old one of these days.’ Arnold Palmer holding court as tournament host last week. Now 85, the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters. In the words of the old Bob Dylan song, may he stay forever young. Arnold Palmer (right) presents Matt Every with the trophy after winning the Invitational in Orlando . There is a fine line separating Paul Casey in 49th place in the world rankings from Marc Warren in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference. One is heading to the Masters in a fortnight’s time while the other is not. That could all change, however, following the Valero Texas Open this week. Anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to Augusta and while Warren has secured a prized sponsor’s invitation, Casey has decided to stay at home in Arizona. Paul Casey will be sweating on Marc Warren's performance at the Texas Open to find his Masters fate . What price Scotsman Warren, on a straight-shooter’s course that ought to suit his eye, tipping the Englishman out of the field for the season’s first major? It is to be hoped that both scrape in. Under the ranking system, Casey is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week’s events into account (proceedings at the Trophee Hassan in Morocco on the European Tour could also influence matters). So not just Warren but two other players would have to go past Casey to deny him a Masters outing. As for Warren, anything resembling the tied-17th finish he achieved in his last start at Miami’s Cadillac Championship would do the trick. Among those who could also force their way to Augusta via their efforts in Morocco are Englishmen Andy Sullivan (61st) and Tommy Fleetwood (66th).","Darren Clarke will captain Europe at the Ryder Cup next year .

"The women's world champion, Reanne Evans, has been given a place in the qualifying round's of this year's World Championship, World Snooker has announced. The 29-year-old - the dominant player of the women's game with 10 successive world titles to her name - will head to Sheffield's Ponds Forge in April in a bid to qualify for the main event at the Crucible. Evans will be one of 128 players to bid to join the game's top 16 in the tournament and she will need to win three matches in order to do so. Reanne Evans (left) will be playing for the chance to face the likes of Ronnie O'Sullivan at the crucible . She would become the first women to compete in the World Championship if successful, having become the first woman to qualify for any ranking event last season when she got through to the main stage of the Wuxi Classic in China. A new infrastructure introduced by the sport's governing body means that all players seeded outside the top 16 will join the 128, while invitations have been extended to former world champions no longer on the tour and amateur players. As such, Evans has been invited to qualify, as have former champions Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis, while James Wattana has also been invited. 'So please (sic) to finally be able to say I've been given a place in this years world championship!!! 3 wins and I'll be at the crucible!!! Thanks to all my fans and sponsors,' Evans, a long-time campaigner for the women's game to be given greater prominence, wrote on her Facebook page. Evans will be the first woman to take part in the World Championship if she makes it through qualifying . Commenting on the news, Jason Ferguson, the chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, said: 'Reanne's achievements in the ladies game are incredible - to win 10 world titles in a row in any sport is a phenomenal record. 'She is a true sporting great and proved her ability to compete on the open professional tour when she reached the final stages of the Wuxi Classic in China. 'She deserves the chance to play in the World Championship and she will be aiming to become the first woman ever to play in the main event at the Crucible. Reanne is a trail-blazer for female players around the world.' Were Evans to win even one of her qualifying matches it would carry prize money of £6,000 - a fee comfortably in excess of the tariff on offer for winning the women's World Championship.","Reanne Evans has won the last 10 women's championships in a row .

"An emotional Michael Clarke dedicated Australia’s unprecedented fifth World Cup triumph to his former team-mate and friend Phillip Hughes after his side trounced New Zealand in the final at Melbourne. Clarke – who joins Allan Border, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting (twice) in the pantheon of Australia’s World Cup-winning captains – scored a classy 74 in 72 balls in his final one-day international before quitting the format to focus on Tests. And with Australia overhauling the New Zealanders’ disappointing total of 183 with seven wickets and nearly 17 overs to spare, he went out in style, watched by an MCG crowd of 93,013 – an official world record for a single day’s cricket. Michael Clarke kisses the World Cup after guiding his team to glory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . The Australia side celebrate after defeating New Zealand to be crowned Cricket World Cup champions . Clarke celebrates with his wife Kyly and the trophy in the Australian dressing room . Referring to the black armband he wore in memory of Hughes, who died in November after being struck on the neck by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic game in Sydney, Clarke said: ‘As you can see it's got PH on it. I’ll wear it every game I play for Australia. For everyone in Australian cricket it’s been a tough few months. ‘We played this World Cup with 16 players and this is certainly dedicated to our little brother and team-mate Phillip Hughes. Hughesy used to party as good as any of them, so I’ll make sure we drink two at a time – one for Hughesy and one for us. 'Hughes used to party as good as any of them so I'll make sure we drink two (beers) at a time tonight, one for Hughesy and one for us.' Hughes would have approved of the manner in which Australia crushed their trans-Tasman cousins, even if the neutrals were deprived of the climax which the tournament – if it’s honest with itself – so badly needed. From the moment Mitchell Starc bowled New Zealand’s captain and talisman Brendon McCullum in the game’s first over, a sense of inevitability descended on the MCG like the evening shadows. Here were the pre-tournament favourites doling out a painful lesson to a team taking part in their first World Cup final. The Australian captain receives a kiss from his wife Kyly after winning the World Cup . Kevin Pietersen didn't do his hopes of an England recall any good by posing with James Faulkner . The one-way traffic was held up only during a gutsy fourth-wicket stand of 111 between Ross Taylor and Grant Elliott, New Zealand’s hero during their semi-final thriller against South Africa. But James Faulkner, named man of the match for figures of 3 for 36, removed Taylor and the big-hitting Corey Anderson in the first over of the batting powerplay, and wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi fell in the next, to the outstanding Starc. Elliott went on to make 83, but New Zealand’s last seven fell for just 33 in 10 overs. After eight successive games on their smaller, less intimidating, home grounds, they never came to terms with either the occasion or the relentlessness of the Australian attack. The dismissal of Martin Guptill, who had hammered West Indies for an unbeaten 237 from 163 balls in the quarter-finals, summed up their day: trying to dab a gentle off-break from Glenn Maxwell through backward point, he was bowled for 15. Australia lost Aaron Finch to Trent Boult in the second over of the reply, but for New Zealand’s bowlers that was as good as it got. David Warner hit 45 in 46 balls, before Clarke joined Steve Smith – his heir apparent – to add 112. After carting Tim Southee for four successive fours, Clarke chopped on against Matt Henry with nine runs still needed, but Smith was there at the end, a fifth successive half-century in his increasingly irresistible bag. Clarke received a standing ovation as he left the field having been dismissed in his final one-day international . The Australian captain scored 74 from 72 deliveries to anchor his team's chase of 184 . Clarke said: 'We're really proud, it's a wonderful achievement. It's a great thing just to make a World Cup final, but to be able to win in your own back yard in front of your family and friends is extremely special and I guarantee we'll celebrate hard tonight. 'Obviously I'm over the moon. What a tournament. 'The New Zealand team deserve a lot of credit . They're always a tough team to beat it seems in any sporting event. Australia v New Zealand is always an exciting contest and tonight was no different.' 'It's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country in both Test and one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. 'The time is right for me to walk away from one-day cricket, but I'll keep playing Test cricket.' Clarke poses with the World Cup trophy after Australia's fourth success in the last five editions . Clarke dedicated the victory to Phillip Hughes, who died after being hit on the side of the head by a bouncer . As Australia prepared to celebrate into the night and beyond, it was left to McCullum to confirm his status as one of the World Cup’s most impressive characters. He said: 'It's been one hell of a ride for us right the way through. I think we've played some outstanding cricket and we ran into an outstanding Australia team tonight who continue to set the way in international cricket and full credit to them, they deserve to be champions. 'Michael Clarke as well, he deserves to bow out a World Cup-winning champion too. They were outstanding in this World Cup and thoroughly deserved to win. 'We were the second-best team on the day and all credit to Australia.' McCullum took time to reflect on the tournament as a whole and said he was 'proud' of his team's performances as they became the first New Zealand side to reach a World Cup final. He added: 'We've forged some memories and friendships that will last forever. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum admitted his side were second best on the day . 'Obviously we're not able to lift the trophy but the brand of cricket and the entertainment that we've been able to give people throughout our country and throughout the world is something we're immensely proud of. 'We have no regrets and we walk away from this tournament with our heads held high. 'It's the greatest time of your life to be able to represent your country on the international stage with a group of friends and then put your skills against the world's best - it is the greatest time of our lives and that's how we tried to play the game, play with a free spirit and plenty of heart all the way along. 'It's taken us so far in this tournament but we weren't obviously able to get over the final hurdle, but it's something that I'm immensely proud of, all the guys in the team, all the management group and all those that have been part of this team over the last few years and helped build us into what we are. 'We've still got some work to do but we can be very proud of our achievements in this tournament.'","Australia win Cricket World Cup after beating New Zealand in final .

Peregrine Church has developed art that will make people's rainy days feel a whole lot better . He claims that he was intrigued by the numerous viral videos that featured the miracle substance and believed he could create interesting patterns with light and dark contrasts on pavements. Travelling around the streets of his native Seattle, Peregrine sprays through stencils to create motivational messages – that are initially invisible – on the ground. Demonstrating his work in the video, the artist throws a bucket of water onto a piece of inconspicuous pavement and from nowhere a hopscotch appears on the floor.

"Seven points. All that separates Premier League leaders Chelsea and third-placed Arsenal, two sides who, up until the last couple of months, were deemed to be having wildly contrasting seasons. How times change. The Gunners are on a hot streak and the champions-in-waiting are stuttering, having drawn their last two league games at fortress Stamford Bridge.

Hull (away) - May 2 . Swansea (home) - May 9 . Man United (away) - May 16 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . *Due to FA Cup . That leaves Arsene Wenger's side as the biggest threat to Chelsea, something which seemed almost unthinkable come the final hours of New Year's Day. Arsenal fell to sixth on January 1 after a woeful 2-0 defeat by fellow Champions League chasers Southampton, a result best remembered for two Wojciech Szczesny howlers. But, with summer signing David Ospina establishing himself as the club's No 1, the Gunners have been on an upward trajectory ever since. Arsenal overcame a 12-point deficit to beat Manchester United to the Premier League table in May 1998 . The Gunners secured the 1997-98 title with a 4-0 win over Everton at Highbury, lifting the title that day . VIDEO Arsenal still not in title race - Wenger . One league defeat - albeit to north London rivals Tottenham - is the only blot on their record since that forgettable day at St Mary's, while a return of 24 points from a possible 27 is the best in the division. Saturday's comfortable 3-0 win against West Ham was Arsenal's eighth consecutive victory at home, a feat they last achieved at Highbury in 2005. And that run, combined with Chelsea's lacklustre 1-1 draw with Southampton on Sunday, left Jose Mourinho admitting that the north Londoners can be considered title challengers. 'Of course Arsenal are in it,' he said. 'They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. The only defeat in Arsenal's last nine league games came against Tottenham; they've won the other eight . Jose Mourinho (right) has a lot of history with Wenger, and he still believes Arsenal have a chance . 'Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? 'So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.' Mourinho is a master of mind games and may well have been attempting to pile pressure on Olivier Giroud and Co ahead of a crucial nine-match run-in. But the fact remains that Arsenal - and Wenger in particular - have history when it comes to late title charges. Just cast your mind back to March 1998. Arsenal trained on Monday in preparation for their Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday . Arsenal lost the first leg 3-1, and will be focused solely on the Premier League if they get knocked out . The Gunners were 12 points behind Manchester United and had three games in hand with a little over two months of the season remaining but went on a magnificent 10-match winning run to wrap up the title with two games to spare. The task this time around is undoubtedly more difficult, particularly given Chelsea's extra game, but Arsenal's superb home form and some favourable fixtures should at least offer fans some hope. As well as having an opportunity to claw back three points against the leaders at the Emirates on April 26, they also have games against struggling Newcastle, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland to look forward to. Ian Wright (left) plants a kiss on the cheek of Arsenal captain Tony Adams after winning the 97-98 title . Marc Overmars scored twice against Everton to help Arsenal to the title in 98... but can they do it this season? A home clash with in-form Liverpool next month and a trip to Manchester United in the season's penultimate fixture will be tough, although last week's FA Cup win at Old Trafford should fill Wenger's squad with confidence. Chelsea also have some games they will relish but the visits of United and Liverpool to Stamford Bridge at least offer potential for Mourinho's men to drop points. It will need to be some slip-up for Arsenal to take advantage like they did 17 years ago but Wenger's men - who could well be free of Champions League football this week - should not be discounted. It might not be the title race we expected two-and-a-half months ago but Chelsea cannot breathe easy just yet.","Arsenal are seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea .

But Di Canio came out in support of his successor, claiming that billionaire American Short is responsible for Sunderland’s current plight. ‘It’s not Poyet’s fault because chairman Ellis Short is the real origin of all these troubles,’ Di Canio told Fox Sports. ‘I saved Sunderland when the club was sinking, along with my staff. I completed a true miracle, on and off the pitch. ‘We tried to change the philosophy of the team. In the two previous years, no fines were given, despite players getting drunk and partying until late, even a few days before a match. ‘I was giving fines even for (players being) five minutes late. ‘It’s fundamental, to keep order in the dressing room. I took all the responsibilities, but my project was immediately cut off. ‘It was a choice which came from above. When I was the manager, two directors chose 16 players. ‘None of them are still at the club - neither the players, nor those directors.'

However, Di Canio believes Poyet should have done more to deal with ill-discipline in the squad and says supporters would never have streamed for the exits under his charge, as they did during the weekend loss to Villa. ‘I don’t want to blame Poyet, but if you’re afraid to fine one of your players, then you have to expect some troubles,' he added. 'This team is just looking for three worse teams to leave behind. 'When I was their manager, it never happened to see the supporters leaving the stadium before the final whistle. 'This never happened because we always played with dignity, regardless of the bad results. I don't know what's happening now, but it looks like the team is drifting.

"When Cristiano Ronaldo started the year with a Ballon d'Or award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis. But since his 'Siiii!' war cry in Zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an 'I'm coming for you' message to Lionel Messi, the Real Madrid forward's fortunes have been in free-fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to Manchester United has been opened once again. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for Real Madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player's entourage celebrated his well-deserved gong in January. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo sits on the Bernabeu pitch during his side's 2-0 win against Levante . The former Manchester United man endured a frustrating evening despite his side's La Liga victory . Ronaldo has a shot at goal on Sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net . But since then he has been sent off and banned for two games; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by Atletico Madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team's defeat in the Champions League to Schalke. Manchester United have been linked with both a bold move for Gareth Bale or a romantic return for Ronaldo. Sources in Madrid now say of the two moves, it would be a bid for Ronaldo that would meet with less resistance. For all the boos and whistles for Gareth Bale from sections of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd the club president Florentino Perez is firmly behind his £86million signing and sees him as Ronaldo's heir apparent. Ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former Tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year's Ballon d'Or podium. The request was not received with open arms. Much like Bale when he scored twice on Sunday against Levante. Gareth Bale celebrates after opening the scoring but Ronaldo appeared frustrated that he hadn't found the net . Ronaldo celebrates winning the Premier League title with Manchester United shortly before leaving in 2009 . A return to Old Trafford is not out of the question for the Portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 . Real Madrid trio Ronaldo, Bale and Karim Benzema share an embrace after the Welshman's second goal . Bale, pictured with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, is seen as the heir to Ronaldo by Florentino Perez . Ronaldo failed to celebrate his team-mate's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six-yard area. Like the incredible sulk of old, Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.' He was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. And with those two goals for Bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game, including one sitter in injury-time and a weak shot from a perfect Bale cross in the first half, Ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not to the centre circle to applaud supporters. Ronaldo split up with his long-term girlfriend, Russian model and actress Irina Shayk, in January . Ronaldo's form has dipped since his split and Lionel Messi now has more goals than him this season . Irina accompanied Ronaldo to the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in January 2014 but she was absent this year . Off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from Russian girlfriend Irina Shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of Spain's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be. All this with the Clasico on the horizon – a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than Messi who now has two more than his rival. Last year Ronaldo raced to a 12-goal lead over Messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager Luis Enrique. Messi's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year. Things change so quickly in Spanish football and Ronaldo's last three months are evidence of that. What also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the Bernabeu Ronaldo could yet find time in his record-breaking career to go back to Old Trafford for a glorious swansong.

"When number seven for Steven Gerrard's side walked onto the hallowed Anfield turf once again, a roar was heard from all sides of the stadium, as fans welcomed the return of the brilliant, exciting and unpredictable maverick that is Luis Suarez. The Liverpool fan favourite got tongues wagging after refusing to rule out a return in the future, while disappointing the likes of Manchester City after revealing that he would only ever play for the Merseyside club. Speaking to Liverpool TV he said: 'You never know in football what the future holds but if I ever play in England again, I will play for the Liverpool team and not another team. Luis Suarez took to Twitter and posted this photo of himself and Steven Gerrard after the game . Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez share a joke at the end of the Liverpool All-Star charity game . The Barcelona striker and Fernando Torres come on as substitutes and made their return to Anfield . It was no surprise to see Suarez receive such a welcoming from the Reds faithful after a unforgettable three-and-a-half-year spell with the club. And while he is forging his own reputation in Barcelona now, he still fondly remembers his spell in England. 'I've missed the fans,' added Suarez, who scored the winner in El Clasico against Real Madrid seven days ago. Suarez and Gerrard thank the officials who took charge of the All-Star game at Anfield . 'The atmosphere is unbelievable, it's amazing. Everyone who's played for Liverpool knows how important the supporters are. They know they are in my heart.' Suarez was also delighted to back alongside his friend and former team-mate Steven Gerrard and holds the midfielder in the highest regard. Suarez was quick to praise the Liverpool captain and tweeted a picture of the duo captioned: 'Unbelievable to be back at Anfield and surrounded by great players... Here a picture with the greatest one!!' Suarez in action at the Kop end where he was greeted with deafening cheers after coming off the bench . Liverpool fans loved to see the attacking trio of Torres, Suarez and Gerrard playing at Anfield again . Jamie Carragher was captain of the other side and he pleased to see the Barcelona star back at Anfield, albeit on the opposition side. He posted: 'Great to see Luis back at Anfield today I gave as good as I got but he nutmegged me obviously!'

"Arsenal legend Thierry Henry gave fans at Anfield a glimpse of his very, very best after nailing a cheeky pass to Ryan Babel during an All-Stars game between a Steven Gerrard XI and a Jamie Carragher XI. The former Arsenal man hung up his boots in December, but there was no sign of rustiness as the 37-year-old former France international pulled off the audacious move. Henry, who had been playing for MLS side New York Red Bulls before calling it a day, looked set to pull the trigger after picking up the ball on the edge of the box, only to dummy a shot with his right and play a pass with his left. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry looks set to go for goal as he picks up the ball on his right foot just outside the box during the game . But the former France international fools everybody has he dummies the shot and passes with his left foot to find Ryan Babel in space . A confused defender backs away as Henry's trickery gets the better of him in front of the Anfield support as he plays Babel through . The ball falls to  Babel who sadly drags his effort wide of goal as fans at the All-Stars game applaud Henry's trickery at Anfield on Sunday . Henry (second left) shares a joke with Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva at Anfield, as the two teams make their way from the pitch . Babel was the man to benefit from the pass as it rolled perfectly to his feet, but the Dutchman dragged his effort wide in a manner Liverpool fans had become fully accustomed to during his time on Merseyside. The first goal of the game had been scored by Mario Balotelli and a cracker it was too, the Italian whipping a 25-yard drive that fizzed into the corner of The Kop net on nine minutes. He wasn’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class. At one stage it looked as if Carragher’s side, managed by Roy Evans, would saunter to victory but Gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his Liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat. Henry (right), who played for Steven Gerrard's team in the charity match, shakes hands with his Sky Sports colleague Jamie Carragher . Balotelli opened the scoring at Anfield after slamming in a long-range shot into the corner of the goal as Steven Gerrard looked on . Drogba added a second goal to put Jamie Carragher's side 2-0 up at Anfield after rounding the keeper and slotting into an empty net . Pepe Reina does his best to stop Gerrard from scoring from the spot after a penalty was awarded to the Liverpool captain's side . A second penalty of the afternoon followed for Gerrard and he duly converted that one too to level the scores at Anfield Stadium . He scored two penalties, one in the 36th minute after Martin Kelly had adjudged to trip Jerome Sinclair and another just after the hour when Carragher quite clearly barged Luis Suarez over. Some would say the Sportsmail columnist was lucky not to make it into Lee Probert’s book. The icing on the cake would have been a goal for either Torres or Suarez but, despite the best efforts of the Uruguayan in particular, it never arrived. No matter. A draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day. The smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that. The famous Anfield scoreboard shows the names of two of the stadium's most famous players after their two teams played out a 2-2 draw . Suarez, Torres, Garcia, Xabi Alonso, Gerrard, Dirk Kuyt and Alvaro Arbeloa  gather for a photo together after the full-time whistle . Balotelli posted this photo after the game captioned: 'LEGENDS. Always nice to see you guys, @didierdrogba you are welcome for my pass . Drogba, Torres and Terry pose together as they caught up on their days at Chelsea together in the Anfield dressing rooms after the game . Afterwards Gerrard told LFC TV: 'It has been absolute brilliant, more than anything the charities have done well with a full house. 'The hairs on my neck were standing up. There were times I didn't know who to pass to. People have gone out of their way to come here. 'It has been absolutely magical. Every player who was asked to come here did, whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights.'

"Oh be still my beating heart. Here we are, standing on the gravel outside the library doors at Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series, Downton Abbey. We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey’s Cora, in front of Highclere . ‘Well, that wasn’t my favourite scene!’ cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton’s Cora, who’s Countess of Grantham. ‘The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.’ Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying £20 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. ‘Yes. It’s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,’ she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. ‘I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.’ And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. ‘You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,’ she will say. As Carson the butler (‘Oh, I adore him, he is divine’) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. ‘My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.’ Has she seen the pictures? ‘No and I don’t want to, because I don’t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is having a conversation, not taking snaps. I have never knowingly taken a selfie, I am useless at photography. I am just . . . different, I suppose.’ The Countess of Carnarvon is the equivalent of Downton’s Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern . To whizz down the mile-long drive to Highclere Castle is to travel back in time to a more gracious age. The stately home made famous by Downton has been the ancestral seat of the Earls of Carnarvon since 1679. Flanked by elegant pines planted from seed three centuries ago, the house sits in a rolling landscape designed by Capability Brown. To look upon the soaring architecture of Highclere is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old English upper classes, who once thought that life behind these ramparts of Bath stone, surrounded by Reynolds, Van Dycks and walls covered in green French silk, would go on for ever. Yet even the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Lord and Lady Grantham in the fictional series is far removed from the realities of today. My dears, in the real Downton, the current chatelaine doesn’t even have a lady’s maid. ‘Certainly not!’ she says. ‘And sadly not, because I would absolutely love one.’ In this house, with more than 300 rooms and ‘about 80’ bedrooms, the servants’ bellboard is still there outside the kitchen, just as it was over 100 years ago. But now, instead of tinkling bells, estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie-talkie her ladyship carries in her hand. Here, amid her six dogs, her horses, her staff and her husband, Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme. She was Fiona Aitken before she married Geordie Herbert, the Queen’s godson and soon to be eighth Earl of Carnarvon, 16 years ago. Fiona was a foxy blonde and arch Sloane Ranger. The eldest of six sisters, she was raised in Fulham, West London, and is a trained accountant who once designed and sold crushed velvet evening wraps to other Sloanes. Only two years after they married, she and Geordie took over Highclere when the seventh Earl died. ‘Then you understand that you marry the man and the house,’ she says today. While her husband runs the estate, the jolly, sporty 52-year-old has become the face and force of the real Downton, in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular TV show. In this, she has been enormously successful, writing two best-selling books about previous Carnarvon wives; Almina and Catherine. Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme, much like Dame Maggie's Dowager Countess of Grantham . She also gives talks all over the world. In Texas next month, the socialite Lynn Wyatt is hosting a champagne Highclere Tea where Texan fans of Downton can meet the countess over cake, all for the price of a £440 ticket. She is quite the draw, happy to take on the ambassadorial role while her husband stays in the background. Right on cue, Lord Carnarvon appears in his Dad jeans and trainers, coffee mug in hand. Seeing that the morning room where we are talking is occupied, he quietly reverses out the door, like a dog in a Crufts obedience trial. ‘He is very shy,’ his wife explains. No one, least of all the couple themselves, imagined that Downton Abbey would be so successful. Now screened in more than 100 countries, it brings Americans and Chinese visitors here in droves. ‘Who would have thought an Edwardian drama beginning in 1912 would have such huge appeal?’ she wonders. Who indeed, but shooting began this week on the sixth Downton series. ‘I am sure they would like to go on making more series,’ she says. ITV director Peter Fincham has told her that he wants Downton to go on for 18 years. ‘That made me gulp.’ The money that flows into the Highclere coffers as a result of the series must surely, however, cushion the blow of domestic disruption. After all, before Downton hit our screens, the Carnarvons admitted that their estate needed £11.75 million of repairs, including £1.8 million of urgent work on the main house. Although the family will not say how much money they get for the rental of the castle for filming, Lord Carnarvon has since said the show had ‘taken the pressure off’ them financially. There is also talk of a Hollywood film, which Lady C does not deny. ‘I try not to lie awake at night worrying about money,’ she says. ‘Obviously, like everyone else, I have a sense of complete panic every so often. I am not in a position where I have so much money I worry about what to do with it.’ On sleepless nights, she roams the Highclere corridors, and likes to sleep in her son’s bed when he is at boarding school. She soothes herself by listening to the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4, feeling grateful that she is not ‘alone in a boat on the ocean’. Lady Carnarvon first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of World War I poetry. Her former lover, an eccentric cove called Sir Benjy Slade, had sued her for the return of a pet labrador and claimed she was ‘the ruthless golddigger of the year’. Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire, provides the ravishing setting for Downton Abbey . It’s far more likely that the Carnarvons were two slightly broken people who made each other complete. He had recently separated from his first wife and two young children; she was grieving over the early death of both her parents. They married in February 1999 and had their son Edward in October; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life. It is to her credit that she does all her work on Highclere in the full knowledge that it is her husband‘s son, not hers, who will inherit the Carnarvon title and all the lands. Edward gets nothing, but that does not bother her. ‘I am not worried. If I make some money from books, that is his. In life it is not what you take, it is what you give that matters most.’ She and Geordie appear to have a healthy working partnership, one that she describes as ‘50/50 with a one per cent swing either way.’ They eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day and never get tired of each other. Heaven for them is supper on a tray in front of the television. Her transition from confident and capable young woman to countess is fascinating. ‘I would hate to be considered snobbish,’ she says, although she learned, in the upper class way, to use charm as a weapon to get what she wants. ‘You could walk into somewhere like Highclere and just stand like a petrified creature in the headlights, doing nothing. Or you could take it one step at a time. It is the end, not the journey, that matters.’ A journey that sometimes takes in some aggravating neighbours along the way. ‘I am a woman,’ she says, ‘who knows which battles to fight.’",The Countess of Carnarvon is the real-life equivalent of Downton’s Cora .
"Monaco have stepped up preparations for their all-important Champions League second leg clash against Arsenal by training in La Turbie.

Meanwhile, Carvalho has warned his team-mates that Arsenal are capable of clawing back what is essentially a three-goal deficit. The Ligue 1 outfit head into their second leg against Arsenal knowing their opponents have to score at least three goals at the Stade Louis II to have any chance of progressing to the next round of the Champions League. However Carvalho believes his side must be extremely wary of the threat posed by Arsene Wenger's side. The former Chelsea defender, speaking to Perform, said: 'I don't know [if Arsenal underestimated Monaco]. I don't think so. 'Sometimes that happens in football. Of course, for most people it was a surprise. 'Arsenal are a great team, but sometimes in football, it's true that it can happen.

"Michael Owen failed to get his hands on silverware at a World Cup when playing for England but Brown Panther, a horse he both bred and co-owns, ensured he came away from Saturday's Dubai World Cup meeting with a trophy. The seven-year-old, trained by Tom Dascombe at Owen’s Manor House Stable in Cheshire and ridden by Richard Kingscote, was always close to the pace in the two-mile Dubai Gold Cup and quickened to beat Star Empire by a decisive three and a half lengths. The victory, the 11th of Brown Panther’s career, secured a first prize of £384,000, by far the biggest Owen has ever won in his racing venture. Brown Panther had a convincing victory for co-owner Michael Owen at the Dubai Gold Cup . Former England striker Owen watches on at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday in Dubai . Owen, who won the 2014 Irish St Leger with Brown Panther, said: ‘He is the horse of a lifetime and a superstar in my eyes. That was a tough race – two miles in this heat and he kept on galloping like he did in the final furlong. ‘He is a talented horse but has great courage. I am very proud of him.’ The success was also rewarding for Kingscote. He has had a race against time to get fit after suffering a broken collar bone, snapped arm, broke wrist and elbow plus punctured lungs in a fall. There was a second win on the Meydan card for Europe when Sole Power, trained in Ireland by Eddie Lynam and ridden by Richard Hughes, landed the Al Quoz Sprint. While British jockey William Buick landed the $10m World Cup on Saeed Bin Suroor-trained 14-1 shot Prince Bishop, who beat 2014 Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome. The success for an eight-year-old who has never won at group one level in Europe and was running in his fourth World Cup was another surprise result in the race. It again showed the Dubai World Cup may be the richest race on the globe but it is of questionable quality. Another former England striker Peter Crouch was also in Dubai with his wife Abbey Clancy . Owen is pictured being questioned by the media after victory for his horse Brown Panther . Meanwhile, owner Marwan Koukash continued his good run of sporting form when 12-1 shot Gabrial, trained by Richard Fahey and 22nd winner of the year for jockey Tony Hamilton, landed the Betway Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster. It was a second win in four years for Gabrial’s team, having landed the 2012 Lincoln with Brae Hill. Flamboyant Koukash is the owner of Super League team Salford Red Devils, who have risen to sixth in the table after a run of three wins in their last five games. Gabrial, who had been unplaced on the Dubai World Cup card 12 months ago, had also run over middle distances last year as Koukash harboured hopes he may become a Melbourne Cup contender. But he showed slick turn of foot over the mile of the Lincoln to beat Mondialiste a neck. Owen and trainer Tom Dascombe pose with Brown Panther after winning the race . Owen is pictured with his family at the Meydan Racecourse after his victory . Fahey said: They raced in a very tight pack and I wasn't sure he was going to get out in time. ""That's the first time I've ever seen him really pin his ears back and have a real go as he's a bit of a character. Tony said he always felt like he was going to win. ‘The only reason he was running over further last year was because after Mount Athos got injured.

"Arsenal are awaiting clarification regarding Petr Cech's future before moving for the Chelsea goalkeeper. The Czech Republic international is set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the club now prepared to part with the keeper - but only for £10million or above. Given Arsenal and Chelsea's rivalry, a move to the Emirates Stadium for Cech would be hard to broker. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer . Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has started only four Premier League games this season . And the Gunners want to ensure they have a realistic chance of landing Cech before launching a move, with Chelsea likely to be reluctant to sell to a direct rival. Cech revealed last week that he does not want to spend another season as understudy to first-choice keeper Thiabut Courtois at Stamford Bridge. The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions. Cech revealed last week that he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Thiabut Courtois . 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this.' Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he stared ahead of Courtios for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. 'There always will be speculation, I leave it for the summer,' added Cech. 'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.'","Arsenal awaiting clarification regarding Chelsea's goalkeeper's future .

"In five weeks time Las Vegas will pay host to the biggest boxing match in history when Floyd Mayweatehr Jnr and Manny Pacquiao roll into town for their $300million mega fight. It is an evening Amir Khan desperately wanted to be involved in after repeatedly calling for Mayweather to take him up on his challenge to dethrone the undefeated American. It hasn't kept the Bolton-born boxer away from the bright lights of Vegas, however, as he was pictured at 1 Oak Nightclub in the Mirage Hotel and Casino on Friday night. Amir Khan poses with TV personality Scott Disick during night out in Las Vegas . Khan's wife Faryal Makhdoom uploaded this picture montage from the night out at 1 Oak Nightclub .

Khan, who has yet to agree his next opponent after missing out on securing a bout with Mayweather, believes the American will emerge victorious against Pacquiao on May 2. Khan told Sky Sports News: 'It's going to be a great fight and I think five years ago it would have been ever better because they were both at their peak and it was a fight that everyone was dying to see. Khan trains in the gym as speculation continues over who his next opponent will be . Khan hits Devon Alexander during their welterweight bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena last year . 'Since then Manny Pacquiao has had two defeats. He’s been knocked out once by (Juan Manuel) Marquez and then he got beat by (Timothy) Bradley which was a little controversial, but I think Mayweather will take the fight. 'He will be much smarter and he’ll pick his shots a little bit better. He’ll make it a little boring at times because Manny, as we know, is a come-forward fighter who likes to do a lot of punches. 'But Mayweather will try to avoid all those punches and just maybe throw that one shot that will count and then move away again. But time will tell. 'I’ve been watching Mayweather train on social media and he has been training very hard so he might come up with a different gameplan this fight, something that we have not seen before.","Amir Khan was pictured in 1 Oak Nightclub in Las Vegas on Friday night .

"ITV’S sporting shake-up continued with Jacqui Oatley brought in as a major player in their football coverage next season. Oatley, who was the first female commentator on BBC’s Match of the Day in 2007, has stepped across to take a major position within ITV 4, where she will anchor football programmes during the 2015-16 season. The highly respected broadcaster will also present ITV’s darts coverage, starting with the PDC European Championship in Belgium at the end of October. Jacqui Oatley has been signed up by ITV and will host football coverage from the start of next season . Oatley has previously worked for the BBC, and was the first female commentator on Match of the Day . The move continues ITV’s major shake-up, which has so far seen Adrian Chiles’ axed earlier this year and replaced by BBC Radio 5Live’s Mark Pougatch. Chiles had led ITV’s Champions League and England coverage, as well as last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. Long-standing pundit Andy Townsend has also been told his contract will not be renewed when it expires in the summer, along with Matt Smith, whose position as the broadcaster’s secondary football reporter has been taken by Oatley. Niall Sloane, ITV Director of Sport, said yesterday: ‘Jacqui’s outstanding knowledge and experience make her a first class addition to the ITV Sport team. We look forward to welcoming her on board in September.’ Oatley, who has previously presented football programmes on ITV, including the FA Cup and Africa Cup of Nations, added: ‘I'm delighted to have been asked to join the ITV team from next season. ‘I've had a fantastic time working with them over the last couple of years and look forward to continuing that relationship at major tournaments.’ Oatley added that her new role will not see her cut ties with the BBC, where she has also fronted the Football League Show and covered snooker, golf, motor racing and the Olympic Games. Oatley tweeted: ‘I’m not leaving the Beeb as such. Still hosting the WWC [women’s World Cup] coverage in summer and match reporting, etc next season. Love covering live games.’ Having lost live Champions League and Europa League football from next season, ITV’s only live football beyond outside major tournaments will be England’s international fixtures and other European qualifiers. However, they will show highlights of both UEFA club competitions next seasons.","Jacqui Oatley is to join ITV's football coverage from next season .

"When Liverpool slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in November, the obituaries were penned mourning the loss of the team who had thrilled so much in their pursuit of last season’s title. Here they were; losers in their last four matches, sandwiched between West Brom and Stoke in the bottom half of the table and just four points from the drop zone. Indeed, Sportsmail noted: ‘As a gauge for Brendan Rodgers to measure Liverpool's regression it might be quite accurate. No better at the back than they were six months ago, much worse up front and utterly devoid of belief’. Brendan Rodgers (right, jokes with Emre Can) at Liverpool training at Melwood last week . Rodgers was in good spirits as he also shared a joke with defender Kolo Toure . Steven Gerrard trains with team-mates Joe Allen (left) and Glen Johnson (centre) Liverpool have not lost in their last 12 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) It was, of course, a reference to Liverpool’s surrender of a three-goal lead at Selhurst Park during the final weeks of the previous campaign. Six months on and, minus Luis Suarez, the assumption was that Rodgers and his team had been found out. Then came a 1-0 win at home to Stoke – achieved thanks to a Glen Johnson strike five minutes from time – and so started a run of 11 victories in 16 games. Another at Swansea on Monday evening would see them move back to within two points of Manchester United in fourth. Given their lowly residence in November, Rodgers arguably deserves more credit this time around than he did for last season’s unlikely title tilt. The return to fitness of Daniel Sturridge was always going to aid his cause and that has been evidenced by three goals and six league games without defeat with the striker back on the pitch. The unbeaten run, in fact, extends to 12 matches and is just two shy of last season’s best sequence set by Chelsea. Daniel Sturridge and Alberto Moreno (right) celebrate after scoring against Crystal Palace in February . Sturridge, injured on England duty before the start of season, has had a stop-start season in 2014 . But the revival was in place before Sturridge vacated the treatment room. A change of formation in December, 3-4-2-1 put in place, has, almost to a man, brought about an impressive improvement. There is no finer example than Jordan Henderson. The midfielder was never struggling but, since Christmas, he has matured into the leader everyone at Anfield was hoping he would become. There was one game at former club Sunderland which marked his emergence as successor to Steven Gerrard. When the skipper made way at half-time, Henderson took the armband and proceeded to boss the contest from the centre of the park – it was an awesome display and one which won warm praise from Rodgers afterwards. Jordan Henderson has thrived for Liverpool this season and stepped up in Gerrard's absence . Luis Suarez (left) departed Liverpool for Barcelona during the summer in a £75million deal . The boss, though, should be applauded for the manner in which he is aiding the development of a player who is still just 24. The future captaincy is an incentive smartly employed to take Henderson’s game to another level – and it has worked. But there are others, too. Raheem Sterling is unrecognisable from the troubled teen as which he has previously been cast. Rodgers has found a way to extract craft and graft from Sterling and playmaker Philippe Coutinho, a pair who are certain to feature on the shortlist for PFA Young Player of the Year. He has also kept faith with goalkeeper Simon Mignolet – derided earlier in the season – while Dejan Lovren – another mocked following his £20m arrival from Southampton – has returned to a three-man backline which has kept four clean sheets in six. Steven Gerrard's slip at Anfield against Chelsea last year proved costly and allowed Demba Ba to score . Ba slots the ball past Simon Mingolet as Chelsea win 2-0 and end Liverpool's title hopes . VIDEO Every game counts for Rodgers . In short, Rodgers is getting the best out of each of his number – unmanageable Mario apart, that is. But sideshows such as Balotelli and Gerrard’s impending departure have not been allowed to derail their recovery. A penalty-shootout exit from the Europa League could prove a blessing as Liverpool chase a Champions League finish. They have 10 games to achieve as much and Rodgers has factored a return of 23 points as being enough. Were they to achieve that, Rodgers would certainly have proved a point of his own. CHELSEA .

Tyson and Holyfield, of course, twice met in the ring and have rebuilt their relationship since their controversial rematch in 1997 when Tyson took a chunk out of his opponent's ear. Both are long retired but 50-year-old Hopkins has yet to announce whether he plans to continue after losing to hard-hitting Russian Sergey Kovalev last November. Tyson pretends to take a chunk out of the director's ear while Holyfield poses at a previous event . Tyson bites a chunk out of Holyfield's ear in their heavyweight rematch in 1997 . Tyson, meanwhile, has admitted that UFC champion Ronda Rousey might 'kick his ass'. Rousey defended her bantamweight title last month when she submitted Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds. 'S***, Ronda Rousey might kick my ass,' Tyson told the Huffington Post. 'That 14 seconds the last fight, s*** man, you got to take that seriously. 'She's marketed herself, and not necessarily from a publicist's perspective. She put in the work, too. She's putting these people to bed, she's tapping them out, she's doing the 14-second thing.'","Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield were at the screening of Champs .

"Javier Mascherano has admitted Barcelona had trouble 'behind the scenes' at the start of the year. Barcelona's first game in 2015 ended in a 1-0 defeat against David Moyes's Real Sociedad with Lionel Messi starting on the bench following a reported disagreement with Luis Enrique in training. But Barca are currently top La Liga after their win over Real Madrid on Sunday and Mascherano feels they are back to their best. Javier Mascherano has admitted Barcelona had trouble 'behind the scenes' at the start of the year . Mascherano, pictured hugging Lionel Messi after beating Real Madrid, feels they are back to their best . 'We started the year with difficulties, with the defeat at Anoeta, which left us four points behind Real Madrid,' Mascherano told TyC Sports. 'Things weren't so good behind the scenes. 'The team seemed to have doubts. But this situation has now disappeared. This is the situation we live in. The demands at Barcelona are massive and it's not easy to meet them.' And Mascherano is refusing to rule out the threat that Real pose, despite their 2-1 win. 'Now we're four points ahead of Real Madrid. But this could always be turned on its head. The best thing is to always focus on the next game,' he said. 'Clasicos are difficult games, against opponents that push you to the limit, that are as good as our team. You need to try your hardest for every minute of the game, and that's what helped us to win. That's why we got the result we did. 'We're aware that we didn't beat Real Madrid with our best football. Barcelona always like to win, and especially to be better in a footballing sense, over and above the result.'

"Stuart Hogg has been warned he may provoke a furious England backlash at Twickenham after suggesting Scotland’s Calcutta Cup rivals do not respect them as a rugby nation. While Stuart Lancaster, who represented Scotland at age-group level, dismissed any notion that his team will take Saturday’s RBS 6 Nations visitors lightly, Hogg’s incendiary remarks to Sportsmail drew a stern response north of the border. Former Lions prop Peter Wright accused the full-back of a ‘misjudgment’ in making what amounted to a familiar claim of English arrogance. Stuart Hogg claimed England have 'no respect' for Scottish rugby ahead of Saturday's Twickenham clash . Hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the Six Nations game against Wales in February . ‘Under previous England coaches maybe there was a lack of respect for Scottish rugby but under Stuart Lancaster that has changed,’ said Wright. ‘He always gives respect to the opposition. The England lads will be angry to be accused of not respecting Scottish rugby because they do and that could fire them up even more.’ Wright’s comments followed a Twitter reaction to Hogg’s outburst by Will Carling, who said: ‘I always thought you earned respect through your performances. Old fashioned I know…’ His point was a clear reference to the fact that Scotland have failed to win at Twickenham for 32 years. Hogg (centre) wants to record Scotland's first win of the tournament against England at Twickenham . Wright added: ‘Will Carling has every right to suggest respect has to be earned by Scotland. He is a former England captain who led them to three Grand Slams, played in a World Cup final and went on tour with the Lions, so he has every right to take issue with Hogg. ‘I am surprised Stuart said it in the first place and I hope he isn’t made to regret his comments by an England side that will respect Scotland on Saturday but may now want to beat them even more.’ There was a more measured response from within the Scotland camp yesterday. Brad Barritt injured his ankle in Saracens' win over Wasps on Sunday and is now a doubt for England . Exeter Chiefs' 21-year-old fly-half Henry Slade earned himself a call up to Stuart Lancaster's England squad . Assistant coach Matt Taylor added: ‘I don’t see a lack of respect at all. Under Stuart Lancaster they are quite a humble group and they will be taking us seriously.’ Lancaster said: ‘We have a healthy regard for their team, their players and their coaching team.’ England have been forced to rule out Brad Barritt (ankle), Tom Croft (shoulder) and Henry Thomas (shoulder) from the rest of the championship. Exeter’s Henry Slade has been called into the squad and while he may push Billy Twelvetrees for a bench place, he is being viewed as a rising World Cup candidate. Luther Burrell and Mike Brown are expected to start against Scotland.","Stuart Hogg suggested England do not respect Scotland as a rugby nation .

"Sunderland have sacked manager Gus Poyet in the wake of Saturday’s humiliating 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. The result leaves the Black Cats one point and one place above the drop zone and owner Ellis Short believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation. Poyet – who leaves after 17 months in charge – was informed of the club’s decision having taken training at the Academy of Light on Monday morning. Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland fans turned on manager Poyet during the defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday . Sportsmail reported earlier in the day that influential sporting director Lee Congerton had advised Short to sack Poyet. A statement on the club's website confirmed the news on Monday afternoon, in which Short said: 'I would like to thank Gus for his endeavours during his time at the club, in particular last season’s ""great escape"" and cup final appearance, which will live long in the memory of every Sunderland fan. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon looks dejected as Sunderland were thrashed at home by Villa . Gabriel Agbonlahor scored two of Aston Villa's goals in the 4-0 win on Saturday . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. 'Sadly, we have not made the progress that any of us had hoped for this season and we find ourselves battling, once again, at the wrong end of the table. We have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed.' Poyet’s position had become untenable after a breakdown in relationship with Congerton and the club’s fans, thousands of whom streamed for the exits with the team trailing by four at half-time against Villa. A handful of supporters even tried to storm the dugout while some targeted the directors’ box – including chief executive Margaret Byrne - leaving the club hierarchy in no doubt that a change was necessary. Holland boss Dick Advocaat has already spoken to the club about a short-term deal until the end of the season and he could be installed before Saturday’s trip to West Ham. Congerton is close to Frank Arnesen – they worked together at Chelsea and Hamburg – and he is thought to have recommended Advocaat for the role. The new man will inherit a team which has won just once in 12 matches and is without a home goal in more than five hours. Poyet leaves Sunderland after just over a year in charge . Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of Paolo Di Canio . They were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Bradford City last month and away fans fought among themselves at Valley Parade. Bizarrely, Poyet blamed the Press for Sunderland’s woes after that game but his excuses did not wash with supporters. Former Rangers and Holland manager Dick Advocaat is one name in the frame to take over . The goodwill generated by last season’s League Cup final appearance and their escape from relegation in the final weeks of the campaign had long since evaporated and few fans will be mourning his departure. Poyet’s backroom team of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway are also expected to leave the club. The next home match sees North-East rivals Newcastle visit the Stadium of Light on Easter Sunday.

"An extraordinary gun fight in Brazil in which an off-duty policeman holding a child exchanged fire with two bandits has been caught on camera. The dramatic scene unfolded in a store in Belo Horizonte and ended with the two alleged bandits fleeing. Security camera footage of the incident begins with the two suspects walking into the store in Contagem, a district in the city, and talking to the doorman. An extraordinary gun fight in Brazil has been caught on camera. It involves two armed suspects, one in a dark top, the other in a white top and baseball cap - and an off-duty policeman holding a child (right) After the two suspects talk to the store clerk, the policeman realises they are intent on committing a crime and draws a gun as he steps away from them . The two suspects dodge the policeman's shots and run further inside the store . A few words are exchanged, then the officer reaches for his gun and spins around with the child in his arms. The suspects, one wearing a white T-shirt and the other a dark top,  sprint further inside the shop, underneath the camera. At this point it doesn't appear that either has produced a weapon. As they run off the policeman takes cover on the pavement behind a pillar. After peeking around it he moves quickly out of shot. Then the bandit in the white T-shirt rushes out and points a gun in the direction the off-duty policeman left in, before fleeing the scene. The other man follows shortly afterwards. Police said that the attempted robbery took place at around 4pm on Avenida José Faria da Rocha. No one was injured in the shootout. The suspects are still at large, Em.com reported. After a few seconds the man in the white T-shirt produces a gun and points it in the direction of the policeman, before fleeing the scene with his accomplice .","Dramatic scene unfolded in a store in Belo Horizonte and caught on CCTV .

"Speculation that Tiger Woods might play at the Masters next week has spread like wildfire after the 39-year-old played 18 holes at the Augusta National Golf club.

"Asked to nominate his dream strike partner past or present, Wayne Rooney settled on the name of Alan Shearer. It is easy to visualise them together, those barn-storming runs of Shearer and the clever link-up play from Rooney alongside him. In the No 9 and 10 shirts of England, they would have been lethal. ‘I admired Alan Shearer when I was growing up,’ admitted Rooney, as he prepares to lead England out for a prestige friendly against Italy in the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night.

Former Newcastle striker Shearer celebrates his goal against Luxembourg at Wembley in 2000 . ‘I loved the way he played and he was a real goalscorer, as his record shows. I would have worked well with him as a strike partner.’ Shearer scored 30 in 63 appearances for England, seducing a young Rooney at a time when he was still making his way through Everton’s centre of excellence. Partnering them together is the stuff of fantasy, but there will be a dose of reality when Harry Kane is added to an exhaustive list of forwards Rooney has played with since his debut against Australia in 2003. Shearer celebrates with Manchester United legend Paul Scholes after his goal against Scotland . James Beattie also played his first game for England that night — with Rooney’s partners down the years also including Michael Owen, Darius Vassell, Andrew Johnson, Daniel Sturridge, Peter Crouch and Theo Walcott. It is a mixed bag. So what does Rooney, who scored his 47th goal for his country in the 4-0 rout of Lithuania on Friday evening, look for in a partner? ‘I’ve played with a lot of different players with different qualities and I’ve adapted to every player,’ added Rooney. ‘With Michael Owen I was deeper, leaving Michael to run behind, and with Emile Heskey I tried to stay close — he’s a big lad who can hold the ball up.’ Rooney played deeper when Michael Owen was in the England team beside him .

Kane is expected to gain his first England start during the international friendly match against Italy . ‘I’m probably as excited about Harry Kane as everyone in the country,’ admitted Rooney. ‘He’s had an unbelievable season. I’ve seen the comparisons out there but Harry is his own player. He’s good in the air and can shoot with both feet. ‘He’s taking the ball and running at players, which is great to see. At the moment he’s very confident to score. ‘There were questions going into the season about where he would play for Tottenham because he was starting Europa League games, but not the Premier League. He gave his manager no option but to play him and he’s not looked back. ‘After scoring his goal on Friday I bet he can’t wait to get out on the pitch and try to score another goal.’ Rooney is back for more, testing himself against the Italians again as he faces them for the first time since England’s 2-1 defeat in the opening game of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He spoke yesterday of their uncompromising tactics over the years, but the England captain is also a big admirer of the football played here, particularly when Fiorentina boasted the Argentine forward Gabriel Batistuta. Rooney admitted he is a big admirer of former Argentina and Fiorentina ace Gabriel Batistuta . ‘It’s a passionate country and they love their football,’ added Rooney. ‘They are probably the closest in Europe to South American teams. They’ll do anything to stop you. They’re tough to play against, organised, (and) make it as difficult to play against as possible. They’re the best in Europe at doing that. ‘I’ve never thought about playing in Italy but growing up I watched Italian football. They had some great teams like Juventus and AC Milan and I loved to watch Fiorentina because I loved Batistuta.’ The Argentine — fondly known as Batigol — is one of the game’s greats, also playing for Roma and Inter Milan during his 12-year spell in Italy. The Argentine is one of the game’s greats, also playing for Roma and Inter Milan 12-year spell in Italy . This is Rooney’s year for England, growing into the role of captain for club and country. These days he speaks with increasing maturity and conviction. Here in Turin, as the questions fizzed around over Ross Barkley’s startling dip in form, Rooney recalled a conversation he once had with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he was named as a substitute at Manchester United. Ross Barkley burst onto the scene, but his form this season has failed to live up to expectation . ‘With Everton they hit the heights last season, but he hasn’t done as well and the team hasn’t done as well recently,’ added the England captain. ‘I spoke to him after the game on Friday night and the only advice I gave him was to watch the game from the bench with England. He will know how to get into the opposition, where the spaces are. ‘That’s what Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said to me when I was young, so you know where to be when you come on.

United had gone into that game with a number of doubts cast over their Champions League credentials, having delivered some unconvincing performances in recent weeks. But on Saturday, they were back to their best with a performance replete with pace and verve that blew Spurs away.

He told TalkSport, 'Liverpool are the only team who can do a bit of damage to Manchester United. I don't see it happening now though. 'United are clicking into gear at the right time and are relaxed in the way they're playing their football.'

Marouane Fellaini continued his superb run of form with an eye catching display against Spurs on Sunday . 'Marouane Fellaini is the fulcrum of the side now,' he said.

Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Aljaz Bedene was born in the Slovenian capital of Ljublana in 1989 but has made the UK his home since 2008. The 25-year-old lives in Hertfordshire and trains at Gosling Sports Park in Welwyn Garden City with British coach James Davidson and fitness trainer Martin Skinner. Bedene's career-high ranking was No 71 in February 2013 and he reached his first ATP tour final earlier this year when he finished runner-up at the Chennai Open in January. However, whether he can play Davis Cup for GB is a different matter, as he has three times been in the Slovenian squad, albeit never having played a 'live' rubber. He is appealing a new rule banning players from representing two nations on the basis that his citizenship application was being processed at the time. 'Today is one of the most special days of my life,' said Bedene. 'This has been a long process and to gain citizenship almost seven years to the day after arriving is just overwhelming. 'This is something I have wanted since the moment I stepped foot in this beautiful country and I feel honoured to be able to compete under the Union Jack on the ATP Tour. Davis Cup is another dream and one I will have to fight for with everything I have.' Bedene is the most significant British tennis import since Greg Rusedski. A quick and agile baseliner, he has already been ranked No 71 in the world and after being held back by injuries last year ought to be heading into the top 50 before too long. He has long been managed by Stevenage-based firm Global Tennis Connections and has a British coach in James Davidson. He has actually represented Hertfordshire in the County Cup, the team being captained by tennis nut Wayne, famous for his War of the Worlds production.

Bedene will now slot in as British No 2 although it must be highly unlikely he could play in the Davis Cup quarter-final after Wimbledon against France, especially after James Ward's heroics against the USA in the first round. The likes of Ward, who has been a stalwart of the Davis Cup team through thick and thin, might understandably be peeved were Bedene suddenly to walk into the team. Otherwise there should not be too much friction as Bedene, who is certainly not a product of the LTA or the British game, is not competing for wildcards or funding. Andy Murray has welcomed the news of Bedene's switch and feels that he could be a useful addition to the Davis Cup team in future years. Murray told Sky Sports: 'I don't know him extremely well but I know that he's obviously playing some very good tennis right now. Bedene plays on the grass of London's Queen's Club at the 2013 Aegon Championships . The Great Britain Davis Cup team celebrate their victory against the USA in Glasgow earlier this month . 'I think maybe in the future it's possible for him to be involved in the Davis Cup team but I'm not sure exactly what the rules are. 'I know the rules change a little bit this year, that you're not allowed to play for two countries, so I'm not 100 per cent sure if he's going to be eligible. 'This year we have a team that's being doing extremely well and I would expect that this year we would stick with that team and revisit it again in the future if he becomes eligible.' British No 4 Liam Broady - who will drop to No 5 when Bedene officially starts representing Britain on the tour - was also warm in his reaction, tweeting: 'Welcome to GB mate.'","Aljaz Bedene officially became a British citizen at a ceremony on Tuesday .

"A nine-year-old Rory McIlroy predicted he would usurp the world's greatest golfer after penning a letter to Tiger Woods back in 1999. Although the American legend may have never read the prophecy, a New York Times Magazine profile pieced together its contents through interviews with McIlroy and close family members. Having just won the 1998 Doral-Publix Junior Golf Classic in Florida for the 10-11 age group, the young McIlroy's message was clear: 'I'm coming to get you. This is the beginning. Watch this space.' A nine-year-old Rory McIlroy predicted he would catch Tiger Woods to become the world's best golfer . The Northern Irishman heads to Augusta hoping to complete a full set of major titles . Woods injury problems have seen him slip out of the top 100 for the first time since 1996 . When asked if he recalled the letter, the three time major winner sheepishly admitted: 'A lot of those memories have kind of blurred together. But, yeah, it went something like that.' Whether Woods, ranked an unassailable No 1 at the time, would have paid much attention is unlikely but 16 years later it's the Northern Irishman who heads golf's rankings - while Woods has slipped out of the top 100 for the first time since 1996. And, not only has McIlroy surpassed him on the course but he has also taken his former idol's role as Nike's poster boy and the face of EA Sports video game. In 1999, when McIlroy's letter was written, no one could touch Woods at the top of golf's table . McIlroy has taken Woods' place on the course and as poster boy for Nike and EA Sports . Meanwhile, McIlroy heads for Masters bulked up in bid to complete a career grand slam by winning his third consecutive major title. Although the 25-year-old still has a long way to go before surpassing Woods' record of 683 total weeks as world No 1, he is undoubtedly the American's successor as golf's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens. And  his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand. 'It was when I started to notice results that I fell in love with it,' said McIlroy .

"The new finance minister for Greece has been accused of making an offensive gesture to Germany during a speech. Yanis Varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in Greece's debt from the EU and has been doing a whistlestop tour of Europe in a bid to get support for his proposals. But the new finance minister has been hit by an allegation recently that he held up his middle finger when giving a speech about Greece's finances and Germany in 2013. Scroll down for video . Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been accused of making an offensive gesture with his middle finger during a speech he gave in 2013 about the country's finances, and mentioning Germany . He is alleged to have made the offensive gesture before he was appointed as finance minister, and Varoufakis has denied sticking up his finger. The minister claims the footage has been doctored. A video of the speech appears to capture the offensive gesture. As he raises his finger, Varoufakis says: 'My proposal was that Greece should simply announce that it is defaulting, just like Argentina did, within the euro, in January 2010, and stick the finger to Germany and say well, you can now solve this problem by yourself.' The claims are likely to make a tense situation even more tricky for Varoufakis who has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for Greece to pay back its debt to the EU since the election of the radical left-wing party Syriza in January. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing party heading the new coalition, immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece' £179 billion international bailout deal. Yanis Varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for Greece . The party has continued to describe itself as 'anti-austerity.' The call catapulted Varoufakis onto the European stage. Last month he visited George Osborne in London to garner support for the move and has been touring several European countries. Greece was likely to run out of money by March if a deal was not reached before the end of February and a four month extension to the bailout programme for Greece was agreed on a conditional basis. February 9 2010 – Greek Parliament approved first austerity package measures -  included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, and cuts in overtime workers. March 3 2010 – Parliament passed a new major austerity package. Measures included: Pensions freezes, an increase in sales tax from 19% to 21%, rises in taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, rises in taxes on luxury goods, cuts in public sector pay. April 23 2010 – George Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister formally requested an international bailout. The financing will come from an emergency aid package with the participation of European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. May 2 2010 – Papandreou, the IMF, and euro-zone leaders agree to a €110 billion bailout package that would take effect over the next three years. The government announced the new austerity package measures. June 29 2011 – Parliament passed the new austerity package. October 20 2011 – Government passed the multi-austerity bill, amid protests and violent riots outside the parliament building. February 12 2012 – Parliament passed new austerity package measures amid violent protests. Many buildings in the centre of Athens burnt during riots. November 5 2012 – Parliament adopted new round of austerity cuts required for Greece to receive the next installment of the international economic bailout. April 28 013 – Parliament approved bill that included cutting 15,000 state jobs . July 17 2013 – Parliament approves new austerity measures . March 30 2014 – Parliament passed new multi-bill needed for Greece to receive its next bailout. April 10 2014 – Greece returned to financial markets, with the issue of 3 billion Eurobonds. December 8 2014 – Greek government announced snap presidential vote. Next day the Greek stock market fell 12.78%, a fall record since 1989. December 29 2014 –Government collapses after failing to elect new president of Greece. January 2015 - Alexis Tsipras of Syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade European Union and IMF to ease terms of bail-outs. But there are still concerns the country could run out of money, as Greek officials complain the repayment measures are starving them of money. It was confirmed today that Greece had handed over 580m euros to the International Monetary Fund - clearing its debt for this month. But it will face another 350m euros bill on Friday - generating further tensions between Greece and the eurozone and fears that the country could drop out of the single currency altogether. The allegations come as Varoufakis, an outspoken Marxist economist and blogger, has faced a number of criticisms. He came under fire after taking part in a photo shoot for Paris Match - him and his wife posing with glasses of wine on their roof terrace.","Finance minister has been trying to negotiate a better debt deal for Greece .

"Trainer Aidan O’Brien has acknowledged he is likely to have Ryan Moore riding more of his horses this season. Speculation has raged about the likely riding plans for Ireland’s champion trainer, with son and stable jockey Joseph having his first ride over hurdles at Limerick on Sunday when fifth on Egyptian Warrior.

The trainer said: ‘We’ve a good relationship with Ryan and we always have. We used Ryan more last year than we did the year before and hopefully it will be that way again this year.’ Acknowledging his son’s weight issues, O’Brien added: ‘Obviously (doing) nine stone has been a problem for the last two seasons and last year it was a big problem. ‘This year he’s heavier than he was this time last year. He’ll go gently and we’ll see what will happen.’ Leighton Aspell will ride Many Clouds (left) at Aintree after winning the Hennessy Gold Cup .

"California Chrome, the 2014 Kentucky Derby winner who finished second to Prince Bishop in Saturday’s Dubai World Cup, has been confirmed as a definite runner at Royal Ascot in June. The four-year-old, trained by Art Sherman, has the 10-furlong Prince Of Wales’s Stakes on June 17 in his sights but could first take in the one-mile Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on May 16. California Chrome will be based at Rae Guest’s stable in Newmarket during his stay here. California Chrome has been confirmed as a definite runner for Royal Ascot in June . Co-owner Perry Martin said: ‘We are grateful for the opportunity to race at Royal Ascot and hopeful that California Chrome can put up a good show. We are looking forward to the experience.’ Further overseas interest in the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes could be supplied by Japan’s Spielberg, a Grade One winner on his home turf and third in the Japan Cup in November. The news of California Chrome’s British venture emerged hours before Newmarket trainer Roger Varian confirmed that his 2014 St Leger winner and Arc fourth Kingston Hill will miss the first half of the season. Prince Bishop crosses the finish line at Meydan to win the Dubai World Cup on Saturday . Races like the Coronation Cup at Epsom and the King George at Ascot had been expected to be on Kingston Hill’s agenda. Varian said: ‘He has sustained a superficial injury to his left fore. He is sound but sore. He has an area of significant bruising and inflammation which will take time to settle. ‘We will now target the top middle distance races later in the season with all roads leading back to Longchamp in October for a another crack at the Prix de l’ Arc De Triomphe.’","California Chrome has been confirmed for Royal Ascot in June .

"Newcastle United are willing to pay the £2million compensation fee for Derby County boss Steve McClaren, Sportsmail understands. Senior sources within St James’ Park are convinced that the former England manager will be their next head coach come the summer and say the £3.5m pocketed from Alan Pardew’s defection to Crystal Palace in January will cover the cost of his arrival. It is McClaren’s relationship with United’s chief scout Graham Carr – in essence, the club’s director of football – which is the driving force behind their move for the 53-year-old. Newcastle United are willing to pay the £2million compensation fee for Derby County boss Steve McClaren . Head coach John Carver looks set to be replaced come the end of the Premier League season . Carr has been tasked with finding the new boss should the Magpies decide to replace current head coach John Carver - and that is looking increasingly likely. Sources at Newcastle have indicated McClaren is the only name being considered and they feel there is a willingness on his part to swap Pride Park for St James’ Park. McClaren’s camp deny this, instead insisting he is fully focussed on winning promotion to the Premier League with Derby. Derby boss McClaren has a good relationship with United’s chief scout Graham Carr (pictured) Despite a strong campaign, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight . That, however, is to be expected given his promise to the club’s hierarchy that he would see out the season with the Rams when he was first linked with Newcastle in January. McClaren signed a new three-year deal in August and chief executive Sam Rush has again insisted this week that their manager is going nowhere. However, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight and there is even a chance they could slip out of the play-off places. They announced losses of £7m this week, compared to the £18.7m profit recorded by Newcastle, who intend to invest heavily in their playing squad this summer. It is thought all of those factors will be enough for Carr to persuade McClaren to head to the North-East ahead of next season.","Newcastle have set sights on appointing Steve McClaren as next boss .

"John Carver says Newcastle United need a clear-out this summer. The head coach is in danger of missing out on a permanent appointment following a string of desperate displays by his team, who were accused by Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville of having their flip-flops on. Carver hit back at that on Friday but fired his own warning to those who have performed so poorly. And with Sammy Ameobi, Ryan Taylor and Jonas Gutierrez out of contract in the summer, plenty of players will come under threat. John Carver says there needs to be a clear-out at Newcastle United in the summer . Sammy Ameobi (left) is one of many players whose contracts expire at the end of the season . ‘They know there has to be a clear-out,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty obvious, to the man in the street and to the professionals — it has to be done. ‘There are people out of contract, people who are not good enough — they know that.’ Carver’s words are his strongest since taking over from Alan Pardew in January. The Magpies held a dressing-room inquest in the wake of last Sunday’s 3-0 surrender at Everton and the boss admits everyone — himself included — is fighting for his future at the club. ‘We all are,’ he said. ‘That’s why I was a bit astonished when people (Neville) came out and talked about us being on the beach and wearing flip-flops. How can players do that when they know that everybody is playing for their futures?’ Carver’s situation has not been helped by the lack of player investment in the January window which has left him with just 13 senior players ahead of today’s visit of Arsenal. The Newcastle players applaud the fans after the disappointing defeat by Everton last weekend . Right-back Daryl Janmaat will deputise for suspended skipper Fabricio Coloccini at centre-back, despite admitting earlier in the week that he’d never played there. Carver said: ‘I think he’s a great professional and he will deal with it. He understands the game, he is a full international. It’s another string to his bow and I think he’ll cope with it. ‘He’s been great around the place. He’s such a character. He’s larger than life and he’s quite funny, but he’s a good professional with it. ‘When we lost Mathieu Debuchy (to Arsenal) it was a blow but we replaced him with a better all-round player. ‘But I must admit I’ve never been in a position like this (with injuries and suspension) and I don’t think anybody I’ve ever worked with has, either. ‘I’m missing my best players and that’s how I look at it. With Papiss Cisse it’ s like Tottenham being without Harry Kane. With Siem de Jong, it’s like them being without Christian Eriksen. ‘It’s tough, but we’re not going to use that as an excuse and throw in the towel. Definitely not.’ Darly Janmaat will captain Newcastle in the Premier League fixture against Arsenal on Saturday .

"Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish insists the club are in no rush to sell but they need a financial investment if they want to expand. American businessman Josh Harris, who owns NBA side Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils, had been in talks to buy the Premier League club. But Parish believes there is no need for the south London club to sell up but is wary of the financial implications of commissioning new projects. Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish said that the club are in no rush to sell up . 'Taking on commitments and building things is risky,' he said. 'You could lose a lot of money really quickly. People have lost hundreds of millions in this game in a year or two. 'I could probably stay 20 years and I could get a new main stand and a new training ground and find a way of financing it every year. 'But if you finance it, it puts the club at risk. If you get relegated, you've got a project you're committed to and suddenly your wage bill is bigger than your income. Palace are 11th in the Premier League table and look set to avoid relegation to the Championship again . 'We need a sizeable chunk of investment to do things quickly.'

"Burnley possessed the most English starting XI of any Premier League team in the last round of games, with seven players in Sean Dyche's team eligible to play for Roy Hodgson's men. Tom Heaton, Ben Mee, Jason Shackell, Kieran Trippier, Ashley Barnes, David Jones and Danny Ings meet the criteria for selection, with none of the XI who played against Southampton on Saturday, March 21 drawn from outside the United Kingdom. However, none of that English contingent have yet featured in one of Hodgson's senior squads. The pool of English talent has again been in the spotlight over the last fortnight with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke announcing changes to the work permit system and proposals to increase the number of homegrown players in Premier League squads, all with a view to boosting England's performance at major tournaments. David Jones (right) was among seven English players to take to the field against Southampton on March 21 . Clarets boss Sean Dyche regularly flies the flag for England by starting a majority of English players . England and Tottenham striker Harry Kane was one of six Enlgish players to feature against Leicester City . Harry Kane - held up by Dyke as the sort of talent whose development must not be stifled by foreign imports - heads a six-strong group who featured for Tottenham against Leicester, including fellow new call-up Ryan Mason, while five of the Manchester United team which won at Liverpool were England internationals. At the bottom end of the chart are the leading two teams in the Premier League, Chelsea and Manchester City. Central defensive pair Gary Cahill and John Terry were part of Jose Mourinho's defence as they won 3-2 at Hull - another team with just two England-qualified starters - while Manchester City had only Joe Hart and retired England midfielder Frank Lampard in their XI. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been credited for adding a greater English element to his side in recent years, but the team which won at Newcastle featured only two who would qualify - Calum Chambers and Danny Welbeck. Chelsea's  duo of John Terry (centre) and Gary Cahill were the only English players to start against Hull . Overall, only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. England face Italy on Tuesday night, and the proportion of players in Serie A starting line-ups who were born in Italy - or have otherwise represented Italy at senior level - over the same weekend was 43.2 per cent. That proportion would increase still further if you included those who may qualify under residency rules or those - typically of South American birth - who hold Italian passports due to their ancestry. In the English Championship, the most 'English' teams were Blackburn and Huddersfield with nine, with a few caveats. Jordan Henderson (centre) and Michael Carrick (right) made up nine English players to start in the derby . Huddersfield duo Sean Scannell and Joel Lynch both appear to have nailed their colours to the masts of the Republic of Ireland and Wales respectively, yet neither has made a senior competitive appearance yet so are still technically eligible for England. Adam Henley is still England-qualified for Blackburn after he was an unused substitute in Wales' Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel. Until Matt Ritchie featured for Scotland against Gibraltar on Sunday, Bournemouth also had nine, with the Cherries' Republic of Ireland call-up Harry Arter still England-qualified as he did not feature for the Irish against Poland. League Two's AFC Wimbledon fielded eleven English players in their most recent game against Tranmere . Also flying the flag of St George with an all-English XI were Hartlepool United (pictured) and Southend United . The percentage of England-qualified players starting in the Championship was 57.2 per cent, rising to 76.1 per cent in League One and 86.0 per cent in League Two. Five teams in League One - Bristol City, Chesterfield, Colchester, Crewe and Rochdale - were just one player shy of an entirely England-qualified XI. You had to go down to League Two to find a fully England-qualified XI, with AFC Wimbledon, Hartlepool and Southend flying the flag. Southend's Adam Thompson has won two caps for Northern Ireland, but both came in the 2011 Nations Cup which does not classify as an official competition under FIFA regulations, so he technically remains eligible for England.

However, under a Home Nations agreement, it is understood the residency rules for England eligibility are different. If not born in England, a player must have spent at least five years in education in England prior to his 18th birthday to be eligible. *For Serie A, only players born in Italy or otherwise having represented Italy at national team level were counted in our survey. Many other players may qualify under residency rules or hold Italian passports owing to their parents or grandparents.","Burnley last fielded the most English Premier League staring XI (seven)

"Ronaldo, Game of Thrones and digestive biscuits are just some of the things that Theo Walcott likes after braving the hot-seat while on England duty. The Arsenal forward is currently away in Italy with the national team but still took the time to take part in 'Gone in 60 seconds' quick fire question. The short video was posted on England's Facebook page, where Walcott revealed he's the fastest player in the squad - ahead of the likes of Andros Townsend, Nathaniel Clyne and Danny Welbeck.

"Newcastle United have just three fit defenders ahead of Wednesday’s visit of Manchester United. The Magpies have confirmed that left back Massadio Haidara will miss the game after picking up a knee injury during Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Aston Villa. Midfielder Ryan Taylor is set to deputise after replacing the stricken Frenchman at the weekend. Ryan Taylor looks set to start against Manchester United after Massadio Haidara sustained a knee injury . Taylor (centre) has made just four Premier League appearances since the start of the season . Haidara had to be carried off on a stretcher during Newcastle's 1-0 win against Aston Villa . Head coach John Carver is already without Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett, while Davide Santon and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa were allowed to leave the club in January. And he said: ‘We thought Haidara might be available but he's got a bit of fluid on the knee and has been for an injection, so he almost certainly won’t make it. ‘We're short of defenders and we've not got many possibilities, so Ryan comes into contention and he filled that role very well the other day. ‘But with another injury I'll have to start to try pulling rabbits out of a hat.’ When asked if he had been left short by the club’s failure to bring in January reinforcements, Carver said: ‘The squad itself is big enough, we've just been so unfortunate with these injuries. ‘You normally have three or four of these long-term injuries per season, but we've had more than that with nine already. ‘Our squad at the start of the season was in a healthy position, the only thing you can do is go into the out-of-contract market and it might be something we look at, but not yet.’ Papiss Cisse will be hoping to add to his first-half winner against Aston Villa when he faces Man United .

"For  a moment, the image seemed wrong. Celebrating in the corner were a group of giddy England players, while slumped in the penalty area were clutch of crestfallen Germans. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Important matches between these two old foes tend to end one way and rarely is the outcome happy for England. Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate, after all, knows that better than most. But this was no apparition: two goals in two minutes from Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse provided further evidence this squad Southgate has impressively moulded is an emerging force. When Euro 2015 starts 80 days from now, do not doubt they possess what it takes to win it. This 3-2 win at a rain sodden Riverside Stadium, achieved after they had trailed twice, was stamped with the qualities of a team that can win a major tournament: quality, technique and spirit coming to the fore. Never was it more evident than when Ward-Prowse scored the decisive goal. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's 3-2 defeat of Germany . The Southampton midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in the space of three minutes . Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half . England were heading towards defeat before Redmond's strike on 79minutes brought them back into the game . Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross in the first half . Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from a memorable victory . Hofmann slides in in front of Everton defender John Stones to restore Germany's lead at the start of the second half . ENGLAND (4-2-3-1): Bond 6.5: Jenkinson 7.5, Stones 7, Gibson 6.5 (Keane 77mins), Garbutt 6.5: Ward-Prowse 7.5, Forster-Caskey 7: Lingard 7.5, Hughes 6.5 (Pritchard 65mins 6), Redmond 8: Ings 7 . Subs not used: Bettinelli, Moore, Woodrow. Scorers: Lingard 34, Redmond 79, Ward-Prowse 82.

Booked: Leitner. Scorers: Hofmann 15, 50. Man of the match: Carl Jenkinson. Referee: Davide Massa (Italy) 7. Expectations of a bold show in the Czech Republic can now build but Southgate, who has only lost one of the 16 games for which he has been in charge, was rather more circumspect. Yes, he was pleased but he was also quick to sound a note of caution. ‘How do I keep a check on expectations,’ he asked. ‘That’s easy. I’ll just show people the first 25 minutes of this game. We have tremendous belief in this group of players and some elements of what they did really pleased me. Other aspects showed we can definitely improve.’ The last time Southgate had stood in the technical area of this particular stadium, it came before one of the darkest moments of his career: the events of October 20, 2009, when he was sacked by Middlesbrough, will never leave him. He returned, however, a more confident and mature manager and he has thrived in this role with the FA, getting the Under-21s playing a vibrant, attractive brand of football that will see them go to the Czech Republic with genuine ambitions of success. Germany, though, will go there with the same mind-set and there is no doubt they will be big players when the tournament starts because of the big players they have in their ranks; Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, the Barcelona keeper, Emre Can of Liverpool and Max Meyer of Schalke to name but three. They started this contest impressively, moving the ball with purpose and ambition and in the first 10 minutes England had trouble getting out of their own half. Germany retained possession with ease and there was an inevitability they would strike first. When Germany broke the deadlock, they did it in style. Matthias Ginter skipper down the left and clipped in a cross that Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, controlled with his right foot before smashing a drive beyond Jonathon Bond with his left. For a moment it seemed like Germany might go through the gears but this England team has spirit as well as ability and their speed caused problems; Lingard (twice) and Danny Ings both tested Stegen before Lingard’s industry was rewarded in the 34th minute and parity was restored. Half-time arrived and checked England’s momentum. Germany made changes and the introduction of Arsenal flyer Serge Gnabry gave them blistering pace and trickery to attack Everton left-bacl Luke Garbutt. He made an immediate impact, thrilling providing Hofmann’s second of the night. Yet England were not done and they staged a grandstand comeback, Redmond equalised in the 78th minute before Ward-Prowse won it when bursting through. The players, then, can start to dream and, perhaps in a quiet moment, Southgate will too. ‘We have not achieved anything yet,’ he said. ‘We know what our goal is and we want to get there.’ Hoffman, who plays in Germany's second division, strikes to open the scoring for Germany after 15minutes .

"Cartagena and Lucena players protested months of unpaid wages in a dramatic show of unity by refusing to contest the opening moments of their  Segunda B match at the weekend. After the referee blew the whistle for the start of the game Cartagena’s strikers played the ball forward the bare minimum before walking back to their half to join their team-mates. The home side’s starting XI stood arm in arm and faced their fans in a line while the modest crowd at Cartagonova Stadium stood in unison and applauded. Cartagena and Lucena players stage a protest against months of unpaid wages after starting their match . Lucena, whose plight is largely in parallel with their opponents, dropped to their knees and put their arms behind their backs in their own form of protest. Almost 40 seconds passed before a Cartagena player got the match proper under way and it became business as usual in their fight for survival. A 71st-minute strike from former Real Madrid youth player Chus Hevia decided the 1-0 result for the home side but their sides' statement was made long before that. The Segunda B sides line up as if it was a normal match and kicked off when the whistle was blown . But after the ball is rolled forward by Cartagena the players turn to join together for the protest . Cartagena players face the crowd in their mostly empty stadium while the Lucena side kneel down .

"John Stones and Luke Shaw will be included in England’s squad for Euro 2015 as Gareth Southgate gets close to formulating his 23-man party. The coach is ‘certain’ of 21 of the names and his list includes Everton central defender Stones, who was outstanding in the friendly wins over the Czech Republic and Germany, and Manchester United left back Shaw. Stones went to the World Cup last summer and was a regular in Roy Hodgson’s senior squad at the beginning of the campaign but, like Calum Chambers, he dropped back down with aplomb and will be a key figure in the Czech Republic. John Stones played in the impressive 3-2 win against Germany U21s and will head to the Czech Republic . Luke Shaw hasn't played for the U21s since October but he will be headed for Euro 2015 . Shaw has not played for the Under 21s since the play-off victory over Croatia last October but he was included regularly in the early part of Southgate’s reign. Everton’s Ross Barkley is expected to have the summer off. The midfielder has never been in one of Southgate’s squads and last played for the Under 21s in August 2013.

"With the expansion of the European Championships from 16 to 24 teams for 2016, there has never been a better opportunity for all four of the Home Nations to qualify for a big tournament. And after the fifth round of qualifiers this weekend, all have a strong chance of making it to France next summer. At the half-way point in the qualification campaign, we look at the story so far and assess the chances of each making it. WALES . The story so far . Wales have enjoyed an excellent start to their campaign, with three wins and two draws putting them top of Group B. The reformatting of the competition means that the top two from each group advance automatically to France 2016, while the third-placed side enter the play-offs. Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring a late free-kick in Wales' 2-1 win over Andorra . Wales started sluggishly, requiring a late Gareth Bale free-kick to spare them from embarrassment against minnows Andorra, before earning a credible goalless draw at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, who played at the World Cup in Brazil. Goals from David Cotterill and Hal Robson-Kanu saw off Cyprus before a 0-0 draw away to Belgium, on paper the strongest team in the group. On Saturday, they went top following a 3-0 win against 10-man Israel. Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey put them ahead on the stroke of half-time before the sending off, and two Bale strikes made absolutely sure after the break. Results: Andorra 1 Wales 2; Wales 0 Bosnia 0; Wales 2 Cyprus 1; Belgium 0 Wales 0; Israel 0 Wales 3 . Aaron Ramsey celebrates his opening goal in the 3-0 win over Israel at the weekend . Wales are currently two points ahead of Israel in Group B though they have played one game more . When did they last reach a major tournament? You have to go all the way back to 1958, when Wales reached the World Cup in Sweden, to find their one and only finals appearance. They came close to reaching Euro 2004, but lost to Russia in a play-off. What's still to come? Much now rests on their match with Belgium, who are currently third, in Cardiff on June 12. If Chris Coleman's team can get something from that, they will be in a very strong position. September sees a visit to Cyprus and a home return with Israel, before the campaign concludes with a tricky trip to Bosnia and a final home game with Andorra. From here, there really is little excuse not to make it but Wales have come close before, only to agonisingly miss out. Fixtures: June 12 - Wales vs Belgium; September 3 - Cyprus vs Wales; September 6 - Wales vs Israel; October 10 - Bosnia-Herzegovina vs Wales; October 13 - Wales vs Andorra . Bale was on target twice in Haifa as Wales lifted themselves top of qualifying Group B . SCOTLAND . The story so far . It was a case of hardest match first for the Scots, who mounted some stiff resistance away to World champions Germany and even drew level through Ikechi Anya before succumbing 2-1. A nervy 1-0 win over Georgia at Hampden Park followed before a fine performance earned a 2-2 draw in Poland. Scotland actually led in Warsaw after goals from Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith but were pegged back. But two wins from two home games - 1-0 against the Republic of Ireland and 6-1 against Gibraltar on Sunday - have left Gordon Strachan's side third, good enough for a play-off spot as it stands but just a point off the lead. Results: Germany 2 Scotland 1; Scotland 1 Georgia 0; Poland 2 Scotland 2; Scotland 1 Republic of Ireland 0; Scotland 6 Gibraltar 1 . Ikechi Anya celebrates his goal to pull the Scots level in their opening match with Germany in Dortmund . Shaun Maloney fired home the winning goal at Celtic Park as the Republic of Ireland were beaten 1-0 . Scotland are currently third in Group D - enough to secure a place in the play-offs as it stands . When did they last reach a major tournament? In 1998, Scotland reached the World Cup finals in France so a return there is very much on the cards. They have twice made the European Championship finals previously, in 1992 and 1996. What's still to come? The next match, away to the Republic of Ireland in Dublin is absolutely key. If they win, they will establish a five-point gap over them. If they lose, Ireland will leapfrog them. Scotland have an advantage in that their remaining games against the strongest sides, Germany and Poland, come at home. They must take maximum points from their away trips to Georgia and Gibraltar. But in the most competitive group of the lot, they have every chance of making it. Fixtures: June 13 - Republic of Ireland vs Scotland; September 4 - Georgia vs Scotland; September 7 - Scotland vs Germany; October 8 - Scotland vs Poland; October 11 - Gibraltar vs Scotland . Steven Fletcher scored a hat-trick in Scotland's 6-1 rout of Gibraltar at Hampden Park on Sunday . NORTHERN IRELAND . The story so far . It's been an excellent campaign for Northern Ireland so far, with four wins out of five putting them second to Romania in Group F. Michael O'Neill's side have exceeded all expectations, starting off with a 2-1 win over Hungary in Budapest thanks to late goals from Niall McGinn and Kyle Lafferty. Goals from Gareth McAuley and Lafferty saw off the Faroe Islands at home, before Jamie Ward and Lafferty secured a 2-0 win in Greece three days later. Their only blip came in a 2-0 loss to Romania, but more Lafferty goals on Sunday against Finland saw them return to form. Results: Hungary 1 Northern Ireland 2; Northern Ireland 2 Faroe Islands 0; Greece 0 Northern Ireland 2; Romania 2 Northern Ireland 0; Northern Ireland 2 Finland 0 . Kyle Lafferty celebrates after scoring in Northern Ireland's 2-1 win over Hungary in Budapest . Gareth McAuley scores the first goal in Northern Ireland's 2-0 win over the Faroe Islands in October . Northern Ireland are just one point behind leaders Romania in Group F at the mid-way point . When did they last reach a major tournament? Northern Ireland have never made a European Championship and the last of their three World Cups was back in 1986. What's still to come? The top two in the group, Northern Ireland and Romania meet next at Windsor Park. In September, it's the Faroe Islands away and Hungary at home. The campaign concludes with Greece in Belfast and a tip to play Finland in Helsinki. Encouragingly for Northern Ireland, there is a gap of eight points between themselves and Finland in fourth, so there really is little excuse not to make it into the top three from here. Fixtures: June 13 - Northern Ireland vs Romania; September 4 - Faroe Islands vs Northern Ireland; September 7 - Northern Ireland vs Hungary; October 8 - Northern Ireland vs Greece; October 11 - Finland vs Northern Ireland . Lafferty scored twice as Northern Ireland beat Finland 2-1 at Windsor Park on Sunday . ENGLAND . The story so far . A perfect five from five for Roy Hodgson's men, who are making qualification look like a breeze. They have a six-point lead over Slovenia in second and it would take a real calamity not to make it through from here. Two Danny Welbeck goals saw them to victory in Switzerland back in September and that was followed by a predictable crushing of San Marino. Wayne Rooney curled home a free-kick winner in a tough game in Estonia, before Slovenia were beaten 3-1 at Wembley, with Rooney and Welbeck (2) finding the net. Friday night's 4-0 win over Lithuania made this England's best start to a season ever, courtesy of goals from Rooney, Welbeck, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Results: Switzerland 0 England 2; England 5 San Marino 0; Estonia 0 England 1; England 3 Slovenia 1; England 4 Lithuania 0 . Danny Welbeck's two goals against Switzerland in Basle got England off to the perfect start . Danny Welbeck is the leading goalscorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with six in five games . England have made a perfect start to Group E, with five wins out of five . When did they last reach a major tournament? Regular qualifiers for both the World Cup and European Championships but normally falling well short of expectations. What's still to come? A victory away to Slovenia in Ljubljana in June should just about secure England's place in the finals and, failing that, away trips to minnows San Marino and Lithuania, plus home meetings with Switzerland and Estonia should do it. Hodgson's men should really be aiming for a perfect record of 10 wins from 10. Fixtures: June 14 - Slovenia vs England; September 5 - San Marino vs England; September 8 - England vs Switzerland; October 9 - England vs Estonia; October 12 - Lithuania vs England .

"Top players often try to find a way to avoid difficult questions from the press, but Daniel Alves has found a more inventive method than most. The Barcelona full back was hounded by journalists while travelling home from a few days off over the international break. Alves has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp when his contract expires this summer, and he was repeatedly asked where he would be going. After being pressed about his future at Barcelona, Daniel Alves started singing at journalists . Alves is out of contract at Barcelona this summer, and has been linked with a move to PSG . Despite Alves wearing headphones and giving every indication that he had no interest in talking to the press, the questions kept coming. Eventually, when directly asked about a reported agreement with Paris St Germain, the Brazil defender lost patience, grabbing the microphone off one of the reporters and bursting into song, blasting out a few bars of Bazilian singer-songwriter Xande de Pilares . Fortunately Alves is a better footballer than a singer, and despite not featuring during this international break, and being allowed to leave Barcelona, is not without suitors amongst Europe's elite.","Dani Alves is out of contract at Barcelona this summer .

"Defender Ben Gibson is hoping England Under 21s' 3-2 friendly victory over Germany was a dress rehearsal for a European Championship finals showdown. Both sides will head for the Czech Republic during the summer as manager Gareth Southgate attempts to guide the Young Lions to glory, and England will do so having got the better of their German counterparts with a 3-2 win at the Riverside Stadium on Monday evening. Southgate's men had to come from behind twice to set the stage for a late decisive push, and Middlesbrough's Gibson is hoping that will stand them in good stead for the finals tournament. Ben Gibson (right) is hoping England 21s' 3-2 victory against Germany will boost the team's confidence . James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England' 3-2 victory . He said: 'Germany were always going to be a good side. You know they are going to be technical and strong, and that's what they were. But we thought we could match them - we did that and ended up getting the result. 'We are hoping we will play against them at some point either in the semi-final or final in the Euros - that would be nice. It would be another tough game. 'They are a good side, so for us to get the win, that was the important thing.' The win against Germany was England's third against fellow finalists with Portugal and the hosts having already succumbed at their hands, and while Southgate is confident progress is being made, he is taking nothing for granted. England were heading towards defeat before Nathan Redmond's strike on 79 minutes . He said: 'We have got depth, which really excites me because I don't think you can go to a tournament relying on a couple of players. 'We have shown across the campaign - we started with the likes of Raheem [Sterling] in, we have had Luke Shaw in, we have had to win matches without all of these players at different times, without Harry [Kane], without Saido [Berahino], and they have kept doing it. 'And then new players have emerged, people like Jesse [Lingard] , who has come back from injury and who has got great potential; Alex Pritchard has just come into the squad. 'The 23, I am probably reasonably clear on 21. There are a couple of places that still, in my mind, people are playing for, but I know whoever goes is totally committed. There won't be any loafing around, there won't be any lads who feel it's a chore to go. England boss Gareth Soutgate looks on during the friendly clash at the Riverside Stadium . 'They'll be in there backing their team-mates, and again, that's important going into a tournament.' England's players had to back each other throughout a testing 90 minutes on Teesside during which impressive Kaiserslautern striker Philipp Hofmann fired the visitors into a 15th-minute lead and after Manchester United winger Lingard, currently on loan at Derby, had levelled, restored their lead five minutes after the restart. But there was to be a twist and after Norwich's Nathan Redmond had made it 2-2 10 minutes from time, skipper James Ward-Prowse capped a fine individual display with an 82nd-minute winner, to the delight of a crowd of 30,178. Jess Lingard (centre) races off to celebrate his first goal for England's Under 21s . The England youngsters celebrate Ward-Prowse's later winner in front of the Riverside crowd . It proved the perfect conclusion to the perfect evening for Gibson, representing his country on his own home ground. He said: 'It was a fantastic occasion. Not just to represent your country, but to do it on your home ground is a bit of a dream come true. 'It was a fantastic moment and the fans were brilliant. I got a great reception and I can't thank them enough for that.'","England Under 21s defeated Germany Under 21s 3-2 on Monday night .

"Slavisa Jokanovic affords himself a sneaky peak through the green mesh fence at Watford's London Colney training ground. Next door Arsenal are going through their paces. It is not too revealing but for Jokanovic it is a glimpse into what he hopes is the very near future. The former Chelsea midfielder wants to manage a Premier League club and Watford, one of seven teams to have been top of the Championship so far this season, have a foot in the door. 'I take a little look now and again,' he says wryly. 'It's good to have them so close, it's a reminder of what we want to be. We can't get ahead of ourselves as this is an unforgiving division but it's the dream. It's our focus.' Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic hopes he can lead the club to the premier league next season . Jokanovic is the fourth man to be put in charge of Watford during this campaign and joined them in October . Unforgiving is befitting of a Championship promotion race that has nine teams still vying for a Premier League place with seven games remaining. The next week is a defining moment with Watford second in the table and facing rivals Derby County and Middlesbrough in their next two matches. The fact Watford are there at all is testament to the former Chelsea midfielder when you consider he is their fourth coach of the season. Perhaps ominously, he is also out of contract in the summer. 'It's true we didn't have the best start in terms of changes,' he says, with understatement. 'But I knew what I was coming to.' Italian Beppe Sannino began the season in charge and started well but his exit followed talk of dressing-room unrest. In a bizarre five-week period, Oscar Garcia succeeded Sannino but stepped down after suffering chest pains in his first game and was replaced by Billy McKinlay. Eight days later, after a win and a draw, owner Gino Pozzo called for Jokanovic, who had won two doubles with Partizan Belgrade and the Thai Premier League with Muangthong United. He was recommended to Pozzo by staff at one of the Italian businessman's other clubs, Granada, who recognised his ability to 'find solutions on a small budget'. Jokanovic shrugs. 'It was definitely strange. It's normal for other countries but unusual here,' he says. 'For me, it was just a great opportunity; a small door opened to a big chance. I didn't know the Championship well but I knew what to expect from my time at Chelsea. I've always watched English football and I believe in myself. 'You can look at the fact the club had three coaches before I arrived but I've never been one to worry about what may happen tomorrow, just try and control today. I was excited not worried. I knew there would be little money, that I couldn't bring my own staff but fortunately after a few days I found I was working with quality people. I'm confident I can make any team better. I've lived with pressure since I was 18. My family instilled the same principles, there's no magic formula, just a belief that if you work hard, life will treat you well.' Despite losing 1-0 to Ipswich in their last game, Watford are currently second in the Championship table . Watford midfielder Adlene Guedioura (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Ipswich's Kevin Bru (right) Jokanovic, or 'Slav' as he prefers, is outside the training ground canteen, sipping coffee. The 46-year-old Serb cuts an imposing figure. He is tall, lean, ruggedly handsome and has a disarming charm when he talks passionately about his desire to return to the Premier League. He was frustrated in the transfer window as the Pozzo principle is more about work than spending, often making players fit between their three clubs Watford, Granada and Udinese. He says Bournemouth are the best team in the league but believes he has four good strikers who can make a difference. As a player, he was the 2000 model of Chelsea's defensive midfield linchpin Nemanja Matic; signed by Claudio Ranieri from Deportivo La Coruna. His regret, you sense, is that the Premier League did not see the best of him. 'I was 32 — and a half! My best time had been at Deportivo but I still played 52 games for Chelsea,' he says. 'It was faster, stronger. 'My debut was against Liverpool in the Worthington Cup and I remember being tackled and playing up for the free-kick like we did in Spain but my team-mates turned, saying 'Get up, get on with it, we don't do that here'. I was used to playing a passing game, even if it meant going backwards, but the fans would shout and [coach] Ray Wilkins took me to one side and said, 'I know what you want to do but here you have to move it forward more quickly'. It was all part of learning a different culture, it was good preparation for when I came back.' He has kept in touch with former team-mates Gianfranco Zola and Gus Poyet. Both have been sacked in recent months but he does not feel the need to call. 'Now is a time for them to be with their own thoughts,' he says. 'They know my feelings for them. They are champions and good friends.' Jokanovic during his Chelsea days pulls back Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Tim Sherwood (right) Watford players celebrate after Troy Deeny's goal against Rotherham United in February at Vicarage Road . Home is a few miles away near St Albans. He is at the training ground for 8am and likes to be last to leave. It is a solitary existence as his wife and three children have remained in Madrid, their family home for the past 13 years. Indeed, Jokanovic holds a Spanish passport. 'My eldest daughter is 19 and she came over to visit but it helps that I'm on my own because it sharpens my focus. The job is my life. It consumes almost every hour whether I'm considering the bigger picture or small details. This season could come down to one corner or one free-kick. Listen, if a team in this title race lose concentration, they can pay a very expensive price. Sir Elton John has promised Watford players a big party if they can secure promotion to the Premier League . 'I know what getting into the Premier League means to everyone. I was introduced to Sir Elton John when he opened the stand at Vicarage Road named in his honour before Christmas and he's a good guy, he promised he'd send champagne and we'd have a great party if we go up.' Although he confesses Watford's 'Rocket man' is not on his iPod playlist, Jokanovic will occasionally watch his favourite Robert De Niro film, the gangster epic Once Upon a Time In America, and is reading Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography as he sources extra motivation. 'You always need to improve and find an edge so it makes sense to look at the man who won the Premier League more than anyone else. Hopefully, his words can help. I'm ready for this fight and I don't intend to surrender until I win it.' Whether it is admiring the neighbours or his reading material, Jokanovic is certainly looking in the right direction. If Jokanovic can secure Watford's return to the top flight, it will be their first appearance since 2006-07 .","Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic is targeting promotion to the Premier League this season .

"Theo Walcott will return to Arsenal with Roy Hodgson's warning ringing loud and clear. 'An important few months,' said the England boss, and that was before a frustrating night spent all-too-easily shackled by three Italian centre-halves. Starved of the ball in an unfamiliar position in an even less familiar line-up it was easy to feel sympathy for Walcott as he was hauled off after 55 minutes in Turin. Theo Walcott struggled for England against Italy and was starved of the ball playing in an unfamiliar position . But sympathy won't do him much good. What he needs is football and plenty of it if he is to recapture the zip, rediscover his rhythms and regain ground on those who have passed him at club and country. With a contract set to expire next year and Arsene Wenger seemingly reluctant to offer him game time, even when Alexis Sanchez is running on empty, there is lots to consider. Unlike those striking deals to be excused a half here and a game there, Walcott reported for international duty desperate to feature. He added two more caps. He was encouraged to get the nod to come on ahead of Andros Townsend against Lithuania and thrilled at the chance to start against Italy but it was heavy going. Walcott shoots at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Tottenham winger Andros Townsend came on, also out of position, and fired home England's equaliser . England improved as an attacking threat after Michael Carrick's introduction towards the end of the first-half and pulled level as the game became disrupted by substitutions. To make matters worse for Walcott, it was Townsend who came on, also playing out of position on the left of Hodgson's midfield diamond, and fired a terrific equaliser past Gianluigi Buffon. Walcott goes back to Arsenal to prepare for Liverpool on Saturday, but when Wenger catches up on this game, he will not see any compelling evidence to offer a recall to the first team against one of the clubs likely to show interest if he is to leave the Emirates Stadium. That is not a decision he has yet made. But it will emerge as a possibility if Walcott cannot impose himself on the end of the season. He has just turned 26, he has been an England international for nearly nine years – this was his 38th cap - and he needs to play regularly. If he is on the market, there will be demand from Barclays Premier League clubs anxious to add to their English contingent, but he has to choose carefully. Arsenal may ultimately make the decision for him. England winger Walcott failed to make an impact for the Three Lions as his touch map (right) shows . In Turin, Walcott was starting his first international start for 18 months, having played less than nine hours of competitive football since damaging cruciate ligaments in January last year. When he was injured he was playing up front in an FA Cup tie against Spurs. It' s safe to assume that at that point he did not expect his next England start to be in tandem with Harry Kane, who was on the Tottenham bench that day. Their partnership is unlikely to be rekindled. It started badly, with a moment of miscommunication with Kieran Gibbs, his Arsenal team-mate. Walcott turned and dashed away while Gibbs rolled a pass into the area he had just vacated. Then his touch let him down. His touch was too poor too often, a clue to his lack of match sharpness. The failure of either Kane or Walcott to hold up the ball contributed to an insipid start and the gentle rhythms of the first-half seemed to have sent the crowd to sleep until Graziano Pelle stirred them with his goal. Walcott dropped deeper in search of the ball. His touch was better when he accepted a long, wonderful right-to-left pass from Wayne Rooney, just before Pelle scored. He tried to duck onto his right foot and curl one towards the far post but his effort was blocked by Andrea Ranocchia. Walcott, pictured against Italy's Leonardo Bonucci, lacked match sharpness after his time on the sidelines . That was his only real sniff of goal. Another chance was smothered after a knock-down from Kane. England were flat in the first-half, and less effective on the turnover than they have been. They never utilised Walcott's pace in behind and so did not unleash his greatest asset, although Ian Wright partly blamed the Arsenal man for making the wrong runs. This is one reason he will remain primarily a winger. He can finish and has a healthy goal rate at the time of his injury but he thrives in the open. He was too easily policed by the Italians, but so was Kane, the hottest striker in England. At the start of the second-half, Walcott switched roles with Rooney, playing in the N.10 position, one he is even less familiar with. But, 10 minutes after the break, he was replaced by Ross Barkley, who also made a good impression. The work out will do him no harm, but Walcott is in danger of slipping down the order at England as well as Arsenal. None of which bodes well for his chances of getting what he really needs at club or country. Harry Kane, the Premier League's joint-top scorer, was easily dealt with by Giorgio Chiellini and Co . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley and the England team seemed more comfortable with the Everton man .","Theo Walcott is entering an 'important few months' says Roy Hodgson .

"Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright has urged Arsene Wenger to sign Raheem Sterling as the Liverpool forward's contract talks continues to stall. It emerged on Monday that the England international is prepared to turn down a whopping £180,000-per-week to stay at Anfield.

"Arsene Wenger was handed a timely boost ahead of his side's trip to Liverpool this weekend as several first-team players continued their comebacks from injury. England midfielder Jack Wilshere played 45 minutes and opened the scoring in a friendly against Brentford - his first run-out for the team since suffering an injury against Manchester United in November. Club captain Mikel Arteta, also absent since November, managed to get through the first half, while French full back Mathieu Debuchy completed 60 minutes.

Abou Diaby carries the ball out of defence as Mathieu Debuchy (left) and Mikel Arteta (right) look on . Debuchy has struggled with injuries in his first season at the club and is currently recovering from his second serious setback of the season, a shoulder injury sustained against Stoke. Compatriot Mathieu Flamini - who hasn't started a game since February but has been fit enough for the bench in recent weeks - also lasted over an hour, while Abou Diaby managed to play half the match  as he continues his return from yet another injury. Diaby has played just once this season for the first team - in the Capital One Cup - and three games for the Under 21s. He is hoping to prove himself worthy of a new contract after a career blighted with injuries. The quartet could now be available for the visit of Brendan Rodgers' side this weekend. Danny Welbeck, though, remains a doubt after picking up a knee injury during England's win over Lithuania on Friday night. Debuchy, who has struggled since joining Arsenal, has been out since January when he injured his shoulder . Diaby has been blighted by injuries for the best part of a decade and could be about to leave Arsenal . The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and has played just once for the first team this season .

There was also a run-out for January signing Krystian Bielik, who is yet to feature for the senior side under Arsene Wenger. But it will be Wilshere's return, coupled with a strong performance, which pleased Wenger most, the 23-year-old marking his comeback with a goal and an assist. The England star put Arsenal ahead after just  seven minutes before playing in promising youngster Dan Crowley for the second 12 minutes later.

"Shaun Edwards says that Wales see 'a lot of potential' in uncapped Exeter prop Tomas Francis. The York-born tighthead qualifies for Wales through his grandmother, and he has proved an important part of Exeter's ongoing push for Aviva Premiership play-off status this season. And the 22-year-old has now been invited to train with the Wales squad by head coach Warren Gatland as they go into the final stages of their RBS 6 Nations campaign. Exeter tighthead prop Tomas Francis (top right) has been called up to train with the Wales squad . 'His scrummaging is outstanding, but he is also a skilful player as well,' Wales assistant coach and defence specialist Edwards said. 'Francis is a big kid, and I have seen him play. The scrum at Exeter has been going excellently recently, so we have brought him in. 'He is a young man who is coming from a great environment at Exeter which prides itself on hard work, and we would like to think we are a similar sort of environment. 'It's a case of trying to get the best players playing for us, and we see a lot of potential in this lad.' Francis, who weighs in at more than 20 stone, played Championship rugby for Doncaster and London Scottish before he was snapped up by Exeter, and he could easily push for a World Cup squad place with Wales later this year if he continues to impress. Wales coach Shaun Edwards says that Wales see 'a lot of potential' in uncapped Exeter prop Francis . Experienced Scarlets hooker Ken Owens, meanwhile, has been called into the Six Nations squad and reported for duty at Wales' training base on Monday. Wales, despite losing their opening Six Nations game to England, have given themselves a fighting chance of landing a third title in four years following successive away victories over Scotland and France. Reigning champions and unbeaten title favourites Ireland are next up in five days' time, and Edwards is under no illusion how big a task will be presented by Joe Schmidt's team. 'We have looked at our opponents, and we are coming up against the best team in Europe, the form team in Europe,' Edwards added. The 22-year-old was invited to train with the Wales squad by head coach Warren Gatland . 'They have got two brilliant half-backs, for a start, who have got great tactical brains. 'They have a strike-runner on the outside in Tommy Bowe who maybe the best defensive winger in the northern hemisphere. He is magnificent in picking up interceptions, and we have to keep our eye on Tommy. 'The forwards are well-drilled and a cohesive unit, and play with a lot of passion and aggression, and they have got excellent coaches. 'These are the big games you get excited about, and big-time players rise to the challenge.' Two key areas that Wales will need to perform strongly in are the lineout, where Ireland will be spearheaded by their captain Paul O'Connell, and shackling an impressive new Irish midfield combination of Jared Payne and Robbie Henshaw. Francis played Championship rugby for Doncaster and London Scottish before he was snapped up by Exeter . Edwards said: 'They (O'Connell and Devin Toner) are a very experienced second-row pairing. 'Having worked with Paul, he is a very wily operator and a guy who I have huge respect for. 'Our guys will have their work cut out at lineout time, but they have already been in this morning having meetings and looking at the different structures. They know we are in for a challenge in that area, and I am sure they are up for it. 'And I have been very impressed with them (Ireland centres). 'I knew more about Payne, having watched Ulster more than Connacht. But Henshaw is a big physical guy, and Payne has a cutting edge on the outside. It's important we don't give them any space whatsoever.'","Tomas Francis has been called up to train with the Wales squad .

"Johnny Sexton must come through 'modified training' to prove his fitness for Ireland's pivotal RBS 6 Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff. Ireland's lynchpin fly-half has 'hit all his markers so far' in battling hamstring trouble, but is still fighting to recover to face Wales on Saturday, according to team manager Mick Kearney. Number eight Jamie Heaslip was due to take contact training on Monday for the first time since fracturing three vertebrae in his back against France on February 14. Ireland's Johnny Sexton is winning his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday . The Leinster stalwart is now expected to be fit to face Wales, where victory would leave Ireland almost nailed-on for the Grand Slam. 'Johnny Sexton continues to improve following a mild hamstring strain,' said Kearney. 'As a precaution he will have modified training during the early part of the week with an expectation that he will train fully towards the end of the week. 'We are very happy where he is at, at the moment. He has hit all his markers so far. 'Johnny will have modified training in the early part of the week and if he comes through training through the latter part of the week, he will be available for selection. Sexton has come through all the tests asked of him so far but there is still a chance he could miss the game . 'Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection. 'Sean O'Brien and Jared Payne have both progressed well through the return to play protocol and will be re-introduced to full training during the week. 'Johnny will have modified training today. Jamie will train fully today.' Team manager Kearney admitted British and Irish Lions Sexton and Heaslip are both 'extremely eager' to face Wales this weekend. Ireland are gunning to retain the Six Nations title for the first time since 1949, and also claim a second Grand Slam in six years. Sexton limped out of the latter stages of Ireland's 19-9 victory over England in Dublin on March 1 and has been battling to recover ever since. The 29-year-old has a history of hamstring problems, but Kearney does not expect that to colour his recovery. Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection . 'From what I remember the last time he had a problem was between the Australia game and New Zealand game, in the November series just over 12 months ago,' said Kearney. 'He actually recovered pretty quickly then. 'He came off at half-time against Australia and was fit to play and played the whole game, or most of the game against New Zealand without any issue. 'That certainly wouldn't be a worry at the moment. 'Jamie (Heaslip) hasn't taken any contact yet. He will train fully today and provided there is no reaction he should be available for selection. 'They are extremely eager, absolutely: very eager to play.' Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy has been drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad . Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy was drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad for the final two weeks of Six Nations action. Ireland must win in Wales and Scotland to secure the Grand Slam and retain their Six Nations title - but, barring injury, will do so without veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy. The 35-year-old Leinster centre has been omitted from Schmidt's training squad, with Ulster's Darren Cave and Munster's Keith Earls providing midfield cover. Team manager Kearney refused to accept D'Arcy's absence could spark the end of his glittering 81-cap Test career however. His long-term centre sparring partner Brian O'Driscoll retired last summer, but D'Arcy himself has always been determined to push on to this year's World Cup. 'That is a selection issue, yes,' said Kearney of D'Arcy's absence. 'Gordon has been an unbelievable servant for Irish rugby. 'He's back fit, back playing for Leinster, so certainly I wouldn't rule him out for future consideration.' Both teams must give consent for Saturday's Millennium Stadium match to be played under a closed roof. Team manager Kearney said Ireland will delay their decision until later in the week, and base it around the chances of rain. 'We are waiting to see what the weather forecast turns out like,' said Kearney. 'We don't have to make a decision on that until 7pm on Thursday. 'We will wait until then before we make a final decision. 'I think overall, our preference would be for a dry day and decent weather, rather than wet and miserable weather. 'In good weather our preference would be for it to be open.'","Fly-half Johnny Sexton has 'hit all his markers' in battling hamstring issues .

"Hector Bellerin's remarkable rise this season has been a surprising, but important component of Arsenal's recent form, and the Spanish youngster says it justifies leaving Barcelona.

'I got the chance and I took it', he told Spanish paper Marca. 'Wherever you are, you have to work. If I'd stayed at Barcelona, I don't know if I'd have made it to the elite, you just never know. 'I've worked as hard as I could and always had the mentality of reaching the top. Whether I was in one place or another, I'd have done the same.' Although he knows breaking through at Barca would have been tougher than in the Premier League, Bellerin refused to accept that English football is that far behind La Liga, despite our teams' failure in the Champions League this season. Bellerin was on loan at Watford last season, but is now a Premier League regular under Arsene Wenger . 'A lot of people in Spain watch Premier League games and know what kind of a league it is, he added. 'It would be madness to say that it isn't among the best leagues in the world.

"Legendary Italian goalkeper Gianluigi Buffon has been ruled out of his country's important Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria on Satuday night with flu and is a doubt for their friendly against England in Turin on Tuesday. Buffon, 37, was left back at his hotel as his team-mates arrived at the National Stadium in Sofia with Paris St Germain No1 Salvatore Sirigu named in Antonio Conte's starting XI. The Azzurri will be skippered in Buffon's absence by Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, famous for being the victim of Luis Suarez's bite at last summer's World Cup. Gianluigi Buffon has been ruled out of Italy's crucial European Championships qualifier against Bulgaria . The legendary Italian goalkeeper has flu and may also miss Tuesday's match against England in Turin . Buffon's illness is the latest piece of bad news for Conte who has been blamed by Juventus fans for over-training his players and causing midfielder Claudio Marchisio to sprain his knee in training on Friday. Marchisio is ruled out for an estimated two weeks though earlier reports that he had suffered knee ligament damage appear exaggerated. Conte received death threats on the internet following Marchisio's injury according to the Italian federation president Carlo Tavecchio. Buffon was all set to start in goal on Saturday night, but has now pulled out through illness . The news comes as a further blow to Italy manager Antonio Conte, who has received death threats this week .

"England goal hero Harry Kane enjoyed his first taste of international football and now he is hungry for more. Kane took just 79 seconds to make his mark on international football by scoring the final goal in England's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley on Friday. The 21-year-old peeled away from his marker and nodded Raheem Sterling's cross in at the far post with just his third touch since coming off the bench.

John Cock                       30 . Harry Kane                     79 . After enjoying such a remarkable season with Tottenham, it did not come as a surprise that Kane made such a dramatic entrance to the international arena. The forward has now scored 30 goals so far this term and he was delighted to turn his boyhood dream into reality at Wembley. 'It's a dream come true. Obviously I was very excited to make my debut, and to score as well is what I dreamed of as a little kid,' Kane told Sky Sports News. 'It was a special night, a proud night, and one I won't be forgetting for a while.' Many goal-scoring debutants have seen their England careers quickly fizzle out into nothing. Francis Jeffers and David Nugent found the net on their first appearances and never played for their country again. Kieran Richardson took four minutes to break his international duck against the United States in 2005. He scored again 40 minutes later, but never started another game for the Three Lions.

Kieran Richardson scored twice against the USA in 2005, the last time he pulled on an England shirt . CLICK HERE to read how the Spurs striker fared on his Three Lions bow . Roy Hodgson believes Kane is here to stay, though, and the player himself is desperate to earn more caps. 'This is where I want to be, playing for England and scoring goals,' Kane said. 'It's my first taste of it and I loved it and hopefully I can keep doing well for club and country and see where it takes us.' Danny Welbeck's withdrawal through injury increased Kane's chances of starting against Italy in Turin. And the striker is ready to answer Hodgson's call if needed. 'That's down to the boss, but I'll be ready, raring to go if called upon. I will be looking forward to it,' Kane said. 'The lads have picked up some really good results home and away. We continued that against Lithuania and now we have a tough game coming up, but we are full of confidence.' If Hodgson brought Kane into the starting line-up, he would have to dispense with the 4-3-3 formation that worked so well against Lithuania, unless he started Wayne Rooney as one of the two wide-men alongside Kane. He is more likely to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with Kane and Rooney up front as a strike partnership. Kane's chances of facing Italy were raised after Danny Welbeck was forced to withdraw with injury . The Spurs striker could form a partnership with Wayne Rooney after replacing the captain on Friday . Hodgson was giving little away about team selection for Italy, but he accepts he will face increasing calls for Kane to start after his stunning debut. 'If I listened to clamour every time then a lot of players would be playing from the start in the next game,' said Hodgson, who has also released Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines from his squad. 'People come and go but I think Harry is here to stay. 'It could well happen (that Kane starts). We won't have Sterling and Welbeck so his chances increase all the time.' Hodgson was keen not to burden the youngster with even more pressure although he admits the forward's debut could not have gone any better. 'The word fairytale comes to mind and it's great when fairytales come true in this way,' Hodgson added. 'I'm delighted for him, he's had a good week in training and we've been quite excited to see him. 'But let's keep things in perspective, for him it's been a whirlwind romance for him in terms of playing top-class football and, if anything, I would like to try and relieve the pressure on him rather than heap pressure on him.' Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up as cover for Kieran Gibbs . The 20 players left in the squad were given the rest of Saturday off after a morning warm-down session and team meeting. They will train again on Sunday, when Ryan Bertrand will join in after being called up as back-up for Kieran Gibbs. Seven of the 17 players left in the squad are yet to reach 10 caps, so Hodgson knows stretching England's winning streak to eight matches will be difficult. 'It will be an enormous test for the ones we put in because some of them won't have played in the national team for a long time and they are going to be playing against a top team, but we need a good squad going forward and we need competition for places,' Hodgson said.","Harry Kane scored on his England debut in 4-0 defeat of Lithuania .

"Harry Kane took only 79 seconds to open his account for England, but there are two other players who took even less time to find the back of the net on their debuts. The Tottenham striker continued his sensational scoring form this season by netting the final goal in England's 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier defeat of Lithuania shortly after coming on at Wembley on Friday night. However, the 21-year-old's strike was precisely a minute slower than legendary Spurs manager Bill Nicholson while John Cock also scored in less than half the time on his debut for the Three Lions. Harry Kane Wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal . The Spurs striker headed in at the far post from a Raheem Sterling cross shortly after coming at Wembley . England debutant's fastest goals: . Bill Nicholson                  19secs . John Cock                       30 . Harry Kane                     79 . Nicholson scored after only 19 seconds against Portugal in 1951. He remains the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again. Cock, who was also the first Cornishman to play for the national team, was on target after 30 seconds against Ireland in 1919. Cock would go on to win only one more cap, scoring against Scotland in 1920. Kane had scored just one Premier League goal when Roy Hodgson's men last took to the field more than four months ago, but his rise has been so rapid that the striker's introduction at Wembley was met by a standing ovation on Friday.

"Italy's controversial debutant Eder saved his adopted country from a major embarrassment with a fantastic late strike to lift spirits ahead of their friendly against England on Tuesday. Criticism aimed at Azzurri coach Antonio Conte for picking the Brazilian-born Eder – named by his football-loving parents after the 1982 Brazil World Cup star of the same name – was forgotten as the Sampdoria striker produced a brilliant finish after 84 minutes to preserve Italy's unbeaten record in Euro 2016 qualifying Group H. Italy striker Eder (left) celebrates scoring late equaliser with coach Antonio Conte . Eder's late strike extended Italy's unbeaten run in Euro qualifying to 45 matches . Bulgaria (4-2-3-1): Mihailov, Manolev, Bodurov, Aleksandar Aleksandrov, Minev, Gadzhev, Dyakov, Milanov (Ventsislav Vasilev 88), Popov (Slavchev 85), Mihail Aleksandrov, Mitsanski (Bojinov 73). Subs Not Used: Stoyanov, Bandalovski, Stoychev, Terziev, Malinov, Chochev, Tonev, Radoslav Vasilev, Mitrev. Booked: Dyakov. Goals: Popov 11, Mitsanski 17.

Subs Not Used: Marchetti, Moretti, Cerci, Ranocchia, Valdifiori, Parolo, Pelle, Vazquez. Booked: Immobile, Soriano,Darmian. Goals: Minev 4 og, Eder 84. Att: 6,000 . Ref: Damir Skomina (Slovenia). Eder Citadin Martins, to give him his full title, turned brilliantly on the edge of the penalty area and hammered a right-foot curler that gave goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov no chance. Ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, now in charge of Inter Milan, was among those who opposed his selection and said the Azzurri should only pick Italian-born players. Eder didn't move to Italy until he was 16. His late equaliser saved Italy from a major humiliation in rain-soaked Sofia. Despite being gifted an early lead with an own goal, Conte's team then capitulated to trail 2-1 after 17 minutes against opponents who had only managed to beat Azerbaijan in their other four group games. Even so, the Italian manager now faces an uncertain reception in Turin against Roy Hodgson's Three Lions with Juventus fans also blaming him for a knee injury to midfielder Claudio Marchisio sustained in Azzurri training on Friday. Italian Football Federation President Carlo Tavecchio claimed on Saturday that death threats issued over the internet against Conte had left the manager “shaken” and angry. Conte left Juventus to replace Cesare Prandelli after last summer's World Cup and he rounded on his critics after Saturday night's draw by saying: 'I am Ok – but I don't forget. You can draw your own conclusions. Ivelin Popov equalised for Bulgaria with an 11th-minute strike on Saturday night . Kuban Krasnodar midfielder Popov celebrates his goal against Italy in Sofia . Ciro Immobile of Italy challenges Aleksandar Aleksandrov and goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov . 'In terms of the performance and the chances created, we deserved the victory. It’s a shame, as we achieved the bare minimum with the utmost effort in an arena that is traditionally difficult. 'I liked the lads, we dominated the game and they were restricted purely to counter-attacks.' Bulgaria are a far cry from Hristo Stoichkov's side that reached the World Cup semi-finals in 1994. And the match seemed to be going according to the formbook after four minutes when goalkeeper Mihaylov pushed a cross into the path of defender Yordan Minev who couldn't help it crossing the line for an own goal. Without legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon who was taken ill with flu shortly before the match, Italy's traditionally-strong rearguard was left all at sea.

Paris St Germain No1 Salvatore Sirigu didn't look a bad replacement but he had no chance with Bulgaria's equaliser after 11 minutes when Ivelin Popov took advantage of a back-pedalling defence to arrow in a low shot from 18 yards. Incredibly, Bulgaria then quickly went ahead. Italian striker Simone Zaza carelessly lost the ball by the halfway line going for a mazy dribble and the home side counter-attacked at speed. Georgi Milanov's pinpoint cross to the far post was aimed for Ilian Micanski and he got ahead of sluggish defender Andrea Barzagli to expertly headed in beyond Sirigu. It was beyond the dreams of the Bulgarian fans, most of whom were getting thoroughly soaked by a torrential downpour. In fact, the National Stadium was only half-full because of low expectation among home fans but those who turned up were rewarded. Conte sent on Eder for Zaza as a desperate measure to salvage a point – and it worked. Italy, second in their group, are now firm favourites to qualify for Euro 2016 alongside leaders Croatia who they face in Zagreb in June. Conte will definitely be without Marchisio for England's visit even though initial reports the midfielder suffered ligament damage look unfounded with medical tests showing nothing more serious than a sprain while Buffon will do his best to return from his illness. The only Premier League player on show, Southampton striker Graziano Pelle, was an unused substitute for Italy but could face England and his Saints team-mate Nathaniel Clyne this week.","Italy had grabbed the lead in the fourth minute when the Bulgarian left back Yordan Minev put the ball into his own net .

"There is a digital clock in the foyer of the old RFU offices on Rugby Road that is counting down to the beginning of the World Cup. As England walked out to play Scotland yesterday evening, it said there were 180 days to go. Everything England do in this Six Nations is being seen through the prism of their prospects in the tournament which will start here at Twickenham on September 18 with their opener against Fiji. When Stuart Lancaster’s side failed their biggest test of this competition, slumping to a shattering 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium a fortnight ago, many observers said the rest of the Six Nations was redundant for them. Exeter wing Jack Nowell crosses over to score England's third try and send them top of the Six Nations table . Ben Youngs hands off a tackle as England recovered from a half-time deficit to win at Twickenham . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . They said that the match against Ireland was the only game that could tell us whether England were making significant progress in the build-up to the World Cup and nothing that happened in their last two games against France or Scotland mattered. They were damned for the manner of their defeat, of course. Unflattering comparisons were drawn with where this side stands six months before the World Cup to the level Clive Woodward’s side had reached at the same stage prior to the 2003 tournament. ‘Based on their performances in the Six Nations, England are running the risk of being labelled the most foolish team in the competition,’ England World Cup winner Will Greenwood wrote. ‘England need to play with tempo, yes, but they need to do it with their rugby brains fully engaged and that is not what they have been doing at key moments.’ England won the game but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations . Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham . Despite the predictions, though, Saturday's battle for the Calcutta Cup told us plenty about England’s prospects in the autumn. It wasn’t all good by any means. In fact, the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that England are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the World Cup. It felt like a wasted opportunity. Despite concerns that the match had not sold out, the atmosphere at Twickenham had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from Cardiff where Wales’ victory over Ireland put England back in with a chance of winning the Six Nations. When England tore Scotland apart in the opening minutes, it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success. That feeling did not last for long. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup . Defeating Scotland however will not lead the top nations to fear England, and time is running out . England were not ruthless enough in attack. They squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways, eschewing easy passes, making the wrong decisions. They should have scored four tries before half-time but they were limited to Jonathan Joseph’s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game. It seemed then as if England were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend. That rampage did not materialise. Instead, Scotland came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about England. This time, it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the Welsh earlier in the day. Mark Bennett bulldozed his way over for a score with Scotland’s first chance of the game midway through the half. Twickenham may still be a formidable place to get a result, but England are not unbeatable there . Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit . England allowed Scotland back into the game too easily, and they lack momentum heading to the World Cup . Scotland actually led 13-10 at the interval. Their supporters began to dream of a first victory at Twickenham for 32 years. It was hardly the response to the defeat in Dublin that Lancaster was looking for. ‘England need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face,’ Woodward said at half-time. England banished that idea when George Ford burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but, even though Scotland never threatened again, England remained unconvincing. There were times when they seemed to be trying to set a new record for ways in which they could ruin their good work. Anthony Watson runs clear but England repeatedly failed to take their chances at Twickenham on Saturday . Twice they had tries ruled out for forward passes. A late score in the corner from Jack Nowell put a healthier gloss on the result but they will only take a four-point advantage over Ireland into the deciding weekend. It should have been more and when the final whistle went, it was met only by lukewarm applause. Sure, England may yet win the Six Nations next Saturday but the truth is that there is no sense of momentum about their build-up to the World Cup. There are moments when they excite, certainly, but there are times when they bewilder, too. The suspicion remains that even here at Twickenham, the best in the world will be too much for them in the autumn. And all the time, that clock in the old RFU headquarters keeps on counting down.","England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham but missed several chances .
The biggest test for Stuart Lancaster's side came in defeat by Ireland .
But even after setback, England had chance to lay down a marker .

"Jonny Howson's double inspired Norwich as they maintained their promotion charge in style with a ruthless 4-1 triumph over relegation threatened Millwall at The Den. The hosts spurned numerous chances in a tense first half before Howson surged from midfield to fire a sublime left-footed strike beyond keeper David Forde. Gary Hooper doubled Norwich's lead with a penalty just before the break after Cameron Jerome was felled by Alan Dunne, before Wes Hoolahan made it three and Howson scored his second on the hour. Jonathan Howson scores the first goal of the game during the Championship match at The Den . Howson celebrates his opener with Norwich City teammate Bradley Johnson as the Canaries smash Millwall . It's all too easy for the away side as they deal Millwall manager Ian Holloway yet another striking blow . A stunned Millwall found enough resilience to claim a goal back after Diego Fabbrini won a penalty that Lee Gregory converted but it was too little too late to ease the pressure on beleaguered manager Ian Holloway. After sustained Norwich pressure for the first 20 minutes, Millwall began to respond, as Jos Hooiveld saw his powerful volley blocked by Carlos Cuellar before Ricardo Fuller struck team-mate Martyn Woolford with another effort. The lively Fuller continued to threaten as first Cuellar and then Martin Olsson clumsily fouled the striker on the edge of the area, but the hosts squandered both opportunities from either side of the box. Gary Hooper celebrates his goal from the penalty spot as Norwich all but seal the points at The Den . Norwich City's Wesley Hoolahan celebrates scoring their third goal in the win against Millwall on Saturday . The hosts' wastefulness was duly punished in the 38th minute when Howson surged through midfield and struck an exquisite drive beyond Forde from outside the area to give Norwich the lead. While Howson's goal was slightly harsh on Millwall, the hosts had themselves to blame for Norwich's second on the stroke of half time. Graham Dorrans' long-range effort was saved well by Forde, only for Alan Dunne to needlessly fell Jerome as the striker went to retrieve the rebound, with Hooper firing the resulting penalty straight down the middle. Millwall manager Holloway looks on as his Lions are tamed by the Canaries at The Den on Saturday . Norwich City manager Alex Neil gives his squad the thumbs up as they comfortably see off Millwall . Millwall's Shaun Williams (left) and Martyn Woolford combine to stop Norwich City's Johnson . Norwich had barely broken sweat in establishing a two-goal advantage and had a chance to make it three soon after the restart but Jerome headed Olsson's cross straight at Forde. Yet it was not long before the visitors effectively ended the contest as a slip by Millwall's Sid Nelson was capitalised on ruthlessly by Hoolahan, who drove a left-footed strike beyond Forde on 57 minutes. And just three minutes later, the Canaries claimed a fourth all too easily as Jerome broke down the left before calmly delivering the ball across the box for Howson to slot into the empty net. Norwich City striker Cameron Jerome wins a header unchallenged as the away side easy to victory . The hosts were now conceding chances with alarming regularity as Jerome went close twice before Dorrans struck the inside of the right post after Hoolahan found the West Brom loanee unmarked on 68 minutes. The hosts claimed a goal back in the 82nd minute as Fabbrini drew Gary O'Neil into a foul in the area and substitute Gregory struck the penalty into the bottom right corner.

"Felix Magath has refused to rule out a role in a restructured management team at Rangers. A three-time Bundesliga-winning coach with Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg, the German legend purchased 810,000 shares in the Ibrox club in January. And Magath has proxied his stake to the Rangers Supporters Trust ahead of a General Meeting Thursday which is expected to sweep the current board from power. Felix Magath has refused to rule out a role in a restructured management team at Rangers . Magath has not had a job since being sacked from Championship side Fulham last year . The appointment of a new football management set-up will be a priority thereafter, with Magath touted for a technical director role at the club. Out of work since leaving Fulham in September, the 61-year-old declined to close the door on a job at Rangers, telling Sportsmail: ‘I would not rule it out. ‘I don’t know. At the moment I am fine. I follow things at Rangers closely. We have to wait for Friday then we will see what is happening. ‘I am keeping in touch with things, for sure. I am interested in the situation at Rangers because I have bought shares, so of course I have an interest. But I’m not involved as such. I have an interest, but I am not there. I am just waiting for the result of the vote on Friday like other people.’ Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall has already tendered 12 months’ notice and admits Saturday’s trip to Cowdenbeath could be his final game in charge. Asked if it could be his last stand, McDowall said: ‘It could very well be, but I could have said that right from the start. Kenny McDowall will leave his post at rangers at the end of the current season after handing in his notice . Rangers players train at Murray Park last month as they bid to get their season back on track . Rangers manager McDowall during a training session at Murray Park on Wednesday afternoon . ‘This is probably my last game, but I have handed my notice in and have 10 months or so to do and if I need to be here for the 10 months I have said all along that’s what I will do. Whether I am in charge or coaching — if the club need me I am here.’ McDowall has warned supporters that, even if King and allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan do claim the keys to Ibrox, it could still take five years to rebuild the shattered club. ‘I think fans understand the need to be patient,’ said the former No2 to Ally McCoist, ‘because they know what has gone on here. It won’t be overnight. ‘At least five years I think, until it can be what it was. The whole infrastructure has got to be looked at. It has pretty much been decimated over the last four years. ‘This is a long-term project, it’s not going to be fixed overnight. No chance. That’s why it’s so important whoever comes in that they get it right.’","Former Fulham manager Felix Magath owns shares in Rangers .

"Holywell (Cheltenham, 3.20) is a horse that polarises opinion, but his Festival record is beyond criticism and he can silence his doubters with victory at the highest level in Friday's Betfred Gold Cup. Victories in the Pertemps Final and in a fiercely competitive handicap chase at the past two Festivals endorse the view that Jonjo O’Neill is a master at bringing the eight-year-old to a peak in the spring and, after a couple of modest efforts, he looked on good terms again with a better round of jumping last time in a small-field Kelso event. Holywell polarises opinion but can silence his doubters with victory in Friday's Betfred Gold Cup . Wins in the Pertemps Final (above) in the past two Festival's handicap chase endorse his Cheltenham form . Jonjo O’Neill is a master at bringing the eight-year-old Holywell to a peak in the spring . The bare form of that success is miles away from the requisite level on Friday, but when Holywell is good he is very good, as he was at Cheltenham last year when beating Thursday's Ryanair Chase runner-up Ma Filleule. A subsequent Aintree success was arguably more impressive where the selection destroyed Don Cossack and fellow Gold Cup contender Many Clouds, among others in the Grade One Mildmay Novices’ Chase, a display which truly announced him as a potential Gold Cup winner. He must progress again to trouble King George Chase hero Silviniaco Conti, who sets a lofty standard for his 17 rivals to surpass, but the ante-post favourite must exorcise the memories of a capitulation after the last fence a year ago, where he faded to finish fourth. Paul Nicholls is convinced the stomach ulcers and breathing problems which beset Silviniaco Conti are behind him and he remains a huge danger to all, even granted his modest course record. Paul Nicholls' Silviniaco Conti has a modest course record but still poses a danger to the field . Stablemate Sam Winner was an honourable third to Road To Riches in the Lexus Chase, and looks a huge price given he has tons of track form and just three lengths to make up with Noel Meade’s charge. The form of his gritty defeat of The Druids Nephew here before Christmas has taken a sizeable boost this week with that rival bolting up and the tongue tie and cheekpieces are utilised in combination for the first time, which appears a shrewd move. His handler has sent out 36 horses to contest the Gold Cup and 18 have won or been placed, so he merits real consideration for a tasty each-way wager.","Holywell has an excellent record at Cheltenham and could go all the way .

"David Sisi will rejoin former club London Irish on a season-long loan from Bath this summer. The 22-year-old London Irish academy graduate will return to the Madejski Stadium club for the entire campaign, in a bid for regular first-team rugby. Sisi joined Bath in the summer of 2013 when the Recreation Ground club completed an extensive raid on some of Irish's prized assets. Bath back-rower David Sisi will rejoin London Irish on a season-long loan from next season . The Germany-born back-rower followed Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and Matt Garvey in making the switch from Irish to Bath. Former London Irish coaches Toby Booth and Neal Hatley were able to entice that clutch of talent out along the M4 to Bath, and now Sisi is travelling the other way - in the short term, at least. 'I'm excited to be returning to London Irish on loan next season,' said Sisi. 'It will be great to go back to a club that has done so much for me in the past and I'm looking forward to making the most of the opportunity over the season. 'All young players need consistent game time to help them improve and learn, and the back row is such a competitive position at Bath that this is a really good opportunity for me to get that time on the pitch.' The German-born forward (centre) will return to his former club in a bid for regular first-team rugby . Full-back Tom Homer is the latest Irish player to make the Bath switch, joining head coach Mike Ford's squad earlier this term. Former Irish prop Max Lahiff has also joined Bath this season, further swelling the Reading ex-pats in the west country. Sisi will return to Bath for the 2016-17 season, by which time the coaching staff hope he will be ready to challenge the likes of Francois Louw and Leroy Houston for starts in the back-row. 'Dave is a very talented young player, so we're looking forward to seeing how he progresses with London Irish before coming back to us,' said Bath boss Mike Ford. 'We want our young players to become the best players they can be, and this loan move gives Dave that chance.' Sisi (top) joined Bath from Irish in the summer of 2013 - having graduated from the Exiles' academy system . Junior World Championship winner Sisi blazed a trail through London Irish's much-vaunted academy system, and operations director Bob Casey is delighted to welcome back the young talent. The Exiles are rebuilding under new ownership and more stable investment, with new coach Tom Coventry arriving to take the helm for next season. 'David joined London Irish at 16 and came through our AASE and academy programmes,' said Casey. 'We are delighted he will be returning to the club next season. 'He is young, English and can play across the entire back row and is ambitious and excited about the challenge of returning to London Irish.'","David Sisi left London Irish for Bath in the summer of 2013 .

"The United Arab Emirates have been suspended by the International Equestrian Federation  indefinitely over horse welfare and rule infringements in endurance events. Under the ban UAE riders will not be allowed to compete for their country in any international events, although they will be allowed to compete under an FEI flag in non-endurance disciplines outside of the Emirates. There has been growing concern over the treatment of endurance horses in the UAE and the world body recently stepped in to remove two endurance events in UAE from the winter season. Three horses were reported dead at the 74-mile Al Reef Cup in Abu Dhabi on February 1 and one, Splitters Creek Bundy, appeared to have broken both front legs. It was at the Al Reef Cup that Splitters Creek Bundy front legs appeared to collapse beneath him . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's column from October 2013: Sport is not about driving horses to their deaths . FEI president Ingmar de Vos said the FIA's Bureau had been unanimous in suspending the UAE federation. 'The decision to suspend a National Federation is not something that is taken lightly and we only should do this if no other remedy can be found,' he said in a statement. 'Sadly this was the only option left, but we have to take our responsibility and must never be afraid of tackling major issues head-on. Where horse welfare is concerned the FEI has to show leadership and solve problems in a structural way without making any concessions.' De Vos said the FEI had hoped strict enforcement of new rules brought in on August 1 last year would reduce the numbers of 'catastrophic injuries' and fatalities in the UAE. Dubai’s Sheik Mohammed (right) takes part in an endurance race in the Jordanian desert . The statement was quite devastating. The International Equestrian Federation had removed the two remaining International Endurance events scheduled to be held in the United Arab Emirates in an emergency measure to protect horse welfare and preserve integrity. Put bluntly: some of the most respected horsemen in the world can’t be trusted to look after horses. Within days, Endurance Great Britain dropped a proposed blanket sponsorship from the Meydan Corporation, owned by Sheik Mohammed Al Maktoum, citing national and international pressures and sensitivities. With this scandal mounting for close on two years, it is incredible and embarrassing that Meydan got through the door, no matter how much money was at stake. 'Regretfully this has not been the case,' he added. 'In the end we had no other choice than taking this drastic measure to deal with an unacceptable situation.' Endurance races in the Middle East can be brutal with distances of 100 miles a day, covered at high speed, common. Allegations of horse identity fraud have also been investigated by the FEI, according to the paper. The World Horse Welfare welcomed the move, Chief Executive Roly Owers said: 'In many ways this is a sad day. However the FEI’s drastic move to suspend the UAE federation is a reflection of the seriousness of the situation within endurance. 'While we are disappointed that it has come to this, this action had to be taken for the welfare of the horses and the integrity of the sport.' The ban could raise doubts over Dubai's suitability to host the world championships in 2016 wih the Swiss and Belgium equestrian federations threatening a boycott. The UAE Federation' place in the next year's Summer Olympics in Brazil could also be in jeopardy. It has 30 days to appeal against the suspension.","Three horses died at 74-mile Al Reef Cup in Abu Dhabi on February 1 .

"England produced an error-strewn display which promised so much but ultimately delivered less than it should have done as Stuart Lancaster’s men developed a severe case of white-line fever. The 12 point win means Lancaster’s side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely Championship title if they can see off France more convincingly than Ireland beat Scotland or Wales beat Italy. But they will be kicking themselves at an incredibly wasteful display which saw no fewer than six gilt-edged try-scoring opportunities wasted as passes went astray and support runners were ignored. England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup after England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham in the Six Nations . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup in their Six Nations clash . Jonathan Joseph (centre) is congratulated by his England team-mates having scored an early try at Twickenham . George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half with this early try to put the home side back in front . Exeter wing Jack Nowell crosses over to score England's third try of the evening at Twickenham to send them top of the table . ENGLAND XV: Brown, Watson, Joseph, Burrell, Nowell, Ford, Youngs, Marler, Hartley, Cole, Attwood, Lawes, Haskell, Robshaw, Vunipola . Replacements: Youngs, M.Vunipola, Brooks, Parling, Wood, Wigglesworth, Cipriani, Twelvetrees . Tries: Joseph, Ford, Nowell . Conversions: Ford (2) Penalties: Ford (2) SCOTLAND XV: Kearney, Bowe, Payne, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray; McGrath, Best, Ross, Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, O'Brien, Heaslip. Replacements: Cronin, Healy, Moore, Henderson, Murphy, Reddan, Madigan, Jones . Tries: Bennett . Conversions: Laidlaw (1) Penalties: Laidlaw (2) England did score three tries to Scotland’s one, leaving their points difference four points to the good over nearest title rivals Ireland, but they could so easily have been out of sight if they’d kept their composure with the line at their mercy. Jonathan Joseph, George Ford and Jack Nowell all crossed for Lancaster’s men, with Nowell’s late score adding some gloss to the scoreline. But Lancaster and his men will know this should have been so much more convincing. The Calcutta Cup may be theirs, but this was far from the dominant, clinical performance England craved after the no-show in Dublin a fortnight ago. Rarely can a side have dominated an opening 20 minutes of international rugby so completely but to so little effect. Time after time Scotland’s defence was torn to ribbons only for the England player in possession to run clumsily into contact, seemingly without any awareness of support runners or the need to shift the point of attack. Luther Burrell started the pattern after just two minutes when he completely ignored Anthony Watson on his right to blunder head down into Scotland full back Stuart Hogg, who pulled off the first of three fine tackles. In truth, England should have scored with something to spare. With five minutes on the clock, and Scotland seemingly on the ropes already, England piled into Scotland territory again and fly half George Ford whipped a cleverly delayed pass to Jonathan Joseph and the Bath centre hot-stepped his way over. Ford added the extras to make it 7-0 and it looked for all the world as if England were set to take the visitors for a cricket score. After three slow starts in succession, finally Lancaster’s men had the momentum early in the game. No excuses now. But, despite their dominance and superior attacking edge, England were simply unable to convert chances. Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway with his team-mates sprinting to joining in with his venture forward . Ben Youngs hands off the tackle of Scotland's Greig Laidlaw as England recovered from a half-time deficit to win at Twickenham . Mike Brown, making a welcome return from the concussion he suffered against Italy a month ago, latched on to a smart break down the short side from Ben Youngs after sharp work from Jack Nowell. The England full back pinned his ears back from 20 metres but Hogg had his measure on an arcing run and again the chance was lost as the ball was turned over. Nowell – who looked sharp throughout – was at fault next when he made a powerful break through the middle of Scotland’s defence only to ignore support runners on both sides and slip ineffectively into Hogg’s grasp. It was another chance lost and England could hardly believe they were just seven points ahead after a first quarter that promised so much but ultimately delivered little.

Scotland attempt to clear their lines during the Six Nations clash at Twickenham with Courtney Lawes (right) trying to block . Anthony Watson runs clear for Stuart Lancaster's England side during the Calcutta Cup contest with Scotland at Twickenham . If England have serious pretentions to challenge the world’s top sides on a consistent basis they simply cannot afford to waste chances like this. As Scotland sensed they’d somehow weathered the early storm, centre Mark Bennett forced his way over the line after 23 minutes on his side’s first serious incursion into England’s 22. Greig Laidlaw kicked the conversion and somehow Scotland were level at 7-7. As the half wore on, Scotland’s confidence grew. Joe Marler was penalised twice for boring in with England’s scrum dominant while Dylan Hartley’s line-out radar was once again out of kilter. It came as no surprise when the England hooker was substituted early in the second half. England back-row Billy Vunipola evades the tackles of two Scottish opponents, hoping to kick start another attack . Ford and Laidlaw exchanged penalties before Brown was forced into emergency defensive action when Scotland wing Dougie Fife cut through England’s defence and look to be bound for a try. But Brown took him down, only for another penalty to be conceded, with Laidlaw kicked, as Scotland took a three-point lead in at half time. England again started the second-half brightly and Ford went over within two minutes of the re-start when Chris Robshaw passed behind England’s first line of attackers and the fly half scurried in behind the Scotland defence. Referee Romain Poite chose not to refer his decision to the video referee despite suggestions of crossing. Another penalty from the excellent Ford saw Lancaster’s men into a 20-13 lead on 51 minutes but old habits die hard and Tom Youngs, on for the ineffective Hartley, became the latest England latest player to qualify as a master butcher when he scythed through Scotland’s defence only to throw yet another pass to nowhere. England’s profligacy was astonishing to witness, for all the wrong reasons. Brown looked to have scored on 62 minutes but – you guessed it – James Haskell’s pass was rightly deemed forward and England had their second try chalked off for a forward pass. Watson had crossed in the first half only for Ford’s earlier pass to Burrell to be called forward. Nowell dotted down late on to make it three tries to one.

"Peter Lawwell called it the ‘Le Guen hump’ and for certain Celtic players the chief executive’s words might be tweaked to read ‘taking the hump’. It’s to his credit that, with typical candour, Kris Commons admits he had teething problems with the regime change that saw Ronny Deila walk into Celtic intent on wholesale reform. Lawwell knew that by appointing the Norwegian in the wake of Neil Lennon’s resignation he was taking a risk, and recently likened the gamble to Rangers’ decision to install Paul Le Guen in 2006. After a difficult start, Kris Commons has now build a strong relationship with Celtic manager Ronny Deila . The Frenchman lasted barely six months at Ibrox and departed in the wake of a dressing-room revolt. Yet, while the likes of Kris Boyd and Barry Ferguson actively railed against Le Guen’s methods, the resistance to Deila’s changes was more subtle. There was, however, bemusement that the club should seek to change the winning formula that had seen Lennon land three titles in a row alongside consecutive qualifications for the Champions League group stage. Having clinched the major Player of the Year honours and scored 32 times last season, Commons more than most was perhaps entitled to feel his game had little need for refinement. He readily admits to feeling unsettled by the changes that saw the former Stromsgodset chief place a greater emphasis on fitness as he attempted to realise a high-tempo pressing game. As with most human squabbles, communication has proved the key to a solution. Deila’s policy of regularly sitting down to speak individually with his players has given Commons a right of reply and he has used it, returning to first-team prominence and signing a new contract last month. Commons has adapted well to the manager's demands of his players to be physically fitter than before . Commons is likely to start the League Cup Final and has declared himself all in as Deila bids to win his first trophy as Celtic manager. ‘It is always difficult when you feel like you’ve come off a season doing really well then someone comes in and wants to change things, as he sees it, for the better,’ he said. ‘But through that transitional period we got knocked out the Champions League and didn’t get off to a great start in the league. It had an effect on the park. ‘I wasn’t playing every week and, when I was in, I’d try to do the things the manager wanted. In recent weeks, when I have been fit and healthy, I’ve felt like a different player and added more to my game than usual. ‘We speak one-to-one on a regular basis about what he wants and what I want. He’s good that way, super. He’s not telling me anything I don’t know already, it’s just sometimes you need a push in the right direction to make you a better player.’ Bright, articulate and possessed with a healthy sense of his own ability, Commons is one of the bigger characters in the dressing room and it was always crucial that Deila found a way to bring the Mansfield-born attacking midfielder on side. Even Lennon had a rocky spell with Commons during the player’s first full season at the club but the pair went on to forge a productive working relationship to the extent that the Northern Irishman admitted he would happily take Commons off Deila’s hands as he settled into his new job at Bolton. Commons talks with captain Scott Brown in training ahead of the Scottish League cup final on Sunday . A return to the Championship, where the 31-year-old had performed comfortably and without the incessant pressure to win inherent at Celtic, would have been an easier and possibly more lucrative option. ‘I’m not looking for an easy way out,’ he contends. ‘I wasn’t looking just to plod away through these next two or three years. I have a lot of goals for myself — to win more trophies, more cups. I want to win a Treble and play in the Champions League these next couple of years. I’ve not signed a deal where I think: “Oh, that’s great, I can get my feet up”. ‘The manager will put pressure on me to keep improving, so I’ve got to show signs of doing that and that’s one of my goals — I want to get better as a player as I get older.’ Commons admits he is ‘three to four kilos’ lighter thanks to Deila’s demands that his players cut their body fat and admits he feels fitter as a result. Where Lennon would borrow from the likes of Martin O’Neill in allowing his players to freewheel on the proviso that they delivered on matchdays, Deila demands that, in his own words, his players are 24-hour athletes. Commons is desperate to win the competition, which has eluded him in his four years in Scotland . He may never boast a physique to rival Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale, but he has bought into the new manager’s philosophy — and regards the November win at Pittodrie as a pivotal moment for the new boss. ‘I think Aberdeen away was a big result, when big Virgil (van Dijk) scored in the last minute. I think that was a turning point. Even before that game we saw the benefits on the training field. ‘We are trying to play this high pressing game and everyone is looking to try and improve as much as possible, whether that is a 19-year-old kid that’s just come in or me at 31. ‘The manager wants everyone to make targets to get fit, get healthier, make better touches, make better decisions on the ball and things like that. It is just completely different from last year. ‘Then if you were doing well, it was a case of just keeping doing what you were doing. ‘Ronaldo, is this supreme athlete. He’s the pinnacle, isn’t he — he is the quickest, he can jump highest, he can score most goals. He probably has no fat. That is the target, so whatever I am over that, that is the target. ‘That is not just myself. Even Craig Gordon has had words about it, Nir Bitton and Charlie Mulgrew, too. ‘The manager has goals and aspirations. He wants to makes us better, not only as professionals, but as a team. He wants us to dominate domestically and then take that on to the European stage next year — and not just take part there, but put pressure on teams, especially away from home. ‘I think Inter Milan away we showed signs we are getting there. Even though we were down to 10 men, we showed a really gutsy performance.’ Hampden and the League Cup provided Kris Commons with a glorious Celtic debut yet, four years later, he is still waiting to get his hands on the trophy in celebration. Commons is battling a hamstring injury but hopes to be fit in time to face Dundee United on Sunday . Having completed his £300,000 move from Derby County a day earlier, Commons took just eight minutes to rifle home his first Celtic goal in the 2011 semi-final against Aberdeen. Yet although his spectacular strike set the tone for a largely fulfilling period of his career, he went on to suffer disappointment in the final as Rangers prevailed courtesy of Nikica Jelavic’s goal in extra-time. A year later and caught in a personal form slump, he was a substitute and restricted to the final four minutes as Celtic unsuccessfully tried to equalise Dieter van Tornhout’s shock winning goal for Kilmarnock. The past two seasons have seen St Mirren and Morton provide further misery as the trophy became the one honour to escape the clutches of Lennon. The glaring absence from his own medal collection was just one of the reasons Scotland’s reigning Player of the Year elected to sign a new contract in January and put an end to persistent talk that he was on his way out of the club. A hamstring injury has dogged Commons since he penned his new deal last month but he’s trained this week and, with Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong cup-tied, he looks a good bet to claim one of three attacking midfield slots in Deila’s team to face Dundee United. ‘I feel fine and I’m looking forward to playing — if selected,’ said Commons. ‘It’s the only cup I’ve not won in Scotland, so it’s a big deal. ‘I think Scott Brown is the only member of the squad who has won it.’","Kris Commons has been a key member of Celtic squad for four years .

It wasn’t a brilliant game but you’ve got to be optimistic if you win these.’ It’s only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when Billy McKinlay left after a matter of days but Watford will take some stopping from here. When all is said and done in two months’ time, they will make sure not to hold any regrets. The winner came on nine minutes after Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, rather bizarrely, opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for Almen Abdi to whip in a wicked corner; from that Craig Cathcart’s header was partially saved but Deeney was on the spot to smash in the rebound. ‘Disappointing’ was Kit Symons’ summation. ‘It’s the second phase of a corner.’ Jokanovic’s side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at Vicarage Road before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and Ross McCormack might’ve drawn the visitors level soon after, only for his half-volley to be thwarted by former Tottenham stopper Heurelho Gomes.

Match winner Deeney fights with Kostas Stafylidis for possession during the first half at Vicarage Road . Despite Fulham looking bright, it was the Hornets who could’ve sewn the points up before half-time. Abdi is afforded the freedom to roam from his central berth and that gives Watford an added dimension. Capped by Switzerland, he buzzes in possession and isn’t afraid of bypassing Deeney and Matej Vydra in pursuit of goals. Here the two strikers combined brilliantly to tee Abdi up and he thumped just wide. Make no mistake, this was not vintage Watford but you sense they don’t need to be weekly, such is the quality stacked up in a well-stocked squad. Vydra crashed an effort against the bar after sparkling Adlene Guedioura footwork before Jazz Richards only saw yellow for raising his hands to the striker off the ball. Ben Watson (centre) climbs higher than Bryan Ruiz during his side's crucial victory over Fulham . Symons saw Cauley Woodrow head over from a corner and Seko Fofana’s vicious strike was deflected wide. Fulham failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker Matt Smith; his knockdown fell to McCormack but Gomes rushed out, spread himself and superbly blocked the Scot’s certain equaliser. ‘Matt did well when he came on,’ Symons said. ‘He’s a physical presence up there and we can play a bit more direct. There was a chance at the end when Hugo Rodallega and Ross got in each other’s way. We deserved a point.’ Watford might usually be a pleasure to watch, but they’ll be thankful for that mad Brazilian between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come.","Watford move into third in the Sky Bet Championship following the win .

"Mesut Ozil might have been in good form since returning from injury this season, but he still needs to be better if Arsenal are to challenge for the title, according to Gunners legend Gilberto Silva. The Brazilian, a member of the Gunners' Invincibles team, labelled the German 'slow' and says he has to be more decisive. Gilberto acknowledged Ozil's quality, but insists that he needs to start paying off the faith Arsene Wenger showed by spending £42.5m to bring him to the Emirates Stadium from Real Madrid. Mesut Ozil has not found things easy since moving to Arsenal, but has improved recently . Ozil has a shot deflected over the bar against Everton, and Gilberto Silva says he must offer more . 'You speak about Arsenal and how they don't spend big money on a player often but they did with (Mesut) Ozil and it is always a bit risky,' he said. 'Coming from Spain it is tough to adapt, it doesn't always happen straight away. 'I do really like him as a player but sometimes in the game he does look quite slow, although he has that quality to change the game. 'He can be more decisive for Arsenal for the quality he has, he can be much more decisive for the club. Arsenal have not won the Premier League in the 11 years since Gilberto and his team-mates went unbeaten, and the 38-year-old believes they still don't have the financial firepower to challege Chelsea and Manchester City. Gilberto was a key member of the Arsenal team that went an entire Premier League season unbeaten in 2004 . Arsenal have not won the title since their Invincible season, but Gilberto insists it is now time to challenge . But Gilberto also stressed that the club should be aiming for the title, and given time Arsene Wenger can lead his current squad to glory. 'Arsenal hasn't been able to compete with Chelsea and Manchester City for a few years because they spend money on big names and this is not the Arsenal culture', said Gilberto. 'They don't spend a lot of money to sign players but apart from that it is not easy to find a way to get back on track to win titles. Ozil is the Gunners record signing, but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially . The German playmaker will need to improve if Arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge, says Gilberto . 'It was important for them last season that they won the FA Cup but a team like Arsenal need more and I hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for. 'If you look at Chelsea, they spent a lot of money on a player like Diego Costa and he has settled really well and is scoring lots of goals, that has worked for them but it is not as easy for Arsenal. 'If the players concentrate on their job and pull together they can form a strong team and try to feel good in their play. 'Sometimes people expect quick results but it doesn't always work like that.' Brazil v Chile is on March 29 at 3pm at the Emirates Stadium in London.

"What more can Alexis Sanchez do to force his way back into the middle? Out on the left wing against Queens Park Rangers, where he has moved to make way for Mesut Ozil since his return from injury, he cut a frustrated figure for much of the game. But when he started making runs through the middle, testing Queens Park Rangers defenders and putting them on the back foot with his pace, the chances came. After 70 minutes, that was rewarded with a wonderful individual goal. Alexis Sanchez takes on young Queens Park Rangers defender Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road . Mesut Ozil, voted Arsenal's player of the month for February, holds off the challenge of Nedum Onuoha . The talk ahead of kick-off was that Sanchez simply does not perform as well when Ozil is on the pitch. In the first 45 minutes, they exchanged the ball a total of three times. That’s not to say that every player on the pitch must combine at all times, but Arsenal fans are within their rights to expect £72.5million worth of talent, playing next to each other in an attacking midfield trio, to develop some kind of wavelength. In the first half Sanchez, Arsenal’s best player this season by far, could not get into the game on the flank, making way for Ozil as No 10 since his comeback from injury. In October, there were stories in Chile, from newspaper La Tercera, that Sanchez and Ozil had fallen out. Sanchez felt the German was not giving him enough opportunities on the pitch, it was reported. From this performance, he would have a point. It took 22 minutes before they found one another, Sanchez passing into his team-mate. Sanchez cut in from the left hand side to score from a tight angle and end is run of eight games without a goal . Sanchez celebrates doubling Arsenal's lead mid way through the second half at Loftus Road . At one stage, the Chilean was screaming for the ball wide and free on the left, but Ozil went to play the switch and instead feinted. But perhaps it is not even about the pair of them being on the pitch together so much as Sanchez being wasted on the left. By the 62nd minute, he was clearly frustrated out wide when he made a run down the wing and Olivier Giroud failed to send the ball into his path. He let his team-mate know. In one red-hot period after he scored his first goal for the club against Besiktas he netted 12 in 14 games, from August to the start of November. Now it is just one in eight games, coinciding with Ozil’s return. When he ventured into the middle in the 47th minute, carried the ball into the box with a step-over before aiming one for the far right bottom corner, it was hard to see why he is not guaranteed a central spot all the time. He repeated the act in the 58th minute, growing in confidence with every shot on goal. These two acts alone far exceeded anything Ozil produced. Former Real Madrid playmaker Ozil complains to the referee after feeling he was fouled inside the area . World Cup-winning midfielder Ozil takes a corner during the first half of the Premier League match . Then as if to reaffirm his ability to score, he evaded the presence of young QPR full-back Daniel Furlong inside the box on the left, before firing a shot into Rob Green’s near post for Arsenal’s second. It is all well and good Sanchez displaying an enviable work-rate down the wing, one that surely impresses Arsene Wenger, but it’s more well and good if he is through the middle stretching defences to breaking point. Against QPR, this was not vintage Arsenal and they made hard work of a team fighting relegation, a team they should be sweeping aside. It cannot be denied that they are finding results, getting wins, but in the biggest match of their season, against Monaco, they were found lacking. As this game drew on, Sanchez displayed a lovely deftness of touch to control the ball with his knee then flick it over an opponent in one fluid motion. Where was he? In the middle of the attacking third. Where he belongs. Olivier Giroud stabs in Arsenal's first goal of the evening against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road .

"After a blistering start, England were forced to work for their win against Scotland, which took them level on points with Ireland and Wales at the top of the Six Nations championship table. Jonathan Joseph had Stuart Lancaster's side ahead inside five minutes, but Scotland fought back and forced a thrilling finale. Sportsmail's Chris Foy was there to run the rule over the two teams: . Courtney Lawes gets up above Jonny Gray to secure line-out ball for England in a hard-fought battle . ENGLAND . Mike Brown – Ominous when he dropped first high kick but settled well and posed a threat whenever he had the ball. 7. Anthony Watson – A game of near-triumph for him, but he scored a ‘try’ which was ruled out, as was another he helped set up. 7. Mike Brown takes on Finn Russell as the England full back looked to create opportunities . Jonathan Joseph – Took his try with typical, swerving aplomb, to showcase his nifty footwork. Held up well in defence. 7. Luther Burrell – Squandered glorious early scoring chance. Forceful as ever, but not igniting this campaign as he did last year. 6. Jack Nowell – Exeter wing was electric with his broken-field running. Some suspect decision-making but good finish for try. 7. Jonathan Joseph dives over to score England's early try, which looked to have set them on their way . George Ford – His authority grows. Created openings with distribution and pace, and scored a try. All was well until late missed kicks. 8. Ben Youngs – Was a livewire threat early on and continued to test the Scottish defence with his darts around the fringes. 7. Joe Marler – Deft handling in run-up to Ford try, put in familiar busy shift in defence and was at the heart of set-piece onslaught. 7. George Ford dives over the line for his try in a game where he contributed 15 points and controlled the play . Dylan Hartley – This was a fast-and-loose encounter, so his work in the tight was most felt with his part in a first-half scrum blitz. 6. Dan Cole – The Leicester tighthead is quite content to win scrums and hit rucks, in which case he was in his element here. 7. Dave Attwood – Not as prominent as he was in Dublin, when his defensive work was so valuable and not among top carriers. 6. Dave Attwood gets the ball away out of the tackle as England in another good display from the second row . Courtney Lawes – Largely effective in the way he orchestrated the lineout and a dynamic, punishing presence around the field. 7. James Haskell – Made his fair share of tackles but no major carrying or breakdown impact. His place may be under threat. 6. Billy Vunipola – Determination to impose himself was clear from sheer number of times he pounded the Scottish defence. 7. Billy Vunipola goes on one of his characteristic runs as he offers England some momentum . Chris Robshaw – Not a towering presence before the break, but more influential later, especially as a link-man in attacks. 7. Replacements: Tom Youngs exploded from the bench to provide impetus and fellow front-rower, Kieran Brookes, was involved in the build-up to Nowell’s try and Tom Wood made one strong late burst. Chris Robshaw needs two Scottish tacklers to bring him down as he led England to a Calcutta Cup victory . SCOTLAND . Stuart Hogg – Did well to chase back and prevent a try by Brown. Frustrated by restricted chances and threw some wild passes. 6. Dougie Fife – Had a couple of jinking bursts but largely well shackled. Covered effectively when Watson threatened in second half. 5. Stuart Hogg goes low to bring down Jack Nowell but Scotland couldn't hold out for long . Mark Bennett – Kept his head when the chance came; ignoring men outside to touch down. Largely occupied with tackling. 7. Matt Scott – Was an emergency replacement for Alex Dunbar and this wasn’t a day for him to prove his creative credentials. 5. Tommy Seymour – A regular threat. He came in-field looking for work and often found gaps. Kept choosing clever lines. 7. Finn Russell – Was all at sea in the first quarter but grew into the game. Some shrewd touches but also some glaring lapses. 6. Finn Russell looks for territory as the Scots struggled to get good field position to make a late charge . Greig Laidlaw – Behind a beaten pack, he struggled to control proceedings and didn’t challenge England with box-kicks. 6. Alasdair Dickinson – The prop was damned by association with a scrum effort which was hapless as England took command. 5. Ross Ford – He has had far more commanding outings than this, as he failed to make many dents in a pack on the back foot. 5. Euan Murray – After early tussle with Dan Cole, was left flailing as George Ford scored his try and couldn’t prevent scrum rout. 5. Greig Laidlaw kicks clear as Courtney Lawes attempts to get through two Scottish forwards to charge down . Jim Hamilton – It wasn’t his day. Took a blow to the head that led to an early exit and not the usual snarling menace. 5. Jonny Gray – Nearly touched down when the Scots finally gained a foothold. Couldn’t disrupt English supply at the lineout. 6. Rob Harley – Had a hand in the try scored by Bennett but against the big, strong home forwards he was a lightweight presence. 5. David Denton – Last year, he was almost a lone threat to England and this time he again fought the good fight in vain. 7. Jonny Gray carries the ball as Scotland fought back from a poor start to make a game of it . Blair Cowan – Aside from one slick aerial off-load to send Seymour hurtling clear, he was a low-profile figure in this game. 5. Replacements: The lack of Scottish depth was harshly exposed. None of them sent on from the bench by Vern Cotter could do anything to turn the tide against their team.","England create countless chances but made to work hard for win .

"Scrum-half Ben Youngs has warned that England must be much more clinical next weekend against a France side capable of upsetting the party at Twickenham. Youngs was upbeat but also in realistic mood after Stuart Lancaster’s men defeated Scotland, acknowledging that England blew several chances in the first half. England had trailed 13-10 at the break so captain Chris Robshaw looked more relieved than anything else at the end as he raised the Calcutta Cup to cheers of approval from supporters. Those fans had certainly seemed worried when half-a-dozen first-half chances had gone begging. Ben Youngs runs with the ball as England won at Twickenham, but the margin could have been greater . Youngs was named man of the match but admitted that England will have to improve against France . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . Lancaster’s men should have had a far better points tally but had two tries wiped out for forward passes. They also failed to finish off promising moves due to poor decision-making and last-gasp Scottish tackling. Leicester star Youngs said: ‘It was a crucial win and puts us in with a great chance of the title but we have to do the business against France here at Twickenham next Saturday. ‘We beat ourselves up a little bit and you can’t do that in Test rugby. We are disappointed we left a few tries and points out there. ‘To have so much of the ball, put them under so much pressure and go in at half-time losing was a real blow. We had a few words in the changing room and made sure we put things right. ‘Scotland are a very good team but we should have been more clinical in the first half.’ Teh scrum half celebrates with his front row, brother Tom (right), Dan Cole (left) and Joe Marler . Jack Nowell scored England's late try which put them top of the standings on points difference . Exeter wing Jack Nowell, whose late try ensured England went top of the Six Nations table, said: ‘I’ve not played in an England team where we created so many chances but let them slip by. ‘But the win has given us a real chance of getting our hands on the title. Now we have to get up for France — an even harder match. They’ll come to Twickenham with nothing to lose. ‘I was delighted to get that try at the end. I’d had a few openings during the game but for one reason or another the try did not come. So it was something of a relief at the end there.’ Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw admitted: ‘We had our chance when we led at half-time. After that we did not defend so well and England began to make us pay. ‘It’s another disappointing defeat but the lads will try to finish the tournament with a win over Ireland.’","England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham on Saturday .

"It is a job that would move the most mild-mannered soul to explode in a Malcolm Tucker-esque burst of coarse cussing a dozen times a day. If you can’t deal with a steady stream of frustrations, don’t ever move into coaching - it’ll break your heart *and* send you halfway round the twist. Take Vern Cotter’s experiences yesterday. He’s picked his XV to take on England at Twickenham, the toughest test of this exasperating Six Nations campaign. Vern Cotter has had a difficult time of things, with Alex Dunbar picking up a late injury before Saturday's game . Coach Cotter said the 24-year-old centre Dunbar had played a key role in the Scotland XV . He’s watching the boys run through their paces in the final training session before catching a lunchtime flight to London, when Alex Dunbar – without another player within touching distance – changes direction and crumples to the turf. Suddenly one of his key men, a wrecking ball in attack and a bear in defence, is out not just of tomorrow’s Calcutta Cup clash, but the rest of this season – possibly including the World Cup. Stern Vern has to move from barking orders to comforting a young man facing up to a potential six months in rehab. If he didn’t believe in voodoo, hoodoos, juju and jinxes before he took the Scotland gig … . ‘We’re a team who don’t get things easy,’ said Cotter, looking more than a little shaken by the turn of events. ‘It’s another example of it. ‘It’s the kind of thing that can happen any time, of course. I will give you an example. Thursday training when I was in charge at Clermont, we had finished, I’d blown my whistle. Wesley Fofana and Jason White were running, laughing, Wesley tackles Jason and breaks his leg. These are just the things that happen, unfortunately.’ Cotter’s declaration that the squad may be brought closer together by the sudden loss of Dunbar - his team-mates moved to win one for the Gipper, so to speak - is understandable. It does no-one any good to start tearing cloth and weeping over the absence of one player, however influential. Matt Scott has ability and form enough to deputise, definitely, while recalls for Jim Hamilton at lock and David Denton at No8 should help Scotland in their bid to do something pretty ambitious – out-England the English big men. Dunbar, here showing his disappointment after Scotland's loss to Wales, awaits results of scans on his knee . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash . ‘England are a big physical team and they play a very percentage-orientated game, based on occupation, field position and a strong pack,’ said Cotter. ‘They also have very good finishers in their team, strong runners, line breakers. So they are a team based around their power, their line-out and their scrum. ‘We’ve been looking at trying to compete – and put them under pressure in what they consider to be their strong points. Hopefully if we can contest there and keep the game as tight as possible for as long as possible, you never know. ‘Ireland got on top of them around the rucks and I think they will be more aggressive in that area to get the go-forward they didn’t get against Ireland. Ireland shut down their passing game and got them into an arm wrestle. ‘Defensively, Ireland played very well against them and didn’t let them put in several passes. They will have worked on how to counter those tactics. First and foremost, we look at our contact zone and our set piece. We have to be able to adapt. ‘We also need to be better in the air. We have known that since the start of the six Nations. We know that they use the ball in the air a fair bit. ‘Jim Hamilton is there for his experience. He knows their players very well and I think he may be able to unsettle them with his individual knowledge. He is there to give us that solid base at scrum and lineout.’ Dougie Fife wins just his fifth cap on the right wing, given the chance partly due to a Sean Maitland injury but also because Cotter likes ‘his energy, enthusiasm, his kick-chase,’ adding: ‘He is a young player who is strong, creates line breaks and is a finisher as well. It was tight, but we think his energy, especially in the aerial game, will be important.’ Alex Dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after injuring his knee at training . Cotter spoke in the aftermath of the home defeat to Italy about the brutal honesty required in order to fix the problems so obviously exposed, although he plays down any notion that he’s been tearing his players limb from metaphorical limb this week. Instead, he says that suffering that late loss might even be of long-term benefit to his squad, pointing out: ‘We were two minutes away from lauding the character of a young team for getting out of a tough situation with a scrum penalty. ‘In a lot of ways it has been a bit of a blessing because we can really look in depth at things that may have been ignored or smoothed over. We have had a good look at ourselves. Everybody. The coaches, the players, everybody.’ Addressing those promises of a bloody inquest into the worst performance of the campaign, he added: ‘Those things are always a little exaggerated. We were just very clear on what we want to see and what we expect. We need to learn from certain things. That was the theme behind this week’s training. ‘This weekend, there is the Calcutta Cup and the result two weeks ago. That means there has been more of an edge to training. It is always nice to have an objective. ‘We are two days away from playing for something that we could bring home. It has been a few years since Scotland won at Twickenham. No one is giving us much of a chance. I can understand that. But we will be measuring our improvements from two weeks ago and those things will help us develop our game and become more competitive.’ Hardly a rousing cri de coeur aimed at whipping his men into a frenzy. But, then, maybe he’s saving all his fired-up frustrations for the pre-match address. As the Six Nations rolls on to the penultimate weekend of the campaign, Cotter may have enough fuel left to strip the paint from the walls of Twickenham.","Vern Cotter refuses to feel sorry for himself after injury problems .

"Scotland are clutching at positives in their bid to avoid the  Six Nations wooden spoon, with centre Mark Bennett calling on his side to unsettle Ireland in next week's final round. Defeat at Twickenham to title-chasing England on Saturday leaves Scotland without a win from four games and with victory over Ireland, who are bidding to retain the championship, required to avoid a Six Nations whitewash for the second time in four years. Ireland have lost on their last two trips to Murrayfield - in the August 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-up and the 2013 Six Nations - while Scotland avoided the wooden spoon in 2010 by winning in Dublin.

Bennett, who scored a first-half try at Twickenham, said: 'We really need to go into the week knowing that we can win. 'The whole week is about preparing to win. We've got to go out next Saturday and get the win. 'Getting the win next week is huge. It would put us in a better position in the tournament and a better position to build on come World Cup time. 'Our performances have been a lot better than results have shown. 'With the way that we've played in three out of the four games - the Italy game being a bit of a blip - I wouldn't have expected us to be bottom. We're playing the way we want to, we're starting to create opportunities. 'It's not going to be a negative, going into the game thinking 'oh no we can't come away with the wooden spoon'. It's more ""we're coming into the game to get the win"". '(Ireland) have been playing a really hard, tight game of rugby, very disciplined, putting in great kicks, contesting in the air, squeezing things. We've got to just try to break the mould and run them ragged.' England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup after England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham .

Bennett acknowledged Scotland's front-line defence was not at its best against England, but feels improvement in the scrambled, less structured defence and a reduced penalty count are signs of progress. The Glasgow Warriors centre insisted Scotland must not dwell on what has already happened as they bid to end the tournament on a high. 'It's disappointing, but you've got to look at why it's disappointing,' he said. 'It's our own downfall. We've made too many errors and penalties in the past. (But) it's a case of this is the problem, this is how we fix it, lets move on.'","Scotland without a win in Six Nations after defeat to England on Saturday .

"France set themselves up for their last-day showdown with title-chasing England at Twickenham by shutting out Italy in Rome yesterday. Coach Philippe Saint-Andre praised his side’s resilience after they bounced back from two successive defeats in the Six Nations to overcome Italy in a scrappy match. Les Bleus scored two tries and five penalties to seal an emphatic victory at the Stadio Olimpico after a dour first half in which a wet ball and rain-soaked pitch led both sides into a string of handling errors.

Dusautoir acknowledged that after defeats by Ireland and Wales, France were under pressure to produce ahead of the trip to Twickenham. ‘It was a big test today. In our last few matches, we weren’t able to find this defiance, or quality or this hunger,’ he said. ‘The first half maybe wasn’t very productive but it wore them down and it allowed us to end the match well,’ he said. Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious.

"You know you’re having a bad day at the office when Crystal Palace’s Joel Ward is celebrating a goal like he’s Cristiano Ronaldo. That’s precisely what happened to hopeless Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Ward converted Crystal Palace’s third goal inside 42 minutes at a rampant Selhurst Park after earlier strikes from Wilfried Zaha and James McArthur.

And Such was Ward’s enthusiasm with his first goal in close to 100 appearances for the Eagles, you can perhaps forgive him for his rather cringe-worthy celebration. Picking up the ball inside the QPR penalty area, Ward slotted the ball past Rangers stopper Rob Green with a cool left-footed strike. The 25-year-old then sprinted off towards the corner flag before leaping up in the air and stretching his arms behind his back. Ronaldo hasn’t played in the Premier League for the best part of six years following his mega-money move from Manchester United to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009. But for a moment it was as if the world footballer of the year was back in England’s top flight. Alan Pardew has taken struggling Crystal Palace to within two points of his former club Newcastle . Wilfried Zaha was credited with opening the scoring before colliding heavily with the goal post . James McArthur gestures to his shin after doubling the Eagles' lead at Selhurst Park . It summed up an embarrassing 45 minutes from QPR who are set to be cast further adrift of Aston Villa as they, along with Burnley and Leicester City, stare at immediate relegation back to the Championship. In contrast, Palace, flying-high under Alan Pardew, are set to move to within two points of his old team Newcastle in 11th place. It isn’t the first time a Premier League star has mimicked one of Ronaldo’s iconic celebrations. Earlier this season, Peter Crouch attracted much hilarity when he puffed out his chest in the same vein as the Real Madrid star after scoring in Stoke’s win against Arsenal.

"Nine-man Cardiff survived a late Brentford onslaught to dent the home side's promotion charge with a smash-and-grab 2-1 win. All the goals came from goalkeeping blunders in a game which ended with Kadeem Harris and Federico Macheda both seeing red for Cardiff. Andre Gray gave the home side a first-half lead, but goals from Macheda and Alex Revell turned things round for Cardiff. Cardiff's Kadeem Harris was sent off for a reckless lunge on Brentford midfielder Alan Judge . The Welsh club came to west London with a game plan to stifle the fluent Bees by breaking the game up at every opportunity, and Brentford at times looked rattled by their physical approach. Yet the Bees took the lead midway through the first half after a howler by their former stopper Simon Moore, who could only parry Alex Pritchard's dipping free-kick into the path of Gray to bundle home from close range. The hosts should have put the game beyond doubt by the break, only an acrobatic Moore save denying Pritchard's deflected looping shot. Jota also caused havoc down the right flank and Gray twice went close to extending the lead before the break. Brentford striker Andre Gray beats Cardiff goalkeeper Simon Moore (left) to score opening goal . However, the Bluebirds upped the physical stakes after the interval and made Brentford pay for a lacklustre display. Macheda drew them level on 53 minutes when Brentford goalkeeper David Button collided with his own centre-back Harlee Dean and dropped the ball into the path of the Italian, who slid home from 12 yards. And the comeback was complete on 68 minutes when Button raced off his line to intercept a hopeful through ball and was caught in no man's land for Revell to chip home into the empty goal. However, the sheen was taken off the win by two red cards for the Welshmen. Alex Revell (left) celebrates scoring Cardiff's winner with Federico Macheda . Harris, on loan at Griffin Park last season, was the first to go on 78 minutes, having come on as a half-time sub, for a reckless lunge on Bees midfielder Alan Judge. And former Manchester United striker Macheda followed him to the dressing room with minutes remaining for a second yellow card. That sparked a frantic spell of pressure from Brentford which saw James Tarkoswski head over when well placed and Tommy Smith's goal-bound drive blocked by a melee of City bodies as Russell Slade's men held on. Cardiff almost snatched a third deep into stoppage time, but Kenwyne Jones squandered a gilt-edged chance to give the scoreline a flattering feel by blazing over after racing on to a through ball with the home defence committed. CHARLTON 1-3 BLACKBURN . A clinical double from Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes ensured victory against lacklustre Charlton. It was Blackburn’s third win of the season over Charlton, having already beaten them 2-0 in the reverse fixture and 2-1 in the FA Cup at the Valley. Blackburn keeper Jason Steele takes out Charlton Athletic's Igor Vetokele and gives away a penalty . Alex Baptiste of Blackburn and Igor Vetokele chase after the ball . Gary Bowyer’s side have now lost only one of their last nine games in all competitions, and the win keeps alive slim play-off hopes. Craig Conway was also on target for Blackburn, while Yoni Buyens pulled one back from the spot. Bowyer was delighted with Scottish international Rhodes, and said: ‘I thought his two goals were outstanding quality. The second one is a great piece of poaching and a sublime finish, and the first one is an unbelievable finish from a great bit of quick play from us.’ LEEDS 0-0 NOTTINGHAM FOREST . Dougie Freedman was happy to go home with a draw after Nottingham Forest’s stalemate at Leeds. Forest had won six of their first eight games under the Scot to raise hopes of a late run to the play-offs. There was no denying Forest had the better moments as Chris Burke and Ben Osborn drew smart saves from Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri, but they could not get past the Italian and headed back down the M1 with a point. Freedman said: ‘I’m happy with a point. Because of the run we’re on and the standards we’ve set, we expect to win games. ‘We have to be realistic and to come to Leeds and get a point is a good result. We were the better team, and we had better chances.’ ROTHERHAM 1-2 WIGAN . Wigan kept survival hopes alive as two free-kicks from Jermaine Pennant helped close the gap on Rotherham. The win was Malky Mackay’s side’s fourth straight away victory, and gives them a glimmer of hope ahead of the end-of-season run in. Mackay said: ‘Jermaine’s delivery on both was sensational. It’s not until you look at it again that you see exactly what he did, and how he has executed them.’ Matt Derbyshire pulled one back, but it was not enough to save Rotherham. BIRMINGHAM 1-1 HUDDERSFIELD . Joe Lolley, a product of Birmingham’s academy, returned to St Andrew’s to earn Huddersfield a rare away point with a vital equaliser. Huddersfield Town's Joe Lolley (far right) scores the equaliser against Birmingham . Making only his third start since being signed from Kidderminster for £300,000 a year ago, the 22-year-old justified manager Chris Powell’s decision to play him against his former club when he cancelled out David Cotterill’s opener. Powell said: ‘Joe is a real natural talent, but I would like to see the day when he can last 90 minutes. ‘We are just trying to cajole him. We are trying to get that talent shown regularly out on the pitch.’ SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 1-1 FULHAM . Stuart Gray felt his Sheffield Wednesday side should have been given a free-kick for diving in the build-up to Fulham’s equaliser. Fulham striker Matt Smith is surrounded by Sheffield Wednesday players . Fulham midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe went down in the Wednesday area before poking the ball to goalscorer Matt Smith in the 75th minute. The goal cancelled out a header from Wednesday substitute Stevie May. Gray said: ‘I think the referee shouted play-on because he presumed the lad had dived. That’s what the lads are saying, so if he thought he dived you would have thought he’d have pulled up and given us a free-kick. You’re taught as a kid to play until the whistle goes, and we did seem to stop.’ BOLTON 2-0 MILLWALL . Neil Lennon described Adam Le Fondre as a ‘priceless commodity’ after watching his on-loan striker shoot down Millwall. Bolton's Paddy McCarthy (left) challenges Lee Gregory of Millwall . Le Fondre now has five goals in 10 games since his arrival from Cardiff, and Bolton boss Lennon said: ‘They were two great finishes, and he is our joint second top-scorer and he has only been in the building since late January. ‘It is a priceless commodity being a goalscorer, and he has done that his whole career.’ New Millwall manager Neil Harris admitted: ‘We are in a difficult position, and there are no promises from anyone in the dressing room as to what we are going to do.’ BRIGHTON 1-1 WOLVES . A late goal from Rajiv van La Parra rescued a point for play-off chasers Wolves. Spanish defender Bruno Saltor raised hopes of a fourth successive home win for Brighton, but Wolves hit back to equalise four minutes later when Van La Parra’s cross went in off David Stockdale. The Brighton keeper then produced a brilliant late save to deny Bakary Sako, and Wolves manager Kenny Jackett said: ‘It was a close game, and a fantastic save at the end to deny us. ‘We have to keep pushing. Two teams above us lost and we have two important games coming up. We would have loved three points, but thin dividing lines decide games. ‘A number of clubs are looking for promotion, and it is still open for us.’","Cardiff survived a late onslaught to win 2-1 at promotion chasing Brentford .

"Andy Murray's immediate reward for scoring his 500th career win on Tuesday night was to be presented with a giant green cake that would threaten to add a few inches to any man's waistline. The deeper satisfaction will have been in passing a significant landmark that few manage, and it came with a hard-fought 6-4 3-6 6-3 win over South African Kevin Anderson that sees him into the last eight of the Miami Open. He now faces Austria's 21 year-old world No 52 Dominic Thiem after becoming the 47th man to get 500 wins since the game went completely open to amateurs and professionals in 1968.

That averages out at one per year and it is a fitting testament to Murray's admirable consistency at the top of the game. Only nine active players can claim the same distinction. It was also a day notable for British tennis gaining a second, ready-made top 100 player, as Slovenian-born world No 83 Aljaz Bedene confirmed that he has received British citizenship and will be playing under the Union Jack. After carefully managing not to take a bite from his garish acreage of confectionery Murray contemplated the feat and said, 'It's an amazing feeling, winning matches these days is extremely tough.

'It's very pleasing and not something I expected to do when I first came on tour. It's great to do it here in Miami where I spent a lot of time training and put in do a lot of the hard work.' This has been a prosperous tournament for him, and it was a 25th victory at this Masters level event. There was plenty of high quality tennis as he just about defused the power of the giant South African world No 15, despite suffering a lull that saw him fall 0-4 behind in the second set. He will soon be joined in the British ranks by 25 year-old Bedene, who since 2008 has lived in Welwyn Garden City with his girlfriend Kimalie, a pop star in her native land who is a protégée of renowned record producer Jeff Wayne. Bedene attended a citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday and will formally receive his passport within the next two weeks and start entering tournaments as a British player. Murray's fiancee watches from the shade of her hat at the tournament in Key Biscayne . Kim Sears was made to wait until the final set before seeing her beau get through to the last eight . However, whether he can play Davis Cup for GB is a different matter, as he has three times been in the Slovenian squad, albeit never having played a 'live' rubber. He is appealing a new rule banning players from representing two nations on the basis that his citizenship application was being processed when it was introduced. Bedene is the most significant British tennis import since Greg Rusedski. An athletic and agile baseliner, he has already been ranked 71 in the world and after being held back by injuries last year ought to be heading into the top 50 before too long. 'This is something I have wanted since the moment I stepped foot in this beautiful country,' he said. ' I feel honoured to be able to compete under the Union Jack on the ATP Tour. Davis Cup is another dream and one I will have to fight for with everything I have.' He is unlikely to figure for GB in July's quarter final against France, especially after the heroics of James Ward against the USA. However, he would be a huge asset in any clay court ties.

"Incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has promised an inquiry if the upcoming tour to face a 'mediocre' West Indies side does not go to plan. England's Test team are third in the world and are expected to return from the Caribbean with a success, which would be the ideal preparation ahead of an Ashes summer. A Test series boost will also go a long way in restoring faith in the coaching staff - head coach Peter Moores in particular - who have come in for criticism after the World Cup group-stage exit. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves vows an inquiry if England don't beat West Indies in their Test series . England coach Peter Moores is under pressure after England's disastrous World Cup . However, Graves has sounded a grim warning should Alastair Cook's team fail to beat West Indies, especially as the islanders will be be losing the likes of Chris Gayle to Twenty20 franchises in India. 'If we don't win, I can tell you now there will be some inquiries of why we haven't,' Graves told BBC Radio Leeds. 'I'd certainly be disappointed if we don't win the West Indies series, because I am pretty sure the West Indies are going to have a mediocre team. 'A lot of their stars are going to be playing in the Indian Premier League anyway, not in the Tests, so we should win that series.' Graves is due to start his job at the ECB in May, amid reports of a potential international return for Kevin Pietersen, with the exiled batsman hopeful of first signing for an English county. Test captain Alastair Cook struggled for form in the MCC's nine-wicket defeat to Yorkshire on Tuesday . But before all of that, Graves accepts the board has to start getting back to its roots. With Tom Harrison having taken charge as the new chief executive, Graves added: 'I think we've been seen as a governing body who might have been a bit aloof or a bit away from the coal face. 'I want to get back to the coal face, and our new chief exec is of the same opinion. That's top of the list. 'We want to be open, transparent and we want to work with the counties and everybody else, all the stakeholders, to make sure that we are doing the right thing.'

"Former Chelsea star Salomon Kalou is being sued for €10,000 (£7,100) after appearing to smash a lump out of the Berlin Wall with a hammer and chisel. Kalou, who is now at Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin, was filmed chiseling the Wall by German terrestrial broadcaster ARD in a preview video for Hertha's game against Schalke on Saturday. The clip, which was filmed in the autumn, was shown in the Olympic Stadium before the game, and repeated on ARD's Saturday night highlights show Sportschau. Former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou was filmed taking a piece out of the Berlin Wall . TV presenter Gerhard Delling was left stunned after seeing Kalou take a chunk out of the Berlin Wall . The Ivory Coast international could be hit with a £7,100 fine after smashing lump out of Wall . The producers had come up with the idea of the hammer and chisel as a metaphor for Kalou's task of smashing his way into Schalke's rigid defence, with the Berlin Wall representing Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo's unpopular defensive style. The former Chelsea man obliged unquestioningly, and set about attacking a section of the East Side Gallery, an open air graffiti exhibition which is one of the longest remaining sections of the Wall. The Ivorian was apparently unaware that the Gallery, which attracts more than a million tourists a year, is protected under German monument protection law. Not only that, but the gallery is beloved of many Berliners, with hundreds joining David Hasselhoff and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to protest against its partial dismantlement last year. Kani Alavi, head of the artist's initiative in charge of East Side Gallery, was particularly incensed by Kalou's actions. 'When I initially saw the pictures, I nearly fell off the sofa,' Alavi said. 'Some celebrity is promoting himself at the cost of a monument, and public broadcasters are playing along. It shows a lack of respect. I'm very disappointed.' ARD producers came up with idea ahead of Hertha Berlin's match against Schalke in reference to Roberto Di Matteo's defensive approach . Hertha Berlin striker Kalou played the full 90 minutes of his side's 2-2 draw with Schalke . The initiative has now made an official complaint to the police, and is looking to sue Kalou for around €10,000 (£7,100) worth of damage. The actual extent of the damage, and whether or not Kalou or the broadcaster will be held responsible, remains unclear. 'It's not the first time it's happened,' Alavi told BZ. 'We had a case a few years ago where someone was caught daubing the wall without permission, and they were ordered to pay €2,500 (£1,800) by the court. Alavi was not the only one shocked by the clip. When it was broadcast on Sportschau, presenter Gerhard Delling was visibly taken aback, saying 'he's really taken a piece out of the Wall, there. The beautiful, old Berlin Wall!'. Delling's comment led to even more uproar, and the presenter was forced to defend himself against accusations of nostalgia for the oppressive Wall.","Salomon Kalou was filmed chiseling the Berlin Wall by TV station ARD .

"Arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive Premier League win at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night as they look to chase down second-placed Manchester City. With a nine-point gap to leaders Chelsea, the title looks to be beyond Arsene Wenger's men yet again despite their recent good form. But would finishing as runners-up to Jose Mourinho's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name? Arsenal fan Lee Hurley of blog Daily Cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the Gunners. Just four points from second place, Arsenal haven’t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil-rich Manchester City comes after the Emirates-austerity period has ended. But while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans, it can’t be the end of Arsenal’s ambitions and it won’t be seen as success in its own right. This is a club that wins titles, 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when Chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they couldn’t win them any other way. Arsenal players look dejected during the Monaco defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback . Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated in a 3-1 defeat by Monaco . Alexis Sanchez has been a star performer for the Gunners this season as they seek a top-two finish . In a league that contains clubs who have been outspending Arsenal significantly, to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted Arsenal, again, at the start of this season, who knows how much closer to Chelsea they might have been. But that’s how it’s been with Arsenal over the past 10 years – a severe case of the ‘might have beens’ – what might have been had they not lost so many top players to City and Barcelona and United, or if Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny not been monumental idiots in the League Cup final, or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the Emirates or Eduardo’s leg not been snapped in 2008 when Arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same, albeit in a less dramatic fashion. Or, or, or.... If I’m honest, it's all got a little tedious for many fans, which is why the FA Cup success last season was celebrated so wildly – a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts. The departures of Thierry Henry (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) to Barcelona in the past were huge blows . Arsenal players Mathieu Flamini (left), Olivier Giroud (middle) and Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrate FA Cup success in May 2014 - the club's ended a nine-year trophy drought . Wenger has come under a barrage of criticism from Arsenal fans after last Wednesday's  defeat to Monaco . I can’t speak for all Arsenal fans. Such is the divide between Gooners, nobody could do that (so don’t trust anyone who claims they do). For some fans nothing short of a trophy every year would represent success to them, regardless of how stupid that expectation is. For others they recognise how hard it is to just get in the top four every year (don’t believe me, ask Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester United, even Chelsea who dropped out for a season) and how the footballing landscape has changed so dramatically over the past decade. Ultimately, football is about what you can celebrate and while it’s great fun to get into the Champions League every year, at least until the group stages are over, it’s just not the same as watching your captain lift aloft that great big trophy. After years of scrapping fourth, I’d be more than content should Arsenal grab second place. I want more, though, and I think that is the one and only thing that unites Arsenal fans – they all want more. How patient we all plan to be for it to arrive is another matter altogether.

"Millwall have dismissed manager Ian Holloway and installed club legend Neil Harris as they attempt to try and avoid relegation from The Championship. Chairman John Berylson and the board are believed to have lost patience with Holloway following Saturday's 4-1 home defeat against Norwich City and a decision was announced on Tuesday morning. Harris scored a club record 138 goals in 432 appearances for The Lions and currently works at The New Den coaching their elite development squad. Ian Holloway scratches his head, but time has run out for him to find the solutions to Millwall's problems . Jonathan Howson scored for Norwich during their 4-1 win over Millwall, the club's fourth straight defeat . He served as caretaker-manager last season after Millwall sacked Steve Lomas before appointing Holloway. The dismissal of Holloway is a devastating blow to one of football's most colourful and quotable managers. Known throughout the game as 'Olly', he helped Blackpool win promotion to the Premier League where they were only relegated on the final day with a defeat at Manchester United. Neil Harris, currently the elite development squad coach at Millwall, has been caretaker-manager before . Harris is a legend at Millwall, having scored over 100 times for the club as a player . Holloway fails to get his message across to his players in another defeat for the Championship strugglers . But since leaving Broomfield Road, Holloway was sacked by Crystal Palace and things haven't gone well at Millwall this season.

"Need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Peter Scudamore and Marcus Townend reveal their favourites while Sky Sports News HQ presenter Alex Hammond and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival. PETER SCUDAMORE . Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners . DOUVAN . (Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, 1.30) Rated one of the best horses Irish trainer Willie Mullins  has brought to the meeting, which is saying something. Having beaten some very decent opposition without coming off the bridle, it is impossible to truly measure his merit but the vibes are strong and he should be able to successfully start what could be an amazing afternoon for Mullins and his stable jockey Ruby Walsh. L’Ami Serge looks best of the British but that might not be good enough. BEST ODDS: 13-8 . Douvan, pictured at the gallops, is rated one of the best horses Willie Mullins has brought to the meeting . UN DE SCEAUX . (Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase, 2.05) Another Mullins-trained hot-pot. Fell when clear on his steeplechasing debut but has since pulverised some good performers including Tuesday’s rival Clarcam by 15 lengths in January. Some fear his temperament might get the better of him given the atmosphere but he was far more tractable for Walsh on that last run. BEST ODDS: 8-13 . THE NEW ONE . (Champion Hurdle, 3.20) My pick to derail the Mullins bandwagon by beating hot favourite Faugheen and his two-time champion stablemate Hurricane Fly. Some say the gelding trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies and ridden by his son Sam wasn’t as unlucky as he looked last year when almost brought down at the third hurdle and his failure to keep up on the run to the home turn was crucial. But that ignores how significant a loss of momentum and rhythm can be in a top-quality race. BEST ODDS: 7-2 . ANNIE POWER . (OLBG mares’ hurdle, 4.00) Mullins has won this race with Quevega for the last six years and this mare, whose only career defeat came in last year’s World Hurdle, could be even better. Kept off the track all season by injury but only needs to be near her best to beat a field of inferior rivals. BEST ODDS: 8-13 . The New One is Peter Scudamore's tip to beat favourite Faugheen and Hurricane Fly . MARCUS TOWNEND . SEEDLING . (Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, 1.30) Fair form last season but really flourished this term winning all three races. That includes giving weight and a length-and-a-half beating to Tuesday’s rival Some Plan at Cheltenham in December. The run looks even better when you factor in his bad jumping error at the fourth flight. Trainer Warren Greatrex has his string back in good form after quiet spell. BEST ODDS: 20-1 . SGT RECKLESS . (Arkle Challenge Trophy, 2.05) Lacks experience, racing over fences only once when winning at Uttoxeter in October having been kept away from the worst of the winter ground. Winning a Flat race on the all-weather is unconventional preparation but Mick Channon’s gelding was a fast finishing fourth in last year’s Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and has frame claims if he can pounce off a strong pace set by favourite Un De Sceaux. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . L’UNIQUE . (OLBG Mares’ Hurdle, 4.00) Annie Power is the red-hot favourite for the race but Alan King’s L’Unique looks a great each-way option. She is a Grade One winner who peaks in the spring and was third in this race last year. She also has a decent weight pull for her course defeat by Polly Peachum. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . Sgt Reckless was a fast finishing fourth in last year's Supreme Novices' Hurdle . Sky Sports' Alex Hammond is backing The New One . AND THE CELEBS... Here's who the celebs are backing in the Champion Hurdle. ............................................................................ SIR PETER O’SULLEVAN - Legendary racing commentator . JEZKI .

All fantastic players but for me Gerrard was the best of them all. 'Steven saw I would do everything for my team. In my first season there I played as a second striker and scored 14. But the next year we signed Tores and I moved out to the right. I did that without any problems and Steven liked that.

"Australian tennis pro Bernard Tomic allegedly told a teenage girl he had a stash of cocaine worth $50,000, court documents say. The young woman claims the 22-year-old sports star told her about the drugs while they were both at nightclub boss and developer Jamie Pickering’s penthouse in Surfers Paradise, Queensland. The teenager’s allegation was heard at Southport Magistrates court, on the Gold Coast, on March 12, during a magistrate’s decision, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Magistrate Ron Kilner’s written decision said Pickering will have to stand trial for four counts of supplying cocaine, two of which were to minors. Scroll down for video . Australian tennis pro Bernard Tomic allegedly boasted to a teenage girl that he had a stash of cocaine worth $50,000 . Nightclub boss Jamie Pickering is pictured here with tennis ace Bernard Tomic . Pickering is accused of supplying cocaine to girls as young as 16, between January and April, last year at his Surfers Paradise penthouse. The nightclub owner is a friend of Tomic and the tennis star has previously partied at Pickering’s establishments such as Varsity and Sin City nightclub on the Gold Coast. Pickering told the Gold Coast Bulletin that if Tomic did talk about cocaine to the girl it would have been a joke because ‘he doesn’t touch anything or even go near it’. ‘If it was said, I know it was in jest,’ Pickering said. Pickering said Tomic would have no idea his name had been mentioned in court and was trying to contact him to let him know. ‘Puffery, people make jokes — if he said it, it was purely as a joke, and like I say it could only have been in jest. He would not have been serious in any way,’ Pickering reassured the paper. Tomic was famously photographed partying at Pickering’s Sin City nightclub in 2013 while preparing for the upcoming Australian Open . He was snapped enjoying a lapdance from two women at the club . Tomic was at the club during Schoolies week with Big Brother 2013 winner Tim Dormer . Tomic’s name was mentioned by Magistrate Kilner as he spoke about the statements from four girls who claimed they’d seen a white powdery substance at Pickering’s penthouse. They believed it was cocaine but one girl admitted that no one had identified the powder as drugs or cocaine. Mr Kilner said in the decision: ‘The only exception to that statement was when Bernard Tomic stated to her on one occasion that he had $50,000 worth of cocaine.’ No charges have been made or considered against Tomic. Pickering also told the Gold Coast Bulletin he strongly denied the charges against him. Tomic currently lives in Monaco but lived on the Gold Coast in Queensland for 15 years . No charges have been made or considered against Tomic, police confirmed . Tomic, who is ranked world No. 35, moved to the Gold Coast in 1996 at the age of three when his family migrated from Germany. He currently lives in Monaco in Europe but returns to Australia to visit friends. On one such trip, he was famously photographed partying at Pickering’s Sin City nightclub in 2013 while preparing for the upcoming Australian Open. Tomic was pictured shirtless while enjoying a lapdance from two women during Schoolies week with Big Brother 2013 winner Tim Dormer. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Bernard Tomic's management for comment. Tomic, seen here at the 2015 Australian Open at Melbourne Park, is currently ranked world No. 35 .

"Trainer Michael Scudamore is hoping a breathing operation will make the crucial difference between Next Sensation winning the Grand Annual Chase after last year’s near miss. The eight-year-old put in a spectacular front-running performance in the Festival finale before fading into fourth beaten one and three-quarter lengths by Savello. It was initially hoped the improving gelding might even be up to challenging the top two-mile chasers this season but he has failed to win in four runs, most recently at Newbury in November. Consequently, he lines up in the Grand Annual off a mark only 1lb higher than he raced off 12 months ago. Next Sensation ridden by jockey Tom Scudamore in The Doom Bar Maghull Novices' Steeple Chase . Jockey Davy Russell on Savello (right) wins the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Steeple Chase . Scudamore, who also plans to saddle Grand National contender Monbeg Dude at the Festival, said: ‘He had a racecourse gallop and that went very well and a breathing operation since his last run. ‘Hopefully, that and better ground we will see him back to somewhere he should be. ‘He hates the soft ground and every time we have run him this year it has nearly been heavy. We actually thought he ran a great race at Newbury considering the conditions.’ Monbeg Dude goes onto finish third in The Betfred Grand National Trial  at Haydock Park . Sponsors William Hill make David Pipe’s Bidourey 6-1 favourite to preserve his unbeaten record in the Imperial Cup at Sandown on Saturday. Bidourey holds Festival entries in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle and Triumph Hurdle and would secure a £100,000 bonus if he manages to win the Imperial Cup and go on to success at Cheltenham. Pipe has won the Imperial Cup three times in the last 10 years, twice with four-year-olds – Gaspara in 2007 and Ashkazar in 2008. Gaspara successfully secured the bonus with success in the Fred Winter but Ashkazar was second. Bidourey ridden jumps the last to win the Nomad Novices' Hurdle Race at Leicester Racecourse . Irish trainer Gordon Elliott has booked crack amateur jockey Jamie Codd to ride Cause of Causes in the four-mile National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival. The seven-year-old, who was second in last year’s Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase, looks to have been trained specifically for the race have run only three times since, most recently over hurdles.

"Monbeg Dude has been given the all-clear to run in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on April 11 after disappointing trainer Michael Scudamore at the Cheltenham Festival. Scudamore has also revealed a shot at the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on April 25 is one of the options for Grand Annual Chase winner Next Sensation. Monbeg Dude, the gelding part owned by former England rugby union captain Mike Tindall and fellow international James Simpson-Daniel, was a never-dangerous 14th in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase under Paul Carberry. Trainer Michael Scudamore has given Monbeg Dude the green light to race at the Grand National . Scudamore has run a series of tests on the 10-year-old, who was seventh in last year’s National. With the results coming up negative, Scudamore believes the most likely reason for Monbeg Dude’s below par effort was his resentment of a tongue tie being fitted for the first time. The trainer said: ‘We were disappointed with his Cheltenham run but he has come back fine. There is no reason not to run at Aintree and the tongue tie will be left off. ‘We think maybe he did not enjoy running in it even though he has plenty of experience of it being fitted at home.’ Tom Scudamore celebrates winning the A.P. McCoy Grand Annual Handicap Chase with New Sensation . Scudamore is not thinking of Aintree for Next Sensation and the gelding has options at both Ayr and Punchestown but the trainer is tempted by the Celebration Chase. Scudamore added: ‘We are looking at Ayr and Punchestown, although my only worry about Ireland, given he is a nervy character, is the travelling. The Celebration Chase is in the back of my mind. They are talking of taking (2014 winner) Sire De Grugy there but there are usually only five or six runners.’ Scudamore will discuss Monbeg Dude jockey plans in the next week and also looking for a rider is Neil Mulholland, whose The Druids Nephew, a 12-1 Grand National shot, won the Cheltenham race they both contested. Barry Geraghty is hoping to return for the Punchestown Festival after falling and breaking his shinbone . Mulholland has lost both first choice Barry Geraghty, who broke shinbone in a fall on Sunday, and second choice Davy Russell, who broke his arm 24 hours earlier. Geraghty is hoping to be back in action for the Punchestown Festival which starts on April 28.

"Diego Costa is never short of controversy and Sunday was no different as he played a prominent role in Chelsea's 2-0 win against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final. The 26-year-old clashed with Tottenham trio Eric Dier, Nabil Bentaleb and Kyle Walker in the first half of the game, as he got stuck into Mauricio Pochettino's men. Here, Sportsmail looks at Diego Costa's main moments from the Wembley showdown. 7min: It didn't take long for Costa to pick his first personal fight of the afternoon.

Dier - who earlier in the match he clashed with - receives a booking after the Chelsea man goes down under a sliding challenge from him. Spurs players and Dier alike, are furious with the decision. 45min: Dier is lucky to remain on the field after another exchange with Costa, with the latter rolling around in perceived agony following a kick from the 21-year-old.

"A well-known male panda living in Taipei, Taiwan, has failed to complete his most important job of the year because he was distracted by an apple. When Tuantuan's long-term mating partner, Yuanyuan, was in heat last week - a precious window lasting about 72 hours every year - and Taipei Zoo went to great lengths to entice them to mate naturally. Determined: To celebrity panda Tuantuan, an apple is much more attractive than his long-term girlfriend Yuanyuan who, was on annual heat last week . But the food they used to guide Tuantuan into position ruined the plan, as the 10-year-old male ditched his  girlfriend and leapt towards the apple, according to People's Daily Online. Despite the fact that Yuanyuan repeatedly lifted up her tail, a sign to show she was in heat, Tuantuan changed direction and went for the apple dangled in front of him. Female pandas are generally only in heat once a year for one to three days. In order not to miss Yuanyuan's heat period, Taipei Zoo decided to obtain sperm from Tuantuan through an operation. Yuanyuan was artificially inseminated twice the same night. Gift: The two pandas were given to Taiwan from mainland China in 2008 as a diplomatic present. Their combined name 'tuan yuan' means reunion in Chinese . Stardom: The pair landed in Taipei in December 2008. Thousands went to the zoo to welcome them and millions more watched the event on television . A spokesman from the zoo said they will discover whether the inseminations were successful in about three months. The two pandas were given as a gift to Taiwan from mainland China in 2008. Their combined name 'tuan yuan' means 'reunion' in Chinese. The two became parents for the first time when a baby girl cub called Yuanzai was born in summer 2013. The pair have become local celebrities.

"For one final time, the greatest ever jump jockey will grace his sport’s most spectacular and exciting stage. I urge you not to miss him. McCoy. AP. Nineteen-time champion jump jockey and the most recognisable initials in sport. The 2015 Cheltenham Festival boasts a glittering cast of equine and human stars but the spotlight is on one man. Ruby Walsh (right) will ride Willie Mullins-trained Faugheen in the Champions Hurdle at Cheltenham . The one who will finally walk away from the sport by the end of this season after announcing his abdication following an unchallenged 20-year reign. He is the phenomenon whose record-smashing, off-the-scale achievements have transcended the parochial boundaries of horse racing, the patron saint to millions of punters and sworn enemy of bookmakers. But both sides of that age-old skirmish will probably be praying that the 40-year-old from County Antrim has a final Festival to remember. The next four days for McCoy are not the last time he will ride. It will probably not even be the last time he rides at Cheltenham. McCoy celebrates winning the Gold Cup with Synchronised in 2012 . But it seems like the equivalent of Roger Federer’s last game on Wimbledon’s Centre Court, Ronnie O’Sullivan playing his final frame at The Crucible and — should Liverpool make it through — Steven Gerrard stepping on to the Wembley turf in an FA Cup final. But none of those icons can boast the domination of their own sport like McCoy has ruled racing. He is arguably the best pound-for-pound sportsman around — something crucial in a sport where weights and measures equate to short-head victories or defeats. And nobody loves winning and hates losing more than AP. Thirty Festival wins started with Kibreet in the 1996 Grand Annual Chase. Look back a further 12 months and no-one would have guessed the shape of the last 20 years. His first meeting, then held over three days, consisted of seven rides, three of them 100-1 shots. First up was Supreme Master, who was 16th of 20 in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle. Champion jockey AP McCoy will be competing his his last Cheltenham Festival before retirement . There was a seventh place finish on veteran Beech Road behind Master Oats in the Gold Cup and his best was sixth place on Brave Tornado in the Triumph Hurdle. The middle Wednesday he was riding at Nottingham — a track that does not have a jumps course any more — where he rode a winner. That first experience of the Festival probably taught the young McCoy that Cheltenham is great when you are successful but miserable when it goes wrong. Losing can tear you apart. It is a feeling I know well and McCoy probably enjoyed that Nottingham winner far more than merely being able to play a bit part at the Festival. Just taking part has never been enough for him. There have been times when his pain has been plain for all to see. He got plenty of stick for not smiling even when he won, never mind when he lost. There have been agonising defeats and seasons when his lack of big race Festival ammunition has been tough to take. The fatal injuries to Gloria Victis in the 2000 Gold Cup and Valiramix in the 2002 Champion Hurdle deeply affected him. Jump jockey McCoy has always been a fans' favourite at Cheltenham . As he has got older, he has become better equipped to cope with the Festival roller-coaster of emotions. There will be plenty who point to the tally of 41 Festival wins for Ruby Walsh — a total fuelled by his alliance with Irish powerhouse trainer Willie Mullins and his former tie-up with British champion trainer Paul Nicholls — and ask what the McCoy fuss is all about? Who is the better jockey? Who has the best technique? These are subjective assessments which will never be finally settled. I cannot tell you McCoy has some peerless faultless technique others can only dream of. But I can write of the single-minded drive the like of which I have never known. The bloody-minded determination that can make the impossible possible, just as he did when lifting home Wichita Lineman to win on the opening day in 2009. There is the massive physical strength and resilience to inevitable injury. And I can tell you of the unparalleled professionalism he brings to every ride, an unmatched ability to get off a horse and accurately assess its ability and future career direction as well as his encyclopaedic knowledge of rivals’ strengths and weaknesses. Over the next four days, the chances are Walsh will ride more winners than McCoy, who is 10-1 to be top jockey at the meeting. But AP will view those odds as a challenge. He has sound claims in today’s Champion Hurdle on title holder Jezki, a clutch of handicap possibilities and a strong chance with Hargam in Friday’s Triumph Hurdle. Later that day, Carlingford Lough will be his mount to win a third Gold Cup. The Irish Hennessy Gold Cup winner, who runs in the colours of his boss, owner JP McManus, and is trained by John Kiely, has solid claims in an open year. Victory would be a fairytale ending for both AP and the sport. And you would not bet against it. You never bet against AP.","Jockey AP McCoy will appear Cheltenham Festival for the last time .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has warned against a quota-based system being used in the Premier League believing it will dilute the quality of the division. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke would like to see the number of home-grown players in top-flight squads increased from eight to 12, a move he feels will benefit the national team. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims clubs were told by Dyke at a meeting on Thursday that the FA could not impose the change. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has spoken out against a quota-based system for home grown players . And Wenger believes those changes will not benefit the league or the national team. In an interview with beIN Sports, Wenger said: 'I believe that we are in the world of competition. Competition means who of you or me is the best one. We have to accept that. 'That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best. Or we are not in a competition anymore. The Arsenal boss, on the bench at Newcastle before the international break, is against Greg Dyke's proposals . 'So we can say one of two things - we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players.' Wenger warned that similar schemes in other countries had led to young players becoming 'professional subs', not enhancing their development but downgrading the league standard. 'I give you two examples, he said. 'In Yugoslavia in the past they decided you had to play three players on the team sheet who were under 21. What happened? They became professional subs. It happened in France, too. FA chairman Greg Dyke would like to see at least 12 home-grown players in top-flight squads . 'Then they decided you had to play three players (aged) under 21 from the start. You know what happened? They subbed all three after five minutes.' Dyke's proposal to toughen up home-grown player rules has the backing of UEFA president Michel Platini, who hinted that he intends to follow suit. Should UEFA implement the regulations, then the Premier League would likely have to back down. Dyke hopes a quota-based system for home-grown players would help England manager Roy Hodgson (left)","FA chairman Greg Dyke wants 12 home-grown players in top-flight squads .

"Levante manager Lucas Alcaraz has played down any talk of his side causing an upset at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Despite Real Madrid's poor run of form, which has seen the fans turn on some of the players and the management, Alcaraz knows that on their day they are more than capable of beating his side. Speaking to Levante's official website, Alcaraz explained it would need an excellent team effort. Levante manager Lucas Alcaraz takes his team to the Santiago Bernabeu to face Real Madrid on Sunday . Levante's Kalu Uche (left) celebrates after scoring against Eibar in a 2-1 victory last weekend . He said: 'The players have to play as a team, being able to have order when we have the ball and not suffer losses. 'The potential of Madrid is always high.' A 2-1 over Eibar lifted Levante out of relegation trouble, but the manager does not think it will mean much come Sunday. 'Clearly we won the last game, but there is a vast difference between the potential of Madrid and ours,' he said. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti (centre) takes charge of a training session at Valdebebas on Saturday . Gareth Bale (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo prepare for Sunday's La Liga clash with Levante . Madrid president Florentino Perez was forced to come out in support of his manager this week, declaring 'Ancelotti will continue'. A patchy run of form has seen them drop to second in the table, but it was arguably the 4-3 defeat to Schalke on Tuesday night which was the more damaging to the atmosphere around the club. Despite the uncertainty, Sergio Ramos brushed off the concerns, telling Marca: 'If there's one thing that defines our camp it's joy, in every 'rondo' [piggy-in-the-middle passing drill] and exercise we do. 'First and foremost you have to be happy and have fun, and we have a terrific atmosphere in the dressing room.' Real Madrid president Florentino Perez holds a press conference at the Santiago Bernabeu on Thursday . Ramos is expected to return to the side after injury, but Toni Kroos is expected to be rested in preparation for next week's crucial clash with Barcelona. That means midfielders Lucas Silva and Luka Modric are likely to be recalled to the side, the latter after making his comeback from a serious thigh injury in the Champions League defeat. Daniel Carvajal could also be welcomed back after returning to training with the rest of the squad, but despite a step-up in his rehab, James Rodriguez is not yet ready to return to action.","Real Madrid host Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday night .

"Just a few weeks ago, Real Madrid were the most dazzling side in Europe as they chased Champions League and La Liga glory. Now, they find themselves in a crisis with boss Carlo Ancelotti under fire, record signing Gareth Bale booed by his own fans and Cristiano Ronaldo taking a vow of silence. Here, Spain-based reporter RIK SHARMA runs through just what has gone wrong at the Bernabeu after Tuesday night's 4-3 defeat at home by Schalke. Gareth Bale was subjected to boos from Real Madrid fans as they were beaten at home by Schalke . Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring, but he couldn't prevent his side slumping to a 4-3 defeat . Carlo Ancelotti, pictured hugging Schalke boss Roberto Di Matteo, is under growing pressure at the Bernabeu . It seems that all is not well at the Santiago Bernabeu... You could say that. In fact, you could say a lot worse, and the Spanish newspapers have. 'What horror!' screamed the front page of Marca. 'The odds of being eliminated by Schalke were comparable to those of being killed by a piano,' said AS, after Madrid scraped into the Champions League quarter finals. The Barcelona papers were no kinder. 'A pitiful Madrid!' spat the front page of Sport, while Mundo Deportivo labelled Carlo Ancelotti's side 'ridiculous'. So, what's the problem? Where do you start? Ancelotti's expensive cruise liner is full of holes and the water is flooding in, just at the wrong time. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, for one, was at fault for three of the four goals Madrid conceded. By the way, the last time they shipped four at the Bernabeu in the Champions League was 15 years ago, against Bayern Munich. Virtually the only thing Casillas stopped on Tuesday night was players like Cristiano Ronaldo from leaving the pitch without applauding the fans. Iker Casillas failed to keep hold of Max Meyer's shot which led to Klass-Jan Huntelaar giving Schalke the lead . Gareth Bale, Alvaro Arbeloa and Cristiano Ronaldo look frustrated as Real Madrid were booed off the field . Surely it is time to play Keylor Navas then? It's not that simple. Jose Mourinho started a war within the club with his treatment of the legendary Casillas. While it's plain to see that the Spanish stopper has been far below his best level for a long time, displacing him could cause more trouble than it's worth. Ancelotti reinstated him and the tension at the club has since simmered down. He will have to think long and hard about whether he wants to start a new battle. Casillas was described as a 'celebrity' rather than a goalkeeper by Marca's Roberto Palomar, but the fact remains that he's the team's captain and has a big influence at the club. Iker Casillas has been below his best for some time, but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds . Casillas called on his Real Madrid team-mates acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat . A group of Real Madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle following a disappointing result . Why did Casillas have to force Ronaldo to stay on the pitch? Ronaldo is not having a happy time right now. Ever since he was berated for celebrating his 30th birthday on the evening of Madrid's embarrassing 4-0 defeat by rivals Atletico Madrid, he's been in a strop. Despite leading Lionel Messi in the Pichichi (golden boot) by 13 goals during mid-December, the pair are now level on 30 goals each in La Liga. After winning the Ballon d'Or in January, his productivity levels have dropped considerably. Ronaldo netted twice against Schalke, and both times he celebrated with fury, rather than joy, as if he was proving a point. Ronaldo scored a double against Schalke, but his relationship with the Madrid supporters is strained . The world player of the year has grown frustrated at the lack of support from the Real Madrid supporters . What’s got Cristiano’s goat? A recent poll in AS suggested 30 per cent of Madrid fans wanted to see him dropped - he probably doesn't think he has anything to thank them for. The whistles screaming around the Bernabeu at full time would have angered Ronaldo particularly, given his contribution to the Madridista cause over the past six years. After the game he angrily declared that he wouldn't be speaking to the press until the end of the season. The Spanish media were deeply critical of Real Madrid in Wednesday morning's newspapers . Marca and AS both opted for striking headlines following Real Madrid's defeat at the hands of Schalke . Gareth Bale looked tired against Schalke . What about his partner in crime, Gareth Bale? The past few weeks have been terrible for the Welshman. After last season's heroics in the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals, Bale was expected to continue his development and become a Bernabeu hero. Instead, he's more often the scapegoat. After the controversy where he shot instead of passing to Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, he was labelled selfish and castigated in the Spanish media. Since then, he's been far more reluctant to shoot. That's manifested itself in his recent productivity; he has no goals and no assists in eight matches. That's a long time to go without contributing as a forward for any side, let alone Real Madrid... Yes, it's quite astonishing really. For the most expensive player in football history, in a top team, to fail to contribute anything in that spell, is a surprise. He's played every minute of those eight games, and only in Madrid's 2-0 win over Deportivo de la Coruna on February 14, could he say that he put in a good performance. Is he tired? He looked exhausted against Schalke? That could be the case. Carlo Ancelotti has largely refused to rotate his side, particularly the strikers. The Italian described the 'BBC' attack as 'unnegotiable'. That's a terrible message to send to both the attacking trident, and players like Javier Hernandez and Jese, who are fighting for a place in the team. If Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema will start every game, regardless of performance, it's not going to motivate them or their underlings to produce good displays. It’s understandable that a player like Bale, who relies on his explosive pace, is feeling the strain. Madrid went to the United States to play friendlies in the summer, and then Morocco for the Club World Cup, all of which takes its toll. Carlo Ancelotti's future at Real is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th European Cup . So, is this all Ancelotti's fault? Well, he's the one that's under pressure now. He's being asked about his future at Madrid, which seems a little unfair given he finally landed them La Decima -  the club's 10th European Cup - last season. However, he's not helping his own cause with some of his comments. 'We've played so badly that it is difficult to explain,' he said after the Schalke game. Unfortunately, Carlo, it is your job to not just explain, but also fix the damage. The white handkerchiefs were out... It's a traditional sign of discontent among supporters in Spain, adopted in football from bullfighting. In that 'sport' it's seen as a positive thing, with spectators waving handkerchiefs to encourage the president of the fight to award the fighter a part of the bull (e.g. an ear, or a tail) as a reward for a good performance. Occasionally handkerchiefs can be waved to show support in football, after a great performance, but that was certainly not the case against Schalke. It's not unique to Real Madrid, but they are the team you associate it most with. The fans are, shall we say, high-maintenance. This is good for Barcelona then, who have overtaken Madrid in the league, heading into El Clasico next Sunday? Very good. Luis Enrique’s men are flying, reaping the rewards from a sensible summer schedule and the rotation which the coach was criticised for at the start of the season. Luis Suarez’s enforced rest means he’s finding his best form at the opportune moment, as Manchester City found out a few weeks ago. So Barcelona will beat Madrid in El Clasico and win La Liga? It’s not that simple. Real Madrid didn’t become a giant of world football by rolling over and having their bellies tickled by their bitter rivals. Luka Modric made his return on Tuesday night and he’s a key part of the team, so during the past three months they’ve sorely missed him. Sergio Ramos has been injured, too, along with James Rodriguez. While the latter won’t make El Clasico, Ramos and Modric should play, and that will help Madrid regain some balance and poise.","Real Madrid were dazzling Europe as they chased Champions League and La Liga glory .

"Gareth Southgate has told Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha he still has time to make the England Under 21 squad for Euro 2015. Zaha won the last of his 10 Under 21 caps against Finland in November 2013 and has not been considered by the head coach since he pulled out of a qualifier against Wales last May with injury. Southgate made it clear at the start of the season he would only use players who were fully committed to playing for England and there is no question Zaha would need to show he has matured to stand a chance of going to the Czech Republic in June. Crystal Palace ace Wilfried Zaha has scored two goals and made one assist in his last six games . Gareth Southgate has told Zaha he still has time to make the England Under 21 squad for Euro 2015 . But his form for Palace has not gone unnoticed — he has scored two goals and made one assist in his last six games — and Southgate intends to visit Zaha to see whether the 22-year-old can force himself into the frame. ‘We have always said with Wilf the door is never closed,’ Southgate said. ‘Unfortunately for him, his move to Manchester United never worked out, the loan to Cardiff never worked out and we have had other forwards who have been in good form. ‘You always have to look at players who are in form and playing well. It would be foolish to rule anyone out. But we have got Danny Ings, Jesse Lingard coming back, Alex Pritchard has got good numbers in terms of goals and assists. Wilf is going to have to play really well to force his way in.’ Southgate admits it would be foolish to rule anybody out of contention ahead of this summer's tournament . Burnley striker Danny Ings has been in fine form during the Premier League season at Turf Moor . Palace boss Alan Pardew said after his side beat Queens Park Rangers earlier this month he intended to speak to Southgate about why the coach would benefit from including Zaha in his plans. Southgate has not heard from his former Palace team-mate but while he would welcome the call, he stressed that Zaha had scored once and made one goal in the 17 games before his burst of form. ‘I said to him (Pardew) when he got the job it would be really interesting to see if he could get Wilf back to where he is,’ said Southgate, whose side face Germany at The Riverside Stadium this evening. ‘He is playing well but there has to be consistency. One of the biggest parts of my role is to go and watch players. Wilf, now he is playing regularly, will be one I have to see.’","Gareth Southgate admits Wilfried Zaha still has time to make his squad .

"West Brom are leading the chase for Wolves winger Bakary Sako whose contract at Molineux runs out in the summer and is regarded as being among the most attractive Bosman signings in the next transfer window. Albion are already looking towards next season with their Premier League status virtually assured under Tony Pulis and have put the 26-year-old Mali international winger top of their wish-list. The traditional rivalry between Wolves and West Brom is not seen as an issue with Sako undergoing his footballing development at French club St Etienne before arriving in the west Midlands in 2012. West Brom are keen to sign Wolves' Mali international winger Bakary Sako when the transfer window reopens . The 26-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and will be available on a free transfer . Veteran coach Tony Pulis has managed to stablize West Brom since taking over at the club earlier this year . In addition to blistering pace and quick footwork, Sako is a regular goalscorer and had found the net 12 times this season as Wolves have enjoyed an impressive return to the Championship after being relegated two seasons ago. Wolves have accepted they are unlikely to be able to persuade Sako to stay given that there is Premier League interest in him - unless they make a late run into the play-offs and are promoted themselves. Albion are clear favourites to land the player if he decides to stay in England but there could also be rival interest from abroad.

"Turn on the telly, lie back and think of England the way it used to be. It isn’t difficult. Not with David James, Phil Neville, Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon sharing their expertise and defensive acumen. Or maybe there’s the midfield craft of Steve McManaman, Paul Scholes, Owen Hargreaves and Jamie Redknapp. Or the striking instincts of Alan Shearer and Michael Owen. That’s a decent international team right there, boasting more than 500 caps and more than a hundred goals, even without Match of the Day host Gary Lineker. Or Gary Neville, one of a few England internationals from his generation involved in coaching, when his Sky TV duties allow. Holland beat England 2-0 in 1993 and almost all of the Dutch side are in coaching but not one player from England is in management... HOLLAND . De Goey: Now works with goalkeepers at Dutch amateur side DHC Delft .

Wright: BBC broadcaster . Ian Wright  is dejected after England's hopes of reaching the World Cup in 1994 . Many former England stars have opted for the sofa. Who can blame them? Coaching is a vocation, an all-consuming passion; not something to dabble at in the hope of discovering you possess a magical gift. Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson have devoted their lives to it. Many top players from the previous generation were chewed up and spat out having been through the usual routine: use your name to get a job, discover it’s damn hard and totally different to being a player and either get disillusioned or sacked or both. Soon the name doesn’t open doors because you’re no longer a star footballer but a failed manager. In the Championship, managers survive an average of eight months, not even long enough to complete the UEFA Pro Licence course, the top qualification which is required to coach in the top two tiers of English football. Gary Neville is one of a few former England internationals involved in coaching after stopping playing . Jamie Redknapp (left) and Jamie Carragher right) chose to work as pundits upon ending their playing days . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is one of a number of  Dutch professionals who have gone on to coach . It is a staggering statistic but out of the 92 Football League managers, only four have played for England and they have just 25 caps between them. They are Sheffield United’s Nigel Clough (14 caps), Huddersfield’s Chris Powell (5), Aston Villa’s Tim Sherwood (3) and Carlisle’s Keith Curle (3). Here lies the mangled logic at the heart of the problem. In the spirit of the football culture in this country, many good players are impatient, convinced they should bypass the qualification process. They would rather learn on the job but the job is too insecure on which to learn. Time in charge is diminishing, as is the likelihood of a second chance. Little wonder English coaching has become a punchbag for the failing national team, although English coaches actually do nothing much different to their foreign counterparts. Did we not like it when Holland beat England in Rotterdam in October 1993? Look back on the teams and none of Graham Taylor’s players are working full-time in football, although most have tried and some may return. Paul Ince managed for 238 games. Almost all the Dutch side are locked into the game at different levels. Six of them have the Pro Licence, compared with three of the English. Frank de Boer is coach of Ajax and has won the Dutch league four times in as many seasons . Danny Blind (left) is part of Holland's coaching setup and is earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink (centre) Former Arsenal winger Marc Overmars (right) is now the director of football at Ajax . Ronald Koeman is at Southampton and coveted by Barcelona, Frank de Boer is at Ajax, where Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp are in senior roles. Ronald de Boer was involved in the Ajax youth set-up until the club ordered him to choose between his coaching and broadcasting. He chose TV, surprisingly. Move on to the Euro 96 meeting between the nations and the Dutch team includes PSV Eindhoven boss Phillip Cocu and Danny Blind, earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink as Holland coach. With Giovanni van Bronckhorst stepping up to become Feyenoord boss next season, it means Holland’s ‘Big Three’ clubs will be led by legends with more than 300 caps between them. There is nothing comparable in this country. Scour 92 clubs and you can find 25 England caps, property of Tim Sherwood (3), Keith Curle (3), Chris Powell (5) and Nigel Clough (14). There is a better show from some of the other Home Nations. In Terry Venables’ Euro 96 team which beat Holland 4-1, there was Gareth Southgate, now England U21 manager, protected in the confines of the FA bubble where Stuart Pearce spent much of his coaching career and where Gary Neville is learning. There was Teddy Sheringham, part-time at West Ham, and also in the squad were Les Ferdinand, QPR’s director of football, and Steve Stone, coach at Newcastle. Nothing proves elite players make the best coaches. The opposite could be true to some extent when you look at Ferguson, Wenger or Mourinho. But international players can make fine coaches as Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Bobby Robson, Don Howe and Venables proved. Some who have devoted much time to this subject conclude that the trend is rooted in the British culture, where academic teaching has always held sway over sporting education and where youth coaching is not treated as a career in itself — unlike in parts of Europe and the Americas. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell is one of four former England internationals in the Football League . Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood played three times for England but now manages in the Premier League . The opening of St George's Park has boosted the facilities on hand to the England national team . Why would millionaire footballers trade their comfortable lives to start at the bottom of a profession struggling for identity? This friction has lingered since the days of Sir Walter Winterbottom, who met resistance from traditionalists running clubs and the FA when he tried to modernise the England team to keep pace with countries such as Hungary and Italy in the ’50s. Barriers have been removed. The opening of St George’s Park and recent changes to coach education at the FA represent a big step forward according to many, but some views are deeply engrained. Winterbottom once asked Robson, one of his England players, what he might do when he finished playing. ‘I don’t know,’ replied Robson. ‘I don’t think cleaning windows is an option.’ Nor was a job on Sky Sports, so Winterbottom persuaded Robson to attend one of his coaching courses. Imagine Sven Goran Eriksson asking David Beckham the same question. ‘I’m going to help banish child poverty, model underpants and buy a franchise for a soccer team in Florida, Sven.’ How do the Dutch get their players into the coaching system? And how do they stay there when so many of the English slide out? Is it because England is a nation which prefers coaches to have come through the system? Quite the opposite, really. The obsession with rushing big-name players into high-profile jobs was more probably part of the problem. They weren’t ready for it, since they had no coaching experience, and have fallen out of the system, no doubt bruised by those who sit in judgment and brand them coaching failures. Swansea manager Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager, his team eighth in the Premier League . Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, is the highest ranked British coach in fifth . Meanwhile, there are brilliant coaches who have spent their lives in the lower leagues, a welcoming hand never reaching out to them from the Premier League. Many of the ’93 Holland team went through the Ajax gateway to a coaching career, a club with a reputation for producing elite talent. They were not thrown in at Wycombe like Tony Adams or at Stockport like Carlton Palmer. Holland is a hot-house football environment. Fewer professional teams mean it has a more concentrated focus of talent in competition. There is a greater tactical education and a desire to exchange ideas, all of which works for both young players and young coaches. Swansea’s Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager in this country whose team are eighth in the Premier League. Of nine English managers in the top flight, five are in the bottom six fighting to prove their worth as the foreign coaches contest the title with Brendan Rodgers, the top-ranked Brit offering hope in fifth. Mauricio Pochettino has already managed Southampton and Tottenham at the age of 43 . Burnley manager Sean Dyche (left) and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe are both highly rated British coaches . Should anyone slip, there is a ready supply of experienced and fully qualified foreign coaches, often ex-internationals, waiting to step in. Ambitious coaches such as Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino regularly jump ahead of promising homespun talent such as Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe. England, meanwhile, are in danger of surrendering an entire generation of international footballers to an array of media opportunities.","In 1993, Holland beat England 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier .

"We've divided the Premier League into teams from the north and south of England - with Welsh side Swansea included in the south. Rob Draper had the choice to pick any players from the south teams, in any formation, with no limit on the number of players from each club. Here's how we split the clubs: . South . Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United . North . Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland . North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Kicking off today, Rob Draper selects his South XI - plus seven subs. A full explanation of the criteria is below. Tomorrow, Joe Bernstein will reveal his North XI. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Chelsea are top of the Premier League, and they provide the back-bone of our south XI to face the north . Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Not much to say – either him or David de Gea as goalkeeper of the season, so he’s a natural for the southern No 1 slot. Right back: Nathaniel Clyne  (Southampton) You can wrestle this one back and forth with Branislav Ivanovic who has been superb. But I want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving Clyne the nod. Centre back: Jose Fonte (Southampton) Everyone thought Dejan Lovren was the mainstay of the Southampton defence – but quietly getting on with his job and holding together the best back four in the country has been Fonte. Thibaut Courtois has proven himself to be a genuine Premier League star in his first season in England . Nathaniel Clyne (left) has earned himself an England spot, and keeps Branislav Ivanovic out of our side . Despite losing his centre back partner last summer, Jose Fonte has marshalled the best defence in the league . Centre back: John Terry (Captain) (Chelsea) Would be ridiculous not to pick him – the best defender in the Premier League at present. Left back: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea) Outstanding. Unfussy and consistently good. Best left back in the Premier League. Defensive midfield: Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) For months he has been the pivotal player for Chelsea in providing balance – in the mould of Patrick Vieira and there is no higher praise. Defensive midfield: Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) The steadying influence in Southampton’s rise, all the more remarkable given his disaffection at the start of the season. John Terry - still the best defender in the Premier League - will captain our south XI, as he does Chelsea . Morgan Schneiderlin has bounced back from his uncertain summer to be a mainstay for Southampton . Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard and Terry have been at the heart of Chelsea's table-topping form this season . Right wing: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) Better on the left but nevertheless we need to find room for him in this team. The Sanchez-Cazorla-Hazard axis would terrify any team. Attacking midfield: Santi Cazorla (Arsenal) Appears to be at the absolute peak of his career. Previously you wondered if he had the authority and character to dominate games - now, in his favoured central role, he is showing that. Left wing: Eden Hazard (Chelsea) Potential player of the year. Impish, quick and delightfully skilful. A pleasure to watch – and a much more mature player now after two years in the Premier League. Alexis Sanchez has been superb since signing for Arsenal, and is on the right wing for this side . Hazard's goals have helped take Chelsea top of the league, and he is a player of the season contender . Santi Cazorla has shown his best form since returning to a central role, and will operate behind the striker . Striker: Harry Kane (Tottenham) The easiest pick of all. The south is blessed with the best strikers, so much so that maybe we’ll go 4-4-2 later in the game to get Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud on. But there’s no doubt as to who is in best form at present. Subs . Rob Green (QPR) Petr Cech is probably the next best goalkeeper in the south; but we need a keeper who is sharp and playing regularly and Green has been superb. Harry Kane has emerged this season as one of the Premier League's leading strikers, and is a must-pick . Branislav Ivanovic is unlucky to miss out on a starting spot, but stays on the bench for our south XI . Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea) Very hard to leave him out. He has been a monster this season, rarely dipping below a 7/10 performance. Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal) I’m a little worried that pace may be an issue for my centre halves – if it is we have Koscielny to cover. Excellent defender as well, despite Arsenal’s frequent debacles. Fabien Delph (Aston Villa) No doubt he will be outraged at being in a southern team – but we had to draw the line somewhere. Just a really good, solid midfielder now. Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace) Has come on enormously this season and the Africa Cup of Nations break doesn't appear to have affected him at all – causes problems to every team he plays against. Olivier Giroud (Arsenal) Unfashionably good. His strike rate has been superb and his physicality and ability to hold the ball up is now perhaps the best in the Premier League, alongside... (4-2-3-1): Courtois, Clyne,  Fonte, Terry, Azpilicueta; Matic, Schneiderlin; Sanchez, Cazorla, Hazard; Kane. Subs: Green, Ivanovic, Koscielny, Delph, Bolasie, Costa, Giroud . Diego Costa (Chelsea) The season has ebbed and flowed at times but through it all he has remained the striker you want to have on your side. Edged out by Kane at present but he’ll play a part in this game. Honourable mentions to Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) and Charlie Austin (QPR) who have both been excellent and who will be on the stand-by list. Fabian Delph - though not particularly southern - has done enough this season to earn a spot on the bench . Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has caused problems for every defender he has faced this season . Olivier Giroud, underrated but efficient, celebrates yet another Premier League goal for Arsenal .","No place for Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud as Harry Kane leads the line .
Southampton and Chelsea - the Premier League's meanest defences - make up the entire back seven of our Southern XI .
Eden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez will play with Santi Cazorla behind Kane .

"West Brom legend Laurie Cunningham's historic first England cap is to be sold at auction to raise money towards the Celebration Statue in the town centre. Cunningham, who was previously the first black player to represent England at any level after playing for the Under 21s, won the first of his six international caps against Wales at Wembley in 1979. Cunningham's mother Mavis gave the cap to local businessman Jim Cadman who is determined to give supporters an opportunity to see it before it is put up for sale in late summer. Baggies legend Laurie Cunningham will have his first England cap auctioned for charity . Cunningham was previously the first black player to represent England at any level after playing for U 21s . Speaking to the Birmingham Mail, he said: 'The family are absolutely delighted with the statue and she told me we could have a cap. 'To then discover it was his first cap is extraordinary. When it comes to memorabilia it is a real piece of history. The Three Degrees meet Cunningham, Brendan Baston (centre) and Cyrille Regis (right) at the Hawthorns . 'It is far too valuable to auction off straight away, so having spoken to the PFA and Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson we want the fans to see it first. 'We will take it on a mini tour with the help of the Albion Supporters Club and then auction it in the late summer early autumn with all the proceeds going to the final phase of the statue funding.' Cunning scored 21 goals in 86 appearances for the Baggies as part of the so-called 'Three Degrees' alongside Cyrille Regis and Brendan Baston before being sold to Real Madrid where he won the La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1979-80.","Laurie Cunningham played for West Brom between 1977 and 1979 .

"Belgium survived a red card to captain Vincent Kompany as Marouane Fellaini's early goal was enough to beat Israel in their Euro 2016 qualifier. Fellaini finished well after Kompany's initial shot had been saved, with the Manchester City skipper sent off after the hour mark as he picked up a second yellow card for fouling Eran Zahavi. That dismissal was a boost for Belgium's Group B rivals Wales, with Kompany now suspended for the game in Cardiff in June.

Booked: Alderweireld, Kompany, Vertonghen . Sent off: Kompany . Scorers: Fellaini 9 . Referee: Mark Clattenburg . The win took Belgium above Wales on goal difference and into top spot in the pool, though, with Fellaini scoring his third goal of the week to seal three points. The Manchester United man was on hand to turn home after Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano pushed out Kompany's effort following Kevin de Bruyne's deep free-kick. De Bruyne came close to doubling the Red Devils' lead, but could only drill his 25-yard effort wide, with Israel's first clear chance not coming until just before the break as Thibaut Courtois kept out Tomer Hemed's shot. Berbras Natcho and Zahavi both brought smart stops out of the Chelsea goalkeeper in the second half before Kompany was given his marching orders by Premier League referee Mark Clattenberg. Despite a numerical advantage, Israel could not find an equaliser as Ben Sahar, Natcho and Nir Biton came closest to rescuing a result for the hosts. Belgium almost made sure of the points, but Axel Witsel missed the target with a header and Toby Alderweireld's effort was not strong enough to beat Marciano. In the end it did not matter as Fellaini's solitary strike not only continued his own fine goalscoring form but also saw Marc Wilmot's side move to the head of the group.

"Pakistan-born bowler Fawad Ahmed has been tipped to give England a stern examination this summer after being called into Australia's Ashes squad on Tuesday. The 33-year-old, who sought asylum in Australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later, is one of 17 players selected for both the five-Test series and a preceding tour of the West Indies. Ahmed took 48 wickets during Victoria's triumphant Sheffield Shield campaign, catching the eye of national selector Rod Marsh, who feels the spinner can make life difficult for England's batsmen when the Ashes series starts in July. Fawad Ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield final last week . Ahmed bats for Victoria during the Sheffield Shield final with Western Australia in Hobart . 'Him being a leg-spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage,' Marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad. 'Believe it or not, Australia is always looking for leg-spinners. We've had a proud history of leg-spinning in this country and we want that to continue. '(Ahmed) doesn't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure. 'He has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions, which is what good spinners do. 'He maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right-handers, bearing in mind that England may have up to seven left-handers.' Ahmed pictured during a one-day international with England at Old Trafford in September 2013 . Ahmed has caught the eye of Australian selector Rod Marsh (left), seen here with Adam Gilchrist . There was no place for all-rounder Glenn Maxwell despite his World Cup heroics but Adam Voges, the scorer of 1358 runs in Shield cricket last season, will be on the plane departing for the West Indies on May 19. One-day specialist Maxwell, named in the International Cricket Council's team of the tournament following Sunday's triumph over New Zealand in Melbourne, made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against Pakistan in his last Test appearance for the Baggy Green back in October. Marsh said of Voges: 'I looked at him on four or more occasions and I thought 'I don't know how anyone will get this bloke out', he was that dominant. 'It wasn't just the 1300-odd runs, it was the way he made them. 'It was as good a Sheffield Shield batting as I have ever seen. Pure weight of runs, the way in which he got those runs, you could see Test player written all over him.' Adam Voges, seen here playing for Western Australia, has been selected after an excellent season . Glenn Maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping Australia to World Cup success . While fast bowler Ryan Harris is included, he will remain in Australia throughout the tour of the West Indies, which begins in Dominica on June 5, as he anticipates the birth of his first child. After the second Test in Jamaica - scheduled to conclude on June 17 - he will travel to the United Kingdom to reunite with his team-mates ahead of the first Ashes Test at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on July 8. James Pattinson misses the trip to the Caribbean due to an injured left hamstring but will be observed over the coming weeks and may become an option later in the Australian winter. New South Wales wicket-keeper Peter Nevill is included in a Test squad for the first time after scoring 764 runs throughout the Shield campaign. Ryan Harris has been selected but will miss the tour of the West Indies prior to the Ashes . 'Peter Nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps,' said Marsh. 'He has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye.' Also travelling are skipper Michael Clarke and his vice-captain Steve Smith, Brad Haddin, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon. Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Chris Rogers, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, David Warner and Shane Watson complete the selection. Marsh told cricketaustralia.com: 'The Test team has performed very well in recent times, but the big challenge is to do that away from home. 'We believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important Test matches against the West Indies and England and will give us the best chance of success.'","Ahmed called up for Australia's tour of England and West Indies .

"Before getting married next week, there are a couple of things Andy Murray would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man. The immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories — he is within one win of doing so after beating Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the Miami Open. Murray can pass the mark on Tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant South African Kevin Anderson. Andy Murray could become the first British tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats Kevin Anderson . Should Murray survive that encounter, it is possible he could edge ahead of Rafael Nadal and move back up to No 3 in the world rankings, although that also depends on the performances of others here. Going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him, however, and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game. Since tennis went open in 1968 — the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit — only 45 men have clocked that many wins. Only eight who are currently active have managed it. Murray defeatedSantiago Giraldo of Columbia in their third round match during the Miami Open . No British player in that time has got there, Tim Henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark. Murray said: ‘It’s nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there aren’t loads. ‘Even if it doesn’t happen here then at some stage I’m sure I will get there. Murray could leap ahead of Rafael Nadal in the rankings if he beats Anderson in the fourth round . ‘I obviously want to win more and hopefully I still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number. ‘It’s not easy in this era to win that many matches, so it’s a good sign.’ Of those Murray victories, 24 have come so far at this event, making it his most productive Masters level tournament. Murray and Giraldo shake hands after their match which saw the Scot progress to the next round . Factors like it being a familiar training base for Murray — he has a home only three miles away from this Key Biscayne island site — and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that. He is one of the best at adapting to such conditions. After two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced South Florida’s reputation for reliable sunshine, it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against Giraldo, one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of Colombia. The No 27 seed, who beat Murray in their previous meeting on the clay of Madrid last year, is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the ATP Tour is hardly a straightforward endeavour. Murray's form is improving as the season continues and he looks in good shape for Wimbledon . He gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by Murray’s clever mix of angles and spins. The Scot definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago, although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident. He let the South American, as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world, creep back from 5-1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking. Murray is set to marry long-term partner Kim Sears (right) next week following the tournament in Miami .","Andy Murray is one win away from a total of 500 in his career victories .

"Rafael Nadal’s season plunged to a new low when he was dismissed from the Miami Open 2015 by one of those compatriots he usually defeats for a pastime. After Andy Murray had earlier eased through to the fourth round, the World No 3 floated limply away on the brisk Florida breeze, desperately inconsistent in going down 6-4 2-6 6-3 defeat to World No 34 Fernando Verdasco. He was in decent company because another top player in Murray’s half of the draw, Stan Wawrinka, also perished. The 27 year-old Scot is the survivor on that side after a comfortable 6-3 6-4 victory over Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo, and he now meets South African Kevin Anderson. Rafael Nadal was sent out of the Miami Open in the third round by Fernando Verdasco in three sets . Nadal (left) shakes the hand of Verdasco after defeat to his compatriot knocked him out of the Miami Open . Verdasco rarely looked threatened by Nadal, whose season has hit a new low after the defeat . Nadal has a lot of thinking to do following his defeat to 31 year-old left-hander Verdasco, who had only beaten him once in fourteen previous meetings. Only when the challenger seemed to get flustered after missing an early break in the second set was the French Open champion able to assert his normal superiority. The former World No 1 was troubled with wrist, back problems and appendicitis that caused him to miss much of last season’s second half. But he has played a full schedule in 2015, in which he has only reached one final, winning the relatively low-key ATP clay event last month in Buenos Aires. The question is whether the constant strains on his body are finally catching up with him at 28, although he has stuttered before at this time of year before coming storming back on the European clay, where has been undisputed king for 10 years. Once he had reeled in the second set the expectation was that Verdasco might fade, but after a long toilet break he reasserted himself and found that Nadal’s was in generous mood. Nadal struggled to generate his best shots from his traditionally formidable forehand . The 28-year-old Nadal was unable to exploit any potential nerves that could have been felt by Verdasco . Nadal could not build on winning the second set and was beaten 6-3 in the third as Verdasco secured the win . His feared forehand was particularly awry, and whole movement less assured than usual, never able to take advantage of his opponent’s potential nerves. Nadal maintained afterwards that he was unconcerned about his body, and that it was more an issue of his confidence being low: 'The physical problems are past. I am in competition. I'm playing weeks in a row, it is not an excuse,' he said. 'I don't have this self confidence that when I hit the ball I’m going to hit the ball where I want to hit it, to go for the ball running and knowing that my position will be the right one. I need to fix my nerves and my self-control.'","Rafael Nadal lost 6-4 2-6 6-3 to compatriot Fernando Verdasco .

"Following their easy 4-0 win against Lithuania in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier England will face a much sterner test when they travel to Turin for an international friendly against Italy on Tuesday night. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham reminds you of 10 classic matches between the two sides. Italy 1-1 England, May 1933, friendly (Stadio Nazionale del PNF, Rome) This was the first ever meeting between the two sides, most famous for Italy’s fascist leader Benito Mussolini cheering from the stands and being played in a stadium which translated into English as the ‘National Stadium of the National Fascist Party’. England’s squad had to travel by train, setting off from London Victoria, and boat to get to Rome for the match. Italy’s Giovanni Ferrari put the home side ahead in the fourth minute, but Arsenal striker Cliff Bastin scored his first England goal to cancel it out. The England football team pictured at Victoria station as they depart for Rome to face Italy in 1933 . England 3-2 Italy, November 1934, friendly (Highbury, London) This game was labelled ‘The Battle of Highbury’ afterwards. Italy defender Luis Monti broke his foot in only the second minute and it was full of ferocious challenges. Italy were perhaps spurred on by reports at the time that Mussolini had offered the players an Alpha Romeo and £150 each if they won. That incentive back-fired when England went three goals ahead in the first 12 minutes; Eric Brook scoring three minutes in, adding a second after 10 and Ted Drake getting a third. They almost managed to throw it away, allowing Guiseppe Meazza to score twice in the 58th and 62nd minute, but held on for the win. England beat Italy 3-2 'The Battle of Highbury' during the second meeting between the two teams in 1934 . Italy 0-4 England, May 1948, friendly (Stadio Comunale, Turin) The Italians were still world champions, having won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 and it being cancelled on the next two occasions due to World War Two. Italy’s manager was the great double World Cup winner Vittorio Pozzo, but they were rocked by Walter Winterbottom’s England. Stan Mortensen gave England a fourth-minute lead, Tommy Lawton added another and Tom Finney hit two second-half strikes within two minutes of each other. Goalkeeper Frank Swift, in his first match as captain, pulled off some stunning saves to keep Italy out with the score at 2-0. The result reverberated around the football world. Tom Finney scores England's fourth goal as England beat Italy 4-0 in Turin in 1948 . Italy 2-3 England, May 1961, friendly (Olympic Stadium, Rome) Goals from Omar Sivori and Gerry Hitchens put the scores level at the break, but Sergio Brighenti struck another shortly after and with only 13 minutes to play England were still trailing 2-1. That was until Hitchens netted his second of the match and with only five minutes remaining former Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves got the winner. The match was 54 years ago, but still the last time England beat Italy on their own soil. England and Italy line up at the Olympic Stadium in Rome ahead of the Three Lions' 3-2 win in 1961 . England 3-2 Italy, May 1976, friendly (Yankee Stadium, New York) England’s greatest comeback against the Italians came in the USA Bicentennial Cup Tournament. They were two goals behind by half-time, both strikes coming from forward Francesco Graziani. But in a devastating eight-minute spell after the restart England were in front. Former Southampton striker Mick Channon netted a minute from kick off, Liverpool defender Phil Thompson levelled the match two minutes later and in the 53rd minute Channon got the winner. England's Joe Royle watches on during England's 3-1 win against Italy in New York in 1976 . Italy 2-0 England, November 1976, World Cup qualifier (Olympic Stadium, Rome) This was the game which effectively stopped England qualifying for the 1978 World Cup. By the end of the qualifiers, even a draw would have been enough to send them through, but Giancarlo Antognoni scored first and Roberto Bettega, set up by a stroke of genius from Franco Causio, sealed the win for the Azzurri. England won all of their remaining matches and both teams finished the group joint on points, Italy three ahead on goal difference. It ended the reign of England manager Don Revie. The Italy players celebrate as Giancarlo Antognoni gives them the lead against England in 1976 . England 2-0 Italy, November 1977, World Cup qualifier (Wembley Stadium, London) The return was meaningless in terms of World Cup 1978 qualification, but Ron Greenwood had succeeded Revie as caretaker manager and England responded to their previous defeat with goals from Kevin Keegan and Trevor Brooking. It set up Greenwood to go on to the 1982 World Cup in Spain, where they came home undefeated despite being knocked out in the second group stage of the Finals. England's Trevor Brooking Beats Keeper Dino Zoff To Score England's Second in the 1977 qualifier . Italy 1-0 England, June 1980, European Championship group stage (Stadio Comunale, Turin) Italy were the home nation for the 1980 European Championship, and essentially sent England home in the second group match with this slim victory. England badly missed the injured Trevor Francis and lacked firepower up front. His absence proved costly when Marco Tardelli sent the crowd wild with a 79th-minute strike. England managed to beat Spain 2-1 in their final group match, but, at a time when there were only two groups, it was not enough to help them progress. Dino Zoff makes a great save as England are beaten 1-0 by Italy in Turin in the 1980 European Championship . Italy 2-1 England, July 1990, World Cup third-place playoff (Stadio San Nicola, Bari) England had been agonisingly knocked out of Italia ’90 in the semi-finals on penalties by Germany, while hosts Italy suffered the same fate against Argentina. It meant they met in the third-place playoff. Roberto Baggio put Italy ahead in the 71st minute and 10 minutes later David Platt levelled. But four minutes from time, Paul Parker conceded a penalty which Toto Schillaci slotted in to finish as tournament top-scorer with six. England's Peter Beardsley is foiled by Walter Zenga and Ciri Ferrara during the 1990 third-place play-off . Defender Mark Wright appeals next to goalscorer David Platt during the 2-1 win for Italy . Italy 0-0 England, October 1997, World Cup qualifier (Olympic Stadium, Rome) This was a bruising, battling performance which left Paul Ince covered in blood and forehead bandaged, but England with the vital draw they needed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France. The stadium was thick with tension - as was a nation back home in England - and in the latter stages Ian Wright hit a post while Italy’s Christian Vieri headed narrowly wide. The result meant Italy would have to qualify for the tournament via a playoff against Russia, but England were through. Paul Ince was left bloodied after England's battling draw against Italy to secure qualification for 1998 World Cup . Plus two that live in the memory, for very different reasons… . ANDREA PIRLO'S PANENKA . England 0-0 Italy (Italy win 4-2 on penalties), June 2012, European Cup quarter-final (Olympic Stadium, Kiev) The first 120 minutes were not the most glamorous. Italy tortured England with possession and produced 31 shots on goal, but Roy Hodgson’s players produced a lesson in defending, John Terry particularly heroic, to take the game to penalties. What made this tie was Andrea Pirlo’s genius Panenka penalty. England were clinging on in the shoot-out until the Italy midfielder produced a moment of brilliance, sending Joe Hart plunging to his right as the ball floated down the middle with a whirlwind of backspin. Andea Pirlo chips the ball straight down the middle during the Euro 2012 quarter-final penalty shootout . DAVID BECKHAM'S FIRST GAME AS CAPTAIN - AND SETH JOHNSON'S SOLO CAP . Italy 1-0 England, November 2000, friendly (Stadio delle Alpi, Turin) The match was David Beckham’s first in charge as captain of the national team - a duty he would continue for many years - but it would end in defeat. Sven-Goran Eriksson was set to take over and was watching from the stands as caretaker boss Peter Taylor played an experimental side, in which Seth Johnson earned his one and only England cap. They lost by a single goal when Gennaro Gattuso hit an incredible strike in off the crossbar from 30 yards.

Here, Sportsmail reminds you of 10 classic matches between the sides ."
"England may have thrashed Lithuania to take another step along the road to France 2016 but success has certainly not been confined to the senior team this week. When the Three Lions teams are put together from under 17 level upwards, they have won 11 matches out of 11 during this international spell, scoring 27 goals in the process. The under 21s won 1-0 away to the Czech Republic in a friendly on Friday, while the under 20s have beaten Mexico on penalties after a 1-1 draw and seen off the United States 2-1. England's team from under 17 to senior standard have won all 11 matches played this week . England's under 19s have won the first two of their European Championship qualifiers - 3-2 against Denmark and 1-0 against Azerbaijan, meaning they must defeat France on Tuesday to get through. The under 18s got on a roll against Switzerland, winning 1-0 and 6-1 in a double-header of friendlies, and the under 17s won all three of their European Championship qualifiers - against Norway, Slovenia and Romania. So, on the evidence of the past few days, a bright future awaits for the England team. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the players to have performed well at each age group. UNDER 17 . Ike Ugbo . Age: 16 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Chelsea frontman Ugbo has set his sights on emulating club-mate Dominic Solanke by helping England's under 17s to European glory. Solanke played a key role as John Peacock's side lifted the trophy in Malta last year and Ugbo scored twice against Romania at Burton on Thursday to ensure England made this year's finals in Bulgaria with a 100 per cent record. 'It would be a dream come true for me,' said the Chelsea under 18 player afterwards. 'Seeing them win it last year, with Dom doing as well as he did too, it would be great to be able to follow on from them.' Chelsea frontman Ike Ugbo shoots for goal during England under 17's win over Norway last week . Reece Oxford . Age: 16 Club: West Ham Position: Centre-back . Proudly wearing the captain's armband, Oxford headed home to set the Young Lions on their way to a 3-1 win over Slovenia in the second of their Elite Round qualifiers. Despite being just 16, Oxford has featured regularly in West Ham's under 21 side and is tipped for a very bright future. Indeed, the teenager, who made Sam Allardyce's first-team squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Sheffield United earlier in the season, has been the subject of interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Reece Oxford celebrates scoring for the under 17s against Slovenia in last week's qualifier . Danny Collinge . Age: 16 Club: Stuttgart Position: Centre-back . Scorer in England's 3-1 win over Norway, the first of the three qualifiers, Collinge has been a mainstay of the under 17 team for some time. He is something of a novelty in that he belongs to Stuttgart's academy in Germany, having joined them last summer from MK Dons. Reflecting on his goal against Norway, he said: 'I was over the moon - it was just being in the right place at the right time. But my celebration was a bit poor, that needs some work for next time.' Danny Collinge runs away in celebration after scoring his first England goal against Norway . UNDER 18 . Adam Armstrong . Age: 18 Club: Newcastle United Position: Forward . A pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney proved a source of inspiration for Newcastle hotshot Armstrong, who took his Three Lions goal tally to an impressive 19 in 24 matches with three goals in the friendly double-header with Switzerland over the weekend. Having scored the winner in Thursday's behind-closed-doors match at St George's Park, he contributed two stunners in a 6-1 rout of the same opponents at Walsall on Saturday. Already involved in Newcastle's first team, he has made 14 appearances for his hometown club and was also part of the England squad that won the Under 17 European Championships last season. Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored twice in the under 18's friendly against Switzerland . Tammy Abraham . Age: 17 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Abraham was delighted to get off the mark on the international stage after scoring twice in the 6-1 defeat of Switzerland on Saturday but it was merely the continuation of an excellent season. He is the leading goalscorer nationally at under 18 level with 21 and has also played a key role in the Blues run to the FA Youth Cup final. He will now compete with club-mate Dominic Solanke and Armstrong for an England starting spot. Abraham said: 'I just have to keep scoring. That's the aim of any striker. I'll keep working hard to be picked again, and I'll be doing my best to achieve.' Chelsea's Tammy Abraham scores England's third goal against Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday . Taylor Moore . Age: 17 Club: Lens Position: Centre-back . Another Englishman abroad, defender Moore signed a three-year professional deal with French club Lens late last year. Capable of playing in central midfield as well as defence, the 17-year-old has become a regular in Neil Dewsnip's under 18 side this season. He too was part of the under 17s squad that tasted European glory in Malta last year, converting a penalty during the shoot-out win over Holland in the final. Taylor Moore on the ball during the under 18's emphatic 6-1 win over Switzerland on Saturday . UNDER 19 . Ashley Smith-Brown . Age: 18 Club: Manchester City Position: Defender . It's been quite the week for Manchester-born Smith-Brown, who scored vital winning goals in the under 19's qualifiers against Denmark and Azerbaijan, keeping Sean O'Driscoll's team on course for the finals in Greece. Primarily a right-back, Smith-Brown is more than capable of playing in any defensive position and has been involved with City's under 21 side this season, as well as the UEFA Youth League squad that reached the quarter-finals. Ashley Smith-Brown of Manchester City pictured in the colours of England . Patrick Roberts . Age: 18 Club: Fulham Position: Winger . A key component of the under 17 team that lifted the European Championships last year, Fulham whizzkid Roberts has quickly advanced to the under 19 level and looks very much at home. Indeed, in the initial qualifying phase he scored four goals and set up four more. Roberts made his Premier League debut last season and has continued to play for Fulham following their relegation to the Championship. Roberts has scored four goals for England during the current qualification campaign . Izzy Brown . Age: 18 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward/winger . Another member of the England team that triumphed at the Under 17 European Championships, the prolific Brown has made the step-up to the under 19 standard effortlessly and scored in the 3-2 win over Denmark last week. He is already a member of Jose Mourinho's first-team squad but features mainly in the Blues under 21 squad and the under 19 team that has reached the last four of the UEFA Youth League. Izzy Brown celebrates scoring for England against Italy in an under 19 international at Rotherham . UNDER 20 . John Swift . Age: 19 Club: Chelsea Position: Central midfield . An accomplished central midfield player, Swift has worked his way up the England youth ladder from the under 16s and is now a central cog in Aidy Boothroyd's under 20s. He opened the scoring in Sunday's 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth. Brought through the Chelsea academy, Swift is currently out on loan at League One club Swindon Town to gain experience and has impressed, scoring two goals in 10 matches as they push for promotion. John Swift in action for the England under 20s in their 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth . Moses Odubajo . Age: 21 Club: Brentford Position: Right-back . Brentford's Odubajo was called into the under 20 squad by coach Aidy Boothroyd for the first time and impressed in both matches to suggest that future appearances in the Three Lions shirt may be on the cards. The 21-year-old has been important in Brentford's surprising push for Premier League promotion this season and made the transition to the international arena effortlessly, putting himself in the frame for a place in Gareth Southgate's under 21 squad for the summer's European Championships. Moses Odubajo delivers a cross during England's under 20 win over the United States on Sunday . Alex Mowatt . Age: 20 Club: Leeds United Position: Midfield . This was Mowatt's second appearance in the colours of England and he made a strong case for future inclusion with a good performance in the win over the United States. His form in that match compliments his good season for Leeds United in the Championship, where he has made 31 appearances in all competitions and become a mainstay of the side. Leeds United star Alex Mowatt on the ball for the under 20s in their win over the United States . UNDER 21 . Tom Carroll . Age: 22 Club: Swansea City on loan from Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder . Scored the winning goal as England under 21s defeated the Czech Republic, host nation of this summer's European Championships, on Friday night. The midfielder has been a part of Gareth Southgate's squad for some time and has been playing for Swansea City during this campaign on loan from Spurs. Tom Carroll celebrates with a clenched fist after scoring England's winner against the Czech Republic . John Stones . Age: 20 Club: Everton Position: Defender . A player who has experience with the senior team but seems content to gain experience with the under 21s for the time being. He figured in the win over the Czech Republic and looks set to be included in the squad for the Euros in the summer. Still only 20, Stones is a regular fixture in the Everton defence and manager Roberto Martinez has tipped him for a bright future for both club and country. Stones pictured in training ahead of England's under 21 game with the Czech Republic . Matt Targett . Age: 19 Club: Southampton Position: Left-back . Another product of Southampton's prolific production line, Targett made the jump up to under 21 standard on Friday night having previously played for the under 19s and under 20s. It has also been a breakthrough season for the 19-year-old at club level, with Ronald Koeman playing him in 12 Saints matches this term.

"Dusan Tadic ensured that Southampton remain the spot-kick kings of the Premier League with his penalty against Chelsea on Sunday. The Saints have a near perfect record when it comes to penalties in the Premier League era, scoring 52 of their 55 kicks for a 95 per cent success rate. During their time in the Premier League they have had two of the best penalty takers around. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Matt Le Tissier was the designated penalty taker – and his career record was 47 goals from 48 kicks - which is one reason why their record is so impressive. Dusan Tadic scores from the spot against Chelsea - Southampton's 52nd success in the Premier League era . Matt Le Tissier only missed one penalty during his career - against Nottingham Forest in 1993 . His sole failure to score came in March 1993 in a match against Nottingham Forest, his effort being saved by keeper Mark Crossley. Since promotion back to the Premier League in 2012 they had Rickie Lambert with a perfect record from the spot - six from six in the Premier League before his transfer to Liverpool. Of the teams who have been ever present in the Premier League since its inception back in 1992, Chelsea have the best record with a success rate of 88 per cent (99 goals from 113 penalties). Dennis Wise beats Everton keeper Neville Southall from 12 yards back in 1997 . Manchester United's Eric Cantona was one of the most accurate penalty takers in the Premier League . Spurs forward Harry Kane sees his penalty saved by West Ham goalkeeper Adrian earlier this season . Liverpool have been awarded the most penalties of all the clubs that have been in the Premier League since the first season with 132 - of which they scored 101 (77 per cent success rate). Aston Villa have scored just 64 of their 95 spot kicks (67 per cent) since 1992 – the lowest of the ever-present teams. Manchester United have had some excellent penalty takers over the years with Eric Cantona, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo all proving lethal from 12 yards – but they are down in mid-table with 77 per cent (89 goals from 116 attempts) QPR are struggling at the bottom of the table and they have the worst penalty record from their years in the Premier League with just 12 goals from their 18 attempts (67 per cent).

"When Louis van Gaal has time between figuring out the Angel di Maria conundrum and plotting Manchester United’s Champions League return, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink would love a coffee. Hasselbaink is keen to pick the brains of his former coach, in his words one of the world’s greatest, to help League Two Burton Albion’s promotion push. The former Dutch international is doing pretty well so far by himself in his first managerial job in England, leading Burton to top spot since surprisingly taking over in November. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at Burton Albion; they are top of League Two . Hasselbaink scores for Chelsea, against Tottenham, during his playing days in April 2004 . Sportsmail's graphic shows Hasselbaink's long and illustrious career across a number of countries . But getting advice from the United manager with whom he shares a bond can only help. ‘I was always one of his favourites,’ smiles Hasselbaink, who won most of his 23 Holland caps under Van Gaal. ‘He wanted to sign me for Barcelona from Chelsea in 2003. I will never forget this. The fee was already arranged, then they played Valencia, he lost at home, he got the sack, and the deal didn’t go through.’ Does Hasselbaink recognise the prickly Van Gaal we have seen during low ebbs this season? His face lights up. ‘He is mild! I’m telling you,’ he says. ‘I have not spoken to him yet. I need to find the time to go over to Manchester and have a cup of coffee or tea with him when he is not that busy. ‘He is somebody who tells you exactly what he wants, how he wants and when he wants. There are no prisoners. But he is a very loving man and a top coach, one of the best in the world. Louis van Gaal and Hasselbaink get on well, and the Burton boss would like some advice from his countryman . Hasselbaink and Van Gaal (centre) know each other from when the now United boss was in charge of Holland . Hasselbaink is doing well on his own, but admits he would like to sit down for a chat with the United boss . ‘Of course he has come in for criticism because he is manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world, but let’s not forget, Man United is changing. I am 100 per cent he will succeed and they will play attractive football.’ Hasselbaink would hope players under his guidance one day say similar things about him. At 43, his managerial career is embryonic. He was a novice when he took the reins, despite a year at Royal Antwerp in Belgium. His first fortnight at Burton brought challenges even the most experienced manager might have found daunting. In his debut training session goalkeeper Dean Lyness broke his leg. ‘He is a guy who everybody really likes so that was a big blow,’ says Hasselbaink. ‘But he is back training and getting stronger.’ Then, just days after his first match in charge, at Wycombe, there was an emotionally crushing event — the funeral of Lydia Bennett, a 17-year-old who played for Burton’s women’s team. She had collapsed and died at home on November 4. Hasselbaink thinks Van Gaal is one of the best coaches in the world, and insists he was one of his favourites . Hasselbaink had an esteemed playing career, pictured celebrating a goal for Chelsea in 2001 . Hasselbaink admits that as a player he was more loud - and sweary - than he is as a manager . ‘That was devastating,’ says Hasselbaink, his eyes dewy. ‘I have an 18-year-old and for somebody to lose their child at that age is not right.’ He bangs the table. ‘That was very hard. The only thing I could do was go to the funeral and represent the club the right way. I still have Lydia’s black armband in my office hung up. We see it everyday. You get reminded of the real things in life. At times we forget.’ To hear Hasselbaink talk with such sensitivity only underlines why chairman Ben Robinson selected him ahead of 60 other applicants when predecessor Gary Rowett left for Birmingham. Robinson has a knack here, also giving Neil Warnock and Nigel Clough their breaks in management. Hasselbaink’s motivation to plunge into the lower divisions was not obvious. This is a man who scored so many Premier League goals for Leeds United, Chelsea, Middlesbrough and Charlton (127) he still sits 11th on the all-time list, despite retiring seven years ago. The Burton boss sat down with Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell at the club's stadium after a training session . Hasselbaink's yearly earnings are believed to be around £40,000 - minimal compared to his playing days . Money is not the driving factor. When it is suggested he earns in a year what he once earned per week at Chelsea he grins. The figure is believed to be about £40,000 a year. If he simply wanted to stay in football he could have ticked along with punditry jobs. As recently as last October he was on Match of the Day. ‘As much as I’ve enjoyed the punditry, it’s very easy sitting there and judging people,’ he says. ‘You’re not under pressure. Do you know what has happened in that week’s training? You don’t. ‘So I always wanted to be with the players, seeing them smiling, sweating and, at times, moaning. Yes it’s hard. I love it. The second best thing in football — after playing.’ Still, why Burton? Hasselbaink answers emphatically. ‘It was a great opportunity. A very stable club with ambition, a great chairman who works with his managers, a good squad, excellent training facilities, and you can teach players. The Burton boss could easily pick up more than he currently earns, but he wants to cut his teeth at lower level . Scott Parker (left) and Eidur Gudjohnsen (right) watch on as Hasselbaink celebrates a goal at White Hart Lane . ‘I didn’t look at League Two, League One, Championship or whatever. I was always looking at the job. Can I have a Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink feeling there? What’s the identity of the club? Does it fit with me? Do I fit with them?’ We are sitting in an executive suite at Burton’s Pirelli Stadium, a neat ground with 7,000 capacity, opened a decade ago. Training at nearby St George’s Park — the FA centre of excellence costing £105million — has just finished. It does seem to fit. Hasselbaink finds inspiration in Swansea’s incredible rise through the ranks; bottom of the Football League to established Premier League force in 10 years. ‘Swansea have the perfect model. They have an identity of the club and then they find a manager who fits. A lot of other clubs get a manager because he is doing well. He then wants to change lots of players. ‘Swansea have kept their way of playing. Every manager who has come has tweaked it a bit, but not lost the identity of the club. Hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at Burton in November, and looks to be closing in on promotion . The Burton boss wants to follow the model of Swansea, who rose from the lower leagues to the very top . ‘We are still far, far away from Swansea. But they give smaller clubs hope because of how structured and stable they are. If you plan well you have an opportunity to go far, if you stick with that belief.’ Hasselbaink’s belief in a passing style has seen Burton win 14, draw five and lose three of his matches to date. They can go five points clear at the top if they beat Stevenage at home on Monday night. ‘What has surprised me is that the players are better than people say they are,’ he says. ‘I find that there are some really technical players in League Two.’ He tries to remain cool on the touchline. ‘I want to stay as focused on my team as possible, because that’s where I can affect the game. I’m trying not to swear at the fourth official. ‘So far I’ve been more than good! No four-letter words. As a player I was different and always at it. But that is gone. I try to be as respectable as possible.’ Steve McLaren is another manager Hasselbaink speaks to in order to get advice on coaching . McLaren signed Hasselbaink for Middlesbrough during the Burton manager's playing days in the mid 2000's . Steve McClaren lives fairly close and ‘at times we go for lunch or a quick supper’, says Hasselbaink. McClaren signed him for Middlesbrough and took him to Nottingham Forest as a coach, his last role in England. McClaren had one response when Hasselbaink asked him about the Burton offer: ‘Take it.’ Hasselbaink says: ‘He’s a very good manager. I pick up a lot but I don’t copy. You have to make things your own. He is somebody I can call if I need to ask advice. Somebody I really respect.’ Ronald Koeman is another Hasselbaink has phoned. Where he does not wish for assistance, as he sees it, is through the colour of his skin. Hasselbaink, studying for his UEFA Pro Licence, is one of only five black managers in the Football League, but rejects the proposal of a Rooney Rule that would ensure at least one candidate for each vacancy is from a minority ethnic background. He says: ‘If I apply for a job I want to get an interview because they think I am the right person. Not because one of the six has to be black. I want to know they want me because they think I can take the club further. Otherwise I don’t need it.’ It would appear Burton, with sights on breaking into the third tier for the first time in their history, need Hasselbaink.","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has taken Burton Albion to top of League Two .

"World Cup winners Australia could arrive in England this summer with arguably the most fearsome pace attack in Test cricket since the ferocious West Indies sides of the 1980s. Less than 48 hours after claiming their one-day prize, the Aussies turned their attention on the summer's Ashes series. While captain Michael Clarke might have marked Sunday's final triumph over New Zealand by confirming his retirement from the 50-over game, his desire for Test cricket success burns as bright as ever. Australia celebrate after winning the World Cup in Melbourne on Sunday . Clarke was still recovering from a day-long champagne party with fans on the streets of Melbourne when the Aussies confirmed their squad to play a Test series in the West Indies before arriving in England for the start of the Ashes in July. And if Alastair Cook & Co still have nightmare memories of the way they were blown apart by the pace of Mitchell Johnson as they suffered a 5-0 whitewash in Australia, then there is a new nightmare to come. Australia could have as many as four bowlers who have all logged speeds of 90mph plus in their line-up, with both Johnson and his World Cup pace partner Mitchell Starc in the squad. World Cup hero Glenn Maxwell is the glaring omission despite starring on Australia's run to the final . They will be backed up by Ryan Harris, who misses the West Indies trip to stay home for the birth of his first child but will then join up in time for the Ashes. While 24-year-old James Pattinson is also not on the list because he is currently out with a damaged left hamstring, he will also be monitored with the chance to be included in time to travel to England. Clarke will lead a side anxious to rub away bitter memories of their last Ashes tour when they were beaten 3-0 in 2013. World Cup batting hero Steve Smith, who averaged only 38 in that series, is a far improved batsman now and will be expected to get big runs. David Warner, axed from the early Tests and sent away in disgrace after throwing a punch at Joe Root in a nightclub, will also want to make his mark on the series. National selector Rod Marsh told cricketaustralia.com.au: 'The Test team has performed very well in recent times, but the big challenge is to do that away from home. 'We believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important Test matches against the West Indies and England and will give us the best chance of success.' Two players who starred in the World Cup campaign, Glenn Maxwell and James Faulkner, were tipped for the squad but have missed out. Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling terrorised England as Australia ran out 5-0 victors last year . 'Adam Voges and Fawad Ahmed had sensational seasons at domestic level and their performances just couldn't be ignored. They thoroughly deserve their call-up and the opportunity to be a part of this squad. We believe that both can play important roles in the side if required. 'Adam had one of the great seasons in Sheffield Shield history. He is an experienced player and quality character who will add talent and leadership to the touring party. 'Fawad has worked incredibly hard on his game and has demonstrated throughout the season that he can be a consistent wicket taker. 'Peter Nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps. He has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye.' Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner .

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. James Faulkner . Age 24 . Caps 1 . Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack. James Pattinson . Age 24 . Caps 13 . Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Brad Haddin (wkt) Age 37 . Caps 63 . Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team. Chris Rogers . Age 37 . Caps 20 . Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner. Steve Smith (vice captain) Age 25 . Caps 26 . Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin. Nathan Lyon . Age 27 . Caps 39 . Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear. Mitchell Starc . Age 25 . Caps 15 . Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved. Ryan Harris . Age 35 . Caps 27 . Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. Fawad Ahmed . Age 33 . Caps 20 . Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk.

Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger. Adam Voges . Age 35 . Caps 0 .

"Order and progress – Ordem e Progresso – read the Brazilian flags adorning the stands at the Emirates on Sunday, and the Samba stars have certainly made some decent headway since their unceremonious exit from their home World Cup eight months ago. Make no mistake, this was no vintage Selecao showing. There was little of the free-flowing football we have come to expect from Brazil. Head coach Dunga, himself a World Cup-winning defensive midfielder, has implemented a defence-first policy, with long balls up to the strikers very much the order of the day as far as attacking play was concerned. Firmino celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly match between Brazil and Chile . Firmino is congratulated by teammates after scoring the opening goal during the match  at Emirates Stadium . Neymar was in the wars again after this foul on the touchline left the Barcelona star in apparent agony . But Brazil, missing David Luiz, Dante and Maicon from the back four who started the 7-1 humiliation against Germany, looked a vastly more robust outfit defensively. Thiago Silva, so sorely missed in that ill-fated semi-final, was an assured presence at the heart of the back line, while centre-back partner Miranda weighed in with impressive physicality – especially in dealing with the driving force and trickery of Alexis Sanchez. Brazil are the pioneers of the attacking full back, but much-coveted Porto defender Danilo, despite his excellent through-ball for Fermino’s opener, was relatively reserved on the right side of defence. Danilo (right) springs into an acrobatic challenge to try and win back possession for his side from Sanchez . Jefferson SAMBA STAR . Danilo SAMBA STAR . Miranda SAMBA STAR . Thiago Silva SAMBA STAR . Marcelo SAMBA STAR . Costa SAMBA SHOCKER . Souza SAMBA STAR . Fernandinho SAMBA STAR . Coutinho SAMBA SHOCKER . Luiz Adriano SAMBA SHOCKER . Neymar SAMBA STAR . Left back Marcelo, perhaps a surprising inclusion given his culpability in Belo Horizonte, was also uncharacteristically disciplined, but still offered support to Neymar and Philippe Coutinho when the situation called for it. Sitting midfielders Souza and Fernandinho – the latter being the only other survivor from the World Cup semi-final – were effective in protecting the back four and took their clear pre-match objective to kick lumps out of Sanchez very seriously. Though the Manchester City man rode his luck a few too many times in dangerous positions. Where Dunga’s men really struggled to deal with Chile’s high-pressing game was in attacking midfield. Coutinho and Douglas Costa were hassled and harried by their opponents’ packed midfield on the rare occasions they maintained possession, and as a result created very little for their forwards, who were often forced to drop deep to influence the game. Brazil forward Luiz Adriano struggles to keep his balance as Medel challenges his opponent for possession . Barcelona star Neymar keeps his eye on the ball as he tries to control and begin another attack . Barcelona star Neymar is evidently in pain after Medel's cynical stamp at the Emirates stadium on Sunday . Predictably, Neymar drew the majority of attention – both from his baying supporters and his on-pitch adversaries – and he was by far Brazil’s biggest threat in attack. His lively play in a free role was vital to ensure they didn’t stagnate at the business end of the pitch and his ability to occupy multiple defenders was invaluable to his side. Strike partner Luiz Adriano, on the other hand, was ineffectual. With the creativity of Coutinho and Costa stifled, the Shakhtar man saw very little of the ball and appeared disinterested in forcing the issue. Neymar has all eyes on the ball against Chile midfielder Medel at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Real Madrid left back Marcelo attempts to clear the ball under pressure from Vidal during the friendly .

Firmino skips past the on-coming Claudio Bravo on 72 minutes to slot Brazil ahead at the Emirates stadium . His replacement, Firmino, showed impressive composure in scoring Brazil’s winner, and his intelligent movement was a definite upgrade. Though at that stage, Jorge Sampaoli’s men were looking leggy after 72 minutes of dogged pressing, and Firmino exploited this. On the whole, we witnessed a complete change in Brazil’s philosophy since the World Cup, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Their gung-ho approach dictated by passionate home support was perhaps their biggest downfall last summer. A lengthy Mexican wave in the first half told the story of Brazil’s performance, but in sacrificing an emphasis on attack Dunga looks to have addressed Brazil’s major defensive defects. Attacking cohesion will have to wait.","Former defensive midfielder Dunga has implemented a defence-first policy .

"Thierry Henry has urged England's rising stars to make the most of their time with Wayne Rooney before he calls it a day. Henry has hailed Rooney as one of the greats of the game with the 29-year-old England captain just two goals from equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 49 goals for his country. And the former Arsenal and Barcelona striker insists that young players like Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling must not waste their training sessions alongside Rooney. Thierry Henry (right) and Wayne Rooney pictured alongside each other during a Premier League match in 2002 . Wayne Rooney celebrates his 47th goal for England against Lithuania on Friday night . Henry wrote in The Sun: 'You will only truly appreciate Rooney when he has retired. It's a shame but it's always like hat. 'I would absolutely urge all those youngsters in the squad, such as Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, to watch and learn off Rooney from this day onwards. 'They are extremely lucky to be on the same training pitch as this guy and they must make the most of it. It will be a real waste if they do not. 'They must try to copy him. In terms of his dedication and the way he plays. I would also say this to the young lads at Manchester United. Rooney heads in the opening goal past Lithuania goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis at Wembley . Rooney heads the ball past Arlauskis to give England the lead in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier . 'To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes and it isn't easy. 'Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player.' Meanwhile, Rooney has admitted that the excitement generated by Kane, who scored just 79 seconds after coming on as a substitute in the 4-0 win over Lithuania, reminds him of his early games for England at the age of 17. Rooney was a teenage sensation for England twelve years ago and caused even more of a stir when he starred in England’s 2-0 win over Turkey in 2003. Rooney said: ‘There was one stage in the game, after his [Kane's] goal, where he ran down the left and took a few players on which reminded me of that. Tottenham striker Harry Kane celebrates scoring his first goal for England on his debut . Kane (left) headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing England captain Rooney .

You can feel the excitement around the country. You could tell when he came on everyone wanted him to come on and even he himself didn't think he'd score so quick, but we are all delighted for him. 'He's an exciting player. When you speak to him you can see he is a level headed guy and I am sure he has good people around him so will be able to cope with it. Rooney starred on his England debut against Turkey in 2003, at the age of 17 . Rooney (centre) said Kane's debut reminded him of his early games for his country . ‘There are things I could say to advise him but I think there are things you have to learn on your own, which I am sure he will do in the next year or two. 'He is obviously a little bit older than I was and a bit wiser as I was 16 or 17 when I came in. But he is level headed and can cope. ‘I think people try to help you but it is best to learn on your own. When you are a young lad you do make mistakes and you have to learn from them because it will make you a better player.’","Thierry Henry says England's rising stars must learn from Wayne Rooney .

"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez called an emergency press conference on Thursday to express his support for manager Carlo Ancelotti and defend under-fire Gareth Bale. Marca, the Madrid daily sports newspaper, had claimed on Thursday that the former Chelsea boss was close to being sacked, leading their front page with the headline: 'Not One More'. Marca claim that defeat against Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 10 days' time would spell the end for Ancelotti, who led the club to a Champions League and Copa del Rey double last season. But, in direct response to that report, Perez said: 'To use the fact that we are not on our best form at the moment to report information that is not true is unacceptable.

"Roy Keane called Manchester United's Antonio Valencia 'disgraceful' for his part in both of Arsenal's goals in the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford on Monday. Valencia's short backpass gave Danny Welbeck the chance to score Arsenal's winner by rounding David de Gea, and the former United captain thought he was poor. Keane was also annoyed at Arsenal's opening goal which saw Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ride three challenges before setting up Nacho Monreal  with Daley Blind and Valencia at fault. Roy Keane was very critical of Manchester United's Daley Blind and Antonio Valencia on Monday . A poor defensive showing from United allowed Nacho Monreal to score Arsenal's first-half opener . The former United skipper is known for his outspoken views and made it clear that the pair were not fulfilling their responsibilities. 'It’s too open some times – it was a shocking goal to concede,' Keane said. The former United captain had told presenter Gary Lineker not to ask him about United's defensive efforts for Monreal's opener and when the subject was mentioned he was highly critical. 'I'm looking at it in terms of the defending, and character and putting your body on the line,' Keane added. 'The lads have just downed tools there. Blind goes in for a challenge on Alexis Sanchez at Old Trafford but his work for the goal was criticised . Valencia was panned for his 'absolutely disgraceful' contribution which Keane called a 'schoolboy error' 'Blind and Valencia - it's absolutely disgraceful. Schoolboy errors and that’s what costs your team. Big moments in a football match and if you give Arsenal, with the quality that they have, that type of freedom that’s what happens. 'It was too easy, shocking. Absolutely disgraceful.' Valencia was also at fault for Arsenal's second, laying a goal on a plate for former United striker Danny Welbeck with a under-hit back pass to David de Gea. Keane said the freedom given by the players to Alex Oxlade Chamberlain was poor . David de Gea could have taken out Danny Welbeck and taken a red card as a sacrifice said Keane . 'Shocking defending, this is even worse (than the first goal,' Keane added. '(Phil) Jones, there's a time to clear, he can do better and Valencia of course is compounding from the first goal.' And Keane felt David de Gea maybe would have been better served taking out the goalscorer and accepting a red card. 'Maybe the goalkeeper should sacrifice himself and take Danny out,' he said. 'Sometimes you need to sacrifice.'","Roy Keane was appearing as a pundit for the BBC at Old Trafford .

"Worry: Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said that children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about porn . More than one in ten children (12 per cent) aged 12 to 13 have made or been part of a sexually explicit video, according to new research. Nearly one in ten (nine per cent) of children in the age group are worried that they are addicted to porn, a survey of nearly 700 children for the NSPCC's ChildLine service found. And around one in five (18 per cent) said they have seen porn images that have shocked or upset them. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said that children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography. She said: 'Young people are turning to the internet to learn about sex and relationships. 'We know they are frequently stumbling across porn, often unintentionally, and they are telling us very clearly that this is having a damaging and upsetting effect on them. 'Girls in particular have said they feel like they have to look and behave like porn stars to be liked by boys. 'We absolutely have to talk to young people about sex, love, respect and consent as soon as we feel they are ready, to ensure that they gain a proper perspective between real life relationships and the fantasy world of porn.' Peter Liver, director of ChildLine, said children reported that watching porn made them feel depressed, gave them body image issues and put pressure on them to engage in sex acts they are not ready for. A report by charity ChildWise in 2013/14 revealed that website Pornhub was among the top five favourite sites named by boys aged 11-16. And young people post approximately 18,000 messages regarding exposure to porn on the ChildLine discussion forums every month. Mr Liver said: 'The Government recently proposed plans for children aged 11 upwards to be taught about rape and sexual consent as part of PSHE in schools. 'This would include discussion around what they have learnt from watching pornography. 'Across society, we need to remove the embarrassment and shame that exists around talking about porn - which is why we have launched a ChildLine campaign to help young people to make more informed choices.' Around one in five (18 per cent) children aged 12 to 13 said they have seen porn images that have shocked or upset them . ChildLine has created the Fight Against Porn Zombies (FAPZ) campaign to tackle the problem. It will use animations to illustrate the implications of exposure to porn in both boys and girls. Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate relationship support charity, said: 'We very much welcome ChildLine's new campaign, particularly because we know that children and young people do not feel that adults understand the online issues they face. 'In an IPPR poll last year, 61 per cent of young people said adults are out of touch with young people's relationships and friendships, and 56 per cent said adults find it hard to understand or help with online issues. 'That's why high quality, consistent relationships and sex education in schools is so important. 'We must get the right experts helping young people to understand what building blocks are needed for strong relationships, and ensure that what's being taught is applicable in the digital age. How easy access to porn is affecting young people - for example their sexual expectations and self-image - should be a vital component of this.'","Nearly ten per cent of children are worried that they are addicted to porn .

"For once the north London spotlight didn't fall on Arsenal this Sunday afternoon. After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger would have been happy to shun the limelight this time. Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Spurs loss in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with split responses. Olivier Giroud connects with a corner to fire Arsenal in front in the first half as they continue their bid for a top-four finish . Giroud watches as the ball heads for goal as Arsenal take the lead against Everton who were suffering from their European exertions . Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard can only stand and watch, along with the rest of his defence, as the ball trundles into the net . Giroud, content that the ball will cross the line, turns away to celebrate as Howard makes a late but unsuccessful attempt to stop it . In the end, as arch-rivals Tottenham prepared for their date with destiny at Wembley, the Gunners got their win, courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City. But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing. The 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the full story. Everton dominated large spells of this clash - the Emirates Stadium a bag or nerves until Rosicky's last minute goal. Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win. Wenger rang the changes following Wednesday's hugely disappointing loss. Vice captain Per Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed following the loss to Monaco and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. For Gabriel, in particular, it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager's first-team plans. Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays. And it seems Wenger's reached the end of his tether with the German World Cup winner after another disappointing display in midweek. Giroud struggled in Arsenal's midweek defeat by Monaco but showed his delight at the Emirates after firing the Gunners in front . Giroud points to the heavens after scoring (left) and points to his temple as if to urge Arsenal to maintain their concentration . Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Ospina 7.5; Bellerin 7, Gabriel 6.5, Koscielny 6.5, Gibbs 6.5; Coquelin 7 (Chambers 89), Cazorla 7.5; Oxlade-Chamberlain 8 (Rosicky 82), Ozil 6.5, Alexis 6.5 (Welbeck 87); Giroud 7 .

Click here for more pitch maps and stats in our brilliant match zone. Tomas Rosicky had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond Howard in the Everton goal . Rosicky was left in acres of space and allowed time to take aim as he made sure the points were staying at the Emirates . Rosicky and GIroud, Arsenal's two goalscorers, celebrate the former's strike in the dying minutes against visiting Everton . A strong display from Gabriel against Romelu Lukaku may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside Laurent Koscielny - for the Gunners until at least the end of the season. But the former Villareal defender nearly fluffed his lines on his big audition in the 18th minute as he failed to deal with a long-ball to allow Lukaku a free run a David Ospina. Thankfully for the Brazilian, his fellow South American bailed him out with some excellent goalkeeping. It didn't impress the Gunners fans, nor did it his manager who almost saw his central defensive gamble backfire in woeful fashion. Everton deserved the opening, too, after a confident start at the Emirates. Left-back Luke Garbutt, 21, on only his second Premier League start had made a bright start, while Muhamed Besic and Ross Barkley were seeing plenty of the ball in midfield. Arsenal, on the other hand, started lethargically - lacking any vigour or pace in their play. That was until Giroud missed a guild-edged opportunity to hand Arsenal a 28th-minute advantage. Having brilliantly escaped the attentions of Phil Jagielka deep inside the penalty area, the Frenchman had time to pick his spot from Alexis Sanchez's cross - but the striker sent his close range header wide. It was the last thing Giroud needed after his high-profile misses against Monaco on Wednesday. Supporters didn't get on his back this time, fans responding to by Giroud's wastefulness by chanting his name. Francis Coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team-mate before being hit on the face with the ball . Coquelin is looked at by medics getting a bloody nose. The Frenchman carried on but was later forced off with a suspected broken nose . His nose already hurt, Coquelin took another hit when the ball smacked him square in the face as he challenged for it . Coquelin's face was left in a mess as his nose bled following the second of two incidents during Arsenal's win over Everton . Wenger probably wouldn't have been quite so understanding on the bench, however, having watched the striker, who he has spoke glowingly of in recent weeks, squander yet another chance. The miss, though, did herald a period of sustained pressure from the home side after their slow start. However, if Gabriel hadn't produced an excellent last-ditch tackle to deny Lukaku in the 38th minute then the growing sense of optimism would have instantly waned. The challenge would have made Gabriel feel an awful lot better after his earlier howler. And his mood would have improved further when the Gunners took the lead just a minute later. So to did Giroud, who put his midweek woes behind him to nip in front of John Stones to flick home Mesut Ozil's corner. It was the perfect response after the barracking from his own fans during the defeat to Monaco. Perhaps it was harsh on Everton after a first-half in which, for the most part, they looked comfortable, if not the better side. Gareth Barry tried, spectacularly, to put the Toffees back on level terms inside five minutes of the restart but sent an acrobatic bicycle kick over the bar. Luke Garbutt attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by the intervention of Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin . Gabriel was handed a start in the heart of Arsenal's defence and he made his presence felt with this challenge on Romelu Lukaku . Giroud puts his head in as Everton defender Phil Jagielka stretches his leg out in an attempt to win the ball as Arsenal push forward . Everton forward Kevin Mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by Andre Marriner, claiming Oxlade-Chamberlain had handled in the box. Much like the first-half, Roberto Martinez's side had made a positive start after the break - Garbutt's delivery from dead-balls causing Arsenal's defence problems. The Everton boss threw on Aaron Lennon in place of Mirallas in search of a leveller. Given his Spurs connections, Lennon was afforded a horrendous ovation from home supporters. There'd have been more boos in the 65th minute had Ospina not tipped over Lukaku's first-time shot from Barkley's cross as Everton continued to make life uncomfortable for their hosts. It was even more uncomfortable for Francis Coquelin who was left with a bloody nose following an accidental collision with team-mate Giroud. He would later be replaced after taking a ball full in the face. Lennon missed a glorious chance to score on his return to the capital, firing straight at Ospina deep inside the area after great work from Seamus Coleman down the right. The Emirates Stadium was a bag of nerves. Ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent through by Oxlade-Chamberlain but the German's shot was blocked by Jagielka. Substitute Rosicky, finally, eased tensions in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that took a deflection off Jagielka.","Olivier Giroud's first-half volley fired Arsenal in front after his disappointing performance in midweek .

"Roy Hodgson wants his fringe players to prove a point to him in Turin as he prepares to field an 'experimental' line-up against Italy. England's confidence is running high after they thumped Lithuania 4-0 on Friday to stretch their post-World Cup winning streak to seven matches. They know a much stiffer test lies around the corner though. Italy find themselves in the midst of a crisis after coach Antonio Conte received death threats from angry Juventus fans who blame him for causing Claudio Marchisio to break down with a serious knee injury. Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson will change up his starting XI for the friendly against Italy on Tuesday night . The Azzurri are also without experienced campaigners Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi, but they are still by far the toughest opposition England have faced since their winless and joyless campaign in Brazil. Hodgson's plans have been turned completely upside down after nine squad withdrawals, though. The likes of Chris Smalling, Kieran Gibbs, Andros Townsend, Theo Walcott and Ross Barkley are likely to get a chance in Turin and with competition for places increasing, particularly in midfield and attack, Hodgson wants to see encouraging signs from those who step in. 'We've got a tougher test ahead of us against Italy and we will be playing that game with players we wouldn't normally rely upon,' the England manager told FA TV. England fringe players will get a chance to impress manager Roy Hodgson during a friendly in Turin . 'There are an awful lot of people in the squad I count on that we've lost, but what it means is for those who are still with us, many who are relatively untried, there will be a chance for them to show that my faith in selecting them for this squad was justified.' Hodgson confirmed on Saturday that Danny Welbeck, Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines would all return to their clubs. Southampton full-back Ryan Bertrand is the only replacement so Hodgson now has 20 players - including three goalkeepers - to choose from. Those left are an inexperienced bunch. Eight players have 10 caps or less. Arsenal forward Theo walcott, who was a second-half substitute against Lithuania, could start on Tuesday . England duo Wayne Rooney (left) and Danny Welbeck (right) celebrate their strikes on Friday night . Everton midfielder Ross Barkley runs with possession during a late cameo on Friday in the Lithuania match . In a bid, perhaps, to dampen expectations running high following Harry Kane's impressive debut on Friday, Hodgson was moved to describe his line-up as 'experimental' on Sunday. The England manager says his team should not be judged on the result of Tuesday's game at the Juventus Stadium, but later in the season when they are expected to play big friendlies against the likes of Spain, Holland and France. 'The real test against tougher opposition will be when the qualifying campaign is over,' the 67-year-old said. 'When the qualifying campaign ends - we believe we'll be qualified in October - then we have two very important friendlies in November, two important friendlies in March, certainly in May. 'Hopefully we'll get really quality opposition to play us in those matches which will really put us seriously to the test. Harry Kane celebrates scoring on debut as England cruise to a 4-0 victory over Lithunania on Friday night . 'There are a number of players who quite seriously believe they should be in the team and none of them will be in Italy. 'Italy and Ireland (in June) will be to some extent experimental and a chance to break in to what we think is our best XI.' Still, a win against the nation that beat them in their World Cup opener last summer will do no harm to morale, especially if Kane puts on another performance like the one that saw him score after just 79 seconds on the pitch on Friday. For Hodgson it will be the first time he has visited the new Juventus Stadium. Italy striker Eder (left) celebrates scoring a late equaliser against Bulgaria with coach Antonio Conte . He did not enjoy that much success at the Old Lady's former ground, the Stadio delle Alpi, when he was in charge at Inter Milan, mainly because he always came up against a team containing the likes of Alessandro Del Piero, Didier Deschamps and Zinedine Zidane. Hodgson lost twice in the league at Juventus, but a 3-0 Coppa Italia win over the Turin giants is still remembered fondly by Inter fans. 'I didn't have many happy moments in Turin,' Hodgson said. 'Juventus were clearly the best team in the country during my time with many, many star players. 'Apart from one cup victory which we had there, invariably we didn't get the results we wanted. 'But I'm happy to be going back to Italy as a country and I'm happy to be playing Italy again.'","England beat Lithuania 4-0 in Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday at Wembley .

"For once, the focus of north London did not fall on Arsenal on Sunday. After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger was happy to shun the limelight this time. Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Tottenham defeat in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with differing opinions. As it happened, they all got their wish. Their arch-rivals lost to Chelsea at Wembley and Arsenal got their win — by the same scoreline, — courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City. Olivier Giroud points to the sky after scoring the opener against Everton at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Giroud had a less than enjoyable time in his side's Champions League defeat against Monaco on Wednesday . The French striker congratulates team-mate Tomas Rosicky after he doubled the Gunners' lead on Sunday . But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing. The 2-0 score doesn't tell the full story. This was unconvincing from Arsenal; the Emirates Stadium a bag of nerves until Rosicky's last-minute goal. Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition remains on course. Despite their lack of fluency, Wenger would have been pleased with the response shown by his wounded players following the midweek loss. Giroud, barracked by his own supporters on Wednesday, did not hide; likewise Francis Coquelin, who played on after breaking his nose. This wasn't the Arsenal we're accustomed to, but after the Monaco monstrosity that didn't concern Wenger. 'I think what was really important was the mentally united response,' he said. Rosicky had been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he doubled Arsenal's lead at the Emirates . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said he was proud of his side's response to the loss against Monaco . 'I am very proud of the response we have shown. Our defensive concentration was at a much higher level than on Wednesday. 'We know with the ball we can do better but overall what was important for us was to respond with a win. Not everyone can produce that after such a disappointment and it was vital for us to win.' Wenger's comments, particularly regarding his side's defensive stability, will have resonated with Per Mertesacker. The Frenchman rang the changes following Wednesday's loss. Vice-captain Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. For Gabriel, in particular, this was a huge opportunity. Per Mertesacker (right) was demoted to the bench following Arsenal's Champions League loss to Monaco . Giroud shows his strength in an impressive display to hold the challenge from Everton defender Phil Jagielka . Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays, including against Monaco. On reflection, it wasn't the most convincing of performances from the 24-year-old on his first Premier League start since arriving for £13.5million from Villareal in January. A clean sheet is a clean sheet, though. Mertesacker knows that more than most. Gabriel very nearly gifted the visitors an early lead, failing to deal with a long-ball to allow Romelu Lukaku a free run at David Ospina. Thankfully for the Brazilian, his fellow South American bailed him out with some fine goalkeeping. A goal would not have flattered Everton, who started brightly. Arsenal, though, were lethargic. Giroud, unmarked from six yards, headed wide in the 28th minute after escaping the attentions of Phil Jagielka inside the penalty area. It was the last thing the striker needed after his wasteful display on Wednesday. But this time supporters didn't get on his back, responding to the miss by chanting his name. Arsenal's Gabriel (right) did not have the most convincing performance but managed to keep a clean sheet . Francis Coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team-mate before being hit in the face . This certainly had the desired effect, as the France international nipped in front of John Stones to flick home Mesut Ozil's corner in the 39th minute. Gareth Barry tried, spectacularly, to put Everton level but his acrobatic bicycle kick flew over. Kevin Mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by Andre Marriner, after claiming Oxlade-Chamberlain had handled. Much like the first half, Roberto Martinez's side made a positive start after the break — Luke Garbutt's dead-ball delivery causing Arsenal's defence problems. Aaron Lennon, given his Spurs connections, was afforded a horrendous welcome when introduced in the 62nd minute. There would have been greater boos three minutes later had Ospina not tipped over Lukaku's first-time shot from a Barkley cross. It was even more uncomfortable for Coquelin (below), who was left with a broken nose following an accidental collision with Giroud. Luke Garbutt attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin . Lennon missed a glorious chance to ram Arsenal supporters' insults down their throats, firing straight at Ospina after great work from Seamus Coleman. The stadium was a bag of nerves by this point. Ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent clean through on goal by Oxlade-Chamberlain but the German's shot was blocked by Jagielka, before substitute Rosicky struck in the final minute to ensure Wenger could finally relax.","Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud scored the opener versus Everton on Sunday .

"So was The New One the unluckiest horse at last year’s Cheltenham Festival? Twelve months of wondering should finally be answered at around half past three on Tuesday afternoon. The ground the gelding surrendered when hampered by the fatal fall of Our Conor at the third flight seemed crucial at the time. But were we all conned by the final-furlong surge that he conjured under jockey Sam Twiston-Davies to grab third place behind Jezki and My Tent Or Yours, just in front of dual winner Hurricane Fly in fourth? Sam Twiston-Davies has unfinished business in Monday's big race at Cheltenham . Twiston-Davies  riding The New One on the way to victory in the StanJames.com Champion Hurdle Trial . Jezki and Hurricane Fly, who have traded punches all winter across the Irish Sea, are back again. They have been joined by Hurricane Fly’s unbeaten stablemate Faugheen, christened ‘The Machine’ because of the stunning visual nature of his performances. Significantly, he is also the choice of stable jockey Ruby Walsh. Together they make up one of the strongest ever Irish assaults on the Stan James Champion Hurdle. Britain can muster only three runners and two of them, Bertimont and Vaniteux, are rank outsiders. With hopes resting on the shoulders of the 22-year-old Twiston-Davies and the gelding trained by his father Nigel — and with the Irish wave advancing — Sam could be forgiven if he felt like Michael Caine in the film Zulu. However, he is totally focused on exorcising last year’s nightmare experience. It was one which prompted an enduring image of the 2014 Festival, the crest-fallen Sam with his head in his hands. Back in 2013 Ireland outscored Great Britain by winning 14 of the 27 races, the first time in Festival history that the Irish have won the majority of the races. Great Britain was back on top last year (15-12) but face a strong challenge this time, with five of Tuesday’s races containing favourites from across the water. Ireland dominates the betting for the feature Champion Hurdle, with The New One an island of red, white and blue amid the green, white and orange of the main contenders. Twiston-Davies is entirely focused on exorcising last year's nightmare experience . If the hot four favourites trained by Willie Mullins and ridden by Ruby Walsh all win on Tuesday, bookmakers claim they could be facing their worst day since Frankie Dettori’s Magnificent Seven at Ascot in 1996, which cost them £40million. The Irish duo struck twice on opening day last year and team up this time with Douvan in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, Un De Sceaux in the Arkle Chase, Faugheen in the Champion Hurdle and Annie Power in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle. Coral’s Dave Stevens said: ‘If all four win it will be our worst day in Festival history. They are bound to be popular and linked in accumulators.’ Sam says: ‘There are loads of different opinions and I’d love to know what the answer is. I have watched the video hundreds of times. ‘It is one of the hardest things I have had to deal with. I had run the race scenario through my head so many times and that was the only one I had not thought of. ‘I was prepared for anything else — to finish second or even to fall off. To see him finish as strongly as he did, if things had gone his way he could have won. Luckily, the owners were very kind. They did not make me hang around (in the unsaddling enclosure) afterwards. We talked about what had happened on another day. ‘I just wanted to sit down and put a towel over my head in the weighing room. ‘The only certainty is that I am now able to deal with defeat and disappointment better than I was. That is the experience of growing up.’ Since last year’s Champion Hurdle, The New One has won all of his five races, four of them this season. He gained plaudits for his impressive victory in Cheltenham’s International Hurdle in December but was less impressive when being forced to dig deeper than expected by Bertimont in his final prep at Haydock. But Sam says that is not a concern, adding: ‘I wouldn’t say we have drawn a line through Haydock because we learned that he doesn’t want heavy ground. He would not run on it that bad again. ‘We also learned when things are not going right he is able to win from a bad situation. We now know if it was a dogfight in the Champion he could cope. I loved his performance in the International Hurdle. It was spectacular. He jumped the last upsides and put four lengths between him and Vaniteux.’ Twiston-Davies says he is now able to deal with defeat and disappointment much better . Victory on Tuesday afternoon would be made even more satisfying given the familial nature of the challenge. Since last year’s meeting, Sam, whose two Festival winners include The New One in the 2013 Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle, has been appointed stable jockey to champion trainer Paul Nicholls, the best job in jump racing. It means a string of good rides lined up this week, including Vibrato Valtat in this afternoon’s Arkle Trophy and Saphir Du Rheu in Thursday’s World Hurdle. But he admits he does not know if he would have accepted such riding riches had he been made to leave the star in his father’s stable behind. ‘It’s a very interesting question and I could not give an answer,’ Sam says. ‘I have been lucky to win a lot of big races but The New One is spectacular — one of the best I have ever ridden. ‘He is massive. Dad’s big chance of the week. To do it as a family would be a dream. He goes there in good form. ‘I just hope last year wasn’t supposed to be his year.’","The New One and Sam Twiston-Davies looking to avenge last year's defeat .
