"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been left powerless to intervene in contract stand-offs with Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson, with club owner John W Henry giving full responsibility in negotiations to business partner Mike Gordon. Gordon, the president of Henry’s Boston-based Fenway Sports Group and the second largest shareholder at Liverpool, has been entrusted to play hardball over new deals while Rodgers tries to focus his players on qualifying for the Champions League. Raheem Sterling has still not penned a new deal despite being offered £100,000-a-week . Reds manager Brendan Rodgers (left) insists he is 'relaxed' about the situation . A final offer of £100,000-a-week has been made to 20-year-old Sterling but, like Luis Suarez two years ago, the England international won’t be allowed to force his way out of the club this summer with more than two years to go on his existing deal. Henderson, seen by Rodgers as his captain next season when Steven Gerrard goes to America, is holding out for £90,000-a-week but has been offered around £60,000. There are also major pay obstacles over proposed new deals for Martin Skrtel, Jordon Ibe and Glen Johnson. The Jamaican-born winger has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season . Rodgers had previously claimed that the club would not be held to ransom by the player's agent . Ahead of Sunday's trip to his old club Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘I don’t even know what Raheem wants (financially) to be honest, I just get him to concentrate on his football. ‘I just hope for the kid’s sake it gets resolved. ‘Ultimately it can be about two things for players and representatives — game time and money. ‘As a manager you want to give everything to the player to help them but ultimately if they, or more so their representative, decides the player needs to move, that is normally what happens. ‘I think this club has all the intention of wrapping these deals up but it’s not just the club, you have to remember that. There are two sides to it.’ Sterling trains with captain Steven Gerrard (right) who has recovered from a spell out with a hamstring injury . Anfield captain-in-waiting Jordan Henderson (3rd left) is also yet to sign a contract extension .","Liverpool manager is 'relaxed' over Raheem Sterling's contract situation .

"Pilots with regional airline Regional Express are no longer allowed to use visual approaches to airports after one captain mistook a row of giant coal loaders for a runway, an air safety report has revealed. Crews must use navigational equipment - instead of relying on the human eye - after the incident near Newcastle's Williamtown airport, when Kooragang Island was mistaken for a landing strip, even though it is 19km away from the small terminal. From a pilots perspective Williamtown airport, left, has similar features to Kooragang Island, right. A report released on Friday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said air traffic controllers intervened just in time to direct the Rex plane back to Wiliamtown airport on November 8, 2013. The plane’s crew were given clearance to approach Williamtown at about 7.30pm. Soon after air traffic controllers noticed the descending plane was making a questionable left hand turn after passing Nobbys Head. A report found Williamtown airport, north east of Newcastle, was difficult to identify among other features on the ground . The captain is reported to have seen a ‘brightly lit row of buildings’ and believed them to be a part of the airport. At this stage the tower controller saw that the plane was ‘manoeuvring at a greater distance than usual from the runway’ and redirected the Sydney to Newcastle flight, not before it had descended to 450 metres off the ground. Same, same but different: The Kooragang Island industrial area is located 19 kilometers from the airport . After landing the pilot told authorities the airport was hard to identify as 'lighting conditions were darker than usual' due to 'cloud cover in the western sky.’ Regional Express pilots have since been told not to make a visual approach, instead using navigation equipment to pinpoint their positions. Banned: Rex airways have ruled out visual approaches after crew incorrectly identified Williamtown airport . The report also claims the pilot was effected by an undisclosed illness which left him fatigued. 'The captain later reported that he may not have been fully fit for duty and that, in hindsight, the illness may have affected his performance on the Newcastle Airport flight.' A report found Williamtown airport, north east of Newcastle, was difficult to identify among other features on the ground.","A plane almost landed on a coal loader after pilot mistook it for an airport .

"A five-year-old managed to start an electric car then crashed into a baby in a buggy at a shopping centre in China. The mischievous boy got into the new white Model S Tesla on display and started the ignition at the mall in Beijing, The People's Daily reports. The car moved forward six metres and crashed straight into a red pushchair with a young child inside. The stroller fell over and the youngster, who was grabbed by its mother, was fortunately unhurt. Baby bump: A five-year-old started an electric car on display in a shopping mall in Beijing, crashing into a pushchair. The young child in the buggy (circled here) was not hurt in the incident . Eyewitness Lok Cheng, 36, told local TV: 'There were loads of kids messing around with the cars, even though it was in a roped off area. 'The car started up but only moved forward at a slow speed, and the woman didn't realise because she had her back to it and the engine made no sound. 'They moved the car back afterwards but you could still see kids playing with it, so I don't think they treated the problem that seriously. At least not until the police turned up.' Road rage: People stand to discuss how a five-year-old boy was able to start up the car on public display . Aftermath: The exact path of the car, which was driven by a five-year-old, can be seen as crowds gather to at the scene. The mother and baby, who were knocked over by the car, are circled next to the buggy . The car was in the middle of the shopping centre in the Chinese capital as part of an exhibition featuring two of the new cars which were on display to the public. The sales team were explaining some of the finer points of the car when the boy opened the door of the white Tesla and climbed inside apparently planning to pretend to drive it. Locked: Another young child tries to get into the car following the incident at a shopping mall in Beijing . At rest: The white Model S can be seen lying in front of the exhibition. Crowds gather to look at the scene . Somehow he managed to start the car up and drove it forward, knocking down the woman and the child she had inside the buggy. It has earned him the nickname 'bear child' in China which is a local expression for children who are left to run amok. The mother and baby were left shaken but unharmed and the family have now filed a complaint with the police. The authorities are investigating why the cars were not locked, allowing the child to get in. Cordoned off: Where the new car should be, behind a tape barrier, at the Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall in Beijing . No action will be taken against the young driver but organisers of the exhibit and the shopping centre management at Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall could face censure for not taking more care. Neither the management or the car showroom organisers commented on Sunday's incident.","Boy climbed into driver's seat of display car before starting engine .

"Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez has been using an anti-gravity treadmill in a bid to speed up his recovery from the foot injury that has kept him sidelined since the start of last month. The Colombia ace broke the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the Champions League winners' 2-1 La Liga win against Sevilla at the Bernabeu on February 4. The 23-year-old was expected to be out for around eight weeks but appears on course to make an early return after already taking part in light training sessions with the squad. James Rodriguez steps up recovery from broken foot by using anti-gravity treadmill . James has been out since the start of February after breaking the fifth metatarsal in his right foot . An anti-gravity treadmill is used in rehabilitation to take pressure off the injured part of the body to allow players to train without the risk of aggravating the injury. Now James has taken to Instagram to document the latest phase of his recovery as the £63million man shared a video of him running on an anti-gravity treadmill. James' return will be welcomed by coach Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid continue to struggle in La Liga. The Champions League winners have failed to win in their last three games having drawn with Villarreal before being beaten by Athletic Bilbao as Barcelona usurped Real at the top of the league. Los Blancos hit a new low on Tuesday as they were beaten 4-3 at the Bernabeu by Schalke, only just scraping through to the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to their 2-0 win away in the first leg.

"Ed Woodward and the Glazers love an eye-catching signing at Manchester United but for manager Louis van Gaal the enforced absence of £59.7million winger Angel di Maria against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday might be the best news he’s had this season. Of all the troubles that have afflicted Van Gaal in the last few months, none will have frustrated him more than the most expensive player in Premier League history. Di Maria flickered brightly when he first arrived from Real Madrid but the last six months have signalled a steady decline due to injury, loss of form, an unfortunate burglary and most recently a stupid red card for pulling referee Michael Oliver against Arsenal on Monday night. Angel di Maria pleads his innocence after being booked by referee Michael Oliver in the defeat to Arsenal . Oliver shows the red card to Di Maria  after he tugged at the referee's shirt following a yellow card . Di Maria  walks off the pitch after receiving the red card during the FA Cup quarter-final with Arsenal . United now have to face Spurs without him as they begin a run of key fixtures that will define their chances of getting into the Champions League. Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea all await in just over a month. Yet Di Maria’s absence also gives Van Gaal an opportunity. By his own admission, the United manager likes to kill off opponents by applying pressure through extended spells of possession. It requires patience from fans and players. For an instinctive risk-taker like Di Maria, it’s akin to being a square peg in a round hole. And for United, the deliberate build-up doesn’t work if after 20 passes, their star man dribbles into a defender and doesn’t fight to win the ball back. LVG has tried the Argentine in several positions but none have worked. Without Di Maria against Spurs, themselves pushing for a top-four place, Van Gaal has greater options. He can opt for two traditional wingers, Ashley Young and Adnan Januzaj, recall the flair of Juan Mata or goal-poacher’s instinct of Radamel Falcao, or play a midfield three of Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and Daley Blind to give him the control he craves. For now, Van Gaal is treading carefully with Di Maria. It wouldn’t be wise to tell the board they’ve wasted their money and with the player’s confidence at a low ebb after his red card hastened United’s FA Cup exit, the manager wants to build him up, not destroy him. Manchester United ace Ander Herrera battles for the ball with fellow Spaniard Santi Cazorla at Old Trafford . Manager Louis van Gaal speaks to Ashley Young during the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Old Trafford . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick vies for the ball with former team-mate Danny Welbeck . Even so, it’s significant when the United manager said on Saturday: ‘You pick up players like Juan Mata and Angel di Maria as they are very creative and dangerous, but when you lose the ball too much every trainer-coach will say, “You don’t have to lose so many balls”, as we have to fight back to win the ball again, or the opponent can score. ‘That is always the balance between creative and measuring the risk and ball possession of the opponent. And that is not only for Mata and Di Maria but for every player.’ United have invested too much in Di Maria to jettison him at the first sign of trouble, particularly if no other club is willing to financially compensate a great deal of their outlay. But should United convincingly overcome a Spurs side brimming with youthful energy in the form of Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason, questions will be asked if they are a better unit without their most expensive acquisition. Tottenham Hotspur's French midfielder Nabil Bentaleb battles Bobby Zamora for the ball at Loftus Road . Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Ryan Mason looks to beat QPR ace Matt Phillips to the ball . Of course, the break-in at Di Maria’s house was horrible for his family, who have effectively been forced from their home and now live in a hotel. But it leaves Van Gaal in a tricky position. In the build-up to Sunday's showdown, the United manager tried to address all sides. He said he expected Di Maria to be at the club next season, but at the same time would be sympathetic to any player who was experiencing off-field problems and wanted to leave. He also pointed out that financial considerations meant the club couldn’t allow Di Maria to go cheap. In shorthand it’s unlikely United would beat off any suitors who waved £50m at them to sign Di Maria this summer. Van Gaal and Ryan Giggs stand with an official as they look to get their tactics across at Old Trafford . The manager’s immediate priority is to try and beat Spurs. Any other result would hand the advantage of Champions League qualification to Arsenal, Liverpool and also Mauricio Pochettino’s team. Failure to be among Europe’s elite for a second consecutive season would be cataclysmic for United on many levels. For Van Gaal, a manager who has won championships with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich, the price would be hurtful in football terms even without the monetary implications. ‘I don’t think that I’m here to think about the financial consequences — that is (for) Ed Woodward,’ he argued. ‘I’m here to manage the professional football department of Manchester United and I’m here because of my qualities and my philosophy. Di Maria celebrates a rare goal in a Manchester United shirt after scoring against Everton at Old Trafford . ‘I think they are pleased with my way of managing the club. I am not thinking of the consequences if I am not in fourth or third. It is very bad for the club but why do we have to speak about things that have not happened yet?’ United have lost only two league games since November 2 but their form has been unconvincing and their fans have booed players for an often safety-first approach. The United manager insists everything is on track and the players are buying into his famed philosophy, even if some supporters are impatient with his pragmatic approach. Due to his price tag, it would have been hard to imagine Di Maria being dropped for such an important fixture as this one against Spurs. Now he can’t play, it will be interesting to see if United gel better as a team without him.

"Manny Pacquiao was up at the crack of dawn on Wednesday morning as he continued to put in the groundwork ahead of his fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr. Joined by a large entourage and a Jack Russell Terrier called Pacman, Pacquiao was pounding the streets of Los Angeles at 5.30am on day three of his training camp. Pacquiao has a little more than eight weeks to get himself down to the 147lb welterweight limit for the $300million (£200m) mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2 . Scroll down to watch a video of Pacquiao training . Manny Pacquiao out for an early morning run in Los Angeles with some members of his team . Pacquiao was joined by a Jack Russell Terrier called Pacman as he stepped up his preparations . Pacquiao stopped to shadow box as he awaits the arrival of his trainer Freddie Roach who is in Macao . Pacquiao's preparations started at home in the Philippines before he flew to Los Angeles last Sunday. The 36-year-old is currently training without his mentor Freddie Roach who is in Macao to corner Zou Shiming as he bids to win his first world title at flyweight. 'Manny told me I should be with Zou because he knows how important this fight is for him,' Roach told ESPN. 'The thing is, Manny is that type of guy. He cares about other people. He knows Shiming has a better chance to win if I'm there with him.' In Roach's absence, Pacquiao is working with assistant trainer Marvin Somodio and childhood friend Buboy Fernandez. And on Wednesday he was seen jogging with several members of his team before spending a short time shadow boxing and stretching off. Both Pacquiao and Mayweather have kept fans updated with their progress via social media by posting pictures and video of their training sessions, although the finer details of their game plans will be worked on away from the cameras. Only one press conference will be held in the build-up, next Wednesday in Los Angeles, as both men come face to face for the final time before fight week.

"Reading boss Steve Clarke has revealed he did not watch the FA Cup semi-final draw as he refuses to look beyond Monday's sixth-round replay against Bradford. The Royals will welcome Phil Parkinson's side to the Madejski Stadium on Monday night, with the winner progressing into the final four to face cup-holders Arsenal at Wembley. A goalless draw at Valley Parade in the original tie means the draw was made following Arsenal's win at Manchester United but before a replay could decide who would face the Gunners. Reading manager Steve Clarke reveals he did not watch the FA Cup semi-final draw . Reading and Bradford played out a goalless draw in the FA Cup quarter-final last weekend . And Clarke, who made nine changes to his side that lost 4-1 at Watford in their Sky Bet Championship clash on Saturday, insists he cannot entertain the idea of a Wembley date as he pays full respect to Bradford. 'I didn't watch the draw,' he said. 'A friend texted me telling me we had drawn Arsenal, but I never intended on watching it. 'I don't think it (the draw) makes any difference whatsoever. I think the game against Bradford is big enough in its own right and the reward of getting through to an FA Cup semi-final is big enough in its own right. So I don't think the semi-final opposition makes a difference to either team. 'Before there is any talk of semi-finals you have to get through to the quarter-final and that's what we intend to do. 'What's the point of thinking about a game that is not there? You have to think about the game coming up and it's a very difficult game for us against a very good Bradford team.' Almen Abdi (centre) got Watford off to a dream start against Reading by scoring  inside a minute . Matej Vyrdra (right) also scored as Watford beat Reading 4-1 on Saturday afternoon . Despite a potential meeting with Arsene Wenger's FA Cup winners, Clarke believes his squad must be targeting their own success in this season's competition rather than just hoping for a Wembley day out against Arsenal. 'To get to Wembley doesn't excite me, to get to the FA Cup semi-final does,' he said. That's the key for me. One more step in the cup would be nice. To get to Wembley is just another game, there are no prizes for it. 'The final goal of any competition is to pick up the silver trophy at the end of it. This is just another step on the way to the final. That's how you have to look at every round and that's how we have looked at every round. 'It's not to get excited about a semi-final. In a semi-final there is no trophy, there are no medals. It's much better to put down on your CV that you have got a cup winners medal or you've lifted a trophy. 'That has to be the ambition. The ambition cannot be to reach the semi-final at Wembley, it has to be to lift the trophy. 'That is the mindset I have to give them. That's the mindset you have to have. If you're satisfied to reach a semi-final then that's not correct.'","Steve Clarke admits he did not watch FA Cup semi-final draw .

With the 2022 World Cup now scheduled for November/December, Valcke said that hosting the Nations Cup just one month later would be unfeasible. The Qatar 2022 World Cup is likely to be moved to November and December, interrupting football's calendar . Jerome Valcke had said the Cup of Nations would be moved to June, but Guinea say that is impossible .

'CAF needs to take care to seek the advice of Guinea that we as a state decide which dates the tournament will be played.

"Warrington piled on the agony for Leeds as the luckless Yorkshiremen lost their star full-back as well as their 100 per cent Super League record on Friday the 13th. The Rhinos left out England international Zak Hardaker after it emerged that he was the subject of a police investigation into an assault case, forcing Leeds to throw teenager Ashton Golding in for his full debut. Golding performed admirably but little else went right for Leeds as they fell from the top of the table and suffered a fifth consecutive defeat at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in going down 18-6 to a Warrington side starting to find their groove. Kevin Penny touches down over the line to score a magnificent solo try and get Warrington on their way . The Rhinos trailed 18-0 until scoring what proved to be a consolation try through winger Tom Briscoe and skipper Kevin Sinfield's goal took him to within three points of the 4,000 mark. The Wolves, led by the magnificent Chris Hill in the absence of the injured Joel Monaghan, created the first chance when lively left winger Matty Russell produced a half-break but centre Ryan Atkins was pulled back for a forward pass. Both sides were full of attacking intent but they virtually cancelled each other out and it took a moment of brilliance from right winger Kevin Penny to break the deadlock on 15 minutes. Penny was forced to drop back to collect Stefan Ratchford's wayward pass but that succeeded in fooling the Leeds defence which was back-pedalling when the one-time basketball player cut a swathe through the middle for an opportunist score. Joe Philbin stops Leeds' Kallum Watkins in a game where excellent defenses trumped ambitious attacks . The Rhinos lost centre Joel Moon with concussion at that point but second rower Carl Ablett has plenty of experience in the threequarters and he demonstrated his nous on 25 minutes to create a clear-cut opening for winger Ryan Hall, who uncharacteristically fumbled the pass. The Wolves then struck another blow seven minutes before the break when Ratchford raced onto a perfectly-judged grubber kick from scrum-half Gareth O'Brien. Ratchford kicked his second goal to make it 12-0 and Warrington defended superbly to keep their lead intact up to the break, with Leeds duo Brad Singleton and Danny McGuire held agonisingly short of the line. Leeds recovered a 12-point interval deficit to win handsomely in their last match but any hopes of a repeat were dashed by an unlikely error from their inspirational captain. Stefan Ratchford dives on the ball to score his side's second try, awarded after a decision from the TMO . O'Brien swooped on a stray pass from the Rhinos stand-off 30 metres out from the visitors' line to get Atkins over for a third try and Ratchford kicked his third goal. Leeds grabbed a lifeline on the hour when Hall broke clear on halfway and centre Kallum Watkins was in support to get Briscoe away and they thought they had scored again moments later when Singleton touched down after Ratchford had fumbled Sinfield's high kick but the try was ruled out for a knock-on by McGuire. Sinfield went off injured 11 minutes from the end as Warrington comfortably held on for a precious victory despite Ratchford missing with a penalty kick at goal and Chris Bridge putting a drop-goal attempt wide.

"Victor Valdes says he can have no complaints about sitting on the bench at Manchester United as he regards his rival David de Gea as the best goalkeeper in the world. Louis van Gaal won the race to sign Valdes in January, but his only appearances in a United shirt so far have come in the Under-21 side. Despite being a three-time Champions League winner, Valdes is yet to turn out for the senior team simply because De Gea's form has been nothing short of outstanding. Victor Valdes (right) says his compatriot and team-mate David de Gea (left) is the finest keeper in the world . The former Barca man admits he doesn't mind warming the Old Trafford bench if De Gea is No 1 . Valdes bears no ill feeling towards his fellow Spaniard though. He can only marvel at his performances. 'You are always waiting for your opportunity to play and train every day to show your performance to the manager,' the former Barcelona goalkeeper told United Uncovered. 'But now David is at a very, very high performance level. 'I think he is the most important goalkeeper in the world at the moment. So it is difficult [for me] to play and, of course, I must accept this. 'For me, the top [keeper] now is David. I see him every day in training. I watch him in every game, every week, and his performances right now are amazing.' Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract, which expires next year. Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract . If they are unsuccessful, Real Madrid will surely pounce to sign the 24-year-old, whose Madrid-based girlfriend Edurne Garcia made it clear that she is not a fan of Manchester this week. Valdes, 33, will have a tough job on his hands winning over the fans if he replaces De Gea in goal next season. 'Every week he makes saves to help the team so I am very happy for him and also for the fans,' said Valdes, who is contracted until the end of next season. 'I always hear them sing the song of David de Gea, so I think they are very happy with David for the level of performance he has shown in the last few years. I feel the fans are definitely very happy with the job he is doing.' De Gea's latest impressive display came on Monday when he prevented Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla from making United's FA Cup exit to Arsenal even more painful. One of the few times De Gea has been upstaged this season came on December 28 when Hugo Lloris pulled off a number of excellent saves to earn Tottenham a 0-0 draw against United at White Hart Lane. United management team Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs face the test of Tottenham on Sunday . De Gea still put in a top performance in north London, and on Sunday he is likely to be busy once more when Spurs come to Old Trafford thanks to Harry Kane's form. Van Gaal, a sincere believer in youth development, has been impressed by the fact that Spurs academy graduate Kane has scored 26 goals in his breakthrough year with the club. 'The way [Kane] is scoring is a reason for their success,' Van Gaal said. 'That's one aspect of the world of football that a big talent can stand up in one season and he is doing that. 'I like the process in Tottenham because there also you can see that a lot of experienced players are not playing and a lot of youngsters are playing. Old Trafford boss Van Gaal identified the scoring sensation Harry Kane as a factor to Tottenham's success . 'In spite of that they are also very close (to the top four) and are playing attacking football. 'I like Tottenham. It is not easy to play Tottenham. 'They have a lot of talent . 'I hope we can beat them because it will be very difficult again.' Sunday's game marks the start of a tough run of fixtures for United, who then face Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea. The Red Devils are fourth in the table, just two points in front of Liverpool and three ahead of Spurs. Van Gaal will be without Robin van Persie on Sunday as he remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Jonny Evans and Angel di Maria are suspended while Marcos Rojo is a doubt due to a groin problem.

"Bradford boss Phil Parkinson believes his side have already won one psychological battle ahead of Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final replay against Reading at the Madejski Stadium. Both sides made wholesale changes to their Saturday line-ups in order to combat the frantic fixture scheduling and it was the second-string Bantams who came out best with a gutsy 1-1 draw at Notts County. Bradford's fortunes came in contrast to their Reading rivals, as Steve Clarke sent out a team entirely unrecognisable from the one that earned a draw at Valley Parade last week and saw the Royals slump to a heavy 4-1 defeat at Watford. Almen Abdi (centre) got Watford off to a dream start against Reading by scoring  inside a minute . Matej Vydra (right) also scored for Watford as they beat Reading 4-1 on Saturday afternoon . Parkinson admitted his own side's push for a place in the League One play-offs had made team selection tricky at Meadow Lane, but is convinced the respective weekend performances will have given his own side a bigger lift. Parkinson said: 'I think Reading had an advantage because they are not going to go up or down whereas we've got to make sure we're still fighting on two fronts. 'Reading were able to make more changes but they got thumped which won't help them. When we've made changes we've got results and that will give everybody a lift because the lads who came in are walking around with a spring in their step. 'I think we got it right. I was pleased with the balance of the team (at Notts County) and I thought all the lads who came in actually added something in terms of freshness.' Reading manager Steve Clarke is bemused by the decision to host a quarter-final replay on a Monday . Both teams missed chances as Reading and Bradford drew 0-0 in the quarter-final last weekend . Bradford manager Phil Parkinson acknowledges the crowd during their FA Cup quarter-final match . Both Parkinson and Clarke have made their feelings clear about the controversial scheduling of the last eight replay, which is due primarily to a ruling that domestic games must not clash with UEFA competitions. But Parkinson hopes to be able to bring back all the first-team players who have starred in their improbable cup run so far, with striker Jon Stead showing a welcome return to form with a swinging opener at Meadow Lane. Stead, who will look to maintain his record of scoring in every round of this season's competition at the Madejski Stadium, had looked off the pace as he struggled with a minor injury issue in recent weeks, with his last goal coming in the famous 2-0 win over Sunderland last month. However, the 31-year-old has been given time to recover by Parkinson and it paid off in his 11th goal of the season before he was taken off on the hour mark as a precautionary measure. 'I thought Jon just needed a break,' said Parkinson. 'He has run himself into the ground every weekend but he looked fresher. 'I gave him that opportunity of a rest and we played him for 60 minutes yesterday. He's clinical with both feet and it was a great finish from him so hopefully the break will have done him good.'","Bradford face Reading in FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday night .

"St Helens needed a supercharged second half show to maintain their 100 per cent First Utility Super League record with a 30-20 win at Widnes. Both sides were without several key players but Widnes deserved their 14-6 interval lead before the champions ran in 24 second half points. Lance Hohaia crossed for two of the visitors' five tries, with others from the outstanding Atelea Vea, Luke Thompson and Jordan Turner. Travis Burns kicked five goals. Lance Hohaia  scores first try forÂ of St Helens on Friday night . Widnes led at the break thanks to tries from Eamon O'Carroll and Patrick Ah Van in front of 7,772 fans. The hosts were missing skipper Kevin Brown, Cameron Phelps, Lloyd White, Manase Manuokafoa and Hep Cahill with Danny Craven, Stefan Marsh, Grant Gore and Macgraff Leuluai back after last week's defeat at Huddersfield. St Helens, without James Roby and banned Kyle Amor, were strengthened by the return of Burns from suspension, while Paul Wellens reverted to his old full-back spot in the absence of injured Jonny Lomax. Josh Jones and Andre Savelio replaced injured Mark Percival and Mark Flanagan, who were also injured in the win at Wakefield with Luke Walsh still missing. Widnes notched their first home win over Saints for 20 years last season and made a flying start with O'Carroll charging over from short range after Danny Tickle was held short. Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook has the ball stripped from him by the tackle from Stefan Marsh of Widnes . Tickle had no problem with the straightforward conversion to fire his side into a 6-0 lead. Alex Walmsley almost forced his way over for Saints but was bundled into touch by determined tackling. The Vikings defence was not as impressive after 15 minutes with Hohaia scampering over from dummy half, with Burns adding the goal to level at 6-6. Saints continued to pile on the pressure before Widnes were only denied on the break by a try saving tackle from Tommy Makinson on Joe Mellor before a thundering midfield burst by Ah Van. Makinson was forced to quit injured with Widnes regaining the lead with Rhys Hanbury's pass putting Ah Van over in the corner and Marsh booting the touchline conversion with Tickle having gone off. Marsh struck a penalty five minutes before the interval to make it 14-6 and Saints could have no complaints after sloppy handling. Jon Wilkin gives thumbs up to Saints fans at the end of the game . Paddy Flynn failed to collect the restart and Widnes paid the price with Ah Van fumbling a Jon Wilkin kick - Vea pounced and Burns converted to cut the gap to 14-12. The Vikings lost Chris Dean with a rib injury and were forced to drop out twice in quick succession from under their own posts as Saints stepped up the tempo. The pressure told with teenage forward Thompson forcing his way over to give Saints the lead for the first time after 53 minutes with Burns' kick edging them ahead 18-14. Saints put daylight between the sides four minutes later after a thundering burst from Vea with Wellens in support to send Turner over and make it 24-14. Hohaia wriggled over for his second try to add to the Vikings' woes on the hour and stretch the lead to 30-14. Danny Craven looked certain to notch a third try for Widnes after a long range break but stumbled and was stopped by Matt Dawson. Widnes managed a late try from Aaron Heremaia but paid the price for their poor start to the second half. Â .","Lance Hohaia scored two of the five tries scored by St Helens .

"A group of male submariners traded illicit videos of female officers in various stages of undress as if they were Pokémon cards, a U.S. Navy prosecutor said on Thursday. Navy prosecutors presented evidence against two of 12 male sailors accused of illegally making and trading videos of female officers aboard a nuclear submarine that was among the first to allow American women to serve alongside men. The two men in court Thursday, both missile technicians aboard the USS Wyoming nuclear submarine, based at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Georgia, were accused of trading the videos with other sailors. Going under: The USS Wyoming submarine, based at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Georgia. A group of 12 male submariners serving aboard the vessel stand accused of taking secret footage of their female colleagues undressing and trading it 'like Pokémon cards' Another sailor aboard the Wyoming made the videos with his smartphone and then told others that he had a 'gift for them,' Navy prosecuting attorney Lieutenant Commander. Lee Marsh said. Once the sailor who took the videos arrived back onshore, Marsh said, he shared them with the others by 'bumping' their smartphones together. The videos were not posted online. 'Videos were treated like Pokémon. Something to be collected,' Marsh said during the preliminary hearing in the case against two missile technicians charged with conspiracy to distribute recordings of private areas of female officers. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Connor, commander of the nation's submarine fleet, has characterized the case as a 'serious sexual offence, with significant penalties.' The case highlights issues the Navy has faced in switching to co-ed crews on ballistic-missile submarines. It began the practice in 2011. More than 50 women now serve aboard submarines, and Connor has said while the change to coed crews has not been without incident, overall it has been a success. Navy Lt. Paul Hochmuth, defense attorney for one of the accused missile technicians who was in court on Thursday, said his client didn't know what the files were when he accepted the 'gift' on his phone. Cartoon capers: The submariners on the USS Wyoming submarine were accused of capturing illicit footage of their female colleagues undressing for the shower and trading it like Pokémon cards, which are based on the popular children's cartoon show (pictured) He argued that the government was unfairly describing the videos as graphic, as they were of poor quality, only ever viewed on smartphones, and showed only partial nudity. 'At no point can you ever see a full length view of the person... You might see a face... then a leg... or a butt... but there is no full length view,' Hochmuth said. Marsh said the quality of the videos is irrelevant because they were made without consent and that they were explicit. 'The videos consist of... undressing for the shower and drying off from the shower,' he said. The hearing was presided over by a Naval officer, who listened to statements from both sides and will issue a recommendation to Rear Admiral Charles Richard, commander of submarine group 10. Richard will decide whether to pursue court martial trials against the defendants, dismiss the charges, or use other administrative methods to deal with the cases.","A gang of 12 submariners stand accused of serious sexual offences after secretly filming their female colleagues getting undressed .

"A passionate tree surgeon created a video to show what his unique, dangerous and perhaps misunderstood job entails. Capturing footage of himself on a GoPro camera, Cezary Romanowski documented his experiences over a period of several months. The video begins with Cezary, a tree surgeon from Poland, sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland. Suitably prepared, Cezary ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes – also known as gaffs or spurs – attached to his chainsaw boots. What follows is a fast-paced montage sequence showing Cezary dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes. Sawing through a particularly large trunk, the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw – while its teeth continue to rotate – and reaching for a wedge. Cezary is filmed sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw before filling it with fuel in a snowy wooded area . Cezary prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top .

"A number of England’s Ashes cricket stars are facing ‘very substantial’ bills from the tax man after investing in film funds, it has been reported. International players including some members of the Ashes-winning team of 2005 are said to have been among those who invested in partnerships set up by Ingenious Media. HM Revenue & Customs is reported to have sent demands to Michael Vaughan, Paul Collingwood, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles – all of whom took part in the landmark triumph over Australia. HM Revenue & Customs is reported to have sent demands to Michael Vaughan (left) and Paul Collingwood (right) According to the Guardian, the four players invested in Ingenious Film Partners in February and March 2005 - just months before England secured its first Ashes victory in 18 years. HMRC is currently locked in a legal battle with Ingenious Media, which set up the partnerships, claiming the investments were a means of avoiding tax. The company has previously denied the claims, saying HMRC approved its schemes at the time and that the investments were made in box office hits including Avatar and Hotel Rwanda. The Guardian reports that former England captain Michael Vaughan invested in three of the partnerships being challenged by HMRC – Ingenious Film Partners 2, Ingenious Film Partners and Inside Track Productions. Ashes heroes Matthew Hoggard (left) and Ashley Giles (right) are also reported to have been sent demands by the taxman . Sky Sports presenter and former Ashes winner David Gower (left) is also on the list of investors along with former International batsmen Alec Stewart (right) Sky Sports presenter and former Ashes winner David Gower is also on the list of investors along with former International batsmen Alec Stewart and Mark Butcher. The list of investors is publicly registered at Companies House. The managing director of Arundel Wealth, Jon Alexander, was brought in by the Professional Cricketers’ Association to provide assistance for the players affected. The Guardian quotes him as saying that some are facing ‘very substantial demands’. Apart from David Gower, the former cricketers contacted by the newspaper declined to discuss the matter publicly – although one spoke anonymously to say the demand could place him in ‘financial difficulty’. David Gower is quoted as saying that the money involved ‘won’t wipe me out.’ Ashes heroes: Michael Vaughan (right) was captain as England won the Ashes in 2005 while Matthew Hoggard (left) was a key wicket-taker . But he added: ‘But the principle is just wrong and I want to stand up against it. The government wanted to encourage investment in the film industry, there was a genuine element of risk. ‘The films were successful and generated more than £1bn in taxable income and now HMRC is coming back ten years later saying the schemes weren’t valid.’ Ingenious has repeatedly defended the schemes it set up and has said  it is confident of winning the legal battle. A spokesman is quoted in the Guardian as saying that its partnerships were either 'sale and leaseback partnerships’ established under government legislation or were ‘bona fide commercial partnerships operated for profit’. The case comes as HMRC stepped up its crackdown on tax-avoidance schemes in a bid to claw back £7.1billion from 43,000 people.","HM Revenue and Customs said to have sent demands to several cricketers .

He has been charged with two other men and two women with their involvement in a paedophile network which filmed their own children in sexual positions or acts. District Attorney Kristin Røhne said: 'The people involved had a sexual interest in very young children.' The court in Drammen was told police began tracking the paedophile ring last year after finding sickening footage of the rape on the computer of a suspected child abuser. Mr Røhne said in a prosecution statement: 'We knew nothing about this child, but on the video we could hear the sound of voices from Norwegian radio or television in the background.' The video was traced to a 34-year-old man who was allegedly sent the footage by the 32-year-old father, it was reported by The Local which cited a report by Norway's Aftenposten newspaper. The 34-year-old is said to have previously been convicted of sexually assaulting a minor and distributing videos of child abuse in 2009. The two men have appeared in court alongside a 27-year-old man and two women aged 27 and 43. They have all been charged with involvement in a paedophile network which filmed their own children in sexual positions or acts. The three men have also been charged with raping the 27-year-old woman's two-month-old baby. A lawyer for the 32-year-old man told the court: 'My client has chosen to confess to all charges and lay all his cards on the table.' The trial continues.

"This is the moment rivalry turned ugly at a college basketball game as opposing cheerleaders became involved in a brawl. Members of the Tuskegee University and Albany State University dance teams were supporting their teams during a tournament clash involving the two Alabama schools. But while there was plenty of action in the game, tensions boiled over off the court - when the cheerleaders squared up for a fight at half time. Scroll down for video . Ugly scenes: Members of the Tuskegee University and Albany State University dance teams were involved in a half time brawl during a college basketball fixture in Alabama .

"England international Zak Hardaker has been dropped by Leeds after it emerged that he is at the centre of a police investigation. The 23-year-old Leeds full-back and his Rhinos team-mate Elliot Minchella are expected to be interviewed by police in the next few days over the alleged assault of a 22-year-old man in student flats in Leeds. In a statement Leeds said: 'The club have been made aware of an incident in which it is alleged that Leeds Rhinos players Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved. England international Zak Hardaker is at the centre of police investigation and has been dropped by Leeds . 'Both the club and the individuals concerned are co-operating fully with the police investigation. 'Until such time as that investigation is concluded neither the club nor the players involved are able to make any further comment.' West Yorkshire police released images of two men earlier this week in connection to a break-in and assault at premises on Burley Road in Leeds on February 3 but since removed them after receiving fresh information. Leeds Rhinos full back Hardaker is taken on by Hull FC ace Steve Michaels who tries to bring him down . A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we will be speaking to two men in connection with the incident.' Police say the victim suffered two black eyes and bruising to his ears and neck. In Hardaker's absence, Leeds coach Brian McDermott gave a full debut to teenager Ashton Golding at full-back for the match against the Wolves. Golding, who was given a new four-year contract in December that ties him to the club until the end of the 2018 season, made his Super League debut last season at London Broncos.","England full-back Zak Hardaker has been dropped by Leeds Rhinos .

"Mauricio Pochettino has confessed to a late-night darts habit and has even organised his home viewing arrangements so he can have an eye on the arrows as he studies football matches beamed into his home from around Europe. 'I was watching the Europa League, on Thursday night, all the games,' said Tottenham boss Pochettino. 'I had two screens set up. One with the Europa League on, and the other with Premier League Darts. It's true. 'We don't have darts in Argentina but ever since I arrived in Southampton I've been a fan. I don't play and I've not been to see it live. I prefer to watch at home.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed he is a big fan of watching the darts at his home . While the Spurs boss is not happy to have been knocked out of the Europa League he does get to watch darts . Some of his Spurs players share his love for the game. Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Andros Townsend, were spotted at Alexandra Palace in January watching the semi-finals of the World Darts Championships. Tottenham's exit from the Europa League, beaten in the second round by Fiorentina, has brought the consolation of allowing their Argentine manager to tune in for the Premier League Darts fixtures on Thursday nights. Pochettino has been watching the likes of Phil 'The Power' Taylor on television recently at his home . Andros Townsend has been pictured at the darts, and his girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan is a walk-on girl . 'I was not happy to go out, my preference would have been to be playing against Roma,' said Pochettino, but it has been another difficult season for English clubs in European competition. Only Everton remain in the Europa League, while Arsenal and Manchester City must overturn first-leg deficits next week in Monaco and Barcelona respectively, if they are to reach the last eight of the Champions League. Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League, and Arsenal and Manchester City face uphill tasks . Everton are the only English team remaining in the Europa League after Spurs and Liverpool's exits . 'European teams have an advantage on English teams,' said Pochettino. 'The most difficult period of the season in England is Christmas when they have a break. In February and March it is very tough for the English teams. 'The number of games we play is more than the European teams. This is the key. Teams in the other leagues are fresher then the English teams. 'Our competition is the toughest in the world. Maybe this explains the results in Europe. Teams like Paris Saint-Germain are only focused on the Champions League. Chelsea are focused on the Capital One Cup and the Premier League. Pochettino says the struggles of English teams like Spurs is down to the strength of the Premier League . Harry Kane celebrates his second goal against Queens Park Rangers in Spurs' win at Loftus Road last week . 'It's not an excuse but the reality. It's very difficult to arrive fresh in the same way another team from Europe arrives fresh in the Champions League or the Europa League.' Spurs, sixth in the Premier League with 10 to play, have won twice since they lost to Fiorentina and were beaten in the Capital One Cup final by Chelsea. Like any darts fan, Pochettino knows the way his team finish will be all-important. They are at fourth-placed Manchester United on Sunday and victory will boost their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.","Mauricio Pochettino has set up his home to watch football and darts .

"Manchester United are considering a summer move for Wolfsburg defender Ricardo Rodriguez, claims the player's agent. Rodriguez has been one of Wolfsburg's key players during an impressive campaign for the German club and has pitched in with six goals so far, including a stunning free-kick against Everton last September. The Swiss star's agent Gianluca di Domenico has now revealed that Wolfsburg will attempt to keep hold of their man despite rumoured interest from Louis van Gaal's side. Manchester United are considering a swoop for Ricardo Rodriguez, claims the player's agent . Rodriguez has been crucial to Wolfsburg's impressive Bundesliga and Europa League campaigns . He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'I can say that United have called for information, but that Wolfsburg do not want to give in. With Real there was nothing official.' The 22-year-old had been linked with United last summer before the Old Trafford side swooped for former Southampton youngster Luke Shaw. Shaw has made a steady start to his Red Devils career, but will no doubt be looking to nail down a first team place ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season.

"It may be home to rats and grime but a creative photographer has turned New York's subway system into his own fashion studio. Aaron Pegg, 29, who goes by his middle name Clifton, has captured beautiful models posing in one of the country's more unusual spots. From eating pizza to flashing Calvin Klein underwear, the girls make the bizarre backdrop their own by showing off the stunning clothes. A model strikes a pose between two trains on a platform of the New York subway . The red dress highlights the brightness of the corridor on this photo shoot . Clifton, who has more than 100,000 followers on his Instagram account 'underground-nyc', began taking the photographs in 2013. And since then the innovative photographer has amassed a huge following online with his arty shots - which include other mass transit systems such as Chicago. Scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan spent 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA. The boffins also found 15,152 different types of microorganisms sharing the trains with riders including the bubonic plague, dysentery and meningitis. However, New York's subway system, which carries 5.5 million passengers a week, continues to be a source of incredible artistry for Clifton. Wearing a dress, the sound of the underground is silent as many of the pictures were taken at the subway's quietest times . The New Yorker said: 'I was shooting the typical city stuff such as rooftop views, buildings, cabs and bridges until one day I almost got arrested for roof topping. 'It was too much of a close call and it was getting too cold to continue to get these views so I asked myself what can I shoot in any weather and have access to all the time? 'This led me to the subway but I couldn't just capture it on a typical day - it had to be different so I decided to capture the stations empty. The carriage awaits for his model who is showcasing the clothes on board one of the trains . 'Photography has always been a hobby and a way for me to creatively express myself but now it is turning into a business. 'I take magazine commissions and anything business related which there is a budget for.' Clifton admits he often gets unusual reactions from fellow subway riders who happen to walk in on his shoots. He added: 'I get everything from guys smiling and wanting to talk to the models to people shocked and not understanding what is going on.' Aaron Pegg, who goes by the name of Clifton, has even been snapping the models with food on the subway system .

"Chelsea are considering a renewed bid to sign Raphael Varane from Real Madrid this summer. Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer of the France international centre-back and is willing to test Real Madrid's resolve to hold onto the 21-year-old. Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea need a commanding centre-half like Raphael Varane . Varane is valued at £40million by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and was signed after being persuaded by Zinedine Zidane that Madrid was where his future lay. However, Varane has grown frustrated this year with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit. Manchester United are also keeping tabs on Varane after losing out to Real Madrid in 2011. Real Madrid have slapped a £40m price tag on French defender Varane . Age: 21 . Appearances: Lens 23/Goals 2; . Real Madrid 76 (20)/5; France 17/1 . Varane has been labelled Real Madrid's Lion and former France defender Frank Leboeuf believes he has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro . Varane signed a new six-year contract at the start of the season . The 21-year-old has grown frustrated with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit . Sir Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him from Lens and the Old Trafford club will challenge for his signature again should Madrid show a willingness to deal. Mourinho has concerns about the centre of his defence. Gary Cahill has sometimes looked uneasy against European opposition while John Terry is 34. Kurt Zouma has done well this season but is still inexperienced and Varane is already an assured performer at international level. Chelsea captain Terry will be given a new one year contract while Branislav Ivanovic, who is 31, has 16 months left on contract. The Blues also have Andreas Christensen and Tomas Kalas in reserve but both lack big game experience. Jose Mourinho has concerns over John Terry and Gary Cahill in the centre of his defence .

"A footballer caught on film allegedly punching a rival in the face has been charged by the Football Association. Morecambe youngster Sam Livesey, 18, was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple. Livesey, who was dismissed by the referee in Oldham Under 18's 7-2 win over their Lancashire rivals, could now face a lengthy ban after the FA intervened.

The Oldham youth player is knocked from his feet by the force of Sam Livesey's alleged punch . A red card for violent conduct would normally carry a three-match ban but officials believe such a punishment may be too lenient and have stepped in. A spokesman for the FA said: 'The charge is an allegation that Mr Livesey's behaviour in or around the 71st minute constitutes violent conduct in circumstances where the standard punishment that would otherwise apply following his dismissal is clearly insufficient.' It is understood that Livesey, on loan to Morecambe from Preston North End, has admitted the charge. His case will now be heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission. Livesey has now been charged with violent conduct by the FA and is understood to have admitted the charge .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released a video claiming to show the execution of two Libyan soldiers. Footage shows three balaclava-clad gunmen standing behind the prisoners who are believed to have been captured in battles for the terror group's Libyan stronghold of Derna. The soldiers - one of whom was reportedly a colonel - are then shot in the back of the head by the jihadists, understood to belong to the ISIS-affiliate Ansar Al Sharia.

Fate sealed: Images purporting to show the two men. They were reportedly accused of fighting for General Khalifa Hifter, who has been leading an offensive against Islamic militias for the Libyan government . The shootings are the latest in a disturbing rise of executions in Libya in the wake of the terror group's advance across the North African coast. It has now gained control of a number of Libyan coastal towns including Benghazi, Sirte, Derna and Nofilia. Last month, the jihadists filmed the bloody executions of 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya as it seeks to take a stranglehold on the region. ISIS also claimed responsibility for a series of suicide bombings that killed at least 45 people in the town of Qubba, around 20 miles from Derna, nearly three weeks ago. The extremist organisation's deadly grip now stretches across the Middle East and into northern-Africa where today, only the Mediterranean Sea separates the militants from Europe.

The tyrannical expansion is part of its 'global strategy' to seize destablised countries to 'engage in all-out battle against the West,' the Institute for the Study of War told MailOnline last month. Counter-terrorism analyst Harleen Gambhir said: 'What we've started to see is ISIS has begun to accelerate its operation to activate these sleeper groups that its reaching out to and it's having international effects.'","'Soldiers - one thought to be a colonel - shot in the head by jihadi gunmen'

"Manuel Pellegrini has told James Milner to meet Manchester City halfway as their contract negotiations continue to drag on. The England midfielder, who joined the club from Aston Villa for £26million in 2010, is stalling over a new deal with the Premier League champions and his future at the Etihad appears to be increasingly uncertain. Milner, 29, is reluctant to commit to what could be the last big contract of his career while he still has concerns over his first-team opportunities at City. He will be a free agent in the summer and has been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool, as well as a number of clubs in Italy and Spain. James Milner is a versatile and popular member of City's squad but talks of a new deal have hit the rocks . Pellegrini had been hopeful that Milner’s situation would be resolved by now but seemed less optimistic when asked about it on Friday. The City boss indicated that the ball is in Milner’s court and the club are unlikely to improve their offer. ‘I don’t have any news about James Milner,’ he said. ‘To decide to sign a contract you need both parties to agree it. We will see what happens from now until the end of the season. Manuel Pellegrini has asked Milner to meet the club in the middle after the factions have reached an impasse . ‘Maybe City have already offered all that the club can offer. Maybe it’s not about more money, maybe there are different things to sign a new contract. ‘You must ask James what is happening with him.

"Dick Advocaat’s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season. The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats –  one point above the drop zone – avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level.

"The return of midfielder Koke could be crucial to Atletico Madrid's hopes of overturning a 1-0 deficit to Bayer Leverkusen in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg, coach Diego Simeone said on Monday. A Spain international and one of Atletico's most creative influences, Koke missed last month's first leg defeat in Germany due to injury but has featured in Atletico's last three outings in La Liga. The 23-year-old, who scored in this month's 1-1 draw at home to Valencia, is also a dead ball specialist and the Spanish champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks. Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone and Mario Suarez attend a press conference on the eve of the tie . Simeone believes Koke returning will be a boost for his team as they try to overturn a first-leg deficit . 'He is one of those all-round midfielders who is gifted at reading the game, he knows how to play in different positions in the centre and he has very good peripheral vision,' Simeone told a news conference. 'When he is on top form, he allows us to play with speed. Not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way.' Atletico, last season's beaten finalists, have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions.

'We need to shake off their pressuring quickly when they are trying to win back the ball,' Simeone said. 'They know very well how to disrupt play and hold you up,' added the former Argentina captain. 'That's what happened in Germany. They stopped our attacks quickly with fouls and we couldn't develop our vertical game. If we don't take the ball forward quickly we will have problems.'

'A couple of us went over there and were like, can you guys just stop, that's not right,' Rodriguez told TMJ4. 'Our teammates supported us and they had our backs,' said Terrien. The incident sparked the begining of a beautiful friendship between Desiree and the boys. From then on Desiree – who they call affectionately Dee – got involved in the introduction of the starting lineup for the team. They would also walk her to class and the gym was renamed 'D's House' in her honor. 'We're all created the same. God made us the same way,' said Terrien.

"Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of a football coach kicking a seven-year-old boy in the air during a training session. Valentin Pavlov claimed he was teaching Eugene Efimov how to kick the ball properly after the lad failed to show enough commitment in a tackle. He then ordered the frightened child to get back into the game. In the video, Valentin Pavol can be seen calling the seven-year-old player over to the sideline during training . He then kicks out at him in what he later claimed was an attempt to teach him how to use his feet more 'robustly' Eugene Efimov is sent flying into the air by the forceful kick which has outraged Russia . He twists in the air before landing on his back as another child, far right, watches on in horror . The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous' The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was. The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'. 'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle. 'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence. 'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.' Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children. While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since. But after the video went viral, the youngster's mother Alyona Efimova, 35, was tracked down and she refused to criticise the coach. Left, Valentin Pavlov, the coach who denies kicking Eugene Efimov (right) with the intent of hurting him . She said: 'I was at the match and watching the game, and it was just part of the game. The video doesn't show anything really special, my son has been training for football with this coach for three years and we haven't had any problems up until now, and I still don't see a problem.' The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly. Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.' While the footage has caused outrage in Russia, without a complaint, the Investigative Committee may not take further action. After the boy got back to his feet, Mr Pavlov then appeared to order him back into the game .","Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of coach and player .

"Arsene Wenger was delighted as Danny Welbeck struck a second-half winner to put Arsenal in the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a 2-1 victory over his former club Manchester United, who were reduced to 10 men at Old Trafford. The Gunners took the lead midway through the first half as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain weaved his way through the United defence before teeing up Nacho Monreal to coolly slot his close-range shot past a diving David de Gea and into the bottom corner. It did not take long for the hosts to level matters and Wayne Rooney did the damage as he directed Angel di Maria's beautiful cross into the back of the net via a well-timed header.

But Welbeck handed Arsenal the lead for the second time as he beat De Gea to the ball just outside the 18-yard box and tapped into an empty net just after the hour mark. Wenger admitted he was proud of how his side executed their game plan, and told BBC 1: '(We wanted) to start without apprehension but we were caught a few times here. '(We tried) to be on the front foot from the start and close them down, play with a high pace and I felt that we did that well.' Di Maria received two bookings in quick succession as he was first shown a yellow card for diving and then was sent off after grabbing at referee Michael Oliver's shoulder in protest with just under 15 minutes left. Arsenal were drawn against Bradford or Reading in the last four and Wenger added: 'Last year we played a tricky game at Wembley in the semi-final and you expect that again. Per Mertesacker (centre) and Aaron Ramsey jump for joy after reaching the FA Cup semi-finals . Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny applauds Arsenal's 9,000 travelling supporters at Old Trafford . 'We have played Bradford before, we know about that but let's enjoy tonight. 'I feel we played a good game tonight from the start and we deserved to win the game.' Wenger was full of praise for Welbeck, who left his boyhood club for north London last summer, and provided the killer touch tonight after a blunder from Antonio Valencia. The manager said: 'I believe he is just happy to score. He worked very hard today and he was rewarded by a good goal.' The Gunners went to Old Trafford on the back of a fine run in the Barclays Premier League, with seven wins in the last eight games putting them third, now a point ahead of United and only four behind Manchester City. Danny Welbeck slots home the winning goal after rounding his former team-mate David de Gea . Welbeck didn't hold back in his celebrations after scoring against his old club for the first time . But they are battling to stay in the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg loss at home to Monaco two weeks ago which they need to turn around a week on Tuesday. Wenger continued: 'We live in the real world and we play game by game, we want to compete in every competition and I believe the result today can give us some good morale.' Welbeck appealed for a penalty as he went to ground after a touch from Marcos Rojo just inside the 18-yard box during the first half, but Oliver waved play on. Wenger said he thought it was a spot-kick, but admitted he was pleased with his side's performance despite not winning that appeal. The Frenchman added: 'We had (a shout for a penalty). I think what is the most important when you're a manager is that the team performs at a good level - and that's what we did.'","Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup quarter-finals .

"All work and no play is sure to make Prince Harry a dull boy when he solely focuses on his army duties during his trip to Australia next month. In stark contrast to when the fourth in line to the British throne made his way Down Under the previous two times, his trip next month will revolve around training with Australian troops in army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth. When the party boy Prince visited just two years ago, he relished in witnessing first-hand England's win over South Africa in the Rugby World Cup match  in Perth, and also joined in the festivities of the International Fleet Review's centenary celebrations on Sydney Harbour. While on his first Australian visit a decade earlier during his gap year when the prince was just a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had the opportunity to cuddle up to the country's indigenous wildlife at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. But this time around, in what is believed to be a four-week assignment, the more mature and responsible 30-year-old, who is known in the British Army as Captain Harry Wales, will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force. This comes as Prince Harry has announced he will quit the Armed Forces in June after his 10-year-military career. Scroll down for video .

On his first visit, ten years earlier the prince had the time to cuddle up to koalas at Taronga Zoo in Sydney . Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the attachment will provide Captain Wales with an opportunity to gain greater insight into the Australian Army's domestic operating environment and capabilities. 'We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,' he said. 'While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the British and Australian armies have a shared military history with secondments, exchanges, bilateral training and professional development all part of a routine practice between the two armed forces. But this time around, known in the British Army as Captain Harry Wales, he will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force .

Prince Harry's assignment with the Australian Army is an extension of his regular British Army duties where he is currently working alongside case officers in the Personal Recovery Unit. 'It will build on his previous experience with coalition forces along with his advocacy work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' Air Chief Marshal Binksin said. 'It is also an opportunity for Australian Army personnel to learn from their British counterpart and I know our Diggers will welcome Captain Wales into the ranks when he arrives in Australia next month.' He will take a short break to attend the Gallipoli Commemorations in Turkey on April 24 and 25 with his father, Prince Charles. In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government. After he quits the Armed Forces in June, he will travel onto Africa where he will spend most of the summer undertaking 'field-based conservation work'. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will visit army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth . Known for his sense of humour, Prince Harry pulls a funny face to a child in Sydney during his last visit in 2013 .

In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government . The prince will spend the European summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa, after which he will undertake voluntary work with injured servicemen while 'actively considering other longer term employment opportunities'. In a statement Harry, 30, who has served in the military for ten years and seen two tours of duty in Afghanistan, admitted that it had been a 'tough decision' to leave the job he loved. Harry said today that he was 'really excited' about his future, adding: 'So while I am finishing off one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it. ' But sources close to the prince said he had reached a 'natural crossroads' in his career and, after much soul-searching, had decided he had no desire to 'progress through the ranks'. 'The Prince has had a fulfilling military career and considers it a huge honour to have served his country in the Armed Forces, during which time he has undertaken two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan, qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander and spearheaded the Invictus Games,' a Kensington Palace spokesman said: . Prince Harry will spend the summer doing voluntary work with injured servicemen, following his success in setting up the inaugural Invictus Games . A spokesman said: 'Prince Harry will spend a period of summer carrying out a programme of voluntary work alongside field-based conservation experts in Africa. He will focus his time learning how local communities in sub-Saharan Africa are working to protect and conserve their natural resources and wildlife.' In September, Harry will return to the UK to work with the Ministry of Defence in a voluntary capacity with its Recovery Capability Programme. This will build on his work on the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style event for injured service personnel, which he helped bring to the UK last year. Kensington Palace said: 'In Autumn, Prince Harry will return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, while actively considering other longer term employment opportunities. 'Prince Harry will continue to support Case Officers at London District's Personal Recovery Unit, working with both those who are administering and receiving physical and mental care within the London District area. This will enable him to continue developing his knowledge of the entire recovery process, placing him in an informed position to further support wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women into the future. ' The fourth in line to the throne will spend the summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa . During his first gap year after leaving school in 2003, the Prince worked with orphans in Lesotho, inspiring him to later set up the charity Sentebale - he is pictured here during a trip to the charity in 2014 . Kensington Palace also stressed that Harry will continue to support the work of the Queen and the Royal Family. In his statement Harry himself said: 'After a decade of service, moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process. 'From learning the hard way to stay onside with my Colour Sergeant at Sandhurst, to the incredible people I served with during two tours in Afghanistan - the experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life. For that I will always be hugely grateful. 'Inevitably most good things come to an end and I am at a crossroads in my military career. Luckily for me, I will continue to wear the uniform and mix with fellow servicemen and women for the rest of my life, helping where I can, and making sure the next few Invictus Games are as amazing as the last. 'I am considering the options for the future and I am really excited about the possibilities. Spending time with the Australian Defence Force will be incredible and I know I will learn a lot. I am also looking forward to coming back to London this summer to continue working at the Personal Recovery Unit.

"Talk about causing a stink. A 'mystery pooper' has reportedly soiled a New Zealand swimming pool for five Friday nights in a row. The frustrated administrators of Invercargill's Splash Palace complex have lost thousands of dollars of business cleaning up after a patron's foul play, stuff.co.nz reported. One evening was particularly disastrous, with managers having to close three different pools as those responsible leap-frogged from one pool to another. Splash Palace, pictured, describes itself as one of New Zealand's premier pools. Unfortunately, a so-called 'mystery pooper' has reportedly soiled the waters five times, requiring six hours of cleaning . Manager Pete Thompson told Fairfax: 'They did one in the leisure pool and we moved the kids to the learners' pool, and they did one in the learners' pool and we moved the kids to the main pool, and one appeared in the main pool, so we had to shut the whole thing down. 'In one of those pools was diarrhoea ... that was unfortunate.' Mr Thompson said the incidents occurred after 5pm on Friday evenings. It is unclear whether one person or more is behind the incident, with a local councillor quoted saying: 'We have a mystery pooper'. It won't help Invercargill's sometimes battered reputation. According to local folklore, a member of the Rolling Stones once dubbed the city the 'a***hole of the world'.

'But I just went out on the pitch and it’s good very good. And the second problem was when it rains in south of France, it really rains.

"The fattest man in China has lost 13 stone so far in a battle to bring his weight under control. Liang Yong, 26, was last seen being transported on a steel reinforced trolley to carry his huge weight as he could not fit in an ambulance. The 26-year-old, who officially weighed in at more than 35 stone, went on a diet after he set the unwelcome record five years ago, The People's Daily reports.

"Convicted boyfriend killer Jodi Arias is spending several hours a day video-chatting to fans from her prison cell. The murderer, who narrowly escaped the death penalty for the brutal slaying of Travis Alexander in 2008, is said to be the most popular inmate getting video calls - many from girls as young as 15. Photos have surfaced showing Arias pulling faces and showing off a Hershey's from the confines of the cell where she spends 23-hours-a-day. Scroll down for video . All smiles: 'Fans' take snaps of murderer Arias as she shows off a Hershey's bar and smiles to the camera during video chats from prison cell . Last Saturday alone, Arias took 27 video calls in jail with pictures from some of those calls having leaked. With each call lasting up to 20 minutes, it means Arias spent up to nine hours that day Skyping with followers and fans from a laptop. Poser: The 34-year-old killer was snapped by admirers who have been skyping with Arias in her prison cell following her conviction for murder . Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. Sheriff Joe Arpaio revealed Arias used the jails video system to tell two 15-year-old admirers they should use fake ID's so they could keep talking with her on the jail video call system. 'The mother told the girls to stop, and evidently the girls got back on and Arias advised them to get some phony ID's so they could get back on there because you have to be 18-years-old,' he said. Other admirers who have been taking photos of the conversation have also been banned with 10 now having been stopped form communicating with the prisoner. Victim: Arias was found guilty of killing her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, left, and narrowly avoiding the death sentence . All smiles: Convicted killer Arias is said to be the most popular inmate for video calls receiving dozens in just one day . But, despite calls for her to have the privilege withdrawn, Arias is still able to make and receive video phone calls. Mr Arpaio says any discipline in the jail has to go through a committee, and that process takes a few days. Only after that is complete could Arias lose the right to make calls. 'It takes a few days to justify why we have taken action on any violation of our policy, I want to make sure we follow the proper procedures, she's not going to like this,' said Arpaio. Murdered: Victim Travis Alexander (right) was brutally murdered by lover Arias (left) in 2008 . The 20 minute phone calls cost £3.30 or $5 each, and anybody can request a conversation but Arias has to accept the calls. Earlier this month, Arias was sentenced to life behind bars after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'. The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty. Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April.","Arias took 27 video calls in just ONE day from her jail cell .

"US rapper Jay-Z has agreed to pay half the royalties of one of his songs to a Swiss jazz musician Bruno Spoerri after using his music without consent. The rapper had denied copying instrumental 'Lilith — on the way'  in his 2013 song 'Versus'. But he has now agreed to pay 50 per cent of the royalties to the Swiss pianist and saxophonist, following an 18-month legal wrangle. Scroll down for video . Settled: US rapper Jay-Z, pictured here with wife Beyoncé, has agreed to pay Swiss musician half of royalties from a song in which he lifted an instrumental . Royalties: Swiss jazz musician Bruno Spoerri has been awarded 50 per cent of royalties from Jay-Zs song 'Versus' after rapper admitted using music without permission . It comes just days after Marvin Gaye's family were awarded $7.4 million after a jury decided that the Robin Thicke song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off Gaye's 1977 hit 'Got to Give It Up'. The song made a staggering $16million for producer Pharrell Williams, Thicke and rapper T.I. with the family being awarded $4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song. An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favour of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. In this case, the lifted melody came from a song composed by Spoerri in 1978, with the musician rejecting an initial offer as 'too low'. Out of pocket: Musician Jay-Z, pictured here at the opening of a club,  has agreed to pay Swiss musician half of royalties from one of his songs . The American musician and record producer only admitted using the music without attribution a few months ago, according to reports. Speaking last year, the veteran jazz musician said legal proceedings could have been avoided with a phone call. 'In a way I'm flattered that a relatively young rapper takes a sample from an old man, a sample that is about 35 years old,' he told swissinfo.ch. 'On the other hand I'm furious because it would have been so simple to clear the sample. All it would have needed was a call or an email to the company and I think it would have been relatively cheap.' Mr Spoerri, 79, has worked with the likes of Lee Konitz, Hans Kennel and George Gruntz in a career spanning nearly 50 years. In an illustrious career, he has directed the Zurich jazz festival and music schools in Zurich and Lucerne.","Rapper initially denied copying melody from Bruno Spoerri's 1978 tune .

"Mikey Knight ordered 16 tickets for him and friends to watch Norwich City, but his mother accidentally roasted the tickets - worth around £500 in total . When Mikey Knight ordered 16 tickets  to an upcoming football match for him and his friends, he thought the safest place to get them delivered was his parents' house. But when the 28-year-old went to the house in Taverham, Norfolk, his mother Cherry had to make a confession - she had roasted them. Mrs Knights had accidentally cooked the tickets, worth £500,  for 40 minutes after they got stuck to the underside of a roast in the bag chicken. The football fan initially didn't believe his mother until she handed him an envelope containing the charred remains of 16 tickets to Good Friday's  Championship match between Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion, which were unreadable. He said: 'I turned up for tea and my mum asked me if I was in a good mood. I said ""yes."" 'It was then she told me she'd roasted the tickets. 'She'd put them on the side in the kitchen ready to give to me, but when she put the bird down as she got it out the fridge the sticky bit of the envelope had opened and got stuck to it. 'She said after about 40 minutes of it cooking she couldn't find the tickets and realised what she'd done. 'I thought it was a wind-up at first, but then I opened the envelope and the 16 tickets were inside, all black. 'She told me she would sort it though. I could see the funny side but I was really worried we wouldn't be able to make it to the match.' Mrs Knights, 62, of Norwich, went to Norwich City's grounds and explained the situation to a member of staff who then emailed Brighton and Hove Albion. The club agreed to reprint tickets for Mr Knights and his friends as a 'goodwill gesture'. Mr Knights added: 'I've already got my train tickets, but it's a good job those didn't go to my mum's address. She might have put them in for afters. Mr Knights initially thought his mother was joking until she handed him the charred remains of the tickets . 'I'm going to have to collect the match tickets when I get down there. 'I'll probably have to skip the pub with my friends to go and get them, but I'm just glad we get to go and I'm really grateful. 'There wouldn't usually be this many tickets to cook, but as the match is on Good Friday more people wanted to come along. It would be awful to have let them all down.'

Newey believes engine suppliers Renault are letting Red Bull down. ‘It’s frustrating that we’ve got an engine which is a long way behind with no obvious light at the end of the tunnel and all sorts of failings,’ he said before Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. ‘We keep trying to offer to get involved. It’s one thing where you’re not competitive but you can see your way out of it. It’s another when you’re not competitive and your partner doesn’t seem to be willing to deal with you.’ Problems persisted into this weekend. Daniel Ricciardo’s car required a new engine - one of four allowed for the 20-round season. He qualified seventh and his team-mate Daniil Kvyat 13th for a race due to start without Manor, the team that is trying to re-form itself from the ashes of Marussia. Mercedes took pole with Lewis Hamilton. Newey, 56, can take his mind off the track with Ainslie’s venture, where he will work with former McLaren colleague Martin Whitmarsh, who was last week named chief executive of the America’s Cup team.

"Formula One breathed a sigh of relief in the sunny early Saturday morning at Melbourne when Sauber's former Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde abandoned his legal action against the team. He had been suing them for dropping him despite having a contract to race for them this season, starting with Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. Courts in Melbourne found in his favour, saying he had a right to drive. However, he has not got a super-licence, so could not. Giedo van der Garde has decided to drop his case against former side Sauber after settling out of court . Marcus Ericsson (left) and Felipe Nasr (right) will race for Sauber in the absence of Van der Garde . This brought about an impasse: Sauber would be in contempt of court if they left him out. But they could not put him in according to the FIA rules. Heads we knocked together over Friday night and Van der Garde settled out of court. Van der Garde wrote on Facebook: 'With respect to the interest of motorsport, and F1 in particular, I have decided to give up my legal rights to race this weekend at the Melbourne Grand Prix. 'As I am a passionate race driver this decision has been very difficult for me. 'However I also wish to respect the interest of the FIA, Sauber Motorsport, as well as Nasr and Ericsson.' Crucially, Van der Garde has made clear further negotiations need to take place, however, before the matter can finally be closed. The 29-year-old added: 'My management will continue talks with Sauber early next week to find a mutually acceptable solution for the current situation that has now arisen. 'I am confident such solution will be found and I will inform the media once done.' Van der Garde dropped the case against Sauber out of respect to 'motorsport, and F1 in particular' Marcus Ericssson and Felipe Nasr will race for them in his place. Both were named on Sauber's race entry and took part in second practice on Friday, having sat out of the first session while the lawyers argued. With three valid driver contracts and only two race seats available, Sauber and Kaltenborn had found themselves mired in controversy. Given Sauber's financial struggles last year, when approached by two drivers in Ericsson and Nasr who could offer considerable sums of money in sponsorship, both the Swede and Brazilian were signed. But with Van der Garde on contract, and despite also having paid up front - albeit a figure less than that of Ericsson and Nasr - the battle became legal. It remains to be seen what 'mutually acceptable solution' can now be ironed out between the two parties. Whatever the outcome, under-pressure team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, a trained lawyer, has emerged from the sorry mess in a poor light. Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn insists she will not resign from her role despite the recent saga . At the circuit on Friday, while unable to talk about the case as it remained ongoing, she did insist however she remained competent to carry on with her role as team boss. 'I don't see it (the case) having any effect,' Kaltenborn said. 'We have a very clear view of what we did. We took action after thinking about it for a while. 'For us that was very clear, but the outcome is different.' Pressed on whether she had considered resigning, Kaltenborn added: 'I've not considered that. 'This whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work, the way the team works.' Kaltenborn did concede, however, the past week had damaged morale given the team's name had been dragged through the courts. 'It's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was, for a while, unclear,' she added. 'We now have certain actions taken against the team, and we are acting accordingly.'","Giedo van der Garde was planning to sue former side Sauber .

"Joy for pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton but ignominy for Jenson Button and history-making of the wrong sort for McLaren. Both their cars, Button in one, Kevin Magnussen in the other, will be on the back row of the grid for the Australian Grand Prix. Their participation ended with the doom-laden radio transmission to Button, a three-time winner here at Albert Park: ‘We have leapfrogged Magnussen, but unfortunately we are one-tenth short of Ericsson (of Sauber) and out.’ In the McLaren garage, chairman Ron Dennis watched on, wearing headphones, his neck extended, his face impassive.

McLaren were six seconds off Mercedes, who took pole through a lightning quick Hamilton, virtually six-tenths – a.k.a. an age – ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg. Felipe Massa, of Williams, was third. It has been estimated that McLaren could be 250 brake horsepower (the equivalent of the Honda Civic Type R) short of the Mercedes. So much for McLaren's new partnership with Honda. So much for the rebuilding that was promised when Dennis sacked Martin Whitmarsh as team principal to take on the chief executive’s role himself. Dennis has inched ever more involved in the team, having originally promised to detach himself and leave the day-to-day management to Eric Boullier, the sporting director. The formula is not working even at their annual outlay of a mighty £200million. Jenson Button will start Sunday's Australian Grand Prix from 17th after a miserable qualifying session . Button leaves the pit-lane with his McLaren team well off the pace at the first race of the season . McLaren will start from the very back of the pack; they were some six seconds slower than the Mercedes . Re-live every moment of an incident-packed qualifying session in Melbourne . You have to wonder whether Fernando Alonso, who is missing this race after being concussed in a testing accident last month, will want to return for Malaysia a fortnight hence. A sick note from the doctor might suit him nicely. Until, let’s say, Monza. By that race in September, Mercedes may nearly, or actually, have wrapped up the constructors’ title. Their dominance is so immense that Hamilton was 1.4sec ahead of Massa’s Williams. Hamilton, securing his fourth pole on the track where he made his debut eight years ago, said: ‘It has been a great start to the weekend. It does not feel like a long time since the last race. 'It has been a huge effort by the guys back at the factory so I feel incredibly blessed. It is so much fun in qualifying and I am massively grateful for all the hard work of the team.' Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, on his Ferrari debut, qualified fourth in Melbourne . Nico Hulkenberg, in his Force India, takes a trip across the gravel. He will start 14th tomorrow . Hamilton ran wide on his very first lap of the afternoon, but recovered to secure pole in Melbourne . Hamilton, who started on pole  here in Melbourne in 2014, but retired with an engine problem, added: 'We had a difficult start to the season last year, so we a really hoping for a better start for both cars to succeed tomorrow. We are going to work as hard as we can, and it will be a good fight with Nico.' Rosberg had to abort his first flying lap after running wide, but recovered to complete a Mercedes front-row lockout. He said: 'The story was Lewis was in impressive form and he did an awesome job. 'For me, the speed was there but I did not get it together. I am realy thankfulf for the team and the car they have given me. P2, I will live with for now, but it is a long day tomorrow.' Of the dominant Mercedes pair, third-placed Massa said: 'They are in a different category'. An ariel view of the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne which plays hosts to the season-opening race . Massa finished third in qualifying and claimed Mercedes are 'in a different category' McLaren would not have been at the very back had Manor not sat qualifying out. The team will not race either. Their supposed rebirth from the ashes of Marussia is danger of turning into a bad joke. Button, however, believes this year's McLaren is essentially good, saying: ‘I was always thinking long term when I re-signed. I really do think that in the end we can challenge Mercedes at the front. This a new package, not just in terms of the engine but the philosophy behind it, the aerodynamics and airflow. ‘I’d rather not be at the back of the grid, but I am not sitting here downbeat. It is a tough time now and there will be tough times for many weeks, but it will make us stronger. ‘We have not done a race distance yet. So if we finish the race tomorrow it may not sound much, but it will help a lot.’ Max Verstappen, the youngest qualifier in Formula One history at 17 years and 165 days, qualified 12th. He had ‘a big moment’ squirming wide at turn five and that left him four places behind Toro Rosso team-mate Carlos Sainz Jnr. Red Bull were disappointingly slow, with Daniil Kvyat only 13th and Daniel Ricciardo seventh.

"The legends whom Lewis Hamilton would emulate met in the paddock for a brief chat — the tartan hat of Sir Jackie Stewart peak to peak with the equally trademark red cap of Niki Lauda. The decades have not dimmed a bond begotten by each man’s achievement in winning the Formula One world drivers’ title three times. Only seven others could ever make that claim: Fangio, Brabham, Piquet, Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Vettel. Here in sunlit Melbourne, Hamilton began practice for the Australian Grand Prix at the start of a 20-round season in which the British driver hopes to add his name to that exclusive club. Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to retain the Formula One title after last season's triumph . Hamilton took part in Friday's Formula One Grand Prix practice session ahead of Sunday's season opener . Michael Schumacher, pictured in 2006, is the most successful Formula One driver with seven world titles . The first race of the 2015 Formula One schedule begins in Melbourne, Australia on Sunday . Drivers’ champion . Lewis Hamilton. A great driver in a great car. His one and only threat is Nico Rosberg, poised and calculating coolly for any mistake. Constructors’ champion . Put your weekly shopping budget, your mortgage and Johnny’s school fees on Mercedes. Surprise driver . Toro Rosso’s Max Verstappen, 17 and 166 days tomorrow. A brilliant talent. My second choice: Daniil Kvyat of Red Bull. The race I am most looking forward to? The saying in F1 is those that start with ‘M’ are the best to be at: Melbourne (my absolute favourite), Monte Carlo, Montreal and Monza. Mexico returns this year. Hamilton pondered the word ‘legend’ and said: ‘I hope when I have retired and am much, much older, perhaps in 30 years, a kid might use that phrase for me. ‘I want to win this year. There’s a championship there for the taking. Damn it, I want to win it! I want to go and grab it. More than ever. At least as much as last year, and hopefully even more.’ He will certainly have a car capable of accomplishing that task. Mercedes are in a parallel universe of speed and reliability, according to pre-season testing. It again promises to be a straight fight between him and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lauda is their boss at Mercedes. Stewart has been a critic of Hamilton from time to time. He thinks the word ‘legend’ can only be applied long after a driver has hung up his helmet. ‘That is how it works with many halls of fame in America,’ he said. ‘Time waits to confer its judgment.’ The debate about Hamilton is always keen. He fuels this by his actions. He has taken to posting pictures of himself brooding and pouting, half-dressed and self-absorbed on the photo-based website Instagram. One such picture had Hamilton standing in a graffiti-lined alley in Melbourne looking up to the sky with his hands clasped in prayer. These fine exhibits of modern art are being undertaken by Dan ‘Spinz’ Forrest, a bald and bearded music producer who seems newly to have attached himself to Hamilton. He is walking around the paddock with a camera in his hand. Never mind that, it is Hamilton’s heavy and skilled right foot that will define him over the next eight-and-a-half months. But his compatriot Jenson Button believes there is still room for Hamilton to improve on his championship-winning form of last season. Hamilton celebrated in Abu Dhabi after winning the 2014 Formula One Championship . Mercedes F1 team showed their support for Red Nose Day by wearing merchandise on Friday . Mercedes' drivers Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg both also wore T-shirts in support of Red Nose Day . ‘He was most inconsistent last year,’ said Button, whose McLaren was three seconds slower than Mercedes in practice. ‘In racing, Lewis was stronger than ever. In qualifying, he seemed weaker than ever. It was a different Lewis. This year, with more confidence, he’ll be more consistent in qualifying and a stronger driver.’ Rosberg’s qualities should not be enough to stop an on-form, all-firing Hamilton becoming the first Briton to win consecutive titles, but the German is calm and focused on his retaliative challenge. ‘Lewis was a little bit stronger than me last year,’ admitted Rosberg, who is due to become a father in August. ‘He’s been working on himself during the winter and I have been working on myself. ‘I’m not at my peak Formula One performance yet. Being an F1 driver is multi-faceted. It’s not just about turning the steering wheel in the best possible way. It’s outside the car, too, having your whole life around you sorted so you are focused and have the energy to do the perfect job in the car. Coming second has motivated me for this year.’ Hamilton wants to remembered as a 'legend' after he has retired from Formula One . The 30-year-old takes time out in the garage during the first practice session of the new season . Sauber's former Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde has abandoned his legal action against the team . The season starts with Formula One in a curious, but entirely new, state of disrepair. Manor, the team that rose from the bones of Marussia, look unlikely to race because, among other things, they do not have the software required to run their cars. It seems the hard drives were wiped to prepare them to be auctioned when the team’s assets were due to be sold and they now need to reinstall the missing programs. But the biggest drama was at Sauber, where Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde is suing the team for breaking his contract. A court in Melbourne has ruled in his favour, saying he should race. However, he cannot do so because he has not been granted a super-licence. He still put on overalls yesterday and was fitted for his seat, unavailingly. Sauber sat out the first practice session but took part in the second in the form of their two named drivers Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. The squabbling parties called a truce of sorts this morning Melbourne time, with Van der Garde abandoning his legal action and averting, for now at least, the threat of bailiffs seizing the team’s assets. DAVID COULTHARD . ‘Lewis appears to be going through a transition in his off-track life. I see he is negotiating his own contract, doing music in the future and has split up with Nicole (Scherzinger), and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative. 'It will be interesting to see now he is a wealthy champion and got lots of opportunities whether the absolute focus is still on the job. Nico now has the experience of battling for a world championship. He went into last year with a good car, everything was going great, then he had the collision in Spa, his team told him he was a bad boy and he was getting booed. I think he will be stronger.’ DAMON HILL . ‘Nico has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than Lewis but I think he is going to have to invent a new Nico to counter his team-mate. The championship was delivered by Lewis, so if Mercedes have to hedge one way or the other, they will go for Lewis. 'I can’t see Lewis getting distracted. He can see the prizes, he collects his trophies and is very proud of his success and he still talks as if he is stunned by his own success. He will be difficult to beat this year.’ MARTIN BRUNDLE . ‘If Lewis had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty but if he wins a third he becomes one of the all-time greats. 'He has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult, but he is going to have a dominant car again so it is Nico Rosberg who he has got to race. Unless Nico has found a way to raise his game, what is going to put Lewis under pressure apart from himself?’ JOHNNY HERBERT . ‘I don’t think it’s a given for Lewis. He can’t say “I beat him last year and it’s going to be fine, I will be able to do those runs of winning four races on the trot again and everything will be hunky dory” — It won’t be like that. Lewis will think, “Yes, I’m quicker”. Is Rosberg capable of doing it? I think he is, that’s why I say Lewis cannot rest on his laurels because he will be there for sure.’","Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to win his third Formula One title .

"It all started as an innocent attempt to find clams, but left a small fox in a tense standoff with a 500lb brown bear. As the two animals faced one another on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in southern Alaska, it seemed there would only be one inevitable ending. But miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear, the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the Alaskan brown bear just wanted someone to play with. A red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear . But it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate, and the fox and bear played a game of chase . American photographer Nate Zeman was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size. The 32-year-old, of Breckenridge, Colorado, said: 'The bear appeared from the forest, located about a mile away, and began to make a beeline straight towards us. 'The bear walked straight past me at a very close distance and kept going towards the fox, and began to chase it. 'The fox, however, easily outmanoeuvred the bear as it was chased in circles a couple of times, and when they stopped they both squared off about thirty feet apart.' The agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive, not running at full speed . And despite the tense stand-off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play. The pair were seen running in circles, neither at full speed, with the agile fox deftly managing to stay out of harm's way. 'Most likely the bear just wanted to chase the fox, and it's as simple as that,' added Mr Zeman. 'It wasn't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill, it just really seemed to want a chase! The fox had been calmly searching for clams on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in Alaska . But the red fox's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it . The 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming . Both animals faced eachother, and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox . 'Soon after I took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming, the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away.' The Alaskan brown bear is the name of any member of the grizzly bear family that lives in the coastal regions of southern Alaska. They are the second largest type of brown bear in the world, only after the giant bears of Kodiak Island. As the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began . The fox managed to dodge the bear and both were seen running in circles across the Alaskan salt flats . Photographer Nate Zeman said neither animal was aggressive and both seemed to be playing a game .","Nate Zeman was photographing a red fox searching for claims in Alaska .

The Qatar team will be based at St George's Park and are expected to play a friendly against Northern Ireland at a venue in the Midlands on May 31 and possibly other internationals too. The move comes despite FA chairman Greg Dyke's unflattering comments about Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup.

"Bayern Munich legend Franz Beckenbauer has raised concerns over the poor discipline of Franck Ribery and Jerome Boateng. Winger Ribery was criticised recently by Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola for his tendency to react angrily to on-field provocations, and Beckenbauer is worried that a failure to control his temper could end up costing his team. He is also worried that a similar risk exists with midfielder Boateng. 'Ribery is often dealt with pretty roughly.

"Arsene Wenger has urged Arsenal to rid themselves of Europe’s gallant loser tag by grasping their Champions League second chance on Tuesday night. The Gunners head into their second leg in Monaco trailing 3-1 following an abject display at the Emirates Stadium. In each of the past four seasons, Arsenal have narrowly crashed out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal were in fine form to beat West Ham on Saturday and will need to carry that momentum forward . The Gunners will need to overturn a two-goal deficit against a team who rarely concede . Last season they secured a credible 1-1 draw in Bayern Munich after losing the first leg; in 2013 Arsenal won 2-0 in the Allianz Arena only to crash out 3-2 on aggregate after a crushing first leg loss. Three years ago, having lost 4-0 to AC Milan in the first leg, Wenger’s side staged a brilliant comeback only to fall short in a 3-0 second leg win. And in 2011, Arsenal again missed out by a solitary goal, crashing out 4-3 on aggregate to Barcelona despite winning the first leg 2-1 at the Emirates. And now Arsenal must perform yet another European comeback in Monaco with Wenger desperate for his side to finish the job this time. Arsene Wenger says his team have an opportunity to right the wrongs of last month's defeat to Monaco . Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud cut a dejected figure while Arsenal were being beaten at home by Monaco . ‘That’s not what you want (to be called gallant losers), you want to qualify,’ said Wenger. ‘We have got it wrong in the first game. What you want in life is the chance to put it right. We have the opportunity to put it right and after, no matter what, we will be ready to give everything to do it. ‘We are in a position where Monaco are favourites. We can go there and create something special. I believe we will have the desire to do it. ‘Honestly, I’d prefer to be 3-0 up (but) we have no choice. We have to put it right. ‘Sometimes in life, you make a big mistake and there’s no comeback, no way you get the chance to put it right again. ‘In football, you can do it so let’s just give everything. Is all the pressure on Monaco? They can lose it. They’ve already won it but they can still lose it.’ Should the Gunners need a further motivation then they only have to glance at Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov’s suggestions that his side wanted it more than the English club during the first leg. Giroud has bounced back from a poor performance to score three times in four games since Monaco . The Arsenal striker hit a stunning goal to put the Gunners ahead at home to West Ham on Saturday . ‘We have enough experience to know that what happens on Tuesday night does not depend on statement of people, but just depends on our performance on the night,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘I don’t believe that (Monaco wanted it more than Arsenal). I think we wanted too much to make a difference in the first game and forgot our basics.’ Meanwhile, Olivier Giroud is determined to right the wrongs of his wasteful performance in the first leg last month. The Frenchman was heavily criticised by his own supporters for missing gilt-edged chances in the clash. But the striker has responded well, scoring three in as many starts since the defeat to Monaco — including a brilliant strike in the win over West Ham that fired Arsenal to within a point of second-placed Manchester City. ‘I try to bounce back as quickly as I can and it’s true the boss gave me a chance to do it against Everton (after the Monaco defeat),’ said the France international. Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League last season despite a good display against Bayern Munich . In 2012 the Gunners came close to overturning a 4-0 deficit against AC Milan, but fell just short . ‘I try to do it straight away. If you let the doubts enter your head it’s even more difficult to cope. ‘There are always tough moments like that because we do a hard job. You have to question yourself every week and bounce back. ‘I try to show my answer on the pitch with my mentality. Football is a sport where you need to have a strong mentality because you have to face some difficulties. ‘Even when you play well and score a lot of goals, if you miss some everything is forgotten. You have to have a conscience about it and be aware. ‘Don’t believe the people who talk too much about football. I know when I play well or not. I know how to bounce back. I say that football is an everlasting new beginning.’","Arsenal have lost narrowly in last 16 in each of the last four seasons .

"Australia eased past Scotland despite a long rain delay to finish second in World Cup Pool A after a seven-wicket win in Hobart. Scotland were skittled out for 130 in just 25.4 overs by the Australia attack with Mitchell Starc (four for 14) the key man for the tournament co-hosts. Australia then made light work of the reply, which was interrupted for an hour and a half by a rain delay, with Michael Clarke top-scoring with 47 as they eased to victory in 15.2 overs. Michael Clarke top-scored with 47 as Australia beat Scotland by seven wickets in Hobart on Saturday . Clarke plays a pull shot before there was an hour and a half break in play due to rain . It was a dominant performance by Australia starting with their bowling attack. Starc accounted for opening batsmen Kyle Coetzer (nought) and Calum MacLeod (22) before returning to bowl out Josh Davey (26) and last man Iain Wardlaw (nought). Matt Machan offered some brief resistance with a knock of 40 before being caught by James Faulkner off the bowling of Pat Cummins, but with wickets tumbling at regular intervals, Scotland were unable to gain any momentum. Cummins finished with figures of three for 42 while Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell also picked up a wicket apiece. Mitchell Starc celebrates with his team-mates as he took four wickets for just 14 runs . Starc's bowling display earned him the player of the match award as Australia finished second in Pool A . In reply, Australia lost Aaron finch for 20 in the fourth over but then started motoring nicely, with Clarke and Shane Watson bring up the 50 mark in 45 balls. Clarke fell for 47 when the score was on 92 and shortly after the teams were forced to leave the pitch for an earlier than scheduled dinner break as heavy rain started to fall in Hobart. After an hour and a half's delay, both sides returned to the field with no overs lost, where new batsman David Warner and James Faulkner plundered the remaining runs required for victory. Matt Machan offered some brief resistance with a knock of 40 as Scotland were bowled out for just 130 . Warner hit 21 from six balls while Faulkner added 16 from six as the duo wasted no time in wrapping up the match.

"Arsene Wenger has confirmed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss up to four weeks with a hamstring injury. As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss a clutch of Arsenal's fixtures - including next week's Champions League clash against Monaco - after suffering a hamstring strain in Monday's win over Manchester United. Speaking ahead of Arsenal's Premier League clash against West Ham, Wenger said: 'It's a hamstring injury. He'll be out for three to four weeks. Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be out of action for 'three to four weeks' Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a hamstring injury during Arsenal's 2-1 FA Cup win against Manchester United . 'It's frustrating for him but he's played more games this season than before. He's shown his importance.' The Gunners star will also be unavailable for England's double-header against Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month. Wenger also confirmed Jack Wilshere, who is recovering from ankle injury, will not be available for Roy Hodgson to pick next week. He added: 'It's very difficult to say when he (Wilshere) will be back. We have to respect his recovery.'

"Vicarage Road was awash with emotion on Saturday afternoon as Watford performed a show of solidarity for Nic Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital. Cruwys was shockingly set upon by a group thugs on his way back to Wolverhampton train station from Molineux last week and is in a critical condition. The 44-year-old had been in the Midlands to watch his side draw 2-2 in the Championship. Watford’s players warmed up with ‘For Nic’ T-shirts in show of support for injured fan Nic Cruwys . Watford performed a show of solidarity for Mr Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital . Watford’s players warmed up with t-shirts reading ‘For Nic’ and the club dedicated their matchday programme to him with the message ‘thinking of Nic - showing the strength of the Watford FC family’. Members of Nic’s family were given a rousing reception on the pitch before the game against Reading, with all four sides of the stadium on its feet in applause - then mirrored just before the break. A banner behind one goal simply read: ‘Best wishes Nic “Moo”, we are all thinking of you... From your Watford FC family.’ Two teenagers, 13 and 18, have been arrested and bailed until April after the attack. A heartfelt message of support for Mr Cruwys was displayed on a large banner before the game . Mr Cruwys was in a critical but stable condition at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Saturday . Chief executive Scott Duxbury wrote in the programme to address the ‘horrendous events’ of seven days ago. ‘Everyone who works for Watford has had Nic Cruwys in their thoughts since last Saturday’s sick and unprovoked attack,’ Duxbury said. ‘I’d like all Watford fans to be aware just what a positive impact the support you’ve shown towards Nic and his family has had. An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has raised more than £25,000. A fund set up to raise money for the Watford fan has raised more than £25,000 to date . Troy Deeney helped Watford secure a 4-1 victory against Reading on Saturday . ‘Nic was simply enjoying a day out at an away match with his friends when he suffered a callous, calculated and unprovoked assault. Any one of us coming away from the stadium could have suffered as Nic has. ‘You’ll no doubt be aware of the online fund set up to benefit Nic and his family. The total raised is now £25,000 and, while money cannot wipe away what has happened, I am aware that the gesture has been extremely well received. ‘In closing I find it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened. I can only take solace from the fact I know everyone connected with this football club will do everything to help and support Nic.’ Sixteen-year-old Ollie Floyd, a Wolves supporter, whose idea it was to start the fund was interviewed and given a warm reception on the pitch at half-time.

"Brett Pitman bagged a first-half hat-trick as Bournemouth coasted past Blackpool 4-0 to return to the top of the Championship. The Cherries were in cruise control at the Goldsands as they secured their third straight victory which condemned the Tangerines to a fifth consecutive defeat. Basement side Blackpool came in search of their first win in eight matches but any hopes were dashed after just 10 minutes. Brett Pitman fires Bournemouth into the lead at Goldsands as he scored a first-half hat-trick on Saturday . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Elphick (Stanislas 63), Cook, Daniels; Ritchie, MacDonald, Surman, Pugh (Smith 62); Pitman, Wilson (Rantie 79) Subs not used: Camp, Rantie, Fraser, Ward, O'Kane . Scorers: Pitman 10,36 and 39, Wilson pen 49 . Booked: Elphick, Ritchie .

Referee: Chris Sarginson . Attendance: 10,013 . Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish. Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home. Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing. Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick. Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about. Pitman (centre) runs away in celebration as the Blackpool players watch on in frustration at Goldsands . He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes. A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box. But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes. The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine. Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half. Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick. Blackpool manager Lee Clark instructs his side during the comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth . Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes. Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off. Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go. Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort. The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands. Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick. The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.","27-year-old scored a first-half hat-trick to put 3-0 up at the break .

"Five bunker shots, four dropped shots, three missed putts from short range, two poor chips and one blow into the water. And that was just the front nine. It's fair to say Rory McIlroy's curious Florida funk continued in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. At least on the back nine there were enough good blows on show to hint it will not be too long before we can enjoy a more customary service. The world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73. While that might have been barely ok in the context of the field as a whole it was a radical improvement on what appeared a likely score at halfway. McIlroy placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative. 'After nine holes I thought there was really not much more to lose, so go ahead and be more aggressive,' he said. 'It paid off a little and the eagle was really important. Hopefully I can get off to a better start in the second round and get back into it.' Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the fairway during the first round of the Cadillac Championship in Florida . McIlroy lines up a putt on the 16th green during a difficult opening round for the world No 1 . McIlroy tries to play his way out a trouble after landing his shot in the bunker on the 17th hole . He's certainly got some work to do. McIlroy will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former American Ryder Cup player JB Holmes. Given there was a decent breeze blowing for most of the day, his 62 was a remarkable effort. Fellow American Ryan Moore shot 66. World number three Henrik Stenson carded a 69 while Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies. As for McIlroy, a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the Sunshine State this year, taking in last week's two rounds at the Honda Classic, in a startling 11 over par. The world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage. World No 2 Bubba Watson plays his second shot on the 10th hole ad the American finished one under par . Henrik Stenson kept the heat on the leaders as the Swede finished the day's play three under par . Opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start, since there are two par fives in the first three holes. But McIlroy drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains. Just to compound the frustration, his approach to the par four 11th was a metre short of being perfect, and plugged in a greenside bunker to bring about an unlucky bogey. So it continued. Every good iron shot he played he couldn't take advantage, while every bad shot invariably led to more damage to his scorecard. Two over par coming to the 18th, McIlroy became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach, and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green. Welshman Jamie Donaldson composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies . It wasn't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real Rory. A sumptuous long iron to the difficult par three fourth set up his first birdie of the day and lit the spark on a run that saw him birdie two of the next three holes before registering an eagle three at the 8th. Even during this spell, however, there were sloppy bogeys at the 5th and the 9th. No wonder he headed straight to the range afterwards. Two players who will not be remembering their rounds with any affection were Phil Mickelson and Stephen Gallacher. Mickelson's 74 was notable only for the fact it was the first time in 190 consecutive rounds on the PGA Tour that he had failed to register a single birdie. Poor Gallacher's nightmare was even more complete. The Scot put two balls into the water at the 18th to complete an awful 84. It was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro. Lee Westwood, who became the first man to play in 50 WGC events, was one over par after nine .","Rory McIlroy played a disastrous front nine in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral .

"Under-fire Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal insists his team have done ‘rather well’ this season and that he has great chemistry with his players at Old Trafford despite widespread discontent among supporters over recent results and the team’s style of play. United’s indifferent league form and FA Cup exit against Arsenal on Monday have led to doubts on whether the current squad are buying into van Gaal’s ‘philosophy’. However, the Dutchman has robustly defended his record. Louis van Gaal is targeting second place in the Barclays Premier League with a late push in the run-in . The Manchester United manager believes catching local rivals Manchester City is an achievable target . City are just five points ahead of United in the Premier League table, with Arsenal four behind City . ‘We lost the first match against Swansea and had a bad start but in spite of the bad start we are a stable club in the top four,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When you are so long there after such a bad start, I think we’ve done rather well. The coming matches are very decisive. We are so close to a lot of clubs. We can be second or third. It is not a big difference, I believe. 'Manchester United have to be one of the teams who have to play in the Champions League.' United have only lost twice in the league since early November but have ridden their luck in certain games and are currently fourth, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, and in grave danger of not qualifying for the Champions League for the second successive season. The financial implications of missing out would be devastating but Van Gaal insists that is not his concern. ‘I don’t think that I’m here to think about the financial consequences, that is (for) Ed Woodward,’ he argued. ‘I’m here to manage the professional football department.’ Manchester United have attracted unwelcome publicity all season. Expensive signings Angel di Maria, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao have failed to shine. Van Gaal said that United 'have to be one of the teams' who  play in the Champions League next season .

Sergio Aguero and Co haven't been up to their usual standards at the Etihad and that could help United .

"The magic and wizardry in Stuart Hogg’s feet has already earned him a special mention from one of the Scottish rugby team’s most famous fans, JK Rowling. With a flash of quickstep and family connections to George Best, the full-back certainly has the ability to light up any game. But memories of last year’s shocking 20-0 defeat by England at Murrayfield still pain the Melrose-born 22-year-old, even though he remains hopeful about unlocking the curse of Twickenham, where the Scots have not won since 1983. Stuart Hogg is aiming for a first Twickenham win for Scotland since 1983 . Hogg and his team-mates have not had a happy campaign at home or away in the Six Nations this year . Hogg (centre) tries to shake off the attention of Italy player Joshua Furno in the Six Nations game . Hogg is desperate to inspire Scotland to victory over England at Twickenham on Saturday . Harry Potter author JK Rowling included Stuart Hogg in a story about the wizarding world . England’s World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward was particularly scathing of the Scotland performance that day under Scott Johnson, claiming they were so toothless they would have been beaten by an also-ran Aviva Premership side. ‘Last year’s game is one that we always keep in the back of our minds,’ said Hogg. ‘We never, ever want to experience anything like that again. It was probably the worst game I’ve ever been involved with in a Scotland jersey. Our performance was really poor but we’ll draw upon that experience when we go down there.’ Looking out onto the scene of that Murrayfield defeat, Hogg speaks candidly about England’s second-class opinions of Scottish rugby. He carries his heart on his sleeve on and off the field, with obvious frustrations about his nation’s fruitless campaigns. He recalls the childhood days spent playing full contact rugby on concrete in the Scottish Borders and the afternoons working as a ball-boy for his local club. The speed and footwork that will be on show on Saturday, he reveals, were first used for mischievous after-school escapades in Hawick. Hogg says losing to England last year was the worst game he's been involved in . Our man Nik Simon sat down with Hogg at the home of Scottish rugby ahead of the England game . Hogg's Scotland side have lost all three of their Six Nations games so far . Hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the Six Nations game against Wales in February . ‘I had a bit of pace when I was younger, so I could get away with things,’ revealed Hogg. ‘I was quite cheeky, always winding up people and my mum would say: “You get away with murder.” ‘We used to play knock-door-run and then hide somewhere you could see folk opening the door. ‘The street I lived on was shaped like a horseshoe and we had another game called the Grand National. There were 20 houses and you would start at the first, running through all the gardens, jumping over the hedges and trying not to get caught.’ Hogg was soon tearing down rugby pitches and went on to make his Scotland debut as a 19-year-old, coming on as a substitute against Wales. Having idolised Scots pair Cameron Murray, Gregor Townsend and Irish legend Brian O’Driscoll, he became the youngest player on the 2013 Lions tour to Australia where the coaches singled out his ‘X-factor’. Hogg is hoping the Scots will be able to give England something to think about when they clash . ‘You want to get people on their feet and cheering,’ said Hogg. ‘Having fun is about beating players and smashing players. ‘The challenge for the modern-day coach is how you break down these big defences. There are lots of things you can do using footwork and chip kicks. The entertainment is still there, it has to be, or you won’t get 60,000 people coming to watch. ‘With Scotland, we go out there to enjoy and express ourselves. I love running with the ball and the more space that we can create, the better.’ Hogg’s box-office style caught the eye of distant relatives in Northern Ireland, prompting them to get in touch and uncover the family connection to Manchester United legend Best through his late grandmother. Keeping up the sporting tradition, Hogg played as a defender in Junior football — although he claims to have had ‘the touch of a baby elephant’ — and is a fair-weather Celtic and Arsenal supporter. Hogg holds on to the ball in Scotland's 22-19 defeat against Italy in their last Six Nations game . Hogg (third left) tries to get past Matias Aguero for Scotland against Italy at Murrayfield . But rugby has always been his first love and he remains hopeful that Scotland can deliver on the promise shown during head coach Vern Cotter’s first autumn campaign last year. A narrow defeat by the All Blacks and victories over Argentina and Tonga suggested a change in fortunes. However, the Six Nations’ defeats by France, Wales and Italy have stunted any progress made. The Scots are huge underdogs for the final two matches, against the Auld Enemy and Ireland, but Hogg is convinced they can still salvage something from a campaign in which they are in danger of picking up the wooden spoon. ‘Vern Cotter (below) was fairly quiet when he first came in but he is used to the environment now,’ said Hogg. ‘A spade’s a spade with Vern. He’ll not miss and hit the wall if he’s got something to say. ‘In the past, the Scots have had a good autumn and then not backed it up in the Six Nations. We said that we didn’t want that to be the case this time — but, unfortunately, it’s not started the way we wanted. ‘But we still have two games that we’re more than capable of winning. ‘Against England, we need to shut down their key players, George Ford and Jonathan Joseph. They have been on fire of late. We played against them a couple of times with Glasgow, so we know what they’re about.’ And what about those links with celebrity fan JK Rowling? she has mentioned on her website Pottermore that the fleet-footed Hogg might be a Squib. In Harry Potter-speak, that means a person born to a least one magical parent, a wizard-born Muggle. Hogg, for his part, will hope to discover his inner-wizard at Twickenham this weekend. ‘I’ve met her a couple of times and she’s a really nice lady,’ said Hogg. ‘I watch all the Harry Potter films, so maybe we can have some of that magic.’","Stuart Hogg is desperate for Scotland to beat England at Twickenham .

"Leicester scrambled to a 16-12 victory over Newcastle at Kingston Park thanks to a controversial try five minutes from time. Trailing 12-6 at half-time, Freddie Burns pulled the Tigers back to 12-9 with a 59th-minute penalty and then in the 75th minute launched a crossfield kick into the Falcons' goal area where brothers Mathew and Alex Tait both went for the ball which rebounded for Tommy Bell to touch down. After a long delay the TMO approved the try and Burns converted for Leicester to clinch victory and move into the Aviva Premiership's top four. Alex Tait (left) and his brother Mathew Tait compete for the ball which led to Leicester's winning try . Had Newcastle won, London Welsh's relegation would have been confirmed given the Exiles lost 74-19 to Exeter on Saturday. Should Newcastle lose all six of their remaining fixtures, London Welsh would need to win all five of their own and earn a bonus point in at least three of them in order to avoid the drop. Despite being under constant pressure up front, Newcastle showed they were more than a match for Leicester with the ball in hand and Mathew Tait was left with no alternative but to take Tom Catterick's clever kick through into touch right on the Leicester line. Freddie Burns (centre) kicks penalty during the Aviva Premiership match for the Tigers at Kingston Park . Newcastle promptly drove the line-out effectively for hooker Scott Lawson to score and Catterick converted for 7-0 after 10 minutes. It seemed Adam Thompstone must score when he cut back inside, but the winger slipped just inside the Newcastle 22 and the Falcons covered well before Richard Mayhew was caught offside at a scrum and Burns kicked a 15th-minute penalty to make it 7-3. Both Vereniki Goneva and number eight Laurence Pearce were making their bulk count with big runs in midfield as Leicester dominated possession. Scott Lawson (centre on the floor) celebrates scoring their first try with Will Welch in the first half . But Newcastle looked dangerous whenever they had the ball and Catterick had the crowd on their feet with a weaving run into the Tigers' 22 before he was stopped. Mathew Tait ran his brother's long kick out of defence right back at Newcastle and when Adam Powell went off his feet, Burns kicked his second penalty in the 29th minute to make it 7-6. Right on half-time, Newcastle showed what they can do within the ball in hand, producing a period of sustained pressure with wingers Sinoti Sinoti and Alex Tuilagi making big runs and the latter was inches from scoring. Sinoti Sinoti (centre) crosses the line to score the Falcons second try and give them a commanding lead . Newcastle recycled, lost the ball, recovered it and Powell showed real presence of mind to cut back inside and throw a lovely long pass to Sinoti for the winger to hurtle over in the corner with two tacklers hanging on. The try was given after the referee went to the TMO and it put Newcastle 12-6 up at the break, Catterick hitting the post with the conversion from the touchline. Newcastle lost two early second half line-outs deep in the Tigers' 22, and when Josh Furno was taken out in the line-out, Catterick was well short with the 45-metre penalty in the 48th minute. Leonardo Ghiraldini of Leicester (centre) feels the full force of a challenge from Will Welch and Gonzalo Tiesi . They were costly misses as Burns slotted a penalty in the 59th minute to make it 12-9 after Mark Wilson strayed offside. Newcastle kicked it straight out from the restart and were penalised at the scrum for collapsing. Burns had a chance to level the scores but his kick at goal from halfway was short. Leicester stepped up the pressure and Burns was nearly through with the Falcons showing signs of slipping off the pace. However, they seemed to be hanging on until Leicester mounted one last effort and Bell got the crucial score in minute 75.

"Eight competitive rounds to the Masters and Rory McIlroy is determined to get back on track after the rude awakening of a rare missed cut at the Honda Classic last week. ‘Sometimes a kick up the backside can do you a world of good, and I want to do well in these next two events,’ said the world No 1, who will tee off alongside world No 2 Bubba Watson and No 3 Henrik Stenson in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. The 25-year-old took advantage of some unexpected time off to take his mum Rosie out for a birthday treat last Friday night before getting down to some serious hard practice over the weekend. Rory McIlroy was back in action during a practice round ahead of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . World No 1 has this event and the Arnold Palmer Invitational to hone his game for the Masters . McIlroy only has The Masters left to complete a full set of golf's grand slam titles . ‘I guess coming off a three-week break you’re never quite sure how your game is going to be, and I just wasn’t comfortable playing the shots I needed to play in the wind,’ said McIlroy. ‘Now I’m excited to get back at it and obviously put in a better performance. I’ve worked on those wind shots and I feel in a better place and probably a little more prepared than I was last week.’ On Monday, McIlroy turned up at the renowned Seminole club in south Florida for their fabled member-guest event. He walked through the locker room and studied the names on the winner’s board. Men with names like Snead and Hogan. Nicklaus, Palmer and Woods. ‘It would be cool to have my name up there,’ he thought to himself and well, you can probably guess what happened next. The four-time major champion breezed round in 63 and won by two strokes. The Norther Irishman gets lost among the azaleas while playing the Masters last season . McIlroy got a 'kick up the backside' by missing the cut at the Honda Classic in Florida . Now it is the first World Golf Championship event of the season featuring every single member of the world’s top 50. ‘I don’t know whether it’s important for me to be going to the Masters at the top of my form,’ said McIlroy. ‘I’ve won majors when not playing well leading up to them. But I know one thing for sure. I’d much rather be going there with a win or a good performance under my belt.’ When he has finished here, McIlroy will head up to Augusta with his dad Gerry before playing his final competitive event ahead of his first tilt at a career grand slam. That event will be at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. McIlroy was not the only one to leave West Palm Beach last week determined to make amends here. How about Ian Poulter, who bossed a good field in terms of shotmaking but squandered a golden opportunity to claim his first strokeplay triumph on American soil? Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter announces he will be hosting the British Masters in October . The British Masters will be staged at Woburn Golf Club in association with Sky Sports . Poulter put no fewer than five balls into the water during his final round to miss out on the sudden death play-off by a stroke. Now he finds himself on a course laden with so many water hazards it is known as the Blue Monster. Any prospect of a watery hangover, therefore? The ever-confident one gave short shrift to the notion. ‘Do you think I will have suddenly developed a phobia for water?’ he asked, aghast. ‘Come on. I’m holding a bottle of water for heaven’s sake! ‘Honestly, I couldn’t care less there’s water everywhere. This is a course where you’ve got to hit your targets and yes, if you miss them and hit bad shots then chances are that your ball is going to finish up wet. ‘But I’m going into this tournament having led the field last week in greens in regulation and shots that finished closest to the hole. ‘Yes, it’s a tournament I should have won and I’m devastated in some ways that I didn’t. But I haven’t spent the time since wallowing on the sofa or worrying about the three or four loose shots that cost me. Poulter found the water no less than five times as he missed out on a play off at the Honda Classic . Poulter insists he has put the slump behind him and is fitter than ever heading into the WGC at Doral . ‘Time to move on and enjoy the fact I’m fitter than I’ve been for some time. I did some tests last week and the strength in my shoulder area is 75 per cent greater than last year, when I was struggling with injuries. No, it doesn’t mean I’m going to hit the ball 75 per cent further but it does mean I’m going to be able to cope better with the rigours of a long season and be able to hit the number of practice balls on the range that I want to.’ Poulter was speaking at the official announcement that he will be the host when the British Masters, with Sky Sports as presenting sponsor, is relaunched in October. If that welcome development sounds familiar, it is because Sportsmail broke the news last November. As we revealed back then, Poulter will be followed in future years as host by Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.","Rory McIlroy missed the cut at the Honda Classic, Florida last week .

"Once he had come round after emergency surgery, Ben Morgan asked the surgeon two pressing questions; would he ever play again and if so, could he make it back in time for the World Cup? Mercifully for the Gloucester and England No 8 – who had shattered his leg in a match against Saracens the previous night – the answer to both was 'yes'. But that was just the theory; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication, including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber, where the 26-year-old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask. No stone is left unturned in Morgan's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in September and October. There are no guarantees he will be ready, but despite the magnitude of his injury, the signs are good and he is infused with optimism. Ben Morgan is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg . Morgan has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against Saracens in January . Morgan was named England's player of the series following his superb displays during the November Tests . He simply has to take part in the tournament, and help the hosts excel, because the final takes place on his mother's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style! On January 9, Morgan was driving for the line during an Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm when his season was crudely terminated. He heard the sounds of breaking bone, and when team-mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground, he knew he was in real trouble. 'All I remember was that we had a scrum in the left-hand corner, I picked up the ball and went on a usual run,' he told Sportsmail. 'I got tackled by Jacques Burger and having looked back at the clips, I was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and I didn't really have anywhere to go. 'At the time, I didn't really know what the hell had happened and I just started yelping. I like to think I wouldn't make those noises unless it was serious! People moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though I wasn't in that much pain, I knew I had done something. Gloucester No 8 Morgan lines up London Welsh fly half Olly Barkley at the Kassam Stadium . 'I just didn't know how bad it was going to be, but I had an immediate realisation that I was going to be out for a while. When I got to the hospital, the staff were pretty guarded, but I got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed.' A surgeon from Cheltenham came to the hospital in Gloucester to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off, Morgan sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament. 'When I'd come round, I fired loads of questions at the surgeon,' he said. 'The first thing was 'Is it a career-ender?'. I knew he couldn't be precise, but I needed a ball-park idea of how long I'd be out for and he told me six months.' The damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal; to help the healing process. He will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire, but a plate will remain in place. Morgan has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners, but he quipped: 'I'm made of Meccano – don't put any magnets near me!' Morgan is brought to ground by flanker Marcell Coetzee during England's loss to South Africa in November . His self-deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in. While a home World Cup would be a momentous career highlight, he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough, despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does. A six-month rehabilitation period would mean Morgan is match-fit by July 10 and wouldn't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red-letter date. But he said: 'If it takes longer, that's just how it is. 'The World Cup is the carrot, but I have to be realistic; if I don't make it, I don't make it. I'm not going to tear myself up about it. I'm doing everything I can to get back for it, but there are certain hurdles I have to clear. I'm quite relaxed about it. I'm pretty sure I'll be back. If I do end up going into the World Cup training camp, I'll be fresh. I'll be blowing out of my a**e, but I'll be fresh!' The recovery programme has conventional elements, with Morgan spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight-training at the club. But he is also employing cutting-edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly. Twice a day, four times a week, he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an MS centre in Gloucester. Morgan makes another powerful ball carry against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . 'The bulk of what I'm doing is oxygen therapy,' he said. 'I'm being pressurised, to simulate being 10 metres below sea level, and I'm breathing pure oxygen. The thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood, which is brilliant for healing. 'I go in the morning, then go to train with Gloucester, get physio and do upper-body weights, then go back to the oxygen chamber. I'm in there for an hour-and-a-half.' To pass the time, Morgan's creative side is emerging, as he is filling up a large sketch-book with pencil drawings. The subjects are wide-ranging. Billy Vunipola regained the  No 8 jersey in Morgan's absence and has started all three Six Nations games . 'I've drawn a few pictures; my dog, my nephew, a little Mickey Mouse, a turtle, a light-bulb,' he said. 'There's also a little lizard, a Ninja Turtle, an owl… I've just ordered some sketching pencils because it's difficult to get good shading with the ones I've been using. I'm stepping it up! 'I did a couple of bits and pieces at school. It's just a bit of fun, a way of passing the time. I'd be bored out of my brain if I wasn't doing something like the sketching.' Morgan was on a roll before his horror injury. He was named England's Player of the Series after the autumn campaign and had usurped Billy Vunipola to reclaim the No 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted. In recent weeks, instead of being at the heart of the national team's RBS Six Nations campaign, he has been an observer. He will be at Twickenham next Saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel, while maintaining contact with the England coaches. Stuart Lancaster will dearly hope to have Morgan involved at the World Cup and the long-term casualty is confident he will be ready. Veteran Harlequins back rower Nick Easter has been another player to profit from Morgan's absence . He said: 'I feel really positive and, hopefully, that positive attitude will help my healing process. Some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts, but I'm staying upbeat. 'Getting back in time is the hardest battle, but then I have to get selected again, which is going to be a very tough task. Nick Easter has done well since coming back in, Billy is playing well too and I'm missing a block of games. Luckily, I ended on a bit of a high, but I'll have had six months out of rugby. Whether that is a good thing, because I'll be fresh, or will count against me, I don't know, but I'll do everything in my power to be there.' If he makes it, he will have a sketch-book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation – and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present.","Ben Morgan fractured his left leg playing for Gloucester in January .

"Burrowed underground, a grubby five-year-old boy peeks expectantly around a makeshift door as a woman prepares his pancakes. Like the rodent he keeps as a pet, Pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats, sleeps and plays. Accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone, the young boy takes refuge from the ever-present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire. Waiting for lunch: Pavel Makeev, age 5, peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in Donetsk, Ukraine . Pavel and his family live in the basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, an area of Donetsk  under pro-Russian rebel control, and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between Ukrainian troops and rebels. Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped altogether. The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option. Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook. A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags. The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital. Nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths, according to UN estimates. Another 14,595 people have been wounded in the conflict. New life: The young boy holds his pet, Masha, who lives with him in his underground home in the Petrovskiy neighborhood of Donetsk . Basic amenities: Pavel and his family were forced to flee their home and move to the squalid basement for their own safety . Underground existence: Beneath the city, Pavel and his sister Raya are safer from the constant threat of stray bullets and artillery fire . Harsh environment: People have been living in this basement since June 2014, two months after the conflict in Ukraine began . Light relief: The basement has working electricity, meaning the children can watch television while they take refuge from the fighting . Ruined building: An apartment in the neighbourhood is destroyed and abandoned after being hit by artillery rounds in Donetsk, Ukraine . Living area: The haphazard collection of furniture provides the inhabitants of the basement with what little comfort they have . Makeshift bed: Most of the beds consist of pieces of material and furniture salvaged from the war-torn city above . Children's bedroom: Two bunk beds are set up for youngsters in the basement of the Petrovskiy neighborhood cultural centre . Makeshift kitchen: Electric burners are used to cook food for the inhabitants of the basement as they take refuge from fighting in Donetsk . Making the best of it: Eleonora Tsvetaeva makes a rare trip home since the ceasefire between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian rebels . Household chores: A woman named Lubov empties dirty water into a canister after making a lunch of oat pancakes in the basement home . Hell above ground: A man walks past a building that has been peppered with shrapnel from artillery rounds landing nearby in Donetsk .

'We'll have to break quickly as soon as they lose the ball because that will be the key to attacking them. They know how to close off all routes to goal if you hesitate and that's what happened to us in Germany. 'They stopped us going forward and they could cause us problems if we don't break quickly.'

"A woman who says she was conned out of £50,000 by her Senegalese husband in a immigration marriage scam wants to help other women avoid the same fate. Kim Sow, 58, from Dover, has been calling for the government to take action since her husband Laye walked out on her after obtaining his British citizenship. She alleges that Laye had been in the UK illegally and she now believes he was already married to at least two other women. Kim Sow appeared on today's This Morning to share her story of how she was 'duped by a love rat' Kim, pictured with Laye, believes he married her to gain her assets and British citizenship . Kim, a music producer was 49 when she first met Laye, then 43, in a London nightclub in 2007. She said there was an 'instant attraction' and their romance had a 'normal progression to a full-on relationship'. He told her he was a widower supporting three young children in Senegal. Kim said she had no reason not to believe him as he even had his wife's death certificate to prove it. 'He said he was a religious man so couldn't live with me if we weren't married. He told me he didn't believe in polygamy and didn't do affairs. 'He told me his wife had died and his children were being cared for by relatives and he had paperwork to prove it,' she told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on today's This Morning. Kim, who was unable to have children after an ectopic pregnancy left her infertile, said the prospect of having a ready-made family with Laye was a dream come true. She said: 'When we married, I thought his children would come and live with us. I was so happy. 'One of the attractions for me was that I couldn't have children. I was thrilled to be marrying a man with three lovely children, they were the apple of my eye. I spoke to them on the phone and sent them presents, they were my life. 'I even bought a five bedroom house in Dover where we could live as a family.' Kim and Laye married at Kingston registry office in June 2008. 'I was the happiest woman in the world thinking I had a family and it all came crashing down,' Kim said. The music producer told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden, left, that she had no reason to believe Laye was still married as he showed her his wife's death certificate . 'I found out he'd had an affair and he said it was because he was missing his children. I gave him a second chance but then found all these other layers of lies and secrets. 'It was all thanks to Facebook that I discovered his real story.' Using the social network site, Kim said she discovered Laye hadn't lied about the death of his first wife, with whom he had one child. But he had gone on to marry another woman in Africa with whom he had his two other children. She found evidence he had then married a Dutch woman and possibly another English woman - and appeared to have ripped them off in similar circumstances to his dealings with her. She also found Facebook messages from Laye to other women he was targeting on dating websites. At the end of her interview, Phillip pointed out charges have not been made against Laye since he left Kim. Following Kim's allegations, police have begun an investigation into Laye for bigamy, fraud and associated crimes. But it is unclear if he is still in Britain. Kim remains adamant he is a 'love rat' who has left her poorer and broken-hearted. Kim is now working with Immigration Marriage Fraud UK to stop others suffering her fate . On This Morning she said she knows people will think she's a fool for being taken in but she said she had done lots of checks away to ensure Laye was who he said he was. 'I don't have imbecile on my forehead,' she said. 'I had checked his paperwork and it had gone through lawyers, embassies and the registry office. I had met him in the UK.' Kim is now working with Immigration Marriage Fraud UK to force government policy change.","Kim Sow, 58, from Dover, says she's victim of immigration marriage fraud .

"Students at a Catholic school in New Jersey have not been punished for dressing up as a monkey and a banana to taunt black basketball players at a high school game.

Despite numerous complaints, both were simply issued with warnings. Outrage: This is a picture of two Holy Spirit students (right) dressed as a monkey and a banana as they taunted Atlantic City's majority black basketball team (one player seen wearing white, left) Jay Connell, athletic director at Holy Spirit, told The Press Of Atlantic City: 'I am not going to kick anyone out of school or whip anybody. 'All I can do is apologize; I can't take it back. 'There is no punishment. The punishment is that it will be an event that will not happen again, and that is the punishment for Holy Spirit.' According to NBC, a female student was also involved in the skit dressed as a cowgirl, and Holy Spirit's starting five was also majority black. Atlantic City's athletic director Anthony Nistico said: 'What I am appalled at is there are adults there that let this happen,' he said. He added that the boys also hid behind a shower curtain and jumped out in an apparent attempt to scare the opposing team as they played. 'These two students were allowed to walk into the gym in these costumes and with this shower curtain,' he said. 'What were the adults thinking? Where were the refs?' Shockingly, a poll on the Press Of Atlantic City website found 50.3 per cent of people felt the students shouldn't be punished as many students dress up for the event. Atlantic City beat Holy Spirit 54-53.","Two teenage boys dressed as monkey and banana at basketball game .

"Dutch prosecutors have blocked the sale of a bar of soap which its owners claimed was made from the fat of Jewish people murdered at a Nazi death camp. The owner attempted to sell the soap on the internet auction site eBay for €199 (£143). But as soon as the item went live, moderators removed it from sale. Rumours - apparently started by the British - that the Nazis were mass-producing soap using the bodies of concentration camp victims first surfaced in the middle of the war. An antiques salesman tried to sell soap, pictured, reportedly made from the fat of Jewish Holocaust victims . The man was seeking €199 for the bar of soap on the internet auction site eBay, pictured . The listing, pictured, was removed from eBay shortly after it was originally posted . Although the mass production claim was almost certainly untrue, there is evidence that it had happened on a small scale at least during the early stages of World War II. The Nazis are known to have plundered human bodies for products, with hair used to make felt and insulation for example. However, the German scientists who were believed to have experimented with making soap from human fat had almost certainly been stopped by SS-chief Heinrich Himmler who had ordered an investigation into the claims on November 20, 1942. The unnamed antiquities vendor who tried to sell the soap handed himself into police to answer questions after the auction was cancelled. He had also handed over the two bars of soap, which are now being examined to see if they do indeed contain traces of human remains. Historian Arthur Haraf said the soap was one of a number of items found near the Dutch concentration camp Westerbork, from which Dutch Jews were sent to extermination camps. The soap was reportedly made from the fat of Jewish victims of the Westerbork concentration camp, pictured . It is claimed that SS leader Heinrich Himmler, left,  ordered Nazi scientists to stop working on human soap . Westerbork was a Nazi refugee, detention and transit camp in the town of Hooghalen, nine kilometres south of the city of Assen in the north-eastern Netherlands. The other items had been dentures, tooth brushes and glasses, which he claimed were taken from the Jews at the concentration camp. Haraf said: 'This is a terrible act and against the law. Whatever is found near the concentration camp and belongs to the events of World War II automatically becomes property of the Westerbork Memorial Museum.' Jewish organisations responded angrily at the news of the Dutch vendor. Spokesperson for the Dutch Jewish organisation CIDI, Ron Eisenman, said: 'It is saddening and disgusting to find out that there are people interested in gaining money from the Holocaust.' He added: 'We can only watch and hope that collectors will use healthy logic and will not participate in these things.' Historian Joel Stoffels also saw an advert last week selling Holocaust items and was shocked. He said: 'I was amazed to see it. All of these objects are supposed to be displayed in a respectable way and now they are being displayed as merchandise.' The Chairman of the Centre for Jewish Debate, Jaap Fransman, also expressed his anger at the news, saying: 'The selling of these accessories and objects is not just distasteful but also crazy.' The Public Prosecution Service which is dealing with the case has declined to make any statements so far while they await the results of the test on the soap.","The listing sought €199 for the bar of soap reportedly made from 'fat'

"Ashley Barnes says that he has laughed off allegations from Jose Mourinho that he was guilty of a 'criminal tackle' on Nemanja Matic when Burnley drew at Chelsea last month. Barnes' challenge was branded 'criminal' by Mourinho and Matic's retaliation saw him receive a red card during last month's 1-1 draw while the Burnley player was unpunished. It thrust Barnes and his club into the national spotlight and speaking about the incident for the first time to Burnley's programme for their match against Manchester City on Saturday, the 25-year-old striker explained how he dealt with the furore.

The Burnley striker said: 'You're always going to get people who come out of the woodwork and voice their opinion. There were lots of comments made that it was a 'criminal tackle' and that it was disgusting but you just have to laugh it off really. 'Obviously I've not meant it. I give my all for the team but I'm an honest player. As I've gone to pass the ball he's come to try and screen in front of the strikers. I've took a heavy touch and as I've gone to pass to Jonesy (Dave Jones) I've caught him on the shin with the follow through of the pass. 'It wasn't intentional, of course. I would never go out on a football pitch to try and hurt an opponent. But there were so many different angles and it got picked out and scrutinised to the nth degree but you just have to get on with it.

All I can do is apologise that I've caught him in that manner. As you can see nobody in the ground reacted and the next minute he came and pushed me over. Barnes said he was unaware at the time he had hurt the Serbian international: . 'Obviously I wouldn't have been happy if he had caught me there but as I say I've not meant it and I didn't know that I'd hurt him because it was just my momentum that took me that way.

"England reject David Strettle crossed for Saracens as they kept alive their hopes of a domestic and European treble with a 24-20 win over Northampton. The wing, constantly overlooked by Stuart Lancaster, raced over for a fine first-half try as the hosts reached the LV Cup Final. The win was extra sweet for Mark McCall’s men, who fought back from a 13-5 half-time deficit to avenge last year’s defeat by Saints at the same stage. They also lost to them in the Premiership Final. David Strettle races away from two Northampton defender to score a well-taken try . Strettle said: ‘It’s a massive win. Saints have had the better of the results between the two sides of late but this was our day. ‘We just went for it in the second half and got on top of them. But we now need to go on and win the Final.’ In the first hafl Northampton had been totally dominant and looked in control of the match, building up a 13-5 half-time lead. However the home side, aided by the wind, launched a rally to run out narrow winners and so deprive Saints of a final appearance on their home ground. Northampton selected a strong pack with Alex Corbisiero, Samu Manoa and Sam Dickinson all included. Mike Haywood was at hooker for his 100th appearance for the Saints whilst flanker Jon Fisher returned after being out with an injury since November. The former England winger touches down in the corner as Saracens reached the LV Cup Final . Saints began strongly and took an early lead. Sam Olver first made a hash of a drop goal attempt but he was on target with a penalty after six minutes. The visitors should have extended that lead but blew a golden opportunity for the first try. A neat break from Kahn Fotuali'i was carried on by Dom Waldouck but when the ball was recycled, Jamie Elliott knocked on with the line in sight. Saints continued to dominate the opening quarter with the home side unable to get out of their own half and they were rewarded when Olver fired over his second penalty with an excellent touchline kick. Eventually Saracens secured some possession to get a platform into the match. Marcelo Bosch made a strong run to put the visitors' defence on the back foot before the centre was again involved when his skilfully timed pass sent Strettle through a large gap through for the opening try of the game. Sam Olver had scored the first try of the game for the Saints but Saracens stormed back to make the final . George Kruis came on for Saracens replacing the injured Hayden Smith before Saints resumed control of the match. Fotuali'i again unlocked the defence to send Olver over for the try, which the outside half converted. When Northampton surprisingly lost a scrum on half-way, Itoje burst away and looked a likely score but he was overhauled by Dickinson, who pulled off a superb cover tackle to keep his side 13-5 ahead at the interval. Within a minute of the restart, Saracens scored a splendid try. Joubert won a line-out and a pre-planned move put Ellery in space for the wing to run elusively past a number of defenders for the try which Spencer converted before the scrum half added a penalty to put the hosts in front for the first time. Ernst Joubert gets up highest to secure line-out ball in an excellent second-half display from the home side . Assisted by the wind, Saracens were a totally different proposition in the third quarter as it was now Saints' turn to be hemmed in their own half and they fell further behind when Spencer knocked over two further penalties. After 60 minutes, Saints introduced Myler and Dickson at half-back in an attempt to revive their fortunes and it soon paid dividends with Dickson nipped over on the blindside following a driving line-out with Myler converting with a brilliant touchline kick. Northampton threatened a comeback but a late drop goal from Nils Mordt saw Saracens to the final, where they will play either Leicester or Exeter, who play tomorrow.

"England international Zak Hardaker was released by police after admitting assaulting a student, it has emerged. Leeds announced on Tuesday that their full-back was free to resume playing after West Yorkshire police concluded their investigation into an incident in the city last month. The 23-year-old Hardaker and his 19-year-old club-mate Elliot Minchella were both questioned by police and have since been released without charge. England international Zak Hardaker has been released by police after admitting assaulting a student . However, it has been revealed that both men admitted the assault and agreed to pay £200 in compensation and write a letter of apology to their 22-year-old victim under a 'community resolution'. In a statement, the Super League club said: 'Leeds Rhinos can confirm that Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella have both fully co-operated with the police investigation into an incident in Leeds in February this year. 'Both players have been released without charge and the investigation is now concluded. The Rhinos will continue their internal investigation surrounding the incident however both players will be available for selection this week.' The club made no reference to the fact that the pair had admitted or been punished for the offence but West Yorkshire Police confirmed action had been taken. Det Insp David Roberts, from Leeds CID, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'A 19-year-old man from Bradford and a 23-year-old man from Knottingley voluntarily attended a police station in Leeds on Monday. 'Both men admitted the offence of assault on a 22-year-old man at a student halls of residence on 3 February on Burley Road, Leeds. Leeds Rhinos full back Hardaker is taken on by Hull FC ace Steve Michaels who tries to bring him down . 'As part of a community resolution, which was an agreed course of action with the victim, each man will pay £200 in compensation to the victim as well as writing a letter of apology.' The victim suffered black eyes and bruising to his ears and neck in what police described as a 'nasty assault' at the Opal One building on Burley Road last month. Hardaker played in the Rhinos' opening four matches of the season but made way for teenager Ashton Golding in the 18-6 defeat by Warrington last Friday. Now he could be set for a recall when Wigan visit Headingley on Friday, although he could still face punishment from his club. Hardaker was fined £2,500 and given a warning by Leeds for breaching their code of conduct after being thrown out of England's World Cup squad in 2013 for misconduct. He also served a five-match ban last June after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee James Child during a game at Warrington.","England full-back Zak Hardaker has been dropped by Leeds Rhinos .

"Jenson Button, newly wearing a wedding ring, can afford to smile even if some of the rituals of his long career in Formula One will not be repeated at Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix. Three times he has won around Albert Park. There is little chance of that tally being added to in his temperamental McLaren-Honda. There is absolutely no chance of a pre-race coffee and post-race celebratory fish and chips at the Stokehouse on St Kilda beach. It has burned down. McLaren's Jenson Button is gearing up for his 16th season in Formula One . Button has recorded three victories in Melbourne during his career . But, aged 35, just being here is the great boon. A 16th season beckons after he feared being dropped last year to make way for Fernando Alonso, the incoming double world champion from Ferrari. But he was kept on — the result of a boardroom fight between McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who favoured Kevin Magnussen partnering Alonso, and fellow shareholder Mansour Ojjeh, who supported whichever driver Dennis did not want. Ojjeh won. ‘This is where I should be,’ said Button in the paddock on Thursday. ‘It doesn’t feel like a bonus, it feels normal, — and exciting because it is such an exciting new package of engine and car.’ But as cruel irony would have it, Alonso will miss this race after he banged his head in testing and Magnussen has been called up to replace him in tandem with Button. Button poses with the NSX concept vehicle at a Honda F1 Grand Prix press conference . Alonso’s accident in Barcelona last month prompted a host of theories: among them that he had a fit before losing control or suffered an electric shock. The second theory is totally denied by the team. Button, however, was concerned enough to examine the data of Alonso’s car to satisfy himself there was nothing for him to fear. ‘I will not get into a car unless I am 100 per cent sure that it is safe,’ he said. ‘I spent hours going through the data with the engineers and talking to them about the incident. ‘There was nothing wrong with the car whatsoever. I needed to know that before getting into the car at the next test, so I made certain of it. ‘When you are driving at the limit, you need to be sure. I trust these guys and that is why I have the confidence to drive it this weekend.’ Yes, but not as fast as McLaren would like. They are nowhere near the top teams — in expected order: Mercedes, by miles, Williams, Red Bull and Ferrari. Button, a glass-half-full sort of man, was realistic in his assessment of his team’s prospects. Button married his fiancee Jessica Michibata in a secret ceremony in Hawaii in January . ‘We definitely won’t be fighting for a win here,’ he said. ‘The important thing for us is to see improvements every race and progress. ‘The power unit package is so tight and so advanced that you do have issues and we have had more issues than we would have liked. ‘Whether we score points here or not is irrelevant; it is all about improvements race to race. ‘I would rather not score points here and then win a race later in the year.’ This prognosis is a bit dispiriting given the expectations generated by McLaren’s new partnership with Honda. Should the team’s fortunes not turn around, questions will be asked about the success of the restructuring carried out a year ago. Martin Whitmarsh, who it was yesterday announced will take over as chief executive of Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup challenge, was sacked as team principal. Eric Boullier was brought in to replace him and Dennis took on a more involved role as chief executive. ‘We are a year behind the other manufacturers and the design is more aggressive to be a challenge to Mercedes in the future,’ added Button. ‘Honda are the manufacturer who will take it to Mercedes. There are going to be teething problems, but it is about answering those issues right now.’ While Button brings his experience to bear, another British driver, Will Stevens, is just starting out. The 23-year-old Essex-born racer made his debut in Abu Dhabi for Caterham last November and the Australian Grand Prix should be his first race for Manor, if they qualify by the 107 per cent rule — within seven per cent of the pole-sitting car’s time. He drove well on his debut and was assured in his press briefing yesterday. Stevens, whose father is a successful financial figure, comes with an estimated £5million of personal sponsorship to fund his ride. He has signed a one-year contract. ‘Two months ago you couldn’t say I would definitely be here,’ he said of the last-minute deal that saved Manor. ‘There were other options, but we held out for this.’ He has even less chance of scoring points than Button. ‘We need to try to be here at the end of the race to pick up the pieces,’ he said.","Jenson Button has recorded three victories in Melbourne during his career .

"The ISIS militant who appears in a video purporting to show a boy executing an captive Israeli-Arab is a French terrorist whose relatives include a notorious Islamist who slaughtered Jewish children and a woman who took her baby to join the violent extremists. Sabri Essid has been identified as a well-known jihadist, and the half-brother of Mohammed Merah, who shot dead three children, a rabbi and three paratroopers during a terror rampage in the French city of Toulouse. But the two, who are understood to have been close before Merah's 30-hour stand-off with French special forces ended in his death, are among a number of extremists radicalised within the same family. Merah's sister Souad is known to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join Islamic State with her four children - including her nine-month-old baby. Family: The man on the right of ISIS's latest horrific video has been identified as Sabri Essid, a French terrorist who is a member of a family with a number of radicalised extremists . Essid, a married father, was named by security experts earlier today, after he appeared alongside the young boy in a video claiming to show the execution of a so-called Arab Israeli spy. The man  believed to be Essid stands by the boy speaks in French as he refers to the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris in January in which four Jews were killed. 'Oh Jews, indeed Allah has gifted us with killing your followers in your own stronghold in France,' says the man. However, doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the video, which is heavily edited. Experts have questioned whether the boy, thought to be about ten, was really the person who pulled the trigger, supposedly murdering 19-year-old Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam with a single gunshot. There is less mystery surrounding Essid himself, who has long been known to counter-terrorism forces. 'The similarities between Essid and the man in the video are very clear,' said an investigating source in Paris. 'Plenty of experts have made the link.' Terrorist: Mohammed Merah, Essid's half-brother, killed seven people - including three children - in 2013 . Shooting: The 23-year-old targeted the Ozar Hatorah Jewish school in Toulouse, also killing a rabbi . A French police source has also told AFP, France's national news agency, that 'we are checking' the identity of the man in the video. Essid, 30, from Toulouse, was caught in Syria in December 2006 in a house known to shelter Al-Qaeda members on their way to Iraq. He was sent back to France and was sentenced in 2009 to five years in jail, including one year suspended, in a case involving an Iraqi jihadist network. On his release in 2010, he returned to Toulouse - where he became a constant companion of half-brother  Merah. His father had lived with Merah's mother, and Essid was close to the killer and his brother Abdelkader.

"If Louis van Gaal is struggling for inspiration he might be pleased to see that Sir Alex Ferguson has written a book on leadership. The former Manchester United manager, who released his last autobiography in 2013, will be back on the shelves in the autumn. Ferguson, like Van Gaal, endured a torrid time to his start in the Old Trafford hotseat before going on to usher in an unheralded era of success at the club. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will release a new book on leadership this autumn . Co-authored with Michael Moritz, the book will detail Ferguson's tactics and management techniques . He has now teamed up with investor and author Sir Michael Moritz to pen an analysis of his 38 years in management. Promoters say the book, entitled 'Leading', reveals 'the key tools he used to deliver sustained success on and off the field'. They add: 'From tactics to teamwork, from hiring to firing, from dealing with the boardroom to responding to failure, the book will analyse the pivotal leadership decisions of an astonishing career.' Van Gaal's men, who have a tricky run-in, are currently looking vulnerable in fourth position in the Premier League and are out of the Capital One Cup and FA Cup following Monday night's disappointing 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal. The Dutchman is expected to have a busy off-season with another £150million spending spree planned as he attempts to overhaul an under-performing squad. But he may do well to seek out Ferguson's latest effort when it is released next October - which even reveals the details behind his own philosophy. The man himself, now 73, said: 'Since stepping into retirement I have had the opportunity to reflect on my time as a football manager, and to consider the reasons behind my success through personal recollections, conversations with Mike Moritz and my role at Harvard Business School. 'It has been a new experience for me to be looking into the past rather than planning for the future, but one that I have found enjoyable and rewarding.

Wayne Rooney tussles with Arsenal's Per Mertersacker during the FA Cup quarter-finals at Old Trafford . Ferguson celebrates with his United players after wining the Premier League back in 2013 . 'The process behind creating this book began many years ago following my first meeting with Mike, which immediately created a mutual respect for each other's achievements. Over the past year, we have spent many hours together as we have worked our way through my life in order to draw out and discuss the key philosophies I applied during my career.' Sir Michael added: 'Though I have two left feet and cannot dribble, I have long been fascinated by the characteristics of those extremely rare individuals who are capable of exerting an extraordinary influence on the rise, success and durability of the world's highest performing organisations. 'That topic led me to Sir Alex. It has been an enormous pleasure to debate the subject with Sir Alex over the last seven years or so and to collaborate with him on this book.'

"The only word I can use to describe my feeling over the last few days is distraught, really. The night we lost to Bangladesh I found myself staring at the floor in disbelief and I was trying to work out in my own mind what happened. Then over the next couple of days it started to sink in and the disappointment turned to anger. Anger at ourselves. It was in our hands and the players have to take every bit of heat we get because we were in a very winnable position in that game. We just didn’t take to the pressure well at all. What went wrong? It’s tricky as players to try to offer an explanation because it can sound like an excuse. But I will try. Did we lack a bit of experience? You look at the big teams here at this World Cup and most of the players have played a lot more one-day internationals than us. There’s always a temptation to call for change at times like this but my gut feeling would be to keep this group of players together to get them that experience over the next four years before the next World Cup. We don’t play as much one-day and Twenty20 cricket as others because of our schedules but we have to find a way to be honest so we can get that experience. You learn how to win games in tricky positions and the pressure of winning a game for England is completely different to doing it for your county. Stuart Broad (bottom) lays on the floor during England's World Cup Pool A defeat to Bangladesh on Monday . Don’t blame the coach . It’s unfair to pin the blame on Peter Moores. We’ve worked a lot on our game and the coach can’t do anything about the players not being able to take the heat of the battle when it most matters. Coaches try to teach that but you only really get it by winning and losing at the highest level. I’m reading a book called The Unstoppable Golfer by Bob Rotella and a lot of what he says applies to cricket. It’s about players taking responsibility to get into a position to handle the pressure. There was no reason why we couldn’t have beaten Bangladesh on that flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval. No reason why we shouldn’t have been able to chase 275. England coach Peter Moores (left) has come under strong criticism for their early World Cup exit . Below my best . It’s stating the obvious to say I haven’t taken the amount of wickets I would have liked in this tournament but it’s never the definitive way to judge how you have bowled. I like to judge myself on the processes, whether I’ve hit the right areas and whether I’ve created chances. I feel like I have created chances but I’ve not hit the right areas as consistently as I’d like to have done. At the start of the tournament I tried to bowl as quickly as I could but found I wasn’t moving the ball as much as I’d like. So against Bangladesh I changed that and tried to bowl a bit more as if it was a Test and looked for movement. That was better but it took me too long to figure it out in these conditions. I’ve not been happy with myself but it’s such a shame it’s been cut short because there’s a lot of cricket left in this tournament. This group had a lot more expectation than we’ve shown but hopefully a lot of them will be around to grow over the next couple of years. Broad admits he hasn't been happy with his productivity levels in terms of taking wickets at the World Cup . The obsession with statistics . I really don’t know where that has come from. It’s completely wrong to say we are obsessed with statistics or over-analyse things. In my eight or nine years of England touring this trip has seen fewer meetings than ever before. There’s also been the least number of stats flying around. If you are winning then people say you are fantastically prepared if you have good analysis but if you’re losing it becomes something to take aim at. If you want information on your game or an opponent’s then it’s available to you but we haven’t had anything thrown at us. The fast bowler adds that despite talk of stats there have been fewer team meetings than ever before . Moving on . It’s still very raw going out of this World Cup at this stage and that frustration and anger is still there. I’m disappointed with how I played and I’m sure all the guys feel the same. It’s natural and if those feelings weren’t there you would have to ask questions. I feel embarrassed to be honest. Another book I read recently was Roy Keane’s and he’d say that if Manchester United lost on a Saturday when he played he’d be embarrassed to leave his home on a Sunday. That’s how I’m feeling right now but games and challenges come round so quickly that you have to pick yourself up as soon as you can. We can’t afford to sulk. Broad says England can't afford to sulk on their World Cup disappointment with a busy fixture list ahead . A one-day future . I’m only 28 and I want to continue playing one-day cricket for England. Look at the best teams here and they all have experience in their teams. I’ve not shown enough quality in this tournament but the next World Cup is in England and my record is good at home. You can’t say what’s going to happen in the next four years but I’d certainly like to play a key role leading up to the next one. They say a bowler’s peak is from 28 to 33 so why wouldn’t I want to play? I know we are the only team who plays all-year round and that means a lot of cricket but I try to give myself the best opportunity I can to play for England as often as I can. I rest where possible and I haven’t been to the Indian Premier League. That’s because I want to play for England and I want to keep on doing that in all forms. At 28, Broad (right) aims to play in the next World Cup for England which will be on home soil . A modern approach . We’ve got the players to produce the modern brand of cricket we are seeing in one-day cricket, of course we have. Look at people like Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and Joe Root. It’s just that we haven’t delivered it here. Those guys will have a significant number of one-day caps when they play in the next World Cup and that will give them more expertise and more confidence. We must make sure that we accept it if guys like those get out at times playing the modern way and someone like Mo can definitely bat as fluently at the top of the order as some of the players we have seen at this tournament. He just has to be backed to do so. I think the right 15 players were in this World Cup squad and we can only look at ourselves as to why we haven’t justified the faith placed in us. It will take a long time to get over what’s happened here it is what it is and if we don’t learn from it that will be criminal. There is a lot of exciting cricket ahead and that has got to be our focus now. Broad says Moeen Ali (right) is an example of the modern brand of one-day cricket England has to stick with .","England lost to Bangladesh by 15 runs in their Pool A clash on Monday .

"Oral Bryan, 44, has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his former partner with a hockey stick . A father-of-five who used a hockey stick to bludgeon his former girlfriend to death in front of their children has been sentenced to life in prison. Oral Bryan, 44, hit Nicola McKenzie, the mother of their two children, over the head with the stick 'like an axe' during a furious row. Miss McKenzie, 37, suffered horrific brain injuries and never regained consciousness, dying two days later in hospital. The row erupted in Moss Side, Manchester, on September 17 last year when Miss McKenzie spotted a car belonging to Bryan's new partner outside his home. She confronted the woman, who called Bryan, and he returned to intervene. As the two women squared up to one another, Bryan got a hockey stick from his house and cracked it over Miss McKenzie's head as she shouted: 'These are your kids, go on, show them what you're like.' The fatal blow, witnessed by the couple's two children, daughter Teja, 12, and son Amahri, eight, as well as Bryan's three other children, shattered Miss McKenzie's skull and left her lying unconscious in the street. As she lay dying with blood pouring from the head wound, Bryan picked up Miss McKenzie to check for signs of life before casually dumping her back down on the pavement and running off. Miss McKenzie - described as a devoted mother-of-two by her family - was taken to the intensive care unit at Hope Hospital in Salford with massive skull trauma and brain injuries but she  died two days later. Nicola McKenzie, 37, (pictured) was described by her family as a devoted mother of two - she was killed following the brutal attack on September 17 last year in Moss Side, Manchester . Bryan initially fled the scene, but contacted police a short time later and was arrested. He claimed Miss McKenzie had attacked him with a knife and he struck the fatal blow accidentally in self-defence, but no knife was recovered at the scene. He was found guilty of murder at an earlier hearing. Diana Ellis, QC, defending, said her client was 'fully aware' of the impact of his actions, adding: 'No one wishes more that the clock could turned back.' Sentencing Bryan to a minimum of 20 years at Manchester Crown Court today, Judge Michael Henshall said: 'Nicola McKenzie was a young woman in the prime of her life and the mother of two children of who you are the father. 'The effects of the events on that day in front of those children is almost uncountable.' The incident occurred on Cadogan street (pictured) in Moss Side, Manchester on September 17, 2014 . After the case, senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a tragic incident where the life of a woman was sadly cut short in brutal fashion by a man she was once close to. 'Oral David Bryan showed absolutely no concern about his victim and the only intention in his mind when he retrieved the hockey stick from his house was to cause serious harm. 'His lack of concern was further exemplified when he fled the scene to try and save himself rather than get medical attention for Nicola. 'I know the sentence passed here today won't bring her back or even begin to make up for their loss but I hope it will offer Nicola's family some closure and my thoughts are with them.' Miss McKenzie's mother Veronica Fiddler, 62, a care worker said: 'Nicola was quiet and lovely and kind. She was completely dedicated to her children. She hardly ever went out without them, they were her life. She was a very, very good mother and that is how everybody knew her. The children are going to miss her very greatly. 'Myself and her father were there by her bedside when they turned off the life support machine. The whole community is in shock, she was very well-known.'","Oral Bryan, 44, hit Nicola McKenzie, 37, over the head with a hockey stick .

"Leeds did it under Don Revie; Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United side did it; Atletico Madrid under Diego Simeone do it. Many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years. It’s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity. So when Chelsea surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off on Wednesday it wasn’t something new, or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us. It has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game. It’s been a part of English football for years. Having said that, now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way, as I believe Chelsea did on Wednesday and I think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules. Almost all the Chelsea squad surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers after an incident at Stamford Bridge . If a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. So on Wednesday night, he could still have sent off Ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but Chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick. It wouldn’t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction. Behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players. At the moment, it’s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision, so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so. However, if you felt that by hounding the referee, your team might lose a potential goal-scoring opportunity, because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box, managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint. And over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly. Imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee. The manager would be furious. Referees are only human. Kuipers might have looked at the Ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50-50 decision. But when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too, all of that activity around him might make him feel it’s a 90 per cent decision. This tackle from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from Chelsea players . The Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge as he brandishes the red card . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half . This would only be a small change in the rules but I believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time. Certainly managers wouldn’t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team. It gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive. You could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card, trying to get an opponent booked or sent off. That would soon end what is an unsavoury practice. Another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner, forcing the referee to back off. It’s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high. But what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players won’t encroach. If someone is to complain, they can do so backing away from the referee, getting into position, not moving towards him. And if someone does need to go to referee, it should only be the captain. And when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . Football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle. I’ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it’s directed in the right way. But referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct. It’s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and isn’t acceptable. WHEN FRIDAY COMES, ENGLISH TEAMS CAN FEEL BENEFIT IN EUROPE . It has been an awful few weeks for English teams in Europe with only Everton thriving in the Europa League. Given the competitiveness of the Premier League you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the Champions League and Europa League, when the competitions step up a level. But the reverse seems to happening. The sheer competitiveness of the Premier League is leaving us short in these difficult games. Not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title, which is not the case in most of Europe’s other major leagues, but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games. Everton are progressing well in the Europa League as other English sides continue to struggle in Europe . Having played in France, I know that for Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best. It’s not that it’s easy but going to the smaller French teams is not like going to Turf Moor to play Burnley or Loftus Road to play QPR, where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over Chelsea or Manchester United. That’s not the case in France, and I’m not sure it is in Italy or Spain. Obviously Bayern Munich are utterly dominant in Germany at the moment, so there aren’t that many games where they need to be at the top level. Don’t forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over Christmas, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke were on a 40-day break. Arsenal endured a torrid Champions League 3-0 defeat against Monaco late last month . And while the Christmas break isn’t as long in France, Italy and Spain, it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. It’s ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League, which is what has made it so successful, might now be damaging our performance in Europe and by extension damaging it’s reputation. However, there is an opportunity now to help English team in the Champions League. Jose Mourinho has long drawn attention to Spanish teams playing games on a Friday night if they have a Tuesday night Champions League game. The new £5.1billion TV deal — a mark of how popular the Premier League is — has provision for some Friday night games. The Premier League and TV companies should be looking at those Friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the Champions League. We need to give our teams every chance we can. After all, if Premier League clubs consistently fail in Europe, global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' side crashed of the Europa League to Besiktas in late February . GREAT TO LOOK BACK AT MY CAREER . I was really honoured a few months ago when Sky Sports asked if I would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football. The result will be shown tonight on Sky Sports 1 and it’s been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career. There are one or two things I hadn’t remembered, like the post-match interview I did after scoring on my league debut as an 18-year-old against Stoke in 1976. The collars on the shirt I was wearing — oh my word! They look like something Barry White might have turned down as excessive. Glenn Hoddle volleys in for Tottenham against Manchester United in 1979, his favourite goal he scored . And I’m pleased to say my Top of the Pops appearance singing Diamond Lights gets an outing — not that any of the musicians will be. It also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal, the volley I scored for Tottenham against Manchester United from just inside the box in 1979. I’ve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling I had that day, with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring, is how I imagine it feels. I hope people enjoy watching the film as much as I did making it.

"A man from Hunan Province in southern China has been imprisoned by his own mother in a chicken shed for an astonishing 13 years, according to the People's Daily Online.

"An ISIS-inspired teen in Tokyo has been caught 'practicing murder' with a junior school's pet goat, according to the Tokyo metropolitan police. The 14-year old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, said he wanted behead the kid goat before he attacked a human victim after viewing videos of the recent killings of Japanese hostages by ISIS. Police in Tachikawa, a middle-class bed-town serving central Tokyo, said that the boy had been found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in the morning on March 16. Victim: Inspired by watching horrendous videos of ISIS executions, a teenager in Tokyo tried to behead a goat (pictured) as 'practice' before attacking a human . Lucky escape: The boy was found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in Tachikawa, a middle-class town serving central Tokyo . Chilling inspiration: Police quoted the boy who tried to behead the goat (pictured) as saying: 'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State' Safe: The goat escaped any serious injuries and the boy - who is a minor - does not qualify for Japan's capital punishment laws despite calls on Twitter to give him the death penalty . Police said they were alerted to the assault when a passing police officer heard the repeated bleatings of the goat. The teen was caught chasing it and was found to be carrying a saw and other workman's tools. 'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State. But first I decided to kill the school goat for practice,' the police quoted the boy as saying. The attempt on the animal has parallels with another ISIS inspired attack in suburban Kawasaki, adjacent to Tokyo, earlier last month. Like the chief suspect in the Kawasaki murder, the goats' assailant was also a dropout, according to the police, and a 'hikikomori' a shut-in - common among the young in Japan. One of the three high school boys charged with stabbing a 12-year-old boy to death in Kawasaki proclaimed himself and the rest of his 'team' as the 'Kawasaki State' - following the same naming pattern as the terrorist organization ISIS. The gang terrorised other students in the port city declaring: 'We're above the law. We run by our own rules. We are Kawasaki State. If you go against us, we'll cut off your head while you're still alive!' Punishment: Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court . Anger: In light of the attack on the goat, some have blamed Japanese parents for not knowing how to control their children's internet usage . The three are due to be tried for murder in a juvenile court later this year. Both the Kawaski murder and the attempt on the goat have generated thousands of tweets in Japan calling for the death penalty for minors in the case of heinous crimes. The perpetrators in both cases are all minors - under 20-years-old in Japan - and are not subject to the country's capital punishment laws. 'Murder must be punished by the death penalty whatever the age,' was one reaction. Other blamed Japanese parents who do not know how to control their children's internet usage because they are allegedly technologically illiterate. Violent viewing: The computer of the boy who attacked the goat contained videos of hostage beheadings - including those of Japanese hostages Kenji Goto (left) and Haruna Yukawa (right) Police in the Tachikawa case confirmed that the boy's computer showed a long history of downloaded videos of Islamic State beheading hostages - and that the suspect had viewed them repeatedly. The most viewed were the beheadings of two Japanese hostages in January - journalist Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, a security contractor. Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court. They added that the goat escaped any serious injuries.","14-year-old boy in Tokyo was found attacking the goat with crowbar at 1am .

"A 34-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a 27-year old woman after her two young children found her body in a car at Hackham West on Sunday. The children, aged seven and two, were quick to alert neighbours by sounding the car horn once they realised their mother was unresponsive. Two children sounded a car horn after finding their mothers body in a parked Holden Captiva . A man hunt for the woman’s partner led to the arrest of a Hackam West local who police say was known to the victim.

"A group of college footballers have sparked outrage by dressing in Ku Klux Klan robes in a parody of the Will Smith movie Bad Boys II. About 20 members of the team, at Wheaton College near Chicago, Illinois, performed the 'skit' wearing Klan-style white hoods and carrying Confederate flags. The off-season team-building exercise was intended as a 'satirical parody' of the 2003 action comedy Bad Boys II, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, whose characters poke fun at the KKK. Footballers performed a 'skit' wearing Klan-style white hoods during a team-building exercise at Wheaton College (pictured) near Chicago . The skit, intended as a parody of a scene from the Will Smith movie Bad Boys II (pictured), has sparked outrage on campus . But the stunt has provoked anger on the campus while Philip Ryken, the evangelical Christian college's president, has sent an email to all students and staff. The incident happened on February 28 in a campus gym and involved some of the team's black players. College bosses have acknowledged the skit was 'racially insensitive'. In Bad Boys II, the police detectives played by Smith and Lawrence burst out of white robes they are wearing as part of a raid on a Ku Klux Klan meeting. According to the Chicago Tribune, team Captain Josh Aldrin, who is African-American, took responsibility for the skit and, in a letter to students, admitted 'we made a mistake.' The incident happened on February 28 in a campus gym and involved some of the team's black players . In Bad Boys II, the police detectives played by Smith and Martin Lawrence (pictured) burst out of white robes they are wearing as part of a raid on a Ku Klux Klan meeting . He wrote: 'As a black male, a team captain, and the leader of the group that performed the skit, I should have understood that (the) KKK and Confederate symbols are not funny in any context. 'We hope the campus community will forgive us for our actions.' Mr Ryken was made aware of the incident shortly after it happened and held a meeting with some of those involved at 1am the next morning. On Sunday, more than 700 students gathered in the College's Pierce Chapel to pray for 'campus-wide healing'. In a statement posted on its website, the college said: 'The team captain acknowledged his poor judgment in failing to consider the inherently hurtful meanings these symbols carry, though it was clear the skit was not motivated by racial hostility. 'The coaches accepted responsibility for their failure to provide appropriate guidance. 'All recognized that, regardless of the group's intent, the skit was inappropriate, and apologized in an e-mail to the campus community sent out around noon on Sunday.' Footage was taken of the event - but the images were 'inherently hurtful and shocking' and would not be disseminated, the college said. The statement added: 'Wheaton College stands resolutely against racial insensitivity, including the use of symbols that convey hatred against African Americans and other ethnic minorities. 'The College is committed to responding promptly and appropriately to incidents that may violate our Community Covenant, taking the time to consider the total facts of each situation and seeking redemption, with respect for the dignity of each person.'","Players at Wheaton College near Chicago wore KKK hoods as part of 'skit'

"In 1988, when Arsene Wenger was getting in his stride as Monaco manager, he revealed in an interview with a local newspaper that he did a master's degree in economics because it gave him a 'way to understand what was going on around me'. The 65-year-old must now wrap his head around how Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 for the fifth year running, despite a 2-0 win against his former club that left it 3-3 on aggregate. Wenger's return to Monaco was not as romantic as he would have liked as no banners were unfurled at the Stade Louis II and few pleasantries were exchanged during a match that saw Arsenal win the battle, but lose the war.

Wenger leaves the pitch as Arsenal were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 by his former club Monaco . Read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's match report from the Stade Louis II . Arsenal's exit on away goals means Wenger must now  focus on qualifying for next year's competition and little can be made in mitigation for being denied a place in the quarter-finals by a team sitting fourth in Ligue 1. 'We have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners,' Wenger said ahead of the match, though it would take some doing for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco to become the third eventual European champions to boot Arsenal out. Wenger is sure to analyse his team's exit and it was in that same interview with Monaco-Matin some 27 years ago that he revealed his habit for making sure he watches at least half an hour of football every evening, among other interests. 'I read a lot, all sorts of books because you have to be conversant in a larger and larger amount of things,' the then-Monaco manager  said in 1988. 'For example, I follow closely what is being released in the book store, be it in French, in German or in English. I take notes by hand. I do not know how to type. I have watched a lot of matches. 'This is part of continuing to grow [as a manager]. You take a step back from your football and you analyse the practices elsewhere. 'I have at least 250 [video cassettes]. Every evening, at home, I watch a game for about half an hour. Often, it is the opponent that we are about to play, sometimes, it is just for enjoyment. Bayern [Munich] vs Real [Madrid] for example.' Watching this match will not make for pleasant viewing for Wenger, however, as his first competitive return to a city famous for its casino and where one in three people are millionaires saw Arsenal leave empty-handed.

"Premiership Rugby's longest-ever broadcasting rights deal with BT Sport could lead to another rise in the competition's salary cap. Chief executive Mark McCafferty admitted the four-year contract extension with BT Sport will feature in talks over setting the salary cap level for the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership season. Premiership bosses confirmed the new BT deal on Monday, extending the existing four-year contract until 2021. Premiership Rugby Chief executive Mark McCafferty admits the new BT Sport deal could raise the salary cap . McCafferty accepted the salary cap could 'possibly' rise again off the back of the BT deal - but not straight away. 'We've got the salary cap levels in place for the 2015-16 season next year, and we will start discussions with the clubs over the next few months on the cap for 2016-17 onwards,' said McCafferty. 'No doubt the new BT deal gives us some certainty against which to plan those discussions.' Premiership chiefs netted £152million when agreeing their first deal with BT Sport in 2012, and this new extension is expected to command a sizeable increase. The salary cap for the Aviva Premiership will be discussed for 2016-17 onwards in the next few months . Premiership clubs continue to battle the lure of big-money moves to France in the bid to retain their top stars. Northampton skipper Dylan Hartley rejected several lucrative contract offers from French clubs to commit to Franklin's Gardens earlier this season however, and league bosses will hope increasing revenue through deals similar to the BT contract will continue to boost that ongoing fight. The Premiership's salary cap is already set to rise to £5.1million for 2015-16, with clubs able to gain £400,000 in credits for the number of home-grown players in their squad. Premiership clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee players, whose salaries are not included in the cap. McCafferty believes progressive sponsorship and commercial arrangements like the new BT deal will continue to help Premiership clubs build squads potent both at home and abroad. Dylan Hartley (centre)  raises the trophy for Northampton having won the 2014 Aviva Premiership . English and French clubs spent two years haggling over reform of the European rugby competitions, securing meritocratic qualification and record broadcasting investment in the process. For the first time since 1998, four English clubs have qualified for the quarter-finals of Europe's top club contest, in the inaugural European Champions Cup. 'We're particularly keen on all of the talent that we've been developing through the academies: those players have been breaking through into the England set-up at a younger age,' said McCafferty. 'We've got a good, strong, young English squad, and we've had strong performances in Europe from our top clubs. 'The whole picture is coming together but all of that requires more investment, and that's what we intend to do.'","The four-year contract extension is the league's longest ever TV rights deal .

"A volunteer middle school basketball coach has been charged with having inappropriate sexual contact with one of her 14-year-old players during a team sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to DuPage County prosecutors. The abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence after Wilson accompanied some of the girls from the Hill Middle School basketball team to a movie and spent the night at the sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse after being accused of having inappropriate sexual contact with a Hill Middle School basketball team sleepover. She was a volunteer coach with the team . Wilson, also known as Kiki, began volunteering with the team in an unpaid, unofficial capacity at the end of January, Indian Prairie School District Superintendent Karen Sullivan said in a statement on the district's website. The district immediately notified police when officials became aware of allegations and told Wilson she could not be on school property, Sullivan said. She added: 'We want to stress that the district takes these charges very seriously. As this is now a matter for law enforcement officials to handle, we encourage anyone who may have pertinent information regarding this investigation to contact the Naperville Police Department. 'We are providing support in the school for any student who may need to discuss this issue. If your student wishes to talk with someone at school, please direct him or her to speak with their social worker or guidance counselor.' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall told the Chicago Tribune that he was 'deeply disturbed' by the recent events. 'Ms Wilson purposely put herself in a position of influence and trust in order to prey on the innocence of young girls,' he said. State's Attorney Robert Berlin said that the allegations against Wilson are appalling. 'A coach's role is to motivate and inspire athletes to be the best they can be, both on the court and off it,' he told the Tribune. 'Coaches are there to help athletes attain their goals, not to take advantage of the trust their position holds just to satisfy their own sickening desires.' Wilson was an unpaid, unofficial volunteer girls basketball coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois. She played basketball with the same team when she was in middle school . Though the district does not fingerprint volunteers at elementary or middle school levels, it does background checks through the Raptor system, which is used by 12,000 schools across the United States, according to the Tribune. The program screens a person's driver's license information to find registered sex offenders, Janet Buglio, director of communication services in the district said. 'Everyone entering our schools, including parents and volunteers, surrender their driver's license every time they enter a school to be used for a screening using the Raptor system,' she said. Wilson played basketball on two high schools state championship teams before joining the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team for a year. She then transferred to St Joseph's College where she played basketball for two years. Before entering high school, she played basketball at Hill Middle School, the same place she was volunteering in January and February. Bail was set Friday at $100,000 and Wilson is due in court on March 24.","Shakyla Wilson, 22, was a coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois .

Lancaster will inform his players of the results of Wales' clash with Italy in Rome and Ireland's match against Scotland at Murrayfield, but insists their over-riding ambition on must be to secure victory rather than chase a score. 'There are lots of hypotheticals. You don't know how the other two games will play out. Clearly we'll know the outcome before we start, which is an advantage on last year,' he said. 'We were in a similar position going into the Italy game last year when we knew points difference would decide it. The challenge for us was to score as many points as we could.

Jack Nowell scored England's late try which put them top of the Six Nations standings on points difference . 'The emphasis on Saturday will be the same as that day - to get the performance right first and foremost. 'It's impossible to insulate the players from the results of the previous games because 82,000 people are shouting it at them when they run on to the field. 'But the critical thing is to ensure the players are all completely focussed on their own preparations leading into the game. 'By the time the Ireland game finishes we'll know what the objective is and will feed that through to the key decision-makers. 'Everyone else should be concentrating on their job to get a win for the team.'","Stuart Lancaster's side beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham last Saturday .

"Manchester United may have a new secret weapon to try and attract Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford - club legend Bryan Robson. Captain Marvel joked that he was going to go to Madrid to try and tempt the Real winger back to Manchester at the launch of the United Legends match against Bayern Munich. Robson, 58, who will manage the United side, was responding to comments from Bayern counterpart Paul Breitner who claimed he was going to tempt Owen Hargreaves, who played for both sides, to represent Bayern in the Red Heart Charity match which raises money for the Manchester United Foundation. Bryan Robson joked he would try to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to play for Manchester United Legends . United face Bayern in the second leg of their Legends clash having drawn 3-3 in Munich last year . United's line-up for the June 14 clash will include Edwin van der Sar who will play for the club at Old Trafford for the first time since he hung up his gloves in 2011 in the second leg of this clash between  the legends of the two European superclubs. The Red veterans travelled to Munich in August 2014 for the first leg against their German counterparts, with goals from Paul Scholes and Andy Cole resulting in a 3-3 draw, so there is all to play for in the return match in June. Robson revealed that other figures from the club's recent history will also wear the red shirt again. Robson joked that he would try to tempt Cristiano Ronaldo back to Manchester for the game in June . Ronaldo recently returned to Old Trafford with his country Portugal for an international friendly in November . 'Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, Quinton Fortune and Denis Irwin too,' he said. 'The squad's coming together quite nicely and I'm happy with it.' Breitner reeled off a number of names he will have in his squad - Giovani Elber, Niko and Robert Kovac, Roy Makaay, Paulo Sergio, Michael Tarnat, Mark van Bommel, Daniel van Buyten and Dietmar Hamann. Robson added that he was hoping to see Old Trafford sold out. Edwin van der Sar has been confirmed for the game and will don a United shirt for the first time since 2011 . Paul Scholes is set to play after starring for United in the first leg which was a 3-3 draw at the Allianz Arena . Andy Cole is congratulated on the third goal in Munich by his team-mates, and United will want to win this time . 'The Legends game against Real Madrid in 2013 raised around £1million for charity with a crowd of over 60,000,' he said. 'That was great but hopefully we can fill the stadium this time around. To raise that sum was brilliant for a one-off event and I think it’s important to clarify all the lads play for nothing. 'Nobody gets paid for being involved and we know what sort of an impact the funds have on the community through the Manchester United Foundation.'","Bryan Robson attended the launch of a Manchester United Legends fixture against a team of Bayern Munich heroes on June 14 .

"Chris Smalling insists Manchester United are capable of overtaking bitter rivals Manchester City and finishing second in the league. United put on their best display of the season on Sunday as they swept aside Tottenham in a near-effortless 3-0 victory at Old Trafford. The impressive performance raised hopes and expectation levels at the club and Smalling thinks United are well-equipped to sustain that kind of performance level for the rest of the season. Chris Smalling, pictured tussling with Tottenham's Harry Kane, believes Manchester United can finish second . Wayne Rooney scores United's third goal in their comfortable 3-0 win against Tottenham on Sunday . United are two points behind City, who lost to Burnley on Saturday, and just one point adrift of third-placed Arsenal. And Smalling is convinced finishing second above City is not just a pipe dream. 'Yes, I think we could, especially after City's result on Saturday,' the United defender said. 'It is all very close. 'I think it's very open all the way up to second place and we will be aiming for that, especially when we are playing those teams coming up. 'We want Champions League football back here. It's a must. Fourth is the minimum but when it's there, second is a realistic target and if we keep on performing like that I don't see why we can't give it a good push.' United face Liverpool, Aston Villa, City and Chelsea over the next four weeks and then host Arsenal on the penultimate weekend. Many viewed the difficult run-in as a reason why United could fail to qualify for the Champions League, but Smalling views the situation in exactly the opposite way. Marouane Fellaini helped United cruise past Champions League rivals Spurs with an early goal at Old Trafford . The former Everton man celebrates in front of a section of home supporters after finding the back of the net . 'These games are six-pointers,' the England centre-back said. 'We can do ourselves a favour and do our rivals big damage as well. 'Sunday was the first step. It was the perfect time to put in a performance like that, especially with our run of fixtures. 'Confidence will be good, it's one of the biggest games of the season and hopefully we can play like that again.' A video released by The Sun on Sunday, appearing to show Wayne Rooney being knocked out by Stoke defender Phil Bardsley, dominated the build-up to the match. But Rooney poked fun at the episode by shadow boxing during his celebration for his goal at Old Trafford. Rooney celebrates his goal against Spurs by mocking a video of him being knocked out by Phil Bardsley . It was not the first time Rooney has been at the centre of controversy during his career and it was interesting on Monday that he picked out another player who had a rollercoaster career - Paul Gascoigne - as his favourite English footballer during a Chevrolet Google+ Hangout. 'I think he's probably still, to this day, the greatest English player. For excitement and goals, he was my favourite player,' the United and England captain said. Asked what it was specifically about Gascoigne that Rooney liked, he said: 'His ability to turn games round on their head and produce magical moments. He was a perfect entertainer on the pitch.'

"Scotland lock Rob Harley insists the Dark Blues can finish their RBS 6 Nations off on a high if they can stretch their 20-minute blitz against England to an 80-minute onslaught. Vern Cotter's men host Ireland on Saturday knowing defeat will leave them with a disastrous whitewash for the third time in 11 years. But Glasgow forward Harley is taking hope from the promising spell at the end of the first half last weekend where his side stormed back from Jonathan Joseph's early score to grab a 13-10 half-time lead. Rob Harley believes Scotland can take hope from their 20-minute dominant spell over England on Saturday . Mark Bennett finished off a superb move before a pair of penalties from skipper Greig Laidlaw nudged them in front at the break. But Scotland failed to add a single point after the interval and slumped to a 25-13 defeat in London as England stepped up a level. Now Harley insists the Scots will only be able to dent Ireland's title push next weekend if they can repeat their brief moment of dominance down south for the full match at Murrayfield. He said: 'It was a very, very fast Test match on Saturday - possibly the quickest I've ever played. England came at us with huge pace and they moved the ball really well. Scotland stormed back from Jonathan Joseph's early score to grab a 13-10 half-time lead at Twickenham . 'Their dangerous attacking players were pushing them forward and it took some exceptional defence from us a couple of times to stop them building a bigger lead in that first half. 'But I thought we showed great character getting back into the game. We put pressure on them and started to play our own game. 'We got the off-loads going and that's how we got our try - we moved the ball and played quickly. 'Next week is a massive test and it's important we do the same against Ireland that we did in that second quarter against England. Mark Bennett scores a try for Scotland at Twickenham during the impressive spell that they hope to build on . VIDEO 02 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . 'That will be the big focus for us this next week. We'll get a boost from going home to BT Murrayfield in front of our own fans but we need to take the bar that we set with the good things we did at Twickenham and make that the standard for the whole 80 minutes. 'It gives us something to build for and we can definitely take the positives from Saturday's match before hopefully ending the Championship on a high.' Harley says Scotland will take the positives from Saturday's match as they aim to avoid the wooden spoon . Defeat in the English capital follows narrow losses to France, Wales and Italy but despite that miserable set of results, Harley insists Scotland are moving forward. He said: 'The coach spoke after the game in London about making the little improvements that will turn those tight losses into wins. 'We have been giving ourselves chances. We led at Twickenham at half-time but we need to step up our level at bit more so we finish off these chances and do not let teams back at us.'

"Former Liverpool players including Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso are poised to return to Anfield for a special charity match at the end of this month. Steven Gerrard has thrown his support behind plans to stage a game during the international break on Sunday, March 29 which would feature team-mates from his 17-year career. John Arne Riise and Luis Garcia have confirmed they will take part while Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher is also due to be involved. Striker Fernando Torres, now at Atletico Madrid, scored 81 goals in 142 appearances for Liverpool .

Pepe Reina played nearly 400 games for Liverpool during a successful eight-year stay on Merseyside . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) is fully behind the charity match that could raise over £500,000 . Proceeds from the game would benefit the local community with the Liverpool FC Foundation likely to be the main beneficiary if it goes ahead. A full house at Anfield could generate in excess of £500,000. Torres, Reina and Alonso are among those who have been invited to play, although their involvement depends on international call-ups and also permission from their club sides. Luis Suarez is unlikely to be there as Uruguay face Morocco in a friendly in Agadir on Saturday, March 28. Javier Mascherano has the same problem with Argentina scheduled to face El Salvador and Ecuador.

"A blunder from Norwich keeper John Ruddy ensured that the Sky Bet Championship promotion clash against Derby at Carrow Road finished in a 1-1 draw. Cameron Jerome's 18th goal of the season gave the Canaries a deserved lead at the break and the hosts were controlling the game when disaster struck in the 66th minute. Ruddy had had little to do all afternoon but when required to catch an in swinging corner from debutant Jamie Hanson he somehow fumbled the ball into his own net to gift the defensive-minded Rams a point. Norwich City's goalkeeper John Ruddy reacts after fumbling the ball to concede an equalising goal . Norwich City players stand dejected as Derby County's players celebrate their fortunate equalising goal . The clash between second-placed Derby and fifth-placed Norwich got off to a cagey start, with Bradley Johnson's off-target shot from long range for the home side the only effort of note in the opening stages. Norwich were very much on the front foot though and Alex Tettey and Jonny Howson also tried their luck from distance with no success against a Derby side who looked as though they had come for a point. On-loan midfielder Graeme Dorrans then had a clear sight of goal, only for a poor first touch to allow Johnny Russell to clear for a corner, before Cameron Jerome steered the ball just wide after being put in by Wes Hoolahan. Norwich City's Cameron Jerome scores his sides first goal of the game at Carrow Road on Saturday . Without their main men up front - Darren Bent and Chris Martin - the Rams barely posed a threat at the other end and it was no surprise when Jerome opened the scoring for the hosts on 31 minutes. A slick one-touch move instigated by Tettey ended with Martin Olsson crossing low for Norwich's top scorer to slot home from close range. Derby's appeals for offside were waved away and Norwich continued to dominate, although Russell's quick dart into the box did provide a rare moment of alarm for the home side. Norwich maintained their grip on the game in the early part of the second period, with Jerome heading over from a corner before Lee Grant's parry from a Steven Whittaker snap-shot prompted a scramble in the visitors' box. Norwich City's Gary Hooper (right) and Derby County's Craig Bryson compete for the ball during the draw . Jamie Hanson and  Wesley Hoolahan compete for the ball as both side look for the winner at Carrow Road . Derby's lack of a specialist front man was painfully obvious although Tom Ince's low shot on the hour mark did draw a save out of Ruddy. But the Norwich keeper then made a horrible mistake to hand the Rams an equaliser they scarcely deserved. Hanson's 66th-minute corner from the right should have been a routine gather for the former England keeper but he took his eye off the ball and somehow fumbled it into the back of the net. City responded well to the shock and it required a brilliant one-handed save from Grant to keep out Sebastien Bassong's header from an in swinging Hoolahan free-kick. Grant then denied substitute Gary Hooper as Norwich looked for a grandstand finish before Jerome wastefully headed a Whittaker cross just over and Johnson then followed suit with his left foot.","Cameron Jerome's 18th goal of the season gave the Canaries the lead .

"Wales' chances of lifting the RBS 6 Nations trophy could hinge on the fitness battle being waged by Italy captain Sergio Parisse. Warren Gatland’s men need a thumping victory over the Italians on Saturday to have a chance of overhauling England and Ireland, who both boast superior points differences. But Welsh hopes took a knock with news that Parisse, who limped off against France on Sunday, has been cleared of any serious damage to his right foot following an MRI scan in the Italian capital  and hopes to recover for Thursday’s team announcement. Parisse revealed on Twitter that the soft-tissue injury is ‘less severe than expected’ and he could still feature alongside prop Martin Castrogiovanni, who is understood to have been recalled to the squad after suffering a serious dog bite on his nose three weeks ago. Today he tweeted an image of his foot in an ice bath in a bid to get fit for the clash. Sergio Parisse limped off during Italy's defeat by France in Rome at the weekend . If Parisse plays he will be a major factor in Wales' attempts to win the Six Nations . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . The veteran Azzurri pair have 221 Tests between them and their experience could be a major obstacle to Welsh ambitions of securing the necessary landslide victory at the Stadio Olimpico. Wales kept themselves in contention for the title with a classic defensive display against Ireland on Saturday but, with the race likely to be decided by points difference, focus must now shift towards attack. If the trophy is going to head back to Cardiff, then Gatland’s side must burst open the floodgates of the River Tiber and better the scoring record of both England and Ireland. Having topped the tackle count at the Millennium Stadium with — according to the Welsh camp — a record-breaking 38 hits, Luke Charteris is hoping to keep his place in the second row. His side are up first in a triple-bill of fixtures and, with kick-offs staggered throughout the day, the 32-year-old has already decided how to kill the time as other results unfold. Wales beat Ireland 23-16 at the Millennium Stadium to force themselves into title contention . Warren Gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul England and Ireland . ‘We’ll have to find some good Italian wine,’ joked Charteris. ‘First, you have to try to win the game. If you look any further than winning the game by a point then you become unstuck. ‘That has happened in the past and as soon as you do that, you are disrespecting the opposition. If we can win, it gives us a chance. ‘We saw just how good a team they are when they won in Scotland. I know a few of the boys so it will be a really tough game.’ In an ideal scenario, Gatland would have had the option to keep the same starting XV that beat Ireland. But the Kiwi will be without tight-head prop Samson Lee, who was sent to London yesterday to seek specialist advice on a potentially World Cup-threatening Achilles injury. The front-row problems have been compounded by doubts over Richard Hibbard and Gethin Jenkins — prompting call-ups for Exeter’s Tomas Francis and Saracens’ Rhys Gill, but not Adam Jones. Gatland's Wales side have a +12 points difference, 25 behind England and 21 adrift of Ireland . Jonathan Davies and Dan Biggar share a joke during a Wales training session . The 34-year-old British Lion has hinted that he could be drawn out of retirement, however Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde insists the onus is on the player to reverse his decision. ‘We would be open to a call from him,’ said McBryde. ‘It was his decision to hang up his boots on the international front. I still have his number, but there’s no need to call him at the moment. As far as I’m concerned, he’s announced his retirement and, until he changes his mind, at the moment we have enough strength in depth.’ McBryde moved to allay concerns over Jamie Roberts after the 28-year-old was brought off with a head injury against Ireland. The Racing Metro centre has been a mainstay throughout the competition but, in Scott Williams, Wales have attack-minded cover that could exploit Italian weaknesses in the final quarter. ‘We have seen so far that up until the 60-minute mark Italy have been in the game and competing,’ said McBryde. ‘They will be hugely disappointed with their performance against France and I am sure they will be looking to finish on a high, so that makes them more dangerous. We are dealing with a wounded animal. ‘Saturday was a hugely physical Test and some of the players’ reactions following that match reflected the intensity. ‘The fact they have come out of that match on top makes the bruises feel that little less painful. The spirit is good and, by still being in the hunt for the title, everyone has come in with an appetite and an edge to build on the momentum.’","Sergio Parisse could be fit for Italy's clash with Wales in Rome .

"Borussia Dortmund's mini renaissance which had seen them win four Bundesliga games in succession came to a halt, as they were held to a frustrating goalless draw at Hamburg. The tight contest saw the visitors dominate possession, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus typically at the heart of Dortmund's attacks, but try as they might, they could not circumvent a well-drilled Hamburg defence.

For Dortmund, it is a blow to their aspirations of qualifying for continental football next season, while relegation-threatened Hamburg remain without a win in their last four league outings. Dortmund had started the game strongly with Reus, passed fit after an injury scare earlier in the week, finding Aubameyang with a free-kick only for Hamburg's Djourou to make a timely intervention. Hamburg striker Nicolai Muller fired wide a few minutes later, but chances otherwise came at a premium during the first-half.

"Steve Clarke afforded himself a few smiles on the touchline and who could blame him? This has been a strange old season for Reading, who are one win away from an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal but have spent too long being too close to a Championship relegation battle. At least this win will go some way to easing that load. They made it hard for themselves, but they had an in-form player in Jamie Mackie who was able to get the job done. He put Reading in front in the first half and then scored a brilliant winner just moments after Chris O’Grady had levelled with a penalty – one of the only legitimate chances Brighton had all night, even if Clarke was angry about the decision. Reading frontman Jamie Mackie fires the Royals ahead against Brighton in Tuesday's Championship fixture .

He said: ‘It’s embarrassing. There was almost no contact. It seems to be the standard of refereeing in this division.’ The win puts Reading 13 points off the bottom three and Clarke added: ‘It gives us a lift in the league because that is what was needed. It was a big win. It makes the gap bigger between us and the bottom three and we needed that.’ Brighton, meanwhile, have now gone five games on the road without a win and this one came against a side that had gone 344 minutes without scoring at home before Mackie netted midway through the first half. Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale must take an element of blame. His pass out to Rohan Ince was easily cut out and after advancing unchallenged Mackie pulled the trigger from the edge of the area. By then, Jake Cooper had already seen an effort hacked off the Brighton goal-line by Jake Forster-Caskey and Hal Robson-Kanu made a spectacular hash of a chance, launching the ball into the stands when he went clean through. Mackie’s strike eased the tension and almost immediately Reading could have been two up, only for Michael Hector to balloon over the bar from six yards.

"Borussia Dortmund's Ciro Immobile struck twice in the second half to secure a 2-0 victory at third tier Dynamo Dresden and a place in the German Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday. The Italian, criticised for a lack of Bundesliga goals this season, pounced on a cross-field pass from Dynamo's Michael Hefele to snatch the lead five minutes after the break on a bumpy pitch that resembled a ploughed field in parts. Dortmund struggled to play the flowing football that has seen them win their last four league matches and Mats Hummels almost gifted Dynamo an equaliser when his back pass bounced awkwardly and was intercepted before Mitch Langerak saved.

Dortmund's substitute striker Adrian Ramos almost got a second but his shot squeezed past a defender and hit the near post before rolling along the line and being cleared. However, Immobile scored again when he slotted in from a Jakub Blaszczykowski cutback in the box at the final whistle. The only negative for Dortmund was the loss of winger Marco Reus, who missed much of 2014 with a string of ankle injuries, midway through the first half when he limped off. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen's Hakan Calhanoglu rescued his side from embarrassment with a sensational free kick to steer them to a 2-0 extra-time win over second tier Kaiserslautern. The Turkey international fired a shot around the wall from 25 metres past keeper Marius Mueller towards the end of the first half of extra-time to break the visitors' resistance. Stefan Kiessling added a second goal 10 minutes later after Leverkusen struggled for most of the game.

"Oldham Athletic have handed caretaker manager Dean Holden the job for the rest of the season. The League One club received more than 120 applicants for the role which was vacated by Lee Johnson when he joined rivals Barnsley on February 25. They included the likes of ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso and one-time Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde. League One side Oldham Athletic handed caretaker manager Dean Holden the job for the rest of the season . Former AC Milan star and Palermo manager Gennaro Gattuso had also applied for the Oldham manager's job . However, New York-based chairman Simon Corney has decided to put his faith in former player Holden, 35, who has lost three and won one of his four matches in charge. In the 20 days that have passed since Johnson's departure, injury-hit Oldham have dropped from ninth to 15th place in the table while Barnsley, who won 3-1 at Boundary Park on Saturday, have gone from 16th to sixth and a play-off position. Former Oldham manager and current Sky Sports pundit Iain Dowie was the fans' favourite to replace Johnson however, no serious talks are understood to have been held with the ex-Crystal Palace boss. Iain Dowie, pictured during his time in charge of the Latics, was the fans' favourite for the job . Swinton-born Holden, a defender who played for a number of sides including Bolton, Peterborough and Walsall, will be in charge for Tuesday night's match against promotion-chasing MK Dons. He will be assisted by head of youth Tony Philliskirk and first-team defender Adam Lockwood. Holden expressed his delight at being offered the role. 'I'm delighted to accept the role manager of this fantastic football club until the end of the season,' he said. 'I'm also pleased Tony will be alongside me to add his experience and knowledge of the game as we progress forward. 'I now ask all supporters to get behind the club and players for the remaining 11 games of the season, including the game against MK Dons (Tuesday night). 'I firmly believe we have the capabilities of reaching the play-off places this season and with your support, which has been excellent all season, we feel we can reach our targets.' Holden, who played for Oldham from 2002 untill 2005, said he was 'delighted' to accept the role of manager . Chief executive Neil Joy added that the search for a permanent manager would continue 'away from the spotlight.' He added: 'Given the importance of the role, especially at this point in the club’s history, it is essential that no stone is left unturned in ensuring that the board appoints the person whom we believe will give us the best chance of achieving our goal of bringing Championship football to the town.' Oldham currently lie eight points away from the relegation zone and seven points from the play-off positions. Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, who lives in the town and is a regular at matches, was approached about the possibility of taking the job. The 40-year-old, however, said the timing was not right although he did not rule out taking over at some point in the future. Oldham, founder members of the Premier League, have been in the third tier of English football since 1997. Former Man United midfielder Paul Scholes is an Oldham fan and did not rule out taking charge in the future .","Oldham Athletic received over 120 applicants for the role of manager .

"Eden Hazard may be supporting Arsenal's opponents for the rest of the season as the Gunners mount an improbable title bid, but for now the Chelsea winger is on Arsene Wenger's side. Hazard says he is backing Arsenal to beat Monaco on Tuesday night, because them reaching the quarter finals would be good for English football. The Gunners, who go to France attempting to overturn a daunting 3-1 deficit from the first leg, need to score at least three times to progress, after Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco's stoppage-time goal renewed Monaco's two-goal advantage. Eden Hazard has been in superb form for Chelsea this season, but is backing rivals Arsenal in Europe . Hazard is friends with Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, but favours Arsenal over his compatriot's team . Ferreira-Carrasco fired in a crucial third goal to give Monaco a seemingly decisive advantage in the tie . But Hazard, a friend of the young Belgian forward, is backing the country of his employers rather than his compatriot in Tuesday night's clash. 'I have a friend Ferreira-Carrasco over there [at Monaco] and I wish him the best,' Hazard told Canal Plus. 'But for English football, I hope Arsenal go through.' England are currently second in UEFA's country coefficients, which determines how many clubs qualify for the Champions League, only narrowly ahead of Germany in third.

"Jenson Button can understand the reasoning why Fernando Alonso will not be making his second debut with McLaren this weekend. On the advice of doctors, Alonso is absent from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month. Fears were expressed to Alonso of 'second-impact syndrome' whereby a serious brain injury, or even death, could occur should the 33-year-old be involved in a second incident so soon after the first. Jenson Button walks through the paddock at the Albert Park circuit ahead of the Australian Grand Prix . After several weeks testing (above), the Formula One season gets underway in Melbourne on Sunday . Despite that there has been scepticism of the decision, particularly as Alonso spent three days in a local hospital and passed a variety of tests. Button knows what it is like to suffer concussion as he was involved in a severe accident in practice for the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix, yet just a fortnight later was back behind the wheel of his car in Canada. On reflection, Button knows he should arguably have never driven in that subsequent race, so can understand the precautions taken with Alonso, even if they appear extreme. 'As far as I know he (Alonso) had three days (in hospital) undergoing every scan and check under the sun,' said Button. 'I'm sure whatever they've chosen to do is the correct decision. The British F1 driver understands why McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso will miss the race . Alonso suffered concussion after a high speed crash at the Circuit de Catalunya on February 22 . 'Concussions vary. Some are very light, and then you have different grades of concussion, brain damage. 'For me, I raced two weeks after an accident in Monaco in 2003, with checks of standing on a box, closing one eye and whatever else I had to do. 'To be honest, I scraped through, so they let me race, but that was nearly 13 years ago. Now the checks are very stringent. 'With the incidents we've had, in particular with Jules (Bianchi in Japan last year), the medical people are going to be more strict, and so they should be.' A helicopter takes Alonso to hospital after the former world champion crashed during pre-season testing . The Spaniard waves to supporters after leaving hospital, having passed numerous tests . Despite Alonso's incident at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, Button insists he has no issues with the car. Initially, speculation centred on mechanical failure or an electrical issue given the new McLaren is now powered by Honda. The Woking-based marque, however, categorically ruled out any such faults and instead stated a freak gust of wind played its part in the double world champion veering off track and into a wall. Heading into Sunday's race at Melbourne's Albert Park, despite the lack of running throughout testing given numerous other glitches, Button maintains the car is one of the best he has driven. Button was involved in a serious accident at the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix before returning two weeks later . 'Competitiveness is impossible to say, but in terms of feel and how the car is and what you want it to do, it does everything right and a lot better than last year,' assessed Button. 'This car is very different in that it does what you hope it will do, which is very important for myself, and also for Fernando as far as I can see. 'The basic philosophy of the car and idea of the aerodynamics and how it works is definitely right. I haven't driven a McLaren like this before, not in the way it works. 'I'm not saying it's the quickest McLaren I have ever driven, because it's not, but in the way it works, the basic car is very good.' McLaren reserve driver Kevin Magnussen will race in Alonso's absence at the Australian Grand Prix . Whilst Button is confident of finishing Sunday's race, he appreciates McLaren Honda are a long way off from challenging their main rivals. 'You are going to have doubts, and it would be stupid not to have doubts when you look at winter testing because we haven't completed a simulated race distance yet,' said Button. 'Yes, I do know it's going to be a tough start, but it's also very different. 'The last two years have not been the easiest seasons for us, but I think the difference with this year is the understanding there could be something very special on the horizon with McLaren Honda. Button looks on as the NSX concept vehicle at a Honda F1 Grand Prix press conference . 'The whole team is unbelievably excited about what could happen in the future. 'But we also understand there's a lot of work needed before we even start thinking too much about winning races, even podiums and fighting for the world championship. 'It's a great base for the future, but it is going to take time. It's not going to be an overnight thing.'","Fernando Alonso will miss F1 opener in Australia after suffering concussion during pre-season testing .

"Kevin Pietersen is willing to give up his Indian Premier League contract to play county cricket in an attempt to make an extraordinary return to the England side. In what would be the first step of a very long journey back to international cricket, the exiled star is ready to accept the challenge of new ECB chairman Colin Graves and try to fight his way back to the England side. Graves had said in a BBC interview last month that Pietersen would have to be playing regular county cricket if he was to have any chance of being considered by the a regime which is making sweeping changes at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen is willing to turn his back on the Indian Premier League in order to represent England . Pietersen, pictured in 2008, would have to repair his relationship with England boss Peter Moores . The governing body were then quick to emphasise that nothing had changed in their stance and they would only pick those who were not only performing well in county cricket but who were ‘a positive influence on the England side.’ Pietersen was picked up relatively cheaply by the Hyderabad Sunrisers of the IPL this year in a deal worth around £200,000 making it less expensive for him to throw in his lot with an as yet unnamed county and try to call Graves bluff. Yet a comeback, approaching 35, would still be remarkable. England’s need is greatest in one-day cricket, the format of the game Pietersen least enjoyed during his later years with England, and the wounds from his bitter sacking from England are still raw. He reopened many with his bitter book. If he came back it would be hard to see how he could work with senior players like Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson as well as coach Peter Moores, who he tried to force out in 2009, managing director Paul Downton, who sacked him last year, and national selector James Whitaker, who said in December that Pietersen would never play for England again. For Pietersen to come back now a lot of people would have to either depart or rebuild some seriously broken bridges. Pietersen's England future lies in the hands of new ECB chairman Colin Graves .","Kevin Pietersen is keen to make a return to the England set up .

"Wales prop Samson Lee was seeing a specialist in London on Monday to gauge the full extent of an Achilles injury. Lee was carried off just 14 minutes into Wales' 23-16 RBS 6 Nations victory over Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. He will miss next weekend's final Six Nations game against Italy in Rome, where Wales will need to post a sizeable points total to realistically keep alive their title hopes. Samson Lee injured his Achilles during Wales' 23-16 win against Ireland in the Six Nations on Saturday . Wales assistant coach Robin McBryde confirmed on Monday that Lee is being assessed. Lee's fellow prop Gethin Jenkins, meanwhile, continues to be reviewed after he went off at half-time against Ireland due to a hamstring problem.

"If Eoin Morgan really believes what he said after England's miserable World Cup ended with an anti-climactic win over Afghanistan at a near-empty Sydney Cricket Ground, then they are in even more trouble than we thought. The England one-day captain was either protecting his players or is in total denial after an early World Cup exit caused by England's extreme limitations in the 50-over format being repeatedly, brutally and embarrassingly exposed. It is the only explanation for Morgan insisting he had 'no regrets' and, even more bizarrely, saying that he felt all the England players who have under-performed so spectacularly here should carry on in the one-day blue clothing. England captain Eoin Morgan insists he and his side have 'no regrets' over their early World Cup exit . Morgan (second left) walks off the field with Ian Bell (third left) as rain delays play on Friday . This was another deflating day for England even if they did win their final, meaningless group match with ease on a soggy day in Sydney against a willing but mediocre team of minnows in Afghanistan. It was a game that was hardly worth playing and one that even the 9,000 present would have been happy to see rained off so that they could watch the far more entertaining New Zealand win over Bangladesh on TV. The statistics, if we dare bring those up, will tell you that England were businesslike in restricting Afghanistan to 111 for seven off 36.2 overs before knocking off their revised target of 101 in 25 overs with 41 balls to spare. But then came another strange press conference from a captain who has been a massive disappointment since taking over from Alastair Cook on the eve of this tournament, not least with the bat. England batsman James Taylor plays a shot as Afghanistan wicket-keeper Afsar Zazai watches on . Bell shakes hands with Afghanistan players following England's hollow consolation win at the World Cup . 'There are no regrets, absolutely not. We gave it everything,' Morgan insisted after England had managed to equal statistically their worst ever World Cup by defeating a second minnow in Afghanistan as well as Scotland. Only in 1996 have they had such a shocker, on that occasion beating just Holland and the UAE. Then came the bombshell that a team who have failed dismally to come anywhere close to the pace being set by the leading nations in this tournament should all carry on towards the 2019 World Cup. When Morgan was asked if England should make changes as they play catch-up in one-day cricket, he said: 'No, absolutely not. We haven't got guys who are coming towards the end of their careers. I don't see any reason why any of them should retire. I think we have the right calibre of squad. Guys on the outside need to be banging down the door. It's an easy thing to sit here while we're not doing well and say someone outside the squad is better. We considered everybody when we selected the squad and I still believe we had the right group of players here.' Bell plays a shot during England's match against Afghanistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Taylor (left) and Morgan celebrate the wicket of Afghanistan's Samiullah Shinwari during Friday's win . England batsman Alex Hales plays a shot during the final match of England's poor World Cup campaign . That may be so but if the time is not ripe for change now, then we may as well all give up on the 50-over format and go home. For instance, Ian Bell made an unbeaten 52 yesterday in his 161st one-day international but surely that must be his final appearance in a one-day shirt, whether he retires or is dropped. Also, there seems no point in either Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad slogging away in one-day cricket for little reward when there is the small matter of 17 Tests coming up in 10 months, starting with a tour of the West Indies.Then there is the position of the captain himself, who said he was 'hungry' to carry on at the helm. Yet Morgan is not hungry enough, it seems, to lead England in their next one-day international, against Ireland in Dublin in May. Instead he will be at the Indian Premier League even though the coach of his Hyderabad team, Tom Moody, has intimated that Morgan is a squad player and is likely to remain on the bench rather than in the action. The bottom line is that England should have been heading to Melbourne today for a World Cup quarter-final against an India team they defeated twice in the tri-series here before their world fell apart. They could even have won that and reached the semi-finals, and from there who knows what might have happened. What a wasted opportunity. What a reality check for English one-day cricket. And if Morgan truly believes that no changes need to be made now, then he is the wrong man to take England forward after this disaster of a World Cup. England's win over Afghanistan attracted only a handful of supporters to conclude a dismal World Cup . Despite their early exit the World Cup, Morgan suggests England should stick with the current squad .","Eoin Morgan says he has 'no regrets' over England's woeful World Cup exit .

"Louis van Gaal believes he retains the full backing of the Glazer family despite a difficult first year in charge of Manchester United. The next five matches will have a big bearing on whether Van Gaal's maiden season at the club will be regarded as a success or failure. United are two points inside the top four with 10 matches to go and after Sunday's game against Tottenham, they face Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea. Louis van Gaal is targeting second place in the Barclays Premier League with a late push in the run-in . The Manchester United manager believes catching local rivals Manchester City is an achievable target . Despite a run of three defeats in 23 matches, some supporters have complained about a lack of tempo, flair and width from Van Gaal's side. But, crucially, the United boss thinks he still has the support of the Glazer family, who own the club, and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. 'I have faith that I can complete my three years,' the United manager said. 'I think they are pleased with my way of managing the club.' Van Gaal proudly recalled the long list of successes to support his point at a press conference on Friday. The Dutchman reminded those present that he had won silverware in his first season at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Ryan Giggs and Van Gaal haven't had the greatest season but are still well in with a chance of a top four spot . The 63-year-old also recalled the fact that he won the 2008-09 Eredivisie with AZ Alkmaar a year after finishing 11th. 'I said I will (leave) but the (AZ) players came to my house to ask me to stay, and the board also,' he said. 'Then we were the champion.' Van Gaal accepts it will be 'very difficult' to win a trophy in his maiden year in England. United are out of the FA Cup following their quarter-final defeat to Arsenal and they are 10 points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand. Van Gaal's sole task is bringing Champions League football back to Old Trafford. The Dutchman has not contemplated what failure would cost United. 'No. I don't think I am here to think about the financial consequences. That is Ed Woodward. I am here to manage the professional football department of Manchester United,' Van Gaal said. United are facing a difficult run following their FA Cup exit at the hands of Arsenal last Monday . Van Gaal has been criticised for his 'long ball' tactics but insists the club support his philosophy . 'I am here because of my qualities and my philosophy. That we have spoken about in our first sessions with each other, Ed Woodward and myself. After that I have spoken with the Glazers. Because of those discussions I am here now. 'I am not thinking of the consequences if we are not in the first four. It is very bad for the club. But why do we have to speak about things that are not happening yet? 'We are longer in the top four than Arsenal.' Van Gaal is likely to receive significant backing in the transfer market regardless of where United finish. Most of last year's signings continue to struggle. Angel di Maria cost £59.7million but his star has faded fast after an encouraging start. British football's record signing is suspended for Sunday's match against Spurs after being sent off for tugging referee Michael Oliver's shirt in the defeat to Arsenal. The Argentinian has also had to deal with off-the-pitch problems, most notably a house move after his Cheshire mansion was targeted by burglars in February. Van Gaal insists Di Maria is happy at United and believes he will be at the club next season despite rumours of interest from abroad. Angel di Maria pleads his innocence after being booked by referee Michael Oliver in the defeat to Arsenal . Oliver shows the red card to Di Maria  after he tugged at the referees shirt following a yellow card . 'As a manager you can never say no or yes because, in the end, the player shall always decide. But I don't think he shall move,' Van Gaal said. 'Nevertheless, his incident with his wife at home, he is very pleased to be here at Manchester United. 'I think that he shall stay because his reaction after the defeat and the red card is very good. I like his attitude.' Van Gaal says his door is always open if Di Maria or any other player becomes unhappy. Van Gaal insists Di Maria will stay at Old Trafford, despite his unrest both on and off the field . 'I am always like that,' he said. 'That is part of my philosophy. A football player is not only a man who kicks the ball. Also, his environment is influencing him. I shall always be open for (that). 'I know also the commercial interests of the club and we have to respect that also because you cannot give a lot of money for the player and the next season you put him out of your selection,' Van Gaal added. 'It is also the quality of the player. Then they also have to pay the sum.'","Louis van Gaal says Manchester United trust in his philosophy .

"First home buyers may be allowed to spend their superannuation to help them buy a property, Treasurer Joe Hokey has proposed. Mr Hockey says it is due to the aging population in Australia that the role superannuation needs to be reconsidered, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. However the notion has been met with discontent among the Grattan Institute, Labor and the superannuation association, who warn that house prices will rise if the idea was put into place. This comes as the recent release of the Abbott government's Intergenerational Report revealed a snapshot of the next 40 years, showing Australians can expect to live into their mid-90s in 2055. First home buyers may be allowed to spend their superannuation to help them buy a property, Treasurer Joe Hokey has proposed . Mr Hockey said on Friday that the government may have to make fundamental changes to the superannuation system, considering Australia's ageing population. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I am concerned about rising house prices and the accessibility to homes and homeownership for younger Australians, but we've got a limited pool of savings. We need to have these conversations.' However John Daley from the Grattan Institute told the Sydney Morning Herald he was against the prospect, saying that Mr Hockey's proposal would only increase housing costs. 'It won't improve the problem around supply. If supply remains constant and you effectively increase the amount that people can pay then prices will go up. This is economics 101,' Mr Daley said. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey said . Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen was also opposed to the notion as he told the Sydney Morning Herald that it goes against the principle behind superannuation. These views were echoed by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia as they expressed that such a proposal would only help those on higher salaries rather than Australians who earn less. On Thursday, the Abbott government's first intergenerational report was released and found that by 2054/55 there will be about 40,000 people aged over 100 years in Australia. These figures were compared to about 122 Australians aged over 100 in 1974/75 and around 4,000 now. The report also highlighted that the number of people aged over 65 is expected to double and the population will be 39.7 million.","Treasurer Joe Hockey says the role of superannuation needs to be reconsidered due to the aging population .

"Jonathan Davies is determined to prove Wales’ doubters wrong in the final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations and plans to celebrate the championship with a plastic cup after a silverware snub. With trophies being sent to Twickenham and Murrayfield, Wales will return home from Rome empty handed even if they go on to win the three-horse race for the title. Warren Gatland’s side need a thumping victory over Italy to overturn their points deficit on England and Ireland and — despite the Kiwi keeping his counsel about the scenario — there is understood to be some disappointment about the organisers’ trophy decision. Wales centre Jonathan Davies is tackled by Ireland lock Paul O'Connell (left) and tighthead Mike Ross . ‘I’m sure we’ll find a trophy somewhere, like a plastic cup or something,’ said Davies. ‘Obviously people are doubting us and they don’t think we’re going to be involved. But we just worry about ourselves, concentrate on ourselves, and will put a performance together that hopefully means we can get the cup on Sunday.’ Welsh hopes of a landslide victory could hinge on the fitness of Italy No 8 Sergio Parisse, who has a ‘30-40 per cent chance’ of being fit. Italy have delayed their team announcement by 24 hours to give him time to recover, but Davies says Wales will not change their approach even if the 31-year-old is ruled out. Scott Williams is congratulated by Davies and Dan Biggar following his crucial try against Ireland . ‘We can’t fall into that trap,’ said Davies. ‘If you do, the pressure seems to come on you rather than the opposition. ‘Italy have some key injuries with the captain maybe being out, and after the disappointment of France, they’ll have doubt in their minds. ‘It’s about us going out there and stamping our authority. It’s about sealing that doubt and building from there.’ While Italy are struggling for form, Wales are still building momentum after their victory over Ireland. A fine defensive display kept the championship race alive, however Davies knows his side must add more cutting edge in attack. Warren Gatland's side are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title that will be decided on Saturday . ‘Looking back on the Ireland game, we probably left two or three scoring opportunities out there,’ said Davies. ‘This week we’re going to have to take all our chances. ‘As a back line we haven’t fired as we’d have wanted to. The forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there’s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities.’ If Wales can rack up the points, the pressure will move on to Ireland and England, who are up second and third against Scotland and France in the afternoon of staggered fixtures. Davies and his countrymen will watch events unfold from Rome and he plans to cheer on his French clubmates from Clermont Auvergne. Italy's captain and talisman Sergio Parisse faces a race to fit for the visit of Wales on Saturday . ‘France can be amazing at times,’ said Davies. ‘Hopefully, they can turn up and do a job. They’ve done it in the past.’ Aside from two injury-enforced changes in the front row, Gatland has kept faith with the starting XV who beat Ireland. Scott Williams scored the decisive try and the centre was on Wednesday among the latest batch of players — along with Alun-Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate and Gareth Anscombe — to sign a dual contract with the WRU and their region. ‘Alun-Wyn, Dan, Scott and Gareth represent a cross-section of experience. Each one of them is a player of proven talent,’ said Gatland.","Wales are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title along with Ireland and England ahead of the final round of action on Saturday .

"Ronny Deila accused Ryan McGowan of endangering the career of Liam Henderson with a wild lunge in the dying moments of Celtic's Scottish Cup victory over Dundee United. The Norwegian's side strolled into a semi-final meeting with Inverness by putting four goals past the Tannadice men, yet the third of four successive meetings between the sides was again pockmarked by ill-discipline. Anthony Stokes was sent off by referee Calum Murray for a swipe at Paul Paton before McGowan was also dismissed for scything down Celtic sub Henderson – prompting the sixth red card in three back-to-back meetings. Ryan McGowan is sent off by referee Calum Murray after he scythed down Celtic sub Liam Henderson . And a clearly angered Deila believes the young Celt was fortunate to escape serious injury. 'It was a red card,' he insisted. 'It was a stupid tackle on the sideline. We need to get these things out of football. 'It was a youngster trying a little trick in the corner. You could have stayed there and kept him out wide instead of going in with both feet. He could have injured him for life. 'It must have been frustration. It was a straight-forward win in the end but there were some angry and disappointed players out there. 'It got a bit tense at the end but that can happen. Celtic boss Ronny Deila claimed McGowan could have injured Henderson for life with his late challenge . 'These have been important games for both teams and sometimes it can get a bit tense. 'Today, we were the better team, like we were on Sunday, and they had some frustration. We need to handle that and get ready for the next game.' Deila, who wanted to look at the Stokes incident before commenting further, isn' t concerned the ill-feeling will spill over in the fourth encounter between the sides on Saturday. 'I spoke to Stokes,' he added. 'His mouth was bleeding after a challenge from Paton and he reacted. We have to see it again if it is a red card. 'I am not concerned for my players. We have to be at the same level and get the three points. I am delighted to be playing them again.' Celtic eased through at the second attempt thanks to goals from Jason Denayer, Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons and Virgil van Dijk. But given the tempestuous nature of the three previous games, Griffiths believes there's every chance matters might get out of hand when the teams reconvene on league business at Celtic Park. 'That's six red cards in three games now and if I was a betting man then I would be putting money on another sending off this Saturday,' he said. Anthony Stokes (second left) comes together with McGowan during an ill-tempered second-half . 'It is just one of those things and the Dundee United players are getting a bit frustrated and we move on to Saturday and hopefully we can pick up another three points. 'I don't think there is niggle between both sets of players. I just think Dundee United are sick of the sight of Celtic. 'We have got them again on Saturday and then we don't see them for a while.' United assistant manager Simon Donnelly believes refereeing decisions have gone against his side in the three games. The Tayside outfit felt Ryan Dow should have been given a penalty in the League Cup Final while Efe Ambrose should have had a second yellow early in the second half last night for a foul on Nadir Ciftci. 'The Celtic reaction on the back of their player being sent off maybe influences the referee (when McGowan is sent off) but I'll need to look at it again,' Donnelly said. 'Is it any worse or any different to Scott Brown's two weeks ago?' Asked about Ambrose, Donnelly replied: 'It's another yellow card. We deliberately put Nadir out there to play on Ambrose because he was on a yellow card. Deila celebrates at full-time as his side reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals with a 4-0 victory . 'I thought it was another yellow card when we were having a reasonable period in the game. 'They've gone against us in the last few games. We've spoken about the penalty at the weekend. That's football.' Meanwhile, Celtic skipper Brown says he's moved on from being photographed seemingly drunk in an Edinburgh street four days before the League Cup Final. 'I don't think I'm the first player to make a mistake and probably won't be the last,' he stated. 'But I've spoken to the manager, it's been dealt with and now all I'm doing is moving on. 'I'm sure the club, the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for Celtic. 'It was a real honour as captain to lift the League Cup on Sunday and we now want to push on and try to bring our fans even more success this season. 'That's all we're thinking about.'","Celtic defeated Dundee United 4-0 in the Scottish Cup on Wednesday .

"A lot has changed since Paul O’Connell played the first of his 100 Tests more than 13 years ago. Professionalism has been the key to the former shelf-stacker’s longevity, although the Irishman has not always been surrounded by such healthy company. On the week of his debut in 2002, the young and enthusiastic second-row had to share a room with former Munster team-mate Peter Clohessy. Sam Warburton of Wales and Paul O'Connell of Ireland pose with the RBS 6 Nations trophy . Paul O'Connell will lead Ireland out at the Millennium Stadium on the occasion of his 100th international cap . O'Connell prepares to offload the ball during the Ireland training session ahead of the game last week . Paul O'Connell's importance to Ireland cannot be overstated as he wins his 100th cap against Wales on Saturday. Over the past 13 years, the iconic Munster lock has become the side's beating heart and captain. 'He's an outstanding leader,' says Ireland fly-half Jonathan Sexton. 'When he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your next stand up.' Their billets were turned into an Irish cards den in the days leading up to the Six Nations visit of Wales; a stark contrast to the preparations for this meeting at the Millennium Stadium. ‘I was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning,’ recalled a laughing O’Connell. ‘“The Claw” used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up. I was well aware from Peter that this was not the way forward! ‘Obviously it’s changed a lot since then. It’s funny, there’s a lot more guys to copy now then when I made my first cap. Now in the Irish camp I take a lot of advice from (strength and conditioning coach) Jason Cowman. Jonny Sexton is obviously a great guy to copy and follow.’ It is testament to O’Connell’s longevity that half of the current Welsh coaching set-up were playing against him in that match — a record 54-10 victory at Lansdowne Road. Both Robin McBryde and Rob Howley have since escaped to the warm comfort of the tactical box where — along with Warren Gatland, Neil Jenkins and Shaun Edwards — they will be hoping to plot Ireland’s downfall at the Millennium Stadium this afternoon. O'Connell powers over for a try in the 54-10 victory for Ireland over Wales back in 2002, his debut . Half of the current Welsh coaching set-up were playing O'Connell at Landsdowne Road in his first game . All eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end Ireland’s Grand Slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes. They have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from Sexton and Conor Murray, with scrum-half Rhys Webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that England made in Dublin two weeks ago. ‘I don’t know if England did much analysis on them,’ said Webb. ‘They didn’t seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever. We need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error.’ The heavily influenced kicking strategy has been criticised for lacking entertainment value. Rhys Webb admits attractive rugby will come second as Wales look to derail Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . All Blacks boss Steve Hansen recently said that rugby is ‘geared towards defences that inhibit attack’ and McBryde is predicting another war of attrition in the Welsh capital. ‘Attractive rugby will come second,’ said the 44-year-old. ‘That’s the nature of the game at the moment and unfortunately the spectators have got to pay a price for that.’ It promises to be an intense tactical battle between Gatland and counterpart Joe Schmidt, with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired Ireland lock Neil Francis during the week. Gatland was said to have ‘the intellectual properties of a tub of Flora’, although O’Connell holds the Kiwi in much higher regard. Webb says Wales need 'to be on the money' in their RBS 6 Nations-defining clash with Ireland . Wales captain Sam Warburton makes his way into the stadium for Wales training ahead of Six Nations clash . ‘For as long as I can remember we’ve being trying to poach ideas from Warren Gatland,’ said O’Connell. ‘We played Wasps with Munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an S&C (strength and conditioning) and nutritional point of view. It was a rude awakening. He makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking. ‘At the start of the championship, Joe said the Wales-England game was going to be the standard-bearer. Two years ago Ireland beat them in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against England. ‘They’ll feel the same thing is happening now.’ Kicking game . In Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton, Ireland have the world’s in-form kicking half-back combination. Their aerial game-plan was predictable against England yet Stuart Lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it. Wales, however, have one of the best defensive back-threes in the world and Leigh Halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into. How well Ireland anticipate that - perhaps using Sexton as a looping runner, if the wingers drop back - will be highly significant. Set-piece . At 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in, Luke Charteris of Wales and Devin Toner of Ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition. They are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line-out throw, while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents’. Their long limbs are used to try and steal ball, although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul, where both Wales and Ireland are particularly effective. Picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of Alun-Wyn Jones and Paul O’Connell. Breakdown . Welsh defence coach Shaun Edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area. However, they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against Ireland, who won 23 turnovers to nine against England in round three. Warren Gatland’s game-plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and Ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of Jamie Roberts and George North. Getting on the right side of referee Wayne Barnes will be key, because Halfpenny and Sexton are two of the world’s leading goal-kickers.","Ireland's iconic captain Paul O'Connell wins his 100th cap against Wales .

"Sepp Blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on Tuesday as one of his rivals for the FIFA presidency obtained some high-level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.' Blatter has three challengers for the presidency: Prince Ali, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo. Despite being heavily criticised during his reign, Sepp Blatter wants the presidency for a fourth term . Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'. Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing FIFA member Theo Zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 World Cup should be removed from Qatar if the Garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches. Zwanziger told Bayern 2 radio station: 'The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong decision. But that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke FIFA ethics rules.'","Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein is one of several candidates bidding to replace Sepp Blatter as president of world football's governing body .

"It is one of the most important rules of the road, always stop and look before pulling out at a junction. But this motorcyclist cut it a little too close as his bike crept out onto a main road, straight into the path of a speeding lorry. The terrifying footage, captured by a dashboard camera in Khabarovsk, Russia, shows the moment the man's bike is swept away under the wheels of the lorry – but the rider miraculously escapes with his life. The moped rider looks tentative from the start of the clip as he eventually makes his way to the front of the queue of cars . Captured at the start of the clip, the man on the moped appears to attempt braking as he reaches the junction but seems to lose control and move forward further than expected. The car, recording the footage from behind the bike, shows the moment it jumps forward, straight into the path of the oncoming lorry. Hitting the lorry’s back wheels, the bike is pulled away from underneath its rider as his head is thrown back violently by the impact. Suddenly the moped rider appears to lose control and speeds up, crashing into the side of the moving lorry . The moped’s top box is also hurled down the road by the lorry and more worryingly so is the man’s helmet, which becomes detached during the crash. As the bike lands mangled in front of the first car waiting at the junction, fuel begins leaking from it and onto the road. Remarkably however the man almost immediately appears from the wreckage and jogs back to the side road. The impact from the crash with the lorry forces the man's head backwards and throws the moped down the road . His t-shirt appears to be ripped and he throws himself down onto the floor as a pedestrian approaches him to see if he is okay.

"As the man charged with ensuring the finer details of England’s attacking game are in working order, it would have been understandable to find Mike Catt in a much darker mood than he was on Tuesday. Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far — and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship — Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . ‘Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,’ said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. ‘Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. ‘At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. ‘We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.’ Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England’s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster’s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England’s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: ‘We don’t control it. It’s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.’ England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship’s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England’s chances, despite Saturday’s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . ‘It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,’ he said. ‘We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. ‘We’re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It’s something we’ll work on. I don’t think there is any need to panic.’ VIDEO England v Scotland - extended highlights .

"High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne (pictured) announced a ‘wide-ranging review’ into crippling business rates . High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne announced a ‘wide-ranging review’ into crippling business rates. Introduced in Elizabethan times, the tax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business by charging punishingly high rates. High street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals because it is only charged on ‘bricks and mortar’. Business rates are forecast to raise £22.4billion in England in 2014-15, from 1.8million non-domestic properties. But the Chancellor announced a review into the controversial levy, saying ‘you cannot create jobs without successful businesses’. ‘In my opinion, the current system of business rates has not kept pace with the needs of a modern economy and changes to our town centres,’ he said. ‘It needs far-reaching reform.’ Business rates are currently calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses. But this is based on prices from 2008, the height of the property boom, which do not take into account the effect of the recession. The system also means some small shops on busy high streets pay very high rates, while online giants such as Amazon, with large warehouses in cheaper locations, pay less. Tax expert Richard Rose, of BDO accountants, said the review launch was ‘welcome but long overdue’, adding that ‘any benefits of change are unlikely to filter through until well into the next Parliament’. ‘It will, therefore, be a watching brief for some time yet, which will offer little respite for mid-market retailers who continue to feel the pain of rates set in 2008.’ Scroll down for video . 'Now the Budget's out of the way we can focus on serious issues like who's going to host top gear' Jules Winstanley, 51, who will pay £15,000 in business rates for her two clothing boutiques, in Bath and Teddington, south-west London, urged the review to radically reduce rates for small businesses. ‘We need a resurgence of help for independent shops so that we can compete fairly with the big boys,’ she added. ‘It is so expensive to have bricks and mortar and, if we don’t protect them … we will lose that service and face-to-face contact that you will never get online.’ Rain Newton-Smith, of the Confederation of British Industry, said the smallest businesses should be removed from the rates. The review began on Monday and retailers and organisations will be invited to give their opinions. But shops hoping for a large tax cut could be disappointed, as ministers have already warned any changes are likely to be ‘fiscally neutral’, meaning the Treasury would still generate the same amount of tax. Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust said it was ‘crucial’ that the review considers how the rates system can ‘better support small business owners who are struggling’. Last year, MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee suggested the business rates system should be ‘based on sales rather than the rateable value of a property’. A raft of measures were unveiled to appeal to young workers. The national minimum wage will increase by 20p an hour to £6.70 from October. This represents the largest increase, when adjusted for inflation, in almost ten years. The hourly rate for apprentices will also go up by a record 57p to £3.30 an hour. This will result in an annual salary rise of over £1,000 for a full-time apprentice and benefit 67,000 young people. The Government said this would ensure that ‘those undertaking this important type of training are rewarded’. Employers’ National Insurance contributions will also be abolished for under-21s from next month, and for young apprentices from April 2016. This will encourage more businesses to hire young workers. Budget documents revealed that more than two million people have started apprenticeships under the current Government. In the last year, the highest ever number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds also applied to, and were accepted into, university. George Osborne promised income-contingent loans of up to £25,000 for UK students studying for PhDs and research-based master’s degrees. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of The Sutton Trust, said: ‘The plans should improve the chances of low and middle income graduates taking on research master’s and doctoral courses which have become the preserve of better off students.’ Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium welcomed the boost for young workers. She said: ‘Over one million of the three million people who work in retail are under 24. ‘The abolition of national insurance contributions for under-21s will allow retailers of all sizes to create new job opportunities. ‘The industry also employs almost 20 per cent of the UK’s apprentices and abolishing national insurance contributions will make it easier and more cost-effective to employ and train them.’ Charlotte Balbier, 34, (pictured above) is a wedding dress designer who pays £28,000 in business rates per year. She welcomed the Government’s review of the rates, which she said should be lowered to keep small businesses thriving. The designer, of Heald Green, near Stockport, started her business in 2003 and stocks 40 shops across Europe. She has seen business rates rise steadily. The rates affect her own showroom, which occupies two floors of an office block, but also the shops on the high street which she relies upon to stock her dresses. ‘I would like to see lower business rates and less red tape,’ she said. ‘We supply 350 stores … and they are the shops on the high street who could really stand to benefit from a reduction in rates.’ £143-a-year tax break for 4.6million who work for themselves . The self-employed were given a £143-a-year tax break yesterday. The Chancellor announced the Government would axe a £2.75-a-week national insurance contribution (NIC) ‘in the next Parliament’, for the 4.6million who work for themselves. But it emerged the tax break could be a sweetener before a huge shake-up of NI, which funds benefits such as the State pension and maternity leave. The small print of the Budget revealed ministers were planning a ‘contributory benefit test’ – suggesting the self-employed may soon have to pay more for benefits such as the State pension. They usually pay two types of NIC – class 2, a weekly charge if profits are more than £5,885 a year, and class 4, an annual charge if profits are over £7,956. Mr Osborne made no mention of the new ‘test’ in his speech, saying only that he would be scrapping the unpopular class 2 NIC. The self-employed will continue to pay class 4, which is charged at either 2 or 9 per cent of profits depending on earnings. The class 2 tax, while not enormous, was seen as an administrative burden to pay weekly. Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust, said: ‘The scrapping of class 2 NICs will provide welcome relief for the self-employed, at least in the short term. ‘What this means for their level of pension and welfare entitlement in the long-term, however, needs to be examined.’ The self-employed traditionally pay less national insurance because they receive less in benefits, including the second State pension, sick pay and holiday pay. But, from April 2015, everyone will receive a flat-rate State pension irrelevant of contributions – which could put the self-employed at an unfair advantage. Ros Altmann, the Government’s older workers adviser, said yesterday: ‘It is possible the Government could off-set the tax break by asking [the self-employed] to contribute more towards the flat-rate State pension.’","Chancellor has announced a 'wide-ranging review' into business rates .

"New York City has spent $18 million in five years unclogging 'flushable' wet wipes from the sewer system. As the products have become increasingly popular, many manufacturers claim to have 'adapted' them to biodegrade when flushed. But the city's waste management directors have told the New York Times: that is not the case. 'Indestructible': Wet wipes branded as 'flushable' have been clogging up the system by twisting into knots . When the wipes twist into a knot and mix with grease or oil, they are 'really indestructible,' deputy commissioner Vincent Sapienza of the Department of Environmental Protection said. Worming their way into the pipes of homes, offices and public buildings, the wipes have doubled the amount of solid waste that needs to be extracted from water treatment plants. Dave Rousse, president of the wipes trade group, insisted to the Times that users are not flushing the products properly. Outrage: New York City's water waste management has spent $18 million on wet wipes in five years . His words have been slammed by city officials - and waste water managers around the country - who insist the wipes should be disposed of in the trash. The controversy could be solved by an experiment, backed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, that will test which wipes survive the entire sewage system. If so, under a new bill, the manufacturers would be ordered to remove the term 'flushable' from its packaging.","Wet wipes increasingly popular in New York, many branded as flushable .

"Eoin Reddan knows the Six Nations’ staggered final-day format leaves second-placed Ireland poised to be agonisingly pipped at the post in the same way as in 2007, but says they just need to deal with it. Ireland handsomely beat Italy eight years ago on the final Saturday of the tournament but France, playing last that day, went into their game knowing a 24-point win over Scotland would bag the title. They won by 27, a late try denying Eddie O’Sullivan’s side. Now it’s leaders England who have the scheduling advantage, as their game against France this weekend starts at 5pm following Ireland’s 2.30 kick-off in Scotland. Eoin Reddan (centre) knows his side are likely to miss out on the Six Nations title after defeat to Wales . However, Reddan accepts the rules are the rules, claiming it would be ‘crazy’ to be critical of the organisers just a few days before the curtain comes down on the 2015 campaign. ‘It is the way it is and it presents different challenges,’ said the back-up scrum half. ‘The teams that play early, they have got the mental battle of having to win the game and push on and the teams that play late have a target they can chase. ‘It’s a flip of a coin whether you say that makes it more interesting or less interesting. TV rights would probably make the conversation null and void, the amount of money TV provides for Six Nations. The fact that they all want to watch three games is probably the real answer and there is no other way they’re going to do it.’ VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . Irish players make a last ditch effort to get the ball over the line during the Six Nations clash in Cardiff . Reddan came off the bench in Rome in 2007, a day when long-serving hooker Rory Best and current assistant coach Simon Easterby started in the pack. Ireland were 34 points to the good with time almost up only for Denis Leamy to tap a penalty in the hope of adding to his team’s eight-try tally. Instead, they were turned over and Italy scored a converted try through Roland de Marigny to crucially help France’s cause. Reddan hasn’t forgotten its consequences. ‘I remember us conceding a try late on that lost us the trophy, which we shouldn’t have conceded. We should have beaten Italy by that extra bit and we would have won the trophy. Simon Zebo is upended during his sides' loss to Wales which ended their Grand Slam hopes . ‘It’s galling, but you do know the rules. You do know what time the games are on. ‘We’re not really stepping back trying to judge the competition because it’s not really going to change, is it? ‘Especially for me, a few days out from this one, to be reflecting that the competition is a bit “off” would be crazy. At the end of the day, we’re playing second and we’re going to have a job to do from the start and that job may change as the game goes on or it may not,’ added Reddan. ‘The way to win a title is probably not to think about a title,’ he added. ‘It’ s frustrating listening to us because you want to grasp on to the fact that we want to go and win the title and all that, but we have a responsibility where there is no margin for error, no margin for anything. Scott Williams (bottom) is congratulated by his Welsh team mates as they defeated Ireland last Saturday . ‘We can’t even live in that world (of title talk) so that is why we give you what we give you in terms of having to win the game first, because if you take your eye off that for a second there is no championship, there is no win. ‘Treating Scotland as if there isn’t a championship on the line is the key. Realising how good they are, realising their threats and treating them just as you would if this game didn’t need to be a points margin (win), treating them like that and keeping it on for the whole game. ‘There were games last year, like against Italy, which got us over the line in the overall. It was 12 points in the last three minutes. That is just about going and going and going again and not getting too carried away with the big picture, just doing your own little thing a bit harder, a bit faster and just keeping that mindset going all the time. ‘We have the responsibility of letting people dream and think big but our responsibility is to focus on the small little things and keep doing it to the end.’ Ireland need to better England's score by four points if they want to win the coveted Six Nations crown .","Eoin Reddan says his Ireland side know they're to be pipped to the title .

"An incredible finish produced two stoppage-time goals as Norwich came from behind for a second time to rescue a point. No sooner had James Vaughan put Huddersfield 2-1 in front than Canaries substitute Jamar Loza plundered a point with almost the last kick. Both goals came from close range. Vaughan was stupidly sent off after his, taking off his shirt in celebration to pick up a second yellow card within moments of each other. Jamar Loza celebrates after scoring an equaliser six minutes into injury time for Norwich City . Earlier, a goal disallowed after it had been awarded - and an amazing miss - beset Norwich in their top two challenge. But they rallied to challenge strongly for all three at one stage. Bradley Johnson was cautioned for handling the ball into the Huddersfield after referee Nigel Miller had signalled a goal from the Canaries first serious attack. Late in the first half Gary Hooper somehow failed to make clean contact with the ball, let alone bury a sitter from six yards. The young striker fires home after Graham Dorrans' original effort was saved by Alex Smithies . Huddersfield: Smithies; Smith, Hudson (c), Lynch, Scannell; Hogg, Coady, Butterfield, Carroll (Edgar - 70); Miller (Gobern - 78), Vaughan . Subs not used: Murphy, Wallace, Holmes, Charles, Majewski . Booked: Lynch . Red Card: Vaughan 95 . Goals: Miller 54, Vaughan 95 . Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker, Martin (c), Bassong, Olsson; Redmond, Howson (Loza - 87), Dorrans, Johnson (Hoolahan - 67); Hooper (Andreu - 78), Jerome . Subs not used: Rudd, Cuellar, Tettey, Odjidja-Ofoe . Booked: Johnson, Martin, Loza . Goals: Hoolahan 67, Loza 96 . In between times, Norwich were stretched to stay on terms in a lively contest and eventually fell behind to Ishmael Miller after the break. But substitute Wes Hoolahan slipped home from close range within five minutes of leaving the bench to round off a fine move triggered by Nathan Redmond. The Johnson no-goal was a big talking point. He knocked the ball in almost on the line after Cameron Jerome had headed goalwards from Redmond's fine run and cross. There was no flag from assistant referee Lisa Radhid but Miller was prompted to consult her amid strong Huddersfield protests. The upshot was a booking for Johnson whose team mate Jerome was later lucky to escape at least a yellow for clattering over Tommy Smith. James Vaughan, albeit a handful, failed with at least two chances to punish Norwich for whom keeper John Ruddy also denied Jacob Butterfield. Wesley Hoolahan (left) fires home the first equaliser just minutes after coming on as a substitute . But Miller struck with a smart turn on the edge of the box to smash home with Ruddy caught out of position. Jake Charles, 19 year old grandson of the great John Charles, was on the bench for Huddersfield in his first call up to the senior squad. Chris Powell's team were fighting a rearguard action in the last 20 minutes as a more fluent Norwich found their rhythm. Bradley Johnson (centre right) has a goal disallowed in the first half after handballing it into the net . The quick and clever Redmond was a constant source of danger down the right, forcing Town to substitute left back Jake Carroll. Clearly manager Alex Neil was in no mood to settle for a point as Norwich looked to climb from fifth place. Canaries appeals for a penalty were waved aside after Conor Coady was suspected of handling in the box. The Huddersfield players complain to the referee and Johnson was then booked for his handball .","Jamar Loza equalised for Norwich after 96 minutes to save a point .

"Arsenal need to challenge for the Premier League title within the next two seasons, according to former defender Nigel Winterburn. Although Arsene Wenger has guided the Gunners to  Champions League qualification for an impressive 17 consecutive seasons, the 2004 champions have arguably not mounted a serious tilt at the title for five years.

"Roy Hodgson must convince Saido Berahino that his international future is with England after the forward received an official approach from Burundi. Berahino, who has scored 16 times for West Brom in the Barclays Premier League this season, was called into the England squad for the first time in November. The striker was born in Burundi and a delegation of officials from the tiny country in south-east Africa have been courting him this week. Saido Berahino (left, in action for West Brom against Aston Villa) has impressed England boss Roy Hodgson . Berahino was called in to the senior England squad last November but is also wanted by his native Burundi . Burundi, 126th in the FIFA rankings, play Mauritius in a friendly on March 25 and want to name the West Brom forward in their squad. England’s head coach names his squad on Thursday for the Euro 2016 clash with Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley and the friendly in Turin against Italy four days later. Berahino has yet to represent the England team and he would still be permitted to switch nationalities under FIFA rules. Hodgson’s striking options have been swelled by the return from injury of Daniel Sturridge, along with regular forwards Danny Welbeck and England captain Wayne Rooney. Hodgson has already made it clear that he intends to select Tottenham forward Harry Kane when he names his squad at the national stadium next week.

"Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw admits the Dark Blues will be left red-faced if they do not end this year's RBS 6 Nations with a victory on Saturday. Vern Cotter's side have impressed in brief spells so far this campaign but have not done enough to beat France, Wales, Italy or England. They now round off their Championships by hosting the Irish at Murrayfield this weekend. Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw (centre) passes the ball during the Six Nations match against England . But with Joe Schmidt's team chasing their second Six Nations title on the spin, they will have to produce a stunning result to spare themselves their third whitewash in 11 years. Asked if it would be embarrassing for Scotland to finish bottom without a win, scrum-half Laidlaw said: 'Well yeah. We don't want to do that, do we? 'As players that is certainly not what we set out to do. 'But we have an opportunity this weekend to make sure we (don't finish with the Wooden Spoon). 'That's all we can do this year unfortunately. We will go out there and give absolutely everything to try and avoid (another defeat). 'It's a huge game for us but I know the boys are absolutely desperate to get out there, put in a good performance and come away with a win.' England's Geoff Parling (left) and Tom Youngs (right) challenge Scotland's Finn Russell at Twickenham . England centre Luther Burrell is tackled by Scotland's Rob Harley (left) and Jonny Gray (right) The Scots impressed so much during November's three-game series against Argentina, New Zealand and Tonga that there were genuine hopes they could perhaps mount a surprise title bid. But those ambitions now lie in tatters. The last-gasp 22-19 defeat to the Azzurri remains the lowest point of a black six weeks, but the clashes with France and Wales also saw big opportunities missed and self-inflicted mistakes prove costly. Laidlaw now hopes his men can at least stride away from the tournament with some pride intact and avoid the prospect of stumbling towards this year's World Cup with heads bowed. 'Where you finish is where you finish,' he said. 'You can't have any qualms about it. 'But we have a chance this weekend to make sure we don't finish bottom. We have got to do everything in our powers to make sure that doesn't happen. 'If we get a win here it gives us some momentum going forward to the World Cup and the four warm-up games.' Anthony Watson (left) charges past Scotland's Alasdair Dickinson (right) during the Six Nations clash . Scotland's David Denton (right) makes a charge down the wing but is upheld by Watson (left) The Scots sparkled for 20 minutes of the first half against England last weekend at Twickenham and even led the Auld Enemy 13-10 at the break. But they failed to build on that platform as Stuart Lancaster's men came back at them with a second-half barrage to claim 12-point win. Since that bruising second-half collapse, head coach Cotter has sat his men down and pointed out the same old mistakes that keep costing them. But Laidlaw insists those brutal home truths need to be told if the Scots are to improve. The Gloucester half-back said: 'Vern is an honest bloke - he doesn't miss when he swings. 'He's been honest but he's been good too. He's a clever coach and the boys appreciate that. 'The boys don't mind being told. We watched the game back and they saw themselves some of the flaws and that makes us frustrated. 'It really was the simple things we did well against England which allowed us to get on the front foot and take the lead. 'But we let them off the hook in the second half. We almost thought, 'Brilliant, we are in the lead, we have a chance'. We relaxed a couple of per cent and let England come back at us. That cost us the game.' The last time Ireland were welcomed into Edinburgh they were mugged 12-8 by Scott Johnson's side and Laidlaw believes the current Dark Blues could learn from that 2013 display. He said: 'Looking back to that game we just did little things well to stay in the game. 'That will be the key again this weekend. We need to get into their half, hold the ball, win penalties then get the scoreboard ticking over. Get three points, six points, maybe then a try. 'Once you start playing in their half, the game becomes so much easier.'

"Rob Kearney has vowed that the ‘real Ireland’ will roar into Murrayfield to try and salvage a Six Nations title win on Saturday, amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to Wales. Ireland face a major challenge to retain the championship with England enjoying a better points difference and Wales expected to run up a big total against Italy in Rome. However, the Welsh were left fuming on Monday night after it emerged there will be no trophy to present to Sam Warburton in the Stadio Olimpico even if it transpires after the final match of the day between England and France that the Welsh are champions. Rob Kearney has vowed that the ‘real Ireland’ will try to salvage a Six Nations title win . There are two Six Nations trophies and one will be in Murrayfield, and the other in Twickenham, a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some Welsh supporters. It will require a more coherent and less error-addled performance from Ireland to defeat the Scots, and Kearney did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team-mates. ‘This week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole, how we react after a very disappointing defeat,’ the full-back said. ‘We’ll see the real Ireland step up this week. A lot of us who underperformed last week know if we get the opportunity, [we have] to right a lot of those wrongs.’ Ireland’s message for the week appears to have been decided: they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless Scotland, but Kearney did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there. The impression was of players straining, impatient for their coaches to let slip the leash. Yet whether it is admitted or not, the sense in salting away as big a points difference as possible is evident given England’s superior figures and the fact that they are hosting underwhelming France. Wales will also be confident of eating into the Irish and English points’ advantage against Italy. ‘I think any time you get to the last game of a championship you can go and play a bit,’ said Kearney on the question of style. ‘When I say that, it’s important the wrong perception isn’t picked up here and that we’re going to chase this game and we’re going to try and build points, because we’re not,’ he quickly added. VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes - highlights . Ireland will need a more coherent and less error-addled performance to defeat Scotland . ‘But we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash. It’s important to get the win but how we do that will be no different to over the last three or four weeks.’ The Ireland style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game, and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by Schmidt in chasing the match last Saturday. That explained the dislocated moves close to the Wales line, goes this argument. ‘We have good confidence in our running game,’ said Kearney. ‘We were just getting a lot of value from our kicking game. If you launch up a ball and it travels 40 metres and you get it back, that is the equivalent of a 40-yard line break which is very hard to come by. ‘I think the other side of that is maybe we were chasing the game a bit from early so maybe we were forced to keep the ball in hand a little bit more and try and go after the game.’ They couldn’t do so, but there is little expectation of significant changes being made by Schmidt for the trip to Scotland. One of the rare positives to survive the journey to Wales was the fitness of the squad. Ireland were criticised for their poor performance in Six Nations defeat by Wales . No new casualties were sustained, and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the Millennium Stadium. Iain Henderson was the most dynamic of the subs used against Wales and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week, with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility. There have also been calls from some for the addition of Luke Fitzgerald to the replacements’ bench. Kearney admitted that when a team is changed it can sharpen the attention of everyone within the group. ‘It keeps everyone on their toes. I think every single player has been dropped at some stage in their career. It’s happened to the very best of guys. You’ve got new guys coming into the team and they bring a huge amount of energy and excitement because they’re finally getting their chance. ‘The guys who performed under par realise that maybe they have been given a second chance and they really need to pull their socks up. ‘I think when that does happen there can be some positives taken from it.’","Ireland looking to bounce back from defeat by Wales in Six Nations .

"Mauricio Pochettino wants to re-integrate Alex Pritchard into Tottenham's first-team squad next season. The 21-year-old has spent the season on loan at Championship side Brentford, impressing for Mark Warburton's side in their fight for promotion.

Alex Pritchard (left) has impressed while on loan at Championship side Brentford this season . The 21-year-old midfielder is likely to be given a chance in Tottenham's first-team next season . And White Hart Lane coaches believe Pritchard can become the next academy star to make an impact on the senior side from next season. Pochettino has helped nurture the careers of homegrown talent such as Harry Kane and Ryan Mason since his arrival last summer. And Pritchard, who has four England Under-21 caps, is in line to join Kane and Mason next season. Speaking earlier this month, Bees boss Warburton said: 'He can dominate a football. Alex is at his best with the ball at his feet. 'He sees a pass. He’s the best player I’ve seen in this division, certainly, to receive the ball on the half-turn at pace. Tottenham coaches believe Pritchard can follow in the footsteps of academy product Harry Kane . Brentford boss Mark Warburton thinks that Pritchard is capable of improving Tottenham's squad . 'Left or right side, he has the ability to take it on the half-turn and for us, how we play, that hurts the opposition. 'Technically he’s outstanding. For me, he is nailed on Premier League. 'I’d never be disrespectful enough to speak about what Spurs should do or could do with him.

"The thought may have occurred to Sam Robson that there has never been a better time to be an England Test specialist. As the nation rakes over the debris of yet another World Cup fiasco, the Test squad named on Wednesday for next month’s three-match series in the Caribbean will be depicted as English cricket’s chance to start the clean-up operation. And though the Australian-born Robson had his first taste of the big time last summer, he has not represented his adopted country since the Oval Test against India in August. Selection for the West Indies – for the first of 17 Tests in 10 months – will almost feel like starting afresh, all over again. Sam Robson (centre) is ready to battle for his England place after a mixed maiden summer in Test cricket . Robson celebrated his first England century in just his second Test as he scored 127 against Sri Lanka . Robson’s quest to resume his opening partnership with Alastair Cook will face competition if Jonathan Trott is deemed ready to resume his England career following his stress-related condition. But the prize is glittering on the horizon: the chance to help win back the Ashes this summer. ‘To play in an Ashes series would be massive for me,’ Robson told Sportsmail. ‘I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t super keen. But there are five Tests before then, and I’m hoping first and foremost to play in them.’ Robson’s first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the Test batting line-up that remains up for grabs. After scoring a composed century in only his second game for England, against Sri Lanka at Headingley, he began the series against India with a steady 59 at Trent Bridge. But his fortunes ebbed. Six more Test innings brought him a top score of 37. And, as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre Indian attack, he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits’ analysis. But Robson's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled . Robson tucks into the Indian bowling at Trent Bridge last July, but failed to notch a ton against the tourists . ROBSON . Tests: 7 . Innings: 11 . Runs: 336 . Batting average: 30.54 . Hundreds: 1 . Fifties: 1 . Top score: 127 (vs Sri Lanka) TROTT . Tests: 49 . Innings: 87 . Runs: 3763 . Batting average: 46.45 . Hundreds: 9 . Fifties: 18 . Top score: 226 (vs Bangladesh) Last summer, he was caught in the cordon five times, bowled four times and lbw twice. Experts made a simple diagnosis: Robson had a flaw around off stump. ‘It is something I’m conscious of,’ he said. ‘Knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial. I’ve worked on it just as I’ve worked on other areas of my game. But I’m not walking out there expecting never to nick another one. ‘I was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after I’d set myself a good base. But I still look back with pride on the 3-1 series win against India, and the Test hundred was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment. ‘There was a very welcoming culture in the dressing-room, which helped all the young guys coming in. After the disappointing loss to Sri Lanka, that helped us turn things round pretty quickly. I’m hungry if I get another chance to score some big runs.’ While many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the Caribbean have spent the last few months confirming England’s traditional struggle with 50-over cricket, Robson has been assiduously working on his game in South Africa with the ECB’s performance programme and the Lions. And he reserves special praise for the coaching of Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe. ‘I’ve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible, especially from guys who have played lots of Test cricket, and then apply it to my own game,’ he said. ‘In the end you’ve got to work things out for yourself. Jonathan Trott could be ready to resume his England career, which would pile pressure on Robson's place . The 25-year-old opener has been able to learn from Andrew Strauss and Chris Rogers at Middlesex . ‘Andy talks a lot about your approach to batting – how to score runs, as opposed to just technique. If he notices something technical, he’ll say it. But he doesn’t just say stuff for the sake of it. He likes to keep things simple. Graham Thorpe is the same. They spot things, but they don’t go on and on.’ Only 25, Robson has already been privileged to open with Andrew Strauss and Australia’s Chris Rogers at Middlesex, as well as Cook last summer – that’s 50 Test centuries’ worth of experience to learn from at the other end. ‘My game’s in good order,’ said Robson, who is currently in Abu Dhabi for a spot of pre-season training with Middlesex. ‘I’ve had enough cricket over the winter to work on it, and I feel refreshed. I feel ready to go and really hopeful of getting picked in the squad. I just want to get out there and do the job.’","England are set to name their Test squad for West Indies tour .

"Zafar Ansari and Mark Wood could be beneficiaries of the uncertainty around an England Test squad whose reputation has been left in tatters by the World Cup. Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes ahead of Wednesday’s naming of the party for a three-Test series against the West Indies that Peter Moores desperately needs to win if he is to remain England coach. Moeen and Woakes were injured towards the end of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first Test in Antigua on April 13 that follows two warm-up games in St Kitts. Zafar Ansari could be named as part of the England squad ahead of the three-Test series against West Indies . The 23-year-old is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey . The 23-year-old Zafar Ansari is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey. IS HE ANY GOOD? Just ask Kevin Pietersen! So often a victim of left-arm spin, the former England batsman was dismissed by a 19-year-old Ansari as Cambridge University beat Surrey by 10 wickets in 2011. Ansari has 54 first-class wickets and a batting average of 30.16. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW? Ansari would probably be among the smarter cricketers in England’s tour party, having studied politics at Cambridge. He admits he is often ribbed by his team-mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room. That means Surrey’s left-arm spin-bowling all-rounder Ansari and Durham pace bowler Wood could be named to travel with the squad as cover for Moeen and Woakes in the early days of the month-long tour. Ansari, 23, is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to Moeen on the circuit. Wood impressed England’s outgoing fast bowling coach David Saker during a training camp in South Africa before Christmas and only fitness concerns have held the 25-year-old back from full international recognition. It seems certain that Jonathan Trott, now returned to full fitness after leaving England’s last Ashes tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety, will return after a successful tour of South Africa as Lions captain. England’s Test middle order is settled following the success of Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell in the three successive victories over India last summer, leaving Trott to battle Sam Robson to become Alastair Cook’s opening partner. Mark Wood (centre) could also be included in England's test squad to face the West Indies . Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali (pictured) ahead of the Test series . Peter Moores desperately needs England to defeat the West Indies if he is to remain coach . Cook, sacked as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup, returns to action for MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi starting on Sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by England in Test cricket last summer. Jonny Bairstow, one of the casualties of the fall-out from the last Ashes, is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of Kent’s exciting Sam Billings, while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell will compete for the other spin place. Rashid, a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the England squad prematurely in 2009, looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the Lions in South Africa and may now be pipped by the more reliable Tredwell. Such is the desperate state of English cricket after the World Cup that the pressure will be on not just Moores but also managing director Paul Downton when England take on a West Indies side who look sure to be weakened by the Indian Premier League. Chris Gayle, for one, is likely to retire from international cricket after the World Cup and West Indies should be even more vulnerable than England.

"Spanish newspaper Marca has criticised the BBC over an article that claimed the publication had launched 'a vicious attack' on Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale. The BBC published an article last week with the headline 'Gareth Bale: The 'Lazy loner' under fire at Real Madrid' which alleged Marca had been overly critical of Bale as a way of attacking Real club president Florentino Perez. Marca has reacted furiously, defending its coverage of Bale and hitting out at the BBC in an article entitled 'Hooligans on the BBC'. Gareth Bale was the subject of an article on the BBC entitled: 'The 'Lazy loner' under fire at Real Madrid' The article alleged Marca had been critical of Bale as a way of attacking club president Florentino Perez .

'Something that apparently can no longer be said of the BBC who, like ITV, seem now to be all about drama.'

Marca's statement continued: 'These comments are wholly unfounded and unjust - all the information published (in Marca) about Bale had been duly sourced and corroborated - but they also twisted things out of context. 'This is because the analysis of Bale featured in (the BBC) piece was just one part of some 20 pages of coverage over two days last week looking at Real Madrid's struggles, in which other individuals and problems related to the team as a whole were discussed at length.' A BBC spokesperson said: 'We stand by the original story written by our Spanish football writer, Andy West, and it's difficult to see the relevance of some of the comments in the responding Marca article.'

"Wales head coach Warren Gatland says that prop Samson Lee's World Cup prospects are '50-50' after he was injured during last Saturday's RBS 6 Nations victory over Ireland. Gatland has confirmed that Lee, who was carried off just 14 minutes into the Ireland game, suffered a full rupture of his Achilles. Ospreys prop Aaron Jarvis will replace him for next Saturday's Six Nations appointment with Italy in Rome, with loosehead Rob Evans taking over from Gethin Jenkins, who has a hamstring problem. Gatland said: 'We were hoping he (Lee) was going to have surgery on Monday, but there was too much swelling, and it has been put back a week. Wales will be missing props Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee when they take on Italy in Rome on Saturday . 'He is a 50-50 chance for the World Cup, but we are confident he has enough time to get back and be available for the World Cup. 'If things go well, he will not be far away.' Evans and Jarvis will line up against Italy, while there are call-ups on the bench for hooker Ken Owens, props Rhys Gill and Scott Andrews and scrum-half Gareth Davies, with Mike Phillips missing out. Owens features among the substitutes instead of Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard, who had been following return-to-play protocols after taking a blow to his head during the Ireland game. Saracens forward Gill, meanwhile, gains a match-day place after only joining the squad for training on Monday, while Davies - a livewire operator and consistent try-scorer for the Scarlets - gets his chance instead of the hugely-experienced Phillips.

In terms of the starting line-up, it will be Evans' full Wales debut after he went on as a replacement for Jenkins at half-time last Saturday, with Jarvis continuing instead of Lee. Wales will head to the Stadio Olimpico lying third in the Six Nations table behind England and Ireland on points difference. A comprehensive victory over Italy, though, would turn up the heat on their title rivals, with Ireland tackling Scotland at Murrayfield next Saturday, followed by England hosting France at Twickenham. Ospreys prop Aaron Jarvis has also been called up as a replacement as Wales look to win the RBS 6 Nations . Gatland added: 'It was great to get the result we wanted in front of our home supporters last weekend and to give us a chance going into the last round of action. 'Obviously, it's disappointing for Gethin and Samson, but Rob and Aaron stepped up well last weekend and we expect the same on Saturday. 'The challenge to us is to go to Italy and win, and try to win by a significant margin, but we know that's an extremely tough ask and the first job will be to simply get the result. Jenkins (right) joins Wales team-mate Aaron Jarvis in tackling Ireland's Jamie Heaslip on Saturday . 'Italy build their confidence around the scrum and lineout drive, and that is an area we are going to have to compete strongly in at the start of the match.' Wales have won five of their previous seven Six Nations visits to Rome, highlighted by a 38-8 victory in 2005.

"The first two-footed challenge went in from Jose Mourinho when he claimed Paris Saint-Germain’s kickers were a refined version of Shrewsbury Town. It was a razor-sharp comment, designed to rile the French champions and put down a marker for Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers ahead of the second leg. Sometimes this stuff bites you on the backside. Mourinho will be picking the bones out of this for days because they were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this PSG team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was dismissed for this tackle on Oscar, leaving PSG without their talisman . Chelsea players react as referee Kuipers pulls the red card from his pocket . The crestfallen Swede was shown a straight red to light the touchpaper on a tetchy European tie . There was a minor victory for Chelsea, with the foul count showing that Mourinho’s team had committed 24 to the visitors’ 17 at the end of 120 chaotic minutes here at Stamford Bridge. The reality is that they were beaten at their own game. For PSG to do it with 10 men in extra-time, after the ludicrous dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the 32nd minute, is an even mightier achievement. The PSG striker pointed at his battle scars as he left the pitch, well aware that the reaction of Chelsea’s players to the collision with Oscar had helped Kuipers with the decision. ‘I spoke to him and he told me he didn’t mean it,’ admitted Mourinho. The pair are close from his time at Inter. After surrounding Kuipers, Chelsea’s players called for the physio and team doctor to sprint on to tend to the stricken Oscar. Predictably, within minutes, he was back on his feet. It is to Ibrahimovic’s credit that he left the field with dignity and composure, walking towards the tunnel and ignoring the clamour from the stands for a reaction. ‘When the red card happened, the worst thing was the Chelsea players — I felt there were 11 babies around me,’ admitted an understandably aggrieved Ibrahimovic. David Luiz engaged in some gamesmanship, attempting to get Costa in trouble . Jose Mourinho chats with former charge David Luiz after Ibrahimovic's sending off as Laurent Blanc looks on . It was a brutal but fair assessment of the moment that could easily have turned this tie in Chelsea’s favour. There were feuds everywhere: David Luiz versus Diego Costa, Chelsea’s substitute keeper Petr Cech versus PSG midfielder Marco Verratti, Verratti against the world. At every turn, someone, somewhere on the field at Stamford Bridge was rowing with somebody. Costa could start a fight in an empty phone box, never mind an 18-yard box, gnawing away at everyone and everything during an ill-disciplined performance up top for Chelsea. This guy is really stewing at the minute. He has gone a season without scoring in the Champions League and will have to wait until September to get going again in this competition. Luiz got inside his head, jabbering away at him in their native Brazilian-Portuguese tongue in an attempt to destabilise the forward. Costa, as we know, has only mastered one language. The Chelsea striker should have been sent off here — several times, as it happens — for his innumerable transgressions. He really is an angry man. David Luiz feels the force of retribution from Diego Costa after the pair regularly crashed at Stamford Bridge . An outraged Costa reacts histrionically after Kuipers waved away his penalty appeal . In the same motion he could have been booked and sent off when he caught Maxwell from behind close to the touchline of the East Stand and then appeared to accept the challenge from Luiz to graze his forehead. He escaped with a yellow card. There was another escape, this time when he shoved over the excellent Marquinhos in a fit of pique. Quite how he survived is a story in itself. He lives life on the edge, claiming he had been elbowed by Luiz in a hit-and-run job. It was an off-the-ball incident, retribution by the former Chelsea defender after he had collided with the pugnacious forward earlier in the first half. He was throwing punches a few moments later, hitting the ground repeatedly after he was denied a clear penalty when Edinson Cavani took him out as he made his way into the area. These are the fine lines of European football, with every challenge, skirmish and wrangle potentially punishable with an on-the-spot sanction from these notoriously pernickity officials. John Terry battles for the ball with Edinson Cavani as the duo battle for possession at Stamford Bridge . Costa falls to the turf after a challenge from Thiago Silva during a bad-tempered affair in west London . Mourinho convinced us that Blanc had put the French champions on a diet of raw meat ahead of this second leg. This will eat away at him for months to come. ‘I need to go away and think about how this happened,’ admitted Mourinho. Perhaps next time, he should keep both feet on the floor.","Chelsea were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this PSG side .

Manuel Pellegrini's side travel to the Nou Camp having been beaten 2-1 at the Etihad three weeks ago with a place in the last eight of the competition at stake.

"Juventus travel to face Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night knowing that if they do not score, their German opponents can knock them out with a single goal. So the message is clear: they must attack. Head coach Massimiliano Allegri has spoken out ahead of the game urging his team to show they are far from the side cast as 'boring' that lead Italy's Serie A - and the Italian sport newspapers have reflected the boss' vision. La Gazzetta dello Sport, Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport all call for the nation's champions to attack Dortmund, with a forward line including Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang unlikely to be restricted to an extent that they are unable to score the one goal that could send Dortmund through after Juve's 2-1 home win last month. La Gazzetta dello Sport's: 'Go Juve! The right choice' and Tuttosport's: 'The order of Allegri: Let's attack!' Corriere dello Sport's front page barks out: 'Juve, take Europe' after Massimiliano Allegri's comments . Tuttosport's message is the most resounding, with their front page specifically calling for Juve to attack at the Signal Iduna Park making it clear that in order to qualify, the Old Lady need goals. The paper also calls for Argentine winger Roberto Pereyra to be used in a 4-3-1-2 system by Allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract. Both Gazzetta and Corriere look to Juventus' talisman, former Manchester City and Manchester United striker, Carlos Tevez. Gazzetta also want to see Pereyra deployed in a 4-3-1-2 behind Tevez and Alvaro Morata in a game that could be worth £6.5million to Juve. Carlos Tevez trains ahead of the last-16 tie, and the Italian papers see him as a key man for Juventus . Paul Pogba takes a moment away from the training session as Juventus look to hold on to their lead . Meanwhile, Corriere calls for the 'class of Tevez and super defence to tackle Klopp'. 'We go into the game with an advantage,' Allegri said ahead of the game. 'We know the difficulties of the task ahead of us, no doubt about it. 'I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great.' Allegri believes the game in Dortmund will not end 0-0 and that his side will need to find a way to score . Alvaro Morata hits a pass during training, and Gazzetta dello Sport want him upfront alongside Tevez . The Germans have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the Bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games. They are also unbeaten at home in Europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. 'We have to be ready for the strengths of Dortmund, their speed, their pressure,' the Italian coach added. 'We have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses.' The Italian papers called for Tevez to lead the attack at the Signal Iduna Park while Juve's defence holds firm . Roberto Pereyra (second right) is seen as a key man by the Italian papers, who want him deployed in a 4-3-1-2 .","Juventus travel to Borussia Dortmund in their last-16 tie second leg .

"Sami Khedira 'would not help any team' according to Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer, because injuries have ruined his physical attributes. Khedira's contract at Real Madrid expires this summer, and the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool have been linked with the World Cup winner. But Beckenbauer was scathing about the German's value, after a season in which he has been dogged by injuries and started just four league games for Real Madrid. Sami Khedira returned to Champions League action last week, but has not been a Real Madrid regular . Khedira has had injury problems since winning the World Cup with Germany last summer in Brazil . 'In his current physical shape Khedira would not help any team forward,' Beckenbauer told Sky. 'He is missing something in each aspect of the game at the moment.

"Respect for officials may not always be at the levels the referees would hope, but Fiorentina seem to have taken it further than most during their game against AC Milan on Tuesday. 'La Viola' players were in the middle of a startling comeback win, and held the momentum with five minutes to go having just equalised through Gonzalo Rodriguez, when referee Carmine Rosso halted the game to get treatment.

However, the Fiorentina stars took no notice, continuing to attack with no referee on the pitch, until the official, rather angrily, had to forcefully bring the move to the end with several short blasts on his whistle. Eventually the men in purple realised what was going on and stopped so that Rosso could be replaced, in an incident similar to Chris Foy's injury during Arsenal's win over West Ham this weekend. However, the stoppage did little to interrupt Vincenzo Montella's side, as just moments later Joaquin scored a header to put them in front and secure a superb come from behind win.

"Gareth Bale has nothing to prove to Wales, according to his international manager Chris Coleman. The world's most expensive player has come in for sustained criticism during his second season at Real Madrid, but Coleman said: 'I think I'd be on dangerous ground if I said to Baley: 'I need a bit more from you.'' Coleman spoke after naming his squad featuring Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams. Sam Vokes was also called up for the first time in 12 months following his serious knee injury.

Bale could be handed a free role should Vokes feature at centre-forward in the key Euro 2016 qualifying clash in Israel, but Coleman suggested any appearance would be from the bench. Coleman said the Burnley striker, who contributed significantly to their 1-0 win over Manchester City, needs 'a little bit more' action before he is considered match-fit. Coleman believes Bale can benefit from being back among his Wales colleagues. 'There us not much more we can ask of Baley, he keeps coming and giving what he' s got,' said Coleman. 'It's not just his performances it's his body language. Wales boss Chris Coleman is not worried about his star player, saying he has' nothing to prove' The world's most expensive player celebrates scoring for Wales against Cyprus in October . 'He's got no points to prove to us. His fight in Madrid and what he has to prove every time he goes on the pitch is separate from us.' Coleman said Bale was 'caught in the middle' at Real but 'will come through'. 'People say he's had a bad season but Real are in the quarter finals of the Champions League, still with a chance of La Liga, and he has scored 16 goals and god knows how many assists. I have no worries about him, he's the last person I'm worried about.' Burnley striker Sam Vokes (right) has been called up by his national team for the first time . Coleman hopes Aaron Ramsey can continue the form he showed after coming on against Monaco . Coleman hopes Ramsey can continue for Wales where he left off for Arsenal in Monaco. 'He scored a good goal but Rambo at his best dictates the tempo of the game, he did that when he came on,' said Coleman. 'In fairness the last few games for us he's been a little bit quiet. But he's fit at the minute, let's get past this weekend and hope when we go to Israel he is at his best and running the game for us. When he is like that he gives us a great chance.'

"The contest was effectively over before it began. With two minutes and 39 seconds on the clock, Shakhtar Donetsk defender Olexandr Kucher received the quickest red card in Champions League history before Thomas Muller converted the resulting penalty.

Mario Gotze burst into the Shakhtar penalty area after he being released by Franck Ribery's slick first time pass before Kucher went to ground. The contact was minimal but enough to fell the World Cup-winner. Muller made no mistake from 12 yards after the defender had harshly been brandished with a red card. The hosts had to wait 30 minutes before doubling the lead as Robert Lewandowski, who should have scored, hit the post before Andriy Pyatov denied Ribery with a smart stop. But the Ukrainian outfit's resistance was finally broken again on 34 minutes. Former Manchester City defender Boateng tapped home from a yard out after Pyatov had saved at Lewandowski's feet.

"An own goal and late strike from Dominic Solanke booked Chelsea a place in the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League as Atletico Madrid were swept aside at the club’s Cobham training base. John Terry stayed behind after training to watch on the sideline as the teenagers showed Chelsea’s first team how to progress in Europe ahead of their Champions League last-16 second leg match at home to PSG on Wednesday. Adi Viveash’s team could now face an intriguing all-English last four encounter with Manchester City at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, if Patrick Vieira’s young charges win away to Roma next week.

Subs: Perez, Rodriguez, Montoro,  Spoljaric, Prieto, Altamirano, Gama . Goals: Nil . After a tight opening half, the Blues finally broke the resistance of their Spanish opponents after 38 minutes when defender Fran Manzanara could only guide Izzy Brown’s effort into the net. They then mounted a Jose Mourinho-esque rearguard action to keep their opponents at bay through the second period before Solanke struck on the counter-attack to settle it two minutes from time. Atletico had eliminated Arsenal in the previous round and arrived in sunny Surrey seeking to pile the misery on another English opponent. Viveash was taking no chances, fielding a full-strength team containing Brown and Solanke, both tipped by Mourinho for bright futures, the talented Frenchman Jeremie Boga and England under-19 star Charlie Colkett. Charlie Colkett (left) finds himself shielding the ball from Saeid Ezatolahi Afagh . After a quiet start in which both teams tested one another out, Chelsea had the first chance on 25 minutes when Boga sent a free-kick spiralling over Carlos Marin’s crossbar. Just when it appeared the opening 45 would end without score, Brown broke free down the left channel and outpaced the Atletico defence. Colkett found him with the ideal through ball and Brown directed it past the goalkeeper. With Andreas Christensen charging in to make sure, the under-pressure Manzanara got an unfortunate final touch to help it in. Brown will certainly want to claim the goal, his third goal of this season’s European campaign. Atletico were much improved after the break, dictating the tempo and starting the create opening. Amath Diedhiou, who scored the last 16 winner against Arsenal, fired in a near post effort that Bradley Collins diverted around the post. Victor Mendiondo (left) wins a header for the Spanish side, while Dominic Solanke rose highest (right) Shortly afterwards, Matija Spoljaric sent a bouncing shot narrowly wide as Chelsea’s goal came under threat. But their defence refused to be breached and, in classic Chelsea style, they grabbed a second on the break in the dying moments. Christensen, playing in midfield rather than his normal defensive position, showed his creative instincts with a fine pass to Solanke and the England under 18 international applied the finish. Remarkably, it is his ninth goal in the Youth League this season. Chelsea are the first to book their place in the semi-finals, which take place across the road from UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on April 10.

"England could recall two Lions forwards to their starting line-up as they prepare to step into the path of a juggernaut at Twickenham on Saturday — driven by France’s ‘big dudes’ up front. Stuart Lancaster’s team are bracing themselves for a fearsome onslaught in the latest instalment of ‘Le Crunch’ as they aim to clinch the RBS 6 Nations title and there is a significant chance they could turn to hooker Tom Youngs and lock Geoff Parling. Lifted by their win over Italy in Rome on Sunday, Philippe Saint-Andre’s French side will come to London with a monster pack and orders to grind English ambition into the earth. Yet the home forward unit, marshalled by Graham Rowntree, have stood toe-to-toe with all-comers and trumped most rivals in recent years, even if their dominance of the close-quarters combat has not always brought the deserved results. England forward Courtney Lawes described the French pack as 'big dudes' Along with Youngs and Parling, flanker Tom Wood is another established figure pushing hard for a place in the starting XV. One man who will be at the forefront of the home resistance is Northampton lock Courtney Lawes, whose comeback from injury against Scotland was a resounding personal triumph. He was laid back on Monday when considering the magnitude of a title decider. When asked about his French counterparts Yoann Maestri and Alexandre Flanquart, he said: ‘They’re big dudes. It’ll be an interesting game.’ It will be interesting for those who relish a thunderous encounter and Lawes is certainly in that category. He added: ‘I’ve played against many French sides. They’re always physical. Obviously we’ve got to stay with them and show them they can’t just roll over us. Then we can play some good rugby, get them moving around us and hopefully our fitness will tell come the end.’ VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win .

England packs don’t make a habit of bending the knee to any opponents at home.

We’ve got a great pack, very dynamic, and we’ve got a lot of different things we can do which is great. We certainly don’t expect to get pushed around. ‘Physicality is a massive part of the game for French sides and it’s going to be a big challenge up front — something we’ve got to match, at least.’ Danny Cipriani passes the ball during England's training session at Pennyhill Park Hotel in Surrey .

(prop, 5 caps) The heaviest of the lot, New Zealand-born Antonio is 6ft 5in and tips the scale at a whopping 24st 6lb! Lancaster is well aware of the heavyweight threat. Many of the biggest visitors are likely to be substitutes unleashed in the second half in an attempt to blast through a tiring England defence — giants such as Vincent Debaty (19st), Romain Taofifenua (20st) and centre Mathieu Bastareaud (19st). ‘They are a huge team; very powerful and rely a lot on the bench at around 50 minutes — guys like (Benjamin) Kayser and Debaty,’ said the head coach. ‘It will be interesting to see if Bastareaud starts. He adds a huge physical presence to their back line. They are big and athletic.’ Asked if England are equipped to withstand the battering, he added: ‘Yeah, I think so. There is enough power.’ England also need enough points to seal the title but will not worry about chasing elusive targets, at least initially. ‘If we start obsessing about the scoreline, then we’re not going to win the game,’ said Lancaster.","Stuart Lancaster's side beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham last Saturday .

"CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's full interview with Daniel Sturridge by Chief Sports Writer Oliver Holt. The Liverpool striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Daniel Sturridge describes himself as a 'very closed-off person' but here in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail he opens up about his life on-and-off the field. As the Reds prepare for Monday's Premier League trip to Swansea, the 25-year-old striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Here, Sportsmail gathers the best 10 quotes from our Sturridge interview. Daniel Sturridge tells Sportsmail his thoughts on Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and his injury problems . Sturridge on Mario Balotelli . 'In football you meet people who are cool guys and he is one of those guys. He is a young guy who just wants to live his life. Anyone at the age of 24, if you put a microscope on them for a few months and see how they are living, it would probably be far worse than Mario. He is a normal guy. Footballers are put on a pedestal of not being human but we are just normal people. I am a normal dude.' Mario Balotelli (left) has been described as a 'cool guy' by Sturridge, despite a difficult start at his new club . Sturridge on Steven Gerrard . 'This guy is a living legend. Words can't describe what he has done not just for the club but for the players as well. He helps players settle in, young players. He takes them under his wing. We will never be able to repay him for that. His stature and his demeanour will be very difficult to replace but we have to. It will take time. That guy will always be a legend in my eyes. I am in awe of him now.' Sturridge (right) has hailed departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) as a 'living legend' of the club . Sturridge on strikers . 'Why am I watching someone else's glories and achievements? It doesn't matter to me who comes around or what players are about. It means nothing to me. When you watch other people, you don't get anywhere in life because you are at war with yourself. Well done to Harry Kane and what he has achieved, but I am not watching what he is doing. I just believe in me.' Harry Kane has had a scintillating  season at Tottenham scoring 26 goals in all competitions so far . Sturridge on England injury . 'Regardless of what happened in the past, I love playing for England,’ says Sturridge. ‘That situation occurred and it’s in the past. I don’t want to dwell on it. People pick injuries up and they are unfortunate. It just so happened I got injured that day. It’s life. People get injured sometimes. It is what it is.' Sturridge's five-month injury lay-off began when he damaged thigh muscles while on England duty last year . Sturridge on Roy Hodgson . ‘My relationship with the England manager is top class. No worries at all. We speak via text. We speak to each other. We keep in touch. Throughout my injury, he kept in touch. I would never blame him for this. Never. Or any of the staff - it was just an unfortunate incident. I have got so much respect and admiration for him and his set-up. The relationship is very, very good.' Despite the injury, Sturridge (right) says his relationship with England manager Roy Hodgson as 'top class' Sturridge on his personal life . 'I'm a very closed-off person,' says Sturridge. 'I can count my friends on one hand. Everyone has acquaintances, workmates and so on, but apart from that, I just have my family and a close-knit group of people around me. 'Why closed-off? I think it is down to childhood. When you grow up in certain environments, you can't be too loud or too open because you can be exposed to things you don't want to be exposed to. Where I grew up there was crime and there were other things.' Despite his extrovert celebration, the 25-year-old striker describes himself as a 'very closed-off person' Sturridge on Birmingham gang culture . 'There was a gang culture when I was growing up in Birmingham. It was easy to stay away from it because the football was there but that’s the reason why I have never been open. 'It becomes second nature to be like that. I had to be wary. At all times. 'The gang stuff wasn’t based on colours - it was more about areas. You might be a family friend of someone who was involved with something. I was never involved in anything like that and I enjoyed growing up there.' Sturridge on faith . 'I am grateful to God for everything that I have had in the past and everything I will have in the future,' he says. 'You have setbacks, you have comebacks, you have glories, you don't have glories. Not everything is going to be rosy and sweet all the time. There are going to be times in your life when you go through certain situations that test your character, test your courage, test your faith, test your self-belief, test everything.' Sturridge grew up in Hockley in the inner city Birmingham where he kept to himself to himself as a child . Sturridge on USA injury rehabilitation routine . 'I am getting up at 7am and I am finishing at 4 or 5pm. I’m tired. It’s dark by then. The sun’s not out. I went back to my room, ate. Then I played some dominoes and went to bed.' Sturridge on his dream dinner date with four sportsmen . 'Muhammad Ali, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Diego Maradona. I prefer Pele to Maradona as a player but I’d have Maradona for the laughs.' Argentina great Diego Maradona (centre) would be included in Sturridge's dream sportsmen dinner date .","Daniel Sturridge talks about his Birmingham upbringing and gangs .

"UEFA president Michel Platini is preparing a crackdown on bad behaviour by players in a bid to eradicate the intimidation of officials from European competitions. Platini fears future generations of footballers and fans will be put off the game by scenes such as those of nine Chelsea players pressuring Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off PSG’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Unlike the FA, UEFA do not have specific guidelines covering incidents of crowding the referee or a system of punishments, but they are looking into it. Michel Platini (left) during the UEFA Euro 2016 Steering Committee Meeting in Lyon on Thursday . UEFA spokesman Pedro Pinto said: ‘The UEFA president has recently been more concerned about the behaviour of players on the pitch. 'We would like to see an environment where players would accept the decisions taken and where they would not employ the tactic of pressure and intimidation of the officials during the game. ‘There is a strong interest internally to look at specific initiatives and campaigns, and possibly regulations that would have an impact on the behaviour of players. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . ‘It is not a good example for fans, for future players or for the image of the game.’ The FA have the power to fine clubs if they are guilty of mass confrontation or intimidating the match officials. Chelsea admitted a charge of surrounding referee Jon Moss during a game against Everton earlier this month and were warned about their future conduct.

"A butcher whose countryside estate began running short of rabbits started selling squirrel - and the meat has proved so popular it sold out in three hours. Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk is restricted to the numbers of rabbits it can shoot every month due to plummeting numbers and added the unusual delicacy to its menu in a bid to replace stocks. The free range squirrel is white in texture and is said to have a similar taste to rabbit while being low in fat. Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk have added squirrel to their menu after their levels of rabbit starting running low. The unusual delicacy became so popular with customers it sold out in three hours . James Holliday, forestry and conservation manager at the estate, said: 'Rabbits are no longer breeding 'like rabbits'. 'Nationally, numbers have been in decline over the past few years and have now reached such low numbers we are limiting the number killed in order to maintain a sustainable population. 'The population had been decreasing since the 1950s and it has become increasingly important for us to conserve as many rabbits as possible. 'We have been catching the squirrels for a while now but obviously the reduction of rabbits made us think we could use them as a substitute and it has done very well.' The meat is being used in a variety of recipes by the estates customers, including a squirrel pasty (pictured) Richard Howard, food shop manager at the estate, said squirrel meat could be a healthy addition to diets. He said: 'Squirrel from Elveden is wild, nutritious and has virtually zero food miles, coming straight from the estate itself, making for a highly ethical mix.'

"Paul Scholes believes Manchester United must spend big again this summer if Louis van Gaal's tactics are to bring success to Old Trafford. United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks. And former United midfielder Scholes, who has two season tickets at his old club, is unconvinced that Van Gaal's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad. Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Ashley Young during Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected at Old Trafford . Arsene Wenger was right! I would have loved to have played with Mesut Ozil... but only if he always performed like he did at Old Trafford . Writing in his column for The Independent, Scholes said: 'Watching United at Old Trafford on Monday, I know what Louis van Gaal is trying to do with this team. I do like the concept. I just question whether he has the players to do it. 'In recent weeks, Van Gaal has tried what I would describe as a more Barcelona-style approach to games. His centre backs push wide, the full backs push on and the team pass the ball. It has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides, starting with Spurs and the high-pressing game they play, that you have to wonder whether it will be found out. 'To play this way, you really need to be exceptional. Barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years. United have spent around £220m in the last three transfer windows and yet I would question whether they have the players to operate this system.' Van Gaal has been criticised for utilising Fellaini's height and physical presence at times this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer . United were known for their relentless attacking under Sir Alex Ferguson and Scholes, who was an integral part of the Scot's midfield, wants to see fluid football back at Old Trafford. 'I understand what Van Gaal is trying to do,' Scholes wrote. 'I like that he is playing with the wide players. I also know that as former players we cannot harp on about the old days for ever. Things change, although I believe that certain principles, of attacking, entertaining football, should always be protected. 'Like any other match-going fan – I have two season tickets for Old Trafford – I want to see the team play well and win. I just don’t think this system is the best for these players.' Angel di Maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a £60million deal from Real Madrid . Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself out of favour under Van Gaal in recent months . Van Gaal's men are fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham but they could drop out of the Champions League places if they suffer defeat and rivals Liverpool win at Swansea on Monday night. Despite the club's precarious position, Scholes is adamant that the Dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window. He added: 'I still believe that Van Gaal is the right man for the job. I don’t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play. He is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football. But I am afraid to say that if he wants to play this Barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it.'","Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal is trying to play a 'Barcelona style'

"West Ham goalkeeper Adrian produced an outstanding performance against Arsenal on Saturday even though he was playing with a dislocated finger. His team lost 3-0 but the Spaniard produced a string of outstanding saves from Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Alexis Sanchez and then from Danny Welbeck in the last minute to prevent his team from a heavier defeat. And assistant manager Neil McDonald revealed afterwards that Adrian had dislocated his finger in the warm up but had insisted on playing on. Hammers keeper Adrian threatened to spoil Arsenal's afternoon with a succession of fine first half saves . McDonald said: ‘He’s been a brave lad today because he could easily have pulled out.

"If you like the idea of having a conversation with your pet cat then you better look away now. Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline. In the clip is Penny Adams, a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the Cat Shoppe Rescue centre. Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her – opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home – Flam’s owner – to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles’ attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: ‘It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.’ She added: ‘Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.’ The Cat Shoppe is Nashville’s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre. Penny laughs in surprise as the cat continues to bare its teeth at her before scurrying off under the table .","The translator app talks to the cat in a series of meows .

"Australian's have been making a splash, with a new study showing that swimming is the most common sporting activity in the country. The latest National Sports Participation report by Ray Morgan has shown that one in two kids and one in ten adults frequently get their feet wet. Most fall between the ages of six and 13 with just under half of this group (48.8 percent) participating in swimming regularly. Swimming found to be the most common sporting activity in Australia with 1 in 2 kids swimming often . Soccer was a close second among children between 6 and 13 and third over all of the age groups . Cycling came second overall with nearly 38 percent of 6 to 13 year old children participating . Soccer was a close second for the rate of regular participation with 48.7 percent for six to 13 year old children with cycling second overall with nearly 38 percent of  six to 13 year old children participating. Overall, with one in seven Australians regularly swimming, one in nine go cycling and one in 12 play soccer. Children of the ages six to 13 appear to be the most active and 31 percent  participate in athletics, 30 percent in basketball, 30 percent in dancing, 20 percent in tennis and just over 25 percent in cricket. Hiking, Rugby League, softball, martial arts, volleyball, baseball and field hockey were the least most popular sports among this age group with all of these sports having participation of less than 10 percent. There are many more sports for adults such as motorcycle racing and boxing, but walking seems to reign supreme with 45.3 percent of adults regularly walking for exercise. The gym and weight training is more popular than swimming among adults and jogging overtakes cycling while yoga trumps aerobics. The National Sports participation Report by Ray Morgan Research shows swimming having highest popularity .

Walking is the most popular sport among adults with 45.3 percent walking regularly for exercise . '10 of the 20 most popular sports and activities among Aussie kids aged six to 13 are team sports,' said Michele Levine, CEO of Roy Morgan Research.

'[It is] the number one sporting activity for kids and adults with over three million regular participants overall.' With over 7000 beaches in the country it is little wonder that parents are finding out whether their kids will sink or swim and educating them about water safety at all ages.","Swimming found to be the most common sporting activity in Australia .

"The girlfriend of David de Gea has dealt a blow to Manchester United's hopes of keeping him by describing his adopted city as 'not very nice'. Singer Edurne Garcia, Spain's Eurovision Song Contest entrant, made the comments on light entertainment show El Hormiguero. Host Pablo Motos asked her: 'I've been told Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.' Edurne Garcia is the girlfriend of Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . De Gea has been United's star player during a difficult season at Old Trafford under Louis van Gaal . Garcia told Spanish entertainment show El Hormiguero that Manchester is 'not very nice, that's for sure' And rather than leap to the defence of the city where her boyfriend plies his trade, the 29-year-old replied: 'It's not very nice, that's for sure. You have to hunt out specific places, the nice places. 'But even then Spain is nicer. The reason I like it is because David's there. With him being there, everything looks wonderful.' De Gea, 24, sees his contract expire at Old Trafford at the end of next season. The 29-year-old singer has fueled speculation that De Gea could be set for a future away from Manchester .

In December, senior officials at United said they were relaxed about his contract situation.

"The NHS is owed £62million by so-called 'health tourists' who have yet to settle their bills, despite receiving thousands of pounds worth of care in Britain's hospitals. The  bill, built up over five years and across 40 different trusts, suggests previous estimates on the amount owed were far below the mark. The NHS is thought to act as a magnet to people from overseas because it will always care for someone who needs urgent treatment. The bill, built up over five years and across 40 different trusts, suggests previous estimates on the amount owed were far below the mark . An investigation by the Sunday Times has found people who owe money for dialysis, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants.

'I like to take care of myself… Football players like to take care of themselves and pay attention to the way they dress. 'I think as a human being you need variety; you can't just do football, you need a combination. Football is of course my main focus, which is a lot of fun and I love to be on the pitch. 'But I have other interests beside that, like fashion or being with my family.' Ozil and Giroud posed with Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez for GQ Style in their new Lanvin suits, and Giroud admitted he likes it when fans immitate his hair. 'Yes, they try to do the quiff,' he said. 'Especially in France, I see a lot of them. It is funny because they try to imitate me – but it is always a pleasure.' 'David Beckham is a top man.' he added, when discussing his fashion influences. 'I love the guy and what he can show in terms of style as well. He's really classy, an icon… . Beckham, who was at London's V&A museum on Thursday night for a fashion launch, has long combined success on the pitch with life as a fashion icon off it, but Giroud also picked out another, less expected ex-footballer as his major style influence. 'When I was young, I looked up to Andriy Shevchenko. He was so elegant, and on the pitch as well.' See the full shoot in the spring summer issue of GQ Style, on sale Thursday 19th March .
