"Code-crossing football star Karmichael Hunt has been fined $2500 after he pleaded guilty to four counts of cocaine possession but will not have a conviction recorded against him. The current Queensland Reds player pleaded guilty to the downgraded charges, after he had originally been charged with supplying the illicit drug. The fine of $2500 is substantially less than the amount Hunt paid for the drugs, which have a street value of roughly $300 per gram. Later in the afternoon, the Australian Rugby Union came down much heavier on Hunt, hitting him with a six-week ban and $30,000 fine. He also stood down from his position of vice-captain at his club. Scroll down for video . Football star Karmichael Hunt was all smiles as he left court without a conviction, after he earlier pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. Hunt arrives in court prior to pleading guilty to four counts of cocaine possession. All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. Hunt accepted the blame for his actions and apologised to his team and to fans of the game. 'I made a terrible mistake last year and have no one but myself to blame for this situation,' Hunt said in a statement issued this afternoon. 'I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my family, friends, team mates, Reds members, sponsors, fans and the wider rugby and sporting community in Queensland and beyond. Earlier in the day, Hunt said he was 'relieved' with the court's decision. 'I'm looking forward to putting his part of the process behind us and moving on,' he said. Hunt is scheduled to have an official press conference on Friday, but speaking outside of court he was 'relieved with the outcome'. Mr McDougall did not dispute the facts presented by police, and said they were the results of 'poor choices' by his client. 'He'll be paying for those choices for the rest of his life,' Mr McDougall said. 'He has suffered significant economic loss....it's an enormous economic loss. 'This has been a massive, massive wake-up call to him.' ARU boss Bill Pulver expressed his disappointment with Hunt, but said the sport will stand behind the embattled player. 'Illicit substances have no place in Rugby,' Mr Pulver said in a statement. 'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.' The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, from former NRL players. All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. Notices to face court were served to players by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission. The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin. Hunt was allegedly turning to fellow former NRL players John Touma and Matt Seers to buy the drug. A notice to face court was served to the fallen star by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission. Greg Bird is another of the players due to face court in the coming days. Titans players Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling also fronted court this morning, and saw their cases adjourned until May. Fellow Titans Greg Bird, Dave Taylor and Kalifa Faifai Loa are expected to face court on Monday along with former teammates Ashley Harrison and Joe Vickery. The investigation that tackled Hunt also resulted in notices being served to eight current or former members of the Gold Coast NRL team.

"Wealthy professionals in the medical industry, including surgeons and hospital executives have been caught out using a tax loophole to pay for lavish personal items. Rich hospital workers,  businessmen and charity leaders are using the tax break to pay for high-end holidays, extravagant meals and even their children's weddings. The meal and entertainment concession allows employees to spend an uncapped amount of money on food, entertainment and leasing facilities, with some members paying for cruise tickets using the privilege. Wealthy professionals in the medical industry, including surgeons and hospital executives have been caught out using a tax loophole to pay for lavish personal items . The concessions, or credit cards as they are known, allow employees of certain salary packages to purchase items such as mortgage repayments or vehicle expenses from pre-tax income, thereby reducing income tax payable. The federal government has come under pressure from some not-for-profit agencies, who say the state could save astronomical amounts of money over the coming years if they were to get rid of the concessions. According to a report submitted by Save The Children Australia, the exemption from fringe benefits  is estimated to cost the Treasury up to $600 million a year over the next few years. Treasury has estimated that it will cost over $2 billion in lost tax over the next four years. The concessions, or credit cards as they are known, allow employees of certain salary packages to purchase items such as mortgage repayments or vehicle expenses from pre-tax income, thereby reducing income tax payable . 'The Productivity Commission has provided examples of how $2,200 restaurant meals and $40,000 weddings could be paid for from pre-tax income to avoid significant amounts of tax that would otherwise be payable on the relevant employee’s income,' the Save The Children Australia report said. 'The benefit of this concession is also not evenly spread among NFP(not-for-profit) employees, tending to be more highly utilised by eligible employees on higher salaries.' Although Save the Children  currently benefit from this concession, they told Daily Mail Australia that they support its removal. They hope the funding will be re-directed to support vulnerable children. The concession was initially offered up to not-for-profit organisations as an incentive for new employees however over the years it has become a loophole for the rich to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle.

Speaking to The Australian Financial Review, World Vision Australia chief executive Tim Costello said he believes lower paid workers are shunned in the fringe benefit concession, allowing the rich to take a large chunk of the benefits. 'The concessions enable huge benefits to the richest 1 per cent working in the sector while offering minimum benefits to the lowest paid sector.' According to a Treasury report, the concession will cost  $465 million this year alone in lost tax and that figure will rise by nearly $100,000 by 2018.","Surgeons and hospital executive are using a tax loophole for a lavish life .

"A pub diner stabbed a man in the leg with a fork when the victim took an onion ring instead of chip from the man's plate. Builder Mark Lawson, 44, was in The Diamond Tap public house in Newbury Berkshire for his Christmas party when he agreed that his colleague Simon Myers could take some chips from his plate. However, when the Mr Myers started eating an onion ring, Lawson was angered, shouted at his victim and drove the fork into his thigh.

Lawson, from Thatcham, Berkshire, admitted malicious wounding following the incident in the Weatherspoons Free House on December 19, last year. Reading Crown Court heard that the incident happened during a work outing over the festive period. Judge Alexia Durran sought clarification from defence counsel John Simmons on exactly what happened. Judge Durran asked: 'This was a works Christmas party and a man was stabbed in the leg for stealing onion rings from a plate, that’s right isn’t it?' Lawson was unhappy his colleague took an onion ring from his plate (file picture) Mr Simmons replied: 'This is a very peculiar one-off offence. It may be the sort of case where the length of custodial sentence could be suspended and credit should be given for the guilty plea.' Addressing Lawson, Judge Durran said: 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious offence of using a weapon on someone in a public place and Mr Simmons is right to say to me that this may pass the custodial threshold. 'The question is whether a prison sentence can be suspended, allowing for your guilty plea. 'Sentencing is being adjourned for a pre-sentence report. You must be back here on April 22.' Lawson denied one count of wounding with intent and the Crown offered no evidence on that count. Judge Durran said: 'That is a ""not guilty verdict"" on that count.' The court heard that Mr Myers received treatment for a stab wound to his leg and was later allowed home from hospital.","Simon Myers had asked Mark Lawson if he could have some of his chips .

"The Russian embassy says it hopes a koala hugged by President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Brisbane has survived a mass culling of the marsupials by wildlife officers. The seemingly light-hearted comment on the embassy's Facebook page refers to the summit in Queensland, but the koala cull was carried out in Victoria. The message follows news that 686 koalas were put down near Victoria's Great Ocean Road in 2013 and 2014, an operation carried out in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals. Wildlife officers captured and euthanised the koalas, reportedly by lethal injection, in response to overpopulation and starvation in the area's manna gum woodlands. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Russia's President Vladimir Putin met koalas before the start of the first G20 meeting in Brisbane in November . The Russian Embassy in Australia posted this status on Facebook yesterday showing their concern after news of the koala cull that happened in 2013 and 2014 . The Russian embassy's message reads: 'Hope in the number of euthanised koalas did not get those animals that leaders at the G20 Summit in Brisbane were photographed with.' The post includes photographs of President Putin and US President Barack Obama holding koalas at the G20 summit in November. The summit was notable for Western leaders' irritation with Mr Putin over Russia's actions in the Ukraine conflict. Mr Putin left the summit early following his frosty reception, the koala hugging having provided a rare lighter moment. Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation . Victoria's Environment Minister Lisa Neville said on Wednesday that the state government had asked experts to advise on the management of koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne. She wouldn't rule out future koala culls, if recommended by the expert panel but said in the future the culls wouldn’t be kept secret. 'My main priority is making sure that we reduce the suffering of koalas due to starvation,' Ms Neville said. Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week on March 4 . US President Barack Obama also met Jimbelung the koala at the G20 in Brisbane . The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne . Cape Otway koalas can't be moved from their native habitat because they overeat and die, she said. Premier Daniel Andrew said the cull happened some years ago, not under the current government, and there should have been more transparency. The koalas were reportedly killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees. Koalas suffering starvation were euthanised, while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants. Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret. Wildlife Victoria chief executive Karen Masson couldn't understand why the cull was kept quiet. 'If they had good, sound expert advice and had adequately explored all other options then they should have been forthcoming with what they were doing and why,' she said in a statement. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now. 'I want somebody charged,' Ms Tabart said. 'The Australian government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in Australia ever. 'It's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM questioned why the program was conducted in secret . 'And if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret?' Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size. Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating . 'Watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing,' Dr Whisson, from Deakin University, told Daily Mail Australia. 'For every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention. 'It at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery.' Dr Whisson said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options. 'A lot of people ask why we can't just move the koalas somewhere else, but I think it's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact,' she said. 'A large number would die, and they don't want to move from manna gum. 'It's sort of a lose-lose situation all round.' Dr Whisson said the problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island. 'Manna gum is a very good food source for koalas, it's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it,' she said. 'To the point where they don't move for the food supply. 'Koalas can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population, they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up.' Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating. The problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island . The koalas, many of which were starving, were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree . 'Instead of doing this why didn't they plant trees all those years ago?' she said . 'They could have taken young ones out and relocated them. 'They've done nothing – they've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone ""Oh we better do something let's kill them."" 'It's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they shouldn't have got to that misery in first place.' At Cape Otway there are up to 11 koalas per hectare, but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare. The cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals . Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size . Victorian Environment Minister Lisa Neville said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the 'a very challenging and complex issue'. 'It is clear it's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that Cape Otway area because of ill health and starvation,' Ms Neville told ABC. 'That's just not good enough and that's a terrible way to treat koalas. 'I'm wanting to make sure that we're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation. 'I don't want to see koalas suffer.' The koala is listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT and as 'rare' in South Australia but it has no official listing in Victoria.","Russian embassy in Australia posted their koala concern on Facebook .

"Islamic State executioner Jihadi John managed to escape from Britain by hiding in the back of a freight lorry on a ferry crossing the Channel, it has been claimed. The 26-year-old, who has been named as Mohammed Emwazi, a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command. Now the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK. Scroll down for video . It has been claimed that Mohammed Emwazi, who has been named as ISIS executioner Jihadi John, escaped from Britain by hiding on the back of a lorry . The extremist reportedly hid in the vehicle as it crossed the channel before being taken to Turkey. File photo . A source told The Times that the extremist hid in a lorry, which crossed the Channel on a ferry to France and that he was then able to travel across Europe unchecked until he reached Turkey. They added that he passed through the Turkish border with ease and then continued his journey to Syria to join up with ISIS in early 2013. Emwazi has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab. He was stopped with two associates in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, where he told officials they were en route to a safari. Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo was picked up by the SAS and MI5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east African country in November 2010. Emwazi, pictured, has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab . After being detained by police and held overnight and deported, Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, before being returned to the UK. He claimed that an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia and that they even tried to recruit him to join the organisation. He claimed he was harassed by the security services, and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Emwazi was then placed on a terror watch list, which prevented him from travelling to any Muslim country. The Home Office are already facing questions after it emerged between 2009 and 2010, Emwazi travelled between London and Kuwait at least twice. In June 2010, he was detained by counter-terrorism officials in Britain who fingerprinted him and searching his belongings. The next day – to Emwazi’s fury, given he claimed to have a job and bride-to-be in Kuwait – he was prevented from flying. A possible attempt to leave London for Saudi Arabia in 2012 was also blocked. But after managing to leave Britain for Syria, he has gained global notoriety as the masked killer of Western hostages including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines in ISIS beheading videos which have shocked the world. Emwazi was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed. Meanwhile, Emwazi's father, Jasem Emwazi, has said he is not sure that his son is masked ISIS butcher Jihadi John, according to his lawyer. The 51-year-old feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today. His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son. 'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.' He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.' Jasem Emwazi, the father of Mohammed Emwazi, who has said that he is not sure that his son is the masked ISIS butcher Jihadi John . The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed. Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities. Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.' The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that housing and state benefits for Emwazi's family since they came to the UK from Kuwait 20 years ago has cost taxpayers £400,000. After his father returned to Kuwait, other members of his family in Britain have been moved out of their homes for their own protection and are being guarded at a cost of £5,000 a day.","ISIS executioner Jihadi John unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi last week .

"Years ago, when our house was always full of small children, I staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath-time and found the visiting Dads pouring well-earned drinks. We reported that, just before we battened down the hatches, all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies. The mothers all laughed. So did the fathers, for a brief moment, but then, in chorus, they ask™ed: ‘Um . . . and whose was the . . .?’ Civilized, cultured, happily married men, not a porn-hound or a libertine among them, but they couldn’t help it. Willy-worship, willy-pride, is hard-wired deep in the male brain. However much they deny it, men do seem to care. Actors Jonny Lee Miller (left) and Benedict Cumberbatch (right) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as Frankenstein a few years ago . Why else would King’s College London have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure (one hopes not the hard, cold, sharp steel sort) and proudly report that the average length, unstimulated, is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect. I do admire the chaps’ willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler. Brrr. But the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends. And that they all secretly, privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average. The academics explain that it’s all about ‘using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position’, and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder, and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online. So, don’t tell me men don’t care. Further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing Frankenstein play at the National Theatre a few years ago, in which on alternate nights the role of the Creature, stark-naked during a long opening scene, was taken by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable, centring on who won that particular contest, and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument. ‘Ah yes, I see what you mean, but is it a show-er or a grower?’ We women edged away, to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being Dr Frankenstein. Libby says she blames author, Jilly Cooper (pictured), for giving men the impression that women are worried about size . Though to be fair, some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs, pecs, and glutes. We do like a man who looks healthy. It’s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided. But honestly, hand on heart, I suspect that very few of us during early courtship — or afterwards, or even after the golden wedding — are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average. The idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality. I blame author Jilly Cooper for giving men that impression, with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the Tower of Pisa, or space shuttles, or — my least favourite — a ‘joyous otter’. I suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices. You can resort to heavy innuendo, or do some Barbara Cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss. Or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the London or Manhattan skyline, somewhere between Centrepoint and the Gherkin. Though ideally, of course, not the Shard. The porn industry is obsessed with size, but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking. Most of us have never cared about size. We don’t carry on like the fearsome coven on TV’s Sex And The City, shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes. It is worth noting, without comment, that much of the genius behind those series and films came from — ahem — men. Gay men, in many cases. Out here in the real world, that is not the way women carry on. The only ones I’ve ever known talk about male size were sad, angry girls, unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle. Libby is keen to point out that most women don't carry on like the women in Sex And The City (pictured), comparing detailed notes on the men they know . What we like is much harder to measure. I know a lot of women, and have been one for ages, and it’s simpler than you think. We like hugs, we like tenderness, we like men who seem (often bafflingly) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us, even without make-up and a heavy cold. We really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we’re there. We like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise, if not a bit more. We approve of chaps, of any dimension, who work out how to make the main event fun all round. We like men who chat and don’t mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet. We like faithfulness and kindness, and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it’s leaking a bit. And we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6in, or expecting it to be worshipped.","It's the hot topic of the moment thanks to recent scientific research .

"The White House, the State Department and Democrats on Capitol Hill are side-stepping questions about Hillary Clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates. While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans  for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We’re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you’re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, ""Maybe we need another person in this race."" And that is really problematic.' 'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said. 'It’s kinda weird.'","White House now claims it didn't know Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business .

"Eerie pictures have emerged of hundreds of terrified passengers fleeing the foggy scene where a plane crash-landed in Nepal on Wednesday. Although all of the 224 passengers and 11 crew on board the Turkish Airline flight THY726 were safely evacuated after the incident, commuters have described the distressing scenario. 'We could feel the tyres skid... I could see an air hostess from my seat, she had tears in her eyes,' Dikesh Malhotra, a 28-year-old business man on the flight said. Scroll down for video . Eerie pictures have emerged of hundreds of terrified passengers fleeing the foggy scene where Turkish Airline flight THY726 crash landed . All of the 224 passengers and 11 crew on board the plane were safely evacuated after the incident . One pasanger said: 'We could feel the tyres skid... I could see an air hostess from my seat, she had tears in her eyes' Mr Malhotra, said the impact of the landing caused bags to fall on terrified passengers, who clutched their seats, anxiously waiting for the plane to stop moving. When the plane stopped, smoke filled the cabin, making it difficult to breathe, he said. 'Everyone got up and started shouting to open the door... finally they announced evacuation... we were so relieved,' Mr Malhotra said. The fortunate passengers on-board escaped with only minor bumps and bruises, as officials confirmed there were no serious injuries. Air authorities said that the plane, which was arriving from Istanbul in Turkey, came off the runway in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in the early hours of the morning . Two consecutive days of rain had left the runway at Tribhuwan International Airport in Nepal's capital extremely slippery and there was dense fog at the time .

Two consecutive days of rain had left the runway at Tribhuwan International Airport in Nepal's capital extremely slippery and there was dense fog at the time. Airport spokesman Purna Prasad Chudal said the pilot overshot the runway during an initial attempt to land, before making a second try that sent the plane skidding off the tarmac. The plane, which was on a seven-hour flight from the Turkish capital, was forced to circle for 30 minutes over Nepal before it made a second attempt to land.

'We are trying to bring specialised removal equipment from India tomorrow morning in an army plane that can land in the available stretch of runway,' another airport official, Bharat Kumar Shrestha,said. Chudal said officials would launch an investigation into the crash and question the pilot. 'The plane had permission to land and while conditions were foggy earlier, visibility was ok,' Chudal told AFP. Crashed: The front of the Airbus was damaged after the crash. Officials say passengers had bumps and bruises but no serious injuries . Secure: Air officials secured the aircraft after it crashed following its second attempt to land in dense fog . 'We are not sure how this happened.' The only international airport in Nepal remained closed Wednesday morning after the accident. The Himalayan nation is home to some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks and terrain that poses a challenge even for accomplished pilots. A string of crashes as well as the European Union's decision to blacklist all Nepalese airlines prompted government officials last year to announce plans to install new radar and weather monitoring systems.

"Goodyear believes it has a way to extend your electric car's range through tires that charge the battery as you drive on them. Unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, the BH-03 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls. 'This tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions,' Goodyear said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Hot idea: The Goodyear BH-03, unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, uses two advanced material technologies to capture extra energy from normal wear and tear . Yahoo! reports that the thermoelectric fibers are woven into the tire, converting energy generated through friction caused by the tire's contact with the road. Piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting. It's not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car's travel radius. A study published in 2012 in Smart Materials and Structures found  strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible, but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors, not an entire vehicle. The company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path. Showcasing its new Triple Tube tires on the Lexus LF-SA concept car, Goodyear says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions. High concept: The Lexus LF-SA concept car, also unveiled, showcased Goodyear's Triple Tube tires, which use three inflating and deflating tubes to transform the tire's shape to adapt to road conditions . The tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving, increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain. CNET points out that Goodyear has used Geneva  to launch forward-thinking - though not quite market-ready - concepts before, having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year's auto show. The outer ring of the SUV featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a textured surface for traction off road.","The tire company showed off two new concept tires at Geneva Motor Show .

"The Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life', pictured at George's christening in 2013 . Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ Adds a source: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles’s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William’s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

"Taking statins (pictured) can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent, research has shown . Taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent, research has shown. The cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly, which can trigger type 2 diabetes. The risk, which is far higher than previously believed, has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills. The findings are particularly worrying as last year the NHS recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. The drugs’ rationing body NICE published guidance last July urging GPs to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade. This represents around 40 per cent of adults in the UK, and academics said the advice was ‘foolhardy’ when so little was known about the side effects. In the latest study, scientists from the University of Eastern Finland studied 8,749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six-year period. Just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started. Some had only been on the pills for a few months, others for several years. Over the course of the study, the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent. Their research, published in the journal Diabetologia, found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar. This is known as insulin sensitivity, and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins. The cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly, which can trigger type 2 diabetes . The researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar, and the body’s sugar levels rise too high, then it can trigger type 2 diabetes. They concluded: ‘Statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 'The association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra, a consultant cardiologist in London, said that contrary to the NHS guidance, healthy adults should not be taking statins, adding: ‘I personally wouldn’t take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information. ‘Eating a handful of nuts or four tablespoons of olive oil may be a more effective way at reducing risk of a heart attack, stroke or death and without the side effects.’ Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said healthy patients prescribed statins to prevent heart disease should take the ‘lowest possible dose’. He went on to warn that people with existing heart conditions should not stop taking the pills, saying: ‘It is important that people taking statins because of existing cardiovascular disease should continue to take them as the benefits will outweigh the risks.’","Stains are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly .

"A watchdog has cleared officers over the case of a four-year-old boy starved to death by his alcoholic mother, despite years of police contact with the family. Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found in a cot at his filthy home in Bradford in 2011, almost two years after he had died. The family, including his mother Amanda Hutton, 43, had extensive contact with police over a number of years, but today the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that Hamzah's death was not something West Yorkshire Police 'could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent', the police watchdog has found. A watchdog has cleared West Yorkshire Police over the case of four-year-old Hamzah Khan (pictured), who was starved to death by his alcoholic mother despite years of police contact with the family . Mother-of-eight Hutton was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of Hamzah's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children. At her trial it emerged that a range of agencies, including police officers, had contact with her family because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence, but no one spotted the danger the children were in. The IPCC had launched an investigation into West Yorkshire Police’s handling of concerns raised about Hamzah’s welfare, the results of which were announced today. In a statement, the watchdog said: 'The IPCC investigation concluded that Hamzah's death was not something West Yorkshire Police could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent, and that it was the actions of a PCSO who made repeated and concerted attempts to speak to Ms Hutton that led to the discovery of Hamzah's body.' Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton (pictured) was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of Hamzah's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children . The commission said there had been no misconduct by officers but did criticise the force for not referring itself to the IPCC at the time the body was discovered. It said the fact it was not referred 'hindered the IPCC in its obligation to carry out a prompt and effective independent investigation into West Yorkshire Police's contact with the family'. IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: 'There was a clear public interest in enabling the Independent Police Complaints Commission to scrutinise the actions of West Yorkshire Police officers after the discovery of Hamzah's body in 2011. 'The fact that this was not reported to the IPCC until after a serious case review had been completed in 2013 meant that that process was completed without any independent scrutiny of police action.' Hutton's trial heard how Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for attacking Hutton but detectives told the court these were investigated and no problems were found. Today, the IPCC said two officers chose not to make a referral to social services after specific allegations of neglect were made during this interview in December 2008. But it said in its statement: 'The IPCC found that a number of referrals had already been made, one of which was made only five days before the interview with Mr Khan. A further referral to social services could have been made but there was no requirement for the officers to do so.' A serious case review in Hamzah's case concluded that he was 'invisible for almost a lifetime'. But that review was criticised at its publication by children's minister Edward Timpson, who expressed 'deep concerns', saying it failed to fully explain 'missed opportunities to protect children in the house'. The minister wrote to Professor Nick Frost, who chairs the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, saying: 'I have deep concerns over the Hamzah Khan serious case review. The child's body was found in what police said were 'breathtakingly awful' conditions in a bedroom at Hutton's house in Bradford, while the kitchen was also filled with rubbish . The living room of Hutton's home was covered in old takeaway boxes, bottles and plastic bags . 'In particular, I am concerned that it fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken or not taken by children's social care when problems in the Khan family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions.' Alcoholic Hutton was living in what the report described as 'breathtakingly awful' conditions with five of her children as well as Hamzah's mummified remains when police entered her four-bedroom house in September 2011. A jury at Bradford Crown Court found she had allowed Hamzah to starve to death in December 2009 and left his body in a cot with a teddy. The remains were only discovered due to a rookie police community support officer's tenacious pursuit of a minor anti-social behaviour complaint because she knew something was wrong. The family was known to all the main agencies, partly due to a long history of violence Hutton suffered at the hands of Khan. But Hutton failed to co-operate with many children's services and the SCR found that Hamzah slipped below the radar and was invisible. Ms Butts said today: 'Nothing could have reasonably been done by West Yorkshire Police to predict or prevent this horrendous case of child neglect. In fact, it was the tenacity of one of its officers that led to the eventual discovery of his body.'","Hamzah Khan's decomposed body found in cot two years after his death .

"It is a common thread through many of the world's dominant religions that those who do not follow the same faith are  barbarians. Yet new research has now challenged the conventional idea that belief in a powerful and judgmental God is necessary to form large, complex civilisations. Anthropologists have found that belief in supreme deities often emerged after complex societies had already formed. The stone heads on Easter Island (shown above) are thought by some to represent ancestors of people living there and could be an example of where the belief system helped drive the emergence of complex society . The scientists studied the development of religion and cultures on Pacific islands that make up Austronesia. They examined 96 ancient Austronesian cultures - including those on Fiji, Tonga, Hawaii and Samoa - that had not had contact with Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Islam. They often form a central part of most biblical stories, but it appears that floods, famines and plagues may have also helped to start belief in some gods in the first place. Researchers at North Carolina State University found that belief in all-powerful and moralising gods tended to appear at times of hardship in human history. They claim that believing in such a supreme deity helps to ensure people within a society live by certain moral rules that are necessary when living in harsh environments or in times of hardship. The researchers studied the origins of 583 religious societies around the world. They compared these to  climate, rainfall and plant growth data for each area to build up a historical picture of the conditions each society was living in. The findings may help to shed light on how religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam first emerged and why stories of hardship play such a central role. Dr Joseph Watts, an expert in cultural evolution at the University of Auckland in new Zealand, said: 'We found 22 instances of high political complexity through out historically and geographically distant regions of Austronesia. 'The results presented here cast doubt on the widely held view that moralizing high gods facilitate the emergence of political complexity. 'Although beliefs in moralising high gods do co-evolve with political complexity, believes follow rather than drive political complexity.' Instead the researchers found that belief in systems of supernatural punishment - such as vengeful spirits - tended to precede the emergence of complex societies and civilisations on the islands. These tended to be belief in anthropomorphic beings such as the spirits of dead ancestors. The researchers found that 37 of the cultures sampled had beliefs of this type while just six believed in supreme deities. Those that believed in a single all-powerful god tended to be clustered in southeast Asia including the Bontok and Tagbanwa cultures in the Philippines, the Batak Toba people of North Sumatra, the Manggarai tribes of Flores in Indonesia. The names of their gods are Lumawig, Mangindusa, Mulajadi na Bolon and Mori Karaeng respectively. The researchers then used trees of evolutionary connections between cultures, deduced from earlier studies of linguistic relationships, to explore how the societies were inter-related and exchanged ideas. Islam is often seen as having been a civilising influence on Arab culture in the past and millions now make the pilgrimage to Mecca, shown above, every year. But the new research suggests that ancient religions like this that believe in an all powerful God may have emerged after complex cultures had already begun to grow . Native Hawaiians evolved a politically complex society but without belief in a supreme deity. Instead the had a belief system that worked around the representations like wooden Ki'i statues, like those pictured above . They were then able to model how the different religions influenced the development of the political structure and cultural complexity in each society. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Watts and his colleagues said: 'For beliefs in systems of supernatural punishment, however, the beliefs seem to help political complexity to emerge, although by no means guarantee it. 'We suggest that the concept of moralising high gods diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex societies.' Christianity has had a history of trying to convert those of other faiths that were considered heathens but it the latest research suggests that supernatural beliefs played a greater role in civilisation than was thought . However, Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading, told Nature that he believed the key to increasing political complexity was language not religion. He said that societies became more complex as networks of trade and reputation emerged. Instead he said that all powerful gods perhaps were useful as a tool to help those in power to cement their grip on a society. He said: 'As soon as you have a large society generating lots of goods and services, this wealth can be put to use by someone who can grab the reins of power. 'The most immediate way to do this is to align yourself with a supreme deity and then make lists of things people can and cannot do, and these become ‘morals’ when applied to our social behaviour.'","Scientists at the University of Auckland studied 97 Pacific island cultures .

A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face. When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said. He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. 'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.' A former friend of Omar Emwazi say boys who assaulted him and Omar were dumped on the M1 motorway without their clothes in revenge for the violent attack (file picture) Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week . The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'. Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed. He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi – a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended. It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Emwazi's former home (pictured) was on the Mozart estate in west London known for its postcode gang . Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted. Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films. It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria. The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause. Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists. On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes. At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions. A BBC journalist gives a live update from outside the home of Mohammed Emwazi last week. The corporation has defended itself against claims it 'glamorised' the ISIS killer . The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story. But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation. We don't believe that our coverage has glamorised him or Islamic State. 'We have made it very clear that he appears to be responsible for a number of brutal killings, and is a member of a growing, well-armed, well-financed organisation that commits acts of brutality and is having a profound impact on the security of the Middle East. 'We feel BBC News has reported on the activities of Islamic State and Mohammed Emwazi in a clear and accurate manner.'

"A mother whose teenage daughter was stabbed to death by her friend's boyfriend has spoken of her heartbreak over the brutal murder. Julie Warren-Sykes' daughter Samantha, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was just 18 when her life was brutally cut short by Ahmad Otak, then 21, an Afghan asylum seeker who was jealous of her close friendship with his ex-girlfriend Elisa Frank. Determined to punish Elisa, he murdered her own sister in front of her - and in a horrifying twist, forced her to lure her Samantha to her death in March 2012. Scroll down for video . Julie Warren-Sykes' daughter Samantha was just 18 when her life was brutally cut short . Elisa's best friend Samantha Sykes (pictured), 18, was also killed by Otak, who slit her throat and stabbed her . Samantha and Elisa had been friends since they were eight years old. In a sickening act, Otak made Elisa watch as her killed her  sister Kim, 17, and best friend. Now survivor Elisa and Samantha's mother Julie have shared their experiences of that terrible day in TV show Britain's Darkest Taboos. Elisa, now 21, had been in a relationship with Otak after meeting him at a foster home as a teenager but Julie said her daughter had concerns about her friend's new boyfriend. 'She told me that she was concerned about Elisa's relationship with Ahmad Otak. She felt there was something wrong with the relationship, and she said that he gave her a bad feeling,' Julie said. Otak had become increasingly controlling of Elisa and tried to cut her off from her friend and younger sister. Elisa's sister Kim Frank (left) was stabbed 15 times by Ahmad Otak who then licked her blood off his knife . He threatened Elisa with violence and said he would harm her family and friends if she left him. But with the support of Kim and Samantha, she eventually plucked up the courage to end their relationship. She could not fathom that Otak would be carry through with his violent threats in the most horrific way. He asked Elisa to meet him at Kim's flat in Wakefield so he could collect some things from her. But when she arrived, he launched a ferocious attack on her sister as Elisa looked on helplessly. She recalled: 'All I can remember now is Kim fell on to me and I got pushed on to the bed a bit. Then I just turned round, and as soon as I turned round I saw the knife. 'Hearing Kim screaming, really horrific screams, like something that you can't really describe unless you have heard something like that. 'He was like, calling her a stupid b**** and stuff like that while he were stabbing her.' Elisa said Otak showed no remorse and seemed to gloat in the murder. 'He stood up, and licked the blood off the knife, and he spat down at her body,' she said. Survivor: Elisa Frank was the only survivor of the 2012 attack that led to the death of her sister . Then he made Elisa call Samantha and ask her to come to the flat. Terrified Elisa complied but hoped her friend - who had career aspirations as a model - would realise something was wrong and wouldn't go. 'I were hoping that she’d be able to pick something up from my voice, and then maybe phone the police,' Elisa said. But Samantha was a loyal friend to Elisa and worried something was wrong with her, she rushed to her aid. As soon as she arrived at the flat, she was stabbed to death by Otak. By then he had tied Elisa up with cable ties so she had no way of helping her friend. 'He seemed like he'd enjoyed it. Very calm, no emotion at all after he'd done it either, just none,' Elisa said of the murder. Meanwhile, Julie said she had a bad feeling something had happened to her daughter, who had left her a note saying she had gone to see Elisa. 'When I saw the note I had a bad feeling. It's a mother's instinct,' she said. But she admitted nothing could have prepared her for the news that her daughter had been brutally stabbed to death. The truth came out hours later after Elisa finally escaped Otak clutches as he tried to kidnap her by taking her to Dover to flee the country. Much missed: Elisa still has nightmares about the night Kim (pictured right) and Sam (left) were killed . She managed to get away and call the police and Otak was arrested and the bodies of his two young victims discovered in Kim's flat. Julie recalls hearing the terrible news after hours of anguish worrying about her missing daughter: 'Samantha was missing for a number of hours through that night, and I just kept thinking, ""She’s dead."" 'It’s not something that you can actually explain to anybody, it was just as if part of me had gone. It was an horrendous experience, the anxiety, feeling sick, just not really knowing what to do with yourself. You know, it's a mother’s worst nightmare. It was like torture. 'When the police came and told me what had happened, I think I just went into some kind of a shock, where everything seemed surreal. 'The worst thing in the world was always, for me, when somebody loses a child, and it was the one thing that I asked, ""if there’s a God, don’t ever let that happen to me, don’t ever let that happen to me."" Of course, it has happened to me.' Otak was tried at Leeds Crown Court after pleading guilty to the two murders but both Elisa and Julie were disgusted to see he showed no remorse for what he had done. 'To hear the detail of the injuries that both these young people suffered, is devastating. You just think, what is he thinking while he's sat there? Because he never showed any emotion whatsoever,' Julie said. Evil: Afghan asylum seeker Ahmad Otak attempted to flee to France but was foiled by a brave fellow refugee . Otak was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 33 years and 124 days. Julie said of the sentencing: 'When he was sentenced you have a kind of feeling of euphoria, because you think, you know, that’s it, it’s done, he’s been sentenced, he’s got a long sentence. 'But that soon goes, and so, within a couple of days, actually I felt probably worse than I’d felt for a significant period of time. I just fell to pieces. I'm still grieving for Samantha, as are many other people, and you learn to live with what's happened.' Elisa says despite the lengthy sentence, she will never get over the death of her sister and best friend. She has turned to writing to help her deal with the events she witnessed and has written a book about her experiences called The Borderline Diaries. She said: 'Since I've started writing I've been feeling a lot better, and I've noticed that bits of my past and things that I haven’t been able to process so much, come out in my writing, and then I always feel a bit like I've had a weight taken off my shoulders afterwards.' Julie added that she wishes Elisa well and doesn't feel bitter about her part in her daughter's death. Aftermath: Police outside Elisa's Wakefield flat following the double murders . Traumatised: Elisa still has nightmares about the day her sister and best friend were murdered . 'She has an opportunity now that I hope she’ll grasp, and move forward with her life, and do something wonderful,' she said. She added: 'One of the real positive actions that we’ve taken as a family since Samantha’s death is to establish the Samantha Sykes Foundation Trust, whose purpose is to work with not-for-profit organisations who support and help victims of child sexual exploitation, or children and young people who are considered to be at risk of child sexual exploitation. 'We've been overwhelmed by some of the community support, and the generosity of local people has restored some of our faith in human kindness.'

"A woman who tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was 'severely intoxicated' when she fell. Jane Hutch was having a celebratory drink at her rented townhouse in Doubleview, Perth, with her adult son and daughter on Christmas Day in 2009 after signing a lease on the property the previous day. Ms Hutch went upstairs at the two-storey property to find her bag, and when she could not see it in her bedroom she had a 'quick look' over the balustrade of a landing at the top of the stairs to see if it was in the kitchen below. She lost her balance and fell over the balustrade, falling several metres onto the floor below. Ms Hutch suffered head and spinal injuries and is now a paraplegic. Jane Hutch tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic . She sued her landlord Christopher Geoffrey Ryan for damages in the District Court of Western Australia, claiming that the balustrade was too low and she was therefore unable to stop herself once she had begun to fall. But Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's 'severe intoxication' and Mr Ryan was therefore not liable for damages. Ms Hutch gave evidence that she and her son started drinking sparkling wine at 10.30am on December 25, and said she 'probably' drank a bottle or the equivalent of 6.5 standard drinks. The accident occurred just before 1.30pm and she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Tests at hospital found she had a blood alcohol level about six times the legal driving limit. Toxicologist Professor David Joyce gave evidence that Ms Hutch's blood alcohol level suggested she had drunk between 20 and 21 standard drinks. Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's 'severe intoxication' and her landlord was therefore not liable for damages . 'Based on her plasma and blood alcohol level and Professor Joyce's evidence, I find that the plaintiff was severely intoxicated and that this influenced her behaviour when it came to matters of safety,' Judge Davis said. 'I find on the balance of probabilities that the reason the plaintiff leaned beyond the point of no return was because of her state of intoxication.' Judge Davis also found that the balustrade measured 865mm and was compliant with building codes, despite Ms Hutch's expert witnesses submitting evidence suggesting it only measured 857mm. The judge said the landlord's expert witness, builder and building surveyor Darren Mouchmore, 'properly measured' the balustrade and found it to be 865mm.","Jane Hutch, from Perth, fell off an upstairs landing  and was left paraplegic .

"This is the dramatic moment an extreme skier uses his parachute to fly over an avalanche to avoid being knocked off a cliff. Ugo Gerola captured the action on his helmet camera as he was hurtling down a slope on the Aiguille du Midi in the French Alps. At first, the 23-year-old glides  over the powder white snow, occasionally using his parachute to take off and land metres away. Then, out of nowhere, an avalanche comes into shot and nearly sweeps him over the edge of the mountain. Extreme skier Ugo Gerola is seen on his helmet camera hurtling down a slope in the French Alps moments before an avalanche sweeps across his path, nearly knocking him over the face of the 4,000m mountain . Danger: Out of nowhere, the avalanche comes into shot from his left as he races down the slope . Averting disaster: Mr Gerola uses his parachute to lift several feet in the air to dodge the avalanche's path . The extreme skier sails over the path of the avalanche as it sweeps out of view . But Mr Gerola uses his parachute to dodge its path and watches as the powder, ice and rocks drop hundreds of feet below him while he floats in the clear blue skies. He said: 'I was so lucky escaping the avalanche. I only just saw it at the last moment. 'Fortunately from my experience of skiing I knew where to go. 'Once I was safely away from the cliff face, it was amazing to watch the snow falling below my feet. 'In that moment I felt incredibly small.'

He said: 'Once I was safely away from the cliff face, it was amazing to watch the snow falling below my feet' Mr Gerola has been freeriding for six years and works as a ski instructor throughout the winter months. Freeriding, or speed flying as it is also known, involves skiing off off-piste, often with a winged parachute, much like paragliding. Sometimes referred to as 'off-piste', there is a much higher possibility of there being avalanches as the snow is less stable. Mr Gerola said: 'When I showed my friends the video, they were amazed. 'Some of them say I'm crazy because of the dangers of freeriding but it just makes me feel alive. 'I have been practicing for many years now so the risk of my rides is always carefully calculated.'","Ugo Gerola, 23, captured near-miss on helmet camera in the French Alps .

"Last month, TransAsia Airways flight GE-235  crashed shortly after take-off, killing 31 people. The crash site, in Taipei, represents tragedy for those who lost family members and friends in the disaster, yet to a handful of tourists, it made the perfect background for a holiday snap. The photo, published by Hong Kong's Apple Daily, shows three women posing  in front of the  Keeling River, as boats search for crash victims behind them. Tourists pose at the AirAsia crash site, in Taipei, while rescue boats search for bodies in the background . Visiting scenes of death and disaster might seem inappropriate to the average holidaymaker, but dark tourism appears to be on the rise. Philip Stone is Executive Director: Institute for Dark Tourism Research (iDTR), School of Sport, Tourism and The Outdoors, University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), Preston, UK. In his paper, Dark Tourism Scholarship: A Critical Review, he explains: 'The act of travel to sites of death, disaster or the seemingly macabre – or what has commonly been referred to as dark tourism – is an increasingly pervasive feature within the contemporary visitor economy. People pose for selfies  at the site of the Sydney siege, in which a lone gunman held hostage ten customers and eight employees of a Lindt chocolate café located at Martin Place in Sydney, Australia. Three were killed . Social media users shared their pictures, often featuring television camera crews in the background . 'Indeed, the commodification of death for popular touristic consumption, whether in the guise of memorials and museums, visitor attractions, special events and exhibitions, or specific tours, has become a focus for mainstream tourism providers.' Introduced in 1996 the term ‘dark tourism' was brought to the mainstream in 2000, in Lennon and Foley's book Dark Tourism: The Attraction of Death and Disaster. Professor Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University, who has written a blog post on death fascination says there are a number of reasons for our interest in the macabre. 'There's a huge market for witnessing the extremities of human behaviour. By looking at something so extreme it makes us feel better about ourselves,' he told MailOnline Travel. Almost four years the Fukushima crisis, tourists are queuing up to see its abandoned neighborhoods . Countless travel companies offer tours of the Chernobyl Zone in Ukraine. Abandoned hospital beds, pictured . 'Entrepreneurs can exploit that. At the Costa Concordia site people were charging ten euros for tourists wanting to see it.' 'There is also now much more of a desire for unique experiences - we want to do something something that not a lot of other people have done, so we can tell our friends about it. 'Also, people want to be involved in pivotal events in history,' says Professor Griffiths, which explains the photographs taken at plane crash sites. 'But this is nothing new,' he adds. 'People have always flocked towards death -  think of public beheadings.' A man takes pictures  outside the headquarters of French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, in Paris .

"A father spent £10,000 on private detectives after police failed to track down the thug who killed his daughter’s kitten with an air rifle. Neil Tregarthen devoted six weeks to gathering information for a 15-page report that named their prime suspect – but officers dismissed it as ‘rumour and speculation’ and abandoned the case. Yesterday the millionaire former business owner – who posed as an angler at one stage to spy on youths he believed were responsible – criticised the police investigation as ‘totally impotent’. Scroll down for video . Neil Tregarthen spent £10,000 on a private investigator after his daughter's cat, Farah, was shot by an air rifle . He and the private eyes identified several members of a local gang that posted Facebook pages of themselves injuring animals, and had criminal records for air rifle related offences. But police refused to bring a prosecution because of ‘lack of evidence’ for an attack that condemned Farah the kitten to a slow, agonising death. Mr Tregarthen’s daughter Aylish was horrified to find Farah lying in a pool of blood after limping home wounded and crippled with pain last September. The 24-year-old medical student and her father took the kitten to a vet but she suffered ‘a very long, painful, lingering death’ from a ruptured bowel and blood poisoning, finally passing away on the operating table, Mr Tregarthen said. When police told him there was not enough evidence to pursue the case he hired the detective firm and offered a £1,000 reward to catch the killer. They distributed flyers and set up a phone line for people to give information. It quickly became clear there had been a string of air rifle attacks near where Aylish lives in Exeter, Devon. ‘We narrowed it down to four youths, so we set about doing surveillance work,’ Mr Tregarthen said. ‘We would camp out on the river pretending to be fishing. We surveyed certain areas by pretending to be members of the public. Ideally we needed to witness an incident, but that never happened. We found a witness who claimed he had witnessed our main suspect shooting another cat.’ The kitten, pictured right with one of the family's other pets,  died despite extensive treatment at the vets . Mr Tregarthen is offering £1,000 to anyone with information which could lead to Farah's killer. The kitten was shot near her owner's home in Exeter . Exeter-based Focus Investigations, whose staff includes ex-police officers, said the person responsible had ‘an obvious sociopathic nature’. Mr Tregarthen, 56, added: ‘We compiled all the information we had, and presented it to the police. We did 85 per cent of the work – then Devon and Cornwall Police would not even go and knock on a couple of doors. Using an air rifle to shoot cats is illegal, and should be treated as such.’ Mr Tregarthen, who lives in a luxury house in Truro, Cornwall, said of the cost of his own investigation: ‘I would pay double that if I thought it would stop this sort of behaviour. 'I know I am in a fortunate position to be able to do so, but I think it is money well spent. It’s about society fighting back.’ Mr Tregarthen enlisted the help of private investigators Focus (offices pictured above) to help find Farah's killer . The animal is likely to have been playing in the garden when killed, Mr Tregarthen said. She returned to Miss Tregarthen's house wounded . His daughter said: ‘I feel like there is no justification for not investigating something that is illegal. We sympathise with the budget cuts – they have limited time and resources, which is why we chose to investigate it. But to still have the same response is very disappointing.’ Devon and Cornwall Police neighbourhood beat manager Steve Parsons said: ‘We investigated this crime fully.

"The investigation into claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring widened dramatically yesterday after police raided the home of a disgraced Tory MP. Harvey Proctor, 68, had been named on a list of politicians passed to police by campaigning Labour MP John Mann. Scotland Yard officers spent two days searching his grace-and-favour home at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire after a police team arrived on the estate on Wednesday. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . Former Essex MP Proctor, who quit Parliament in 1987 after admitting ‘spanking sessions’ with rent boys, was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys. He said he did not attend Westminster ‘sex parties’ at an exclusive address near Parliament and claimed to be trapped in a ‘Kafka-esque fantasy’. It is understood that investigators now have up to nine current and former senior politicians on Mr Mann’s list in their sights as the sensitive inquiry gathers pace. Speaking last night, Mr Mann said he was pleased at the progress of the investigation and insisted that ‘no stone must be left unturned’. ‘It is encouraging to see that the Met are continuing to fully investigate allegations of child abuse and prominent people,’ he added. Mr Proctor today said he knew nothing about the allegations and wanted to talk to police at the 'earliest opportunity' Proctor faces being interviewed under caution within weeks by detectives with the Met’s Operation Midland squad – which was set up in November to investigate claims of a VIP Westminster child sex abuse ring in the 1970s and 1980s. Victims have come forward to claim men in powerful positions abused boys at the luxury Dolphin Square apartments in Pimlico. They are also examining allegations that figures in politics, the military and law enforcement abused children at other locations. At the centre of the inquiry is an eyewitness described by police as ‘credible’ who claims three of those abused were murdered. In addition, detectives are examining a list passed to them by Mr Mann last December which identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum. It is believed that Proctor’s name has been repeatedly given to police by at least two alleged victims. On Wednesday, detectives arrived at Belvoir Castle near Grantham – the seat of the Duke of Rutland – where Proctor has lived since 2003. They searched at least two properties on the 16,000-acre estate including a red ramshackle building he moved out of in recent months. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed the search. Proctor quickly proclaimed his innocence yesterday, denying any knowledge of abuse or murders. Standing in the grounds of Belvoir Castle, he said he is ‘helping police with their inquiries’. Earlier he told BBC Radio 4: ‘I find myself in a very Kafka-esque fantasy situation. I have never attended sex parties at Dolphin Square or anywhere else. I have not been part of any rent-boy ring with Cabinet ministers, other Members of Parliament or generals or the military.’ Mr Proctor, 68, lives in the 16,000-acre grounds of Belvoir Castle (pictured), near Grantham in Leicestershire . He added: ‘I was a discreet person and regarded in the House of Commons as a very independent MP and a loner.’ Proctor also said he was keen to be interviewed by police as soon as possible to clear his name. Mr Proctor said that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of gross indecency in 1987 for offences relating to to the age of consent for homosexuality, which has since been lowered from 21 to 16 . He added: ‘I believe the number of victims grows by the day, and the number of alleged perpetrators – through death – diminishes. That is a problem. It’s certainly a problem for me. My problem is that I am still very much alive.’ Proctor, who represented Basildon and nearby Billericay, was an outspoken hard-right Tory but left Parliament after pleading guilty to gross indecency. The MP – who was given the nickname ‘Wacko’ – would order rent boys as young as 17 to call him ‘Sir’ or ‘Keith’ and pretend he was a headmaster as he caned them. He was fined just £1,450 but the case signalled the end of his career because his confession followed years of vehement denials. Two months before his court appearance it was revealed how Proctor was caught by security staff on holiday in Morocco with a naked 15-year-old local boy hiding under his bed. He later went to work for the Duke of Rutland as his private secretary and in recent years has been responsible for ‘public and park events’. The 1987 offences would no longer be crimes under current laws after the age of consent for homosexual activity changed from 21 to 16. Campaigning MP John Mann passed his dossier naming suspected Westminster paedophiles to police in December last year. The explosive list identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum who are allegedly linked to historic child abuse between 1970 and the late-1990s. Of these, nine are still alive, and are said to include four serving MPs, three former MPs, a member of the House of Lords and one high-ranking town hall figure. The document also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers, including at least two who allegedly went to ‘abuse parties’. The report names 14 Tory politicians, five Labour and three others. As a young councillor in South London, Mr Mann uncovered evidence a Tory Cabinet minister was allegedly involved. He alerted police but was told three months later that the inquiry was being shelved on the orders of ‘those at the top’.

"A dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown's Scottish seat and rob Ed Miliband of a Commons majority, according to a new poll last night. The study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral deadlock in May, with neither party able to govern alone. The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests the SNP is on course for a landslide at the General Election, winning as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats - up from just six at present. The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests the SNP is on course for a landslide at the General Election, winning as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats - up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including those of departing Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat, held by David Mundell. At Westminster the poll suggests Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year's independence referendum had thrown a 'giant spanner in Labour's works', although the party is forecast to win Tory seats south of the border. Of the eight Scottish seats polled, the SNP would gain six - including four from Labour - and tie with Mr Mundell, in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. 'It is hard to see things getting any worse for Labour in Scotland, while things are on a knife-edge elsewhere,' Lord Ashcroft said. 'But as things stand, Labour losses in Scotland could offset their gains from the Tories, leading to something close to a dead heat. 'This, then, is the battle: can the Conservatives fight back against Labour faster than Labour can fight back against the SNP?' Labour's leader in Scotland Jim Murphy (right) is facing an uphill battle to hang on to Labour's 40 seats north of the border . The SNP surge is on course to claim seats held by a string of household names, including those of departing Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling . The poll throws up the prospect of a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by Nicola Sturgeon's SNP - she has ruled out supporting a Tory government. The two pardicts ties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a Commons majority of just three. Former First Minister Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, has refused to rule out becoming a government minister in the country he tried to break up as part of any deal. And the SNP has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent. Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has carried out a series of polls in marginal Scottish constituencies . The new polling suggests that the SNP will make deep inroads into Labour's Scottish heartlands, and all but eradicate the Lib Dems north of the Border. Gordon Brown's Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the Nationalists a comfortable six-point lead. In Edinburgh South West, where former Chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll pre-another SNP win, on the back of a 22 per cent swing. In Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983, a 21.5 per cent swing to the Nationalists looks set to hand the seat to former SNP treasurer Ian Blackford. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, in Orkney and Shetland, could be left as the only Lib Dem MP in Scotland. New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire, despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the SNP. But, in this scenario, he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining. Mr Murphy last night said David Cameron would be 'rubbing his hands with glee' at the findings as they suggested the Nationalist surge could prevent a Labour victory. He added: 'We can't let David Cameron back into Downing Street by the back door. That would be a disaster for Scotland, but it looks like that is what might happen if these polls in Scotland are repeated on election day.' SNP election chief Angus Robertson described the findings as 'very encouraging' and showed the party was picking up seats across Scotland, including in areas that rejected independence, such as the Borders, where Mr Mundell is facing a knife-edge battle to cling on. A Scottish Tory spokesman said: 'This poll shows that the Scottish Conservatives are now in a real fight across Scotland. 'With the Liberal Democrat vote having collapsed completely, we offer Scots the opportunity to unite around a plan to finish the job of economic recovery and to secure Scotland's place in the UK - any other vote will let Ed Miliband into Downing Street, with Alex Salmond calling the shots.' A Scottish Lib Dem spokesman added: 'These polls show that Lib Dems are best placed to stop the SNP in the Highlands and the North East. The SNP have centralised services away from the Highlands and the North-east to the central belt.'","Study of marginal seats suggests election heading for deadlock in May .

"In-flight meals can be unappetising at the best of times so it’s always a good idea to bring along some snacks if you are going to be in the air for a while. The problem is, when you’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar, just how can you get your hands on it? Well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky, and captured the moment on camera. The pilots appear to be part of the US Navy, judging by their helmets, but little is known about the origin of the video. The pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator . Holding a Snickers chocolate bar in his hand, the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest. Waiting with an outstretched arm, as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot, the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands. Throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval. Floating in the air, the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand . On its way: The navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it . The fact that it was uploaded to an empty Youtube account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for Snickers. But it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun. Weightlessnes like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it. When in a state of free fall like the pilots, the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force. And since gravity cannot be felt without any other opposing forces, there is no sensation of it present. Success: After catching the chocolate bar the navigator celebrates and the pilot gives him the thumbs up .","The Snickers bar is released by the pilot and floats behind him .

"An Alice Springs couple that ditched five children and a baby kangaroo in a car for more than two hours in 40-degree heat so it could gamble and drink have dodged prosecution. The children, one of whom was just two years old, were freed from the car unharmed, but the joey had died by the time emergency services arrived. The incident is still to be investigated by the Department of Children and Families. A couple that left five children and a kangaroo joey alone in a car for more than two hours has avoided prosecution. Alice Springs police said the witnesses who spotted the car were the reason the incident avoided a 'far worse', tragic ending. Police first responded to calls about 'children trapped' about 1:30pm on Tuesday. 'Upon attendance, police located five children aged between two and 13 years who had been left in the car for over two hours,' Commander Chris Wilson said, according to the NT News. Police were alerted to the incident by passersby about 1:30pm, as the temperature soared into the forties. Kidsafe NT executive director Victoria Pollifrone said the scare should be serve as a wake up call and a catalyst for a change to state laws. 'The children were checked by St John Ambulance staff while the two adults looking after the kids were located inside the licensed premises.' Paramedics at the scene cleared the children of having suffered any harm. Kidsafe NT executive director Victoria Pollifrone said the scare should be serve as a wake up call and a catalyst for a change to state laws.

"A pair of conjoined twins born sharing a liver have been successfully separated in southwest China after an eight-hour operation. The twin sisters were born on October 30 last year joined at the stomach, but doctors said the operation had been success in what was a first for the city of Kunming, the capital of China's Yunnan Province. The girls' father Chen Fubin said his daughters were sent to the capital's hospital immediately after their birth in their hometown of Quijing City. Scroll down for video . The conjoined twins in China were born connected at the stomach and sharing a liver . Doctors separate the twin sisters during their surgery, which took about eight hours to complete . The twins were born on October 30 last year and were immediately taken to hospital. Here they are pictured prior to the surgery . Doctors pose for a photograph with the conjoined twins before operating to separate them . He said: 'We felt very sad when we saw them. We didn't expect them to be conjoined. We were worried about their health,' China Central Television reported. Doctors said administering the anesthesia was particularly difficult given their light weight, but little blood was lost and the two were recovering well in an intensive care unit. Last week, two ten-month-old conjoined baby girls from Texas survived a world-first operation to separate them. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac (the lining of the heart), diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis. A team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the girls. The 26-hour surgery was the first time twins conjoined at the chest and abdomen in this way had been successfully separated. These ten-month-old twins from Houston, Texas (pictured before the surgery), were connected at the chest and abdomen and shared several vital organs including the liver, lungs and intestines . Earlier this week it was also announced a pair of conjoined baby boys are expected to make a full recovery after being successfully separated in a nine-hour operation in Saudi Arabia. A team of surgeons led by the country's former Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah completed the difficult procedure in Riyadh. The twins, who were from the Republic of Yemen, were taken to Saudi Arabia to be operated on at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in the capital. During preliminary tests, the medical team discovered that the twins shared organs, including the intestines. The separation was the 35th performed on Siamese twins in the kingdom since 1990 on cases from more than 18 countries, including the Sudan, Yemen, Egypt, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, Morocco and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has a team of top surgeons in the separation of conjoined twins - with 30 successful cases over the past two decades.

In the middle: The garden's tea house centrepiece holds a collection of Samurai swords, sake jars, lanterns and other Japanese ornaments . Mr Verlander - who has entered the 2015 Shed of the Year competition - turned a disused railway cutting into a pretty pond with koi carp.

Other sheds entered for the annual competition include a castle, bar, nightclub, diner, beach hut, pirate ship, pagoda and chapel. They are located in areas from Cheshire to Northamptonshire and Surrey to Nottinghamshire – and entries are still being accepted until April 7. The competition, which celebrates the best of British sheds, invites 'sheddies' to enter their unusual shed creations for a chance to win £1,000. Retired print worker Mr Verlander said that he relied on library books and magazines for inspiration about all things Japanese. He said: ‘The end of my garden is in a dip from a railway cutting.

At the beginning, the garden was a wilderness. 'It has become a 30-year project, doing a bit more year by year. 'I got the idea of the Japanese bridge from a picture of one I saw in a library book. ‘I have had three bridges down the years as the first two were made from soft wood that rotted. 'I prune holly bushes and fir trees into different shapes to make the garden look more Japanese. ‘I have got two Buddhas and three statues of bald-headed monks. 'And five years ago, I saw a picture in a magazine featuring the Chelsea Flower Show of a traditional Japanese tea house. So I decided to create a Westernised version of it.’ Mr Verlander was quoted £7,000 by a local firm to build the tea house – so set about doing it himself for under £1,000.

The tea house also contains a tropical fish tank, TV and DVD player, sound system, bar, fridge - and a kettle. Mr Verlander said: ‘I have never actually been to Japan and I prefer ordinary tea, so I have Typhoo in the teahouse.  My wife Linda and I have the odd gin and tonic in there too. 'I collect Japanese ornaments for the tea house very cheaply from charity shops. 'I got some sake jars for only 30 pence each.

"Tim O'Connell and his wife (pictured here) were driven to their wits end by the rowdy fraternity members next door . A Texas fraternity at the Southern Methodist University has suspended eight members for terrorizing their neighbors. Security footage of rowdy Sigma Chi brothers filmed by Tim O'Connell, 42, reveals how they would urinate on his fence, write obscenities into the snow on his yard, spit on his house and throw raw meat onto his patio. Just like the Hollywood movie Neighbors, starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, the dispute began when O'Connell and his wife complained about the noise from the off-campus students, who lived in an upmarket home near to SMU. 'I brought it to their attention and said 'you can't do that.' They told me they pay rent and they can do whatever they want. It's their right,' O'Connell recounted to News 8. In a statement to address the behavior of their members, the Sigma Chi fraternity said that hopefully now the O'Connell's will be able to sleep better. 'The apology is just the first step in making amends to you for the tenants' actions. I am also working on various forms of punishment for the culprits,' wrote Steve Harrington, Sigma Chi chapter advisor, in an e-mail to O'Connell that was shared with News 8. Appalled by the actions of their neighbors, O'Connell and his wife set up a camera and caught the young men next door violating their property and hurling abuse their way. Warring: Tim O'Connell claims his life was made a misery living next door to Sigma Chi brothers who lived in the house on the right, while O'Connell lived in the house on the left . Like a movie: Tim O'Connell's experience was reminiscent of the Zac Efron and Seth Rogen comedy 'Neighbors' which featured a married couple battling a party-loving fraternity . O'Connell told News 8 the disgusting behavior escalated after he complained about their noise. In response to viewing the footage of their members urinating on O'Connells fence and writing f*** you into the snow on their front lawn, the fraternity have said they will also fine the members. 'I want to make this a learning opportunity for these men,' Harrington wrote in the e-mail to O'Connell. 'I believe that community service and charitable work and/or donations would show them a way to get out of themselves. I believe that being young and self-centered is the main contributor to the behavior they displayed, showing no regard for others. We need to teach them otherwise.' O'Connell claims he asked SMU for help before, but got no response. According to News 8 an investment firm is the owner of the the home and they admitted that O'Connell has had problems with the tennents before.

"A schoolboy drowned in a canal after slipping while playing a game of dare and walking along a gas pipe, as his father and grandfather had done when they were children, an inquest heard. Robbie Williamson, 11, had been about to reach the end of the pipe stretching over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley, Lancashire, when he slipped and hit his head on the canal banking. Knocked unconscious by the blow, he fell backwards into the water and although a passer-by, alerted by the screams of Robbie's friends, was able to pull him from the canal he died a short time later in hospital. Robbie Williamson, 11, drowned in a canal after slipping while playing a game of dare and walking along a gas pipe, as his father and grandfather had done when they were children, an inquest heard . Robbie had been about to reach the end of this pipe, which stretches over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley, Lancashire, when he slipped and hit his head on the canal banking . The Edwardian pipe, which was fitted in 1903, had remained exposed to danger from children's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006. Protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by National Grid 24 hours after the tragedy on April 22 last year to stop children attempting a similar challenge. An inquest at Burnley Coroner's Court was told that Robbie and his two friends had finished their lessons at Shuttleworth High School and had been on their way to meet others at a nearby cricket club. But on their way they spotted a gap in the railings of the Dugdale Bridge and climbed through to the pipe crossing. Robbie's father described him as 'an absolutely brilliant child' and that since his passing his house had been 'extremely quiet without him' The inquest was told it was a well known dare among school children to see if they could walk across the raised cast iron pipe in order to get to the other side of the canal. 'When they got towards the bridge there were some railings,' Detective Constable Wendy Rothwell of Lancashire Police told the  hearing. 'It's believed one said there was a gap in the railings and climbed through. It was sometimes a dare to see if they could walk across. The three boys decided to walk across, there was a conversation who will go first. 'Listening to the children it seems to be a dare possibly between children.' She told the inquest that Robbie went second and he and one of the friends walked with their backs to the wall as they made their way across. 'There were rivets on the pipe which they had to step over and the boys spoke of the pipe being 'a bit slippy.' The officer added: 'As they approached the far end of the bridge one said that he is about to climb down onto the opposite ledge and hears a shout from Robbie and he falls into the water. He strikes himself on the bank of the canal before falling backwards into the water.' Robbie's father, Dean Williamson, and his stepmother Clare lay flowers at the scene following his death . More members of Robbie's family pay their respects to the 11-year-old, who died in April last year . The boys then climbed down and on seeing Robbie in the water screamed for help, as one ran to find assistance. Peter Graham, who heard the children's' pleas said: 'I could see a body lying face down in the canal. I jumped in. I grabbed the child and said, ""help me get him out"".' He added that Robbie had appeared 'lifeless', with his eyes closed, and did not appear to be breathing. As he waited for paramedics to arrive, Mr Graham began CPR  and Robbie was then taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital. He was placed in a medically induced coma but suffered a cardiac arrest and died later that night. Tests showed he died from drowning and a head injury. The Edwardian pipe, which was fitted in 1903, had remained exposed to danger from children's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006 . These protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by National Grid 24 hours after the tragedy on April 22 last year to stop children attempting as similar challenge . Robbie's father Dean Williamson told the inquest that as a child he had crossed the pipe, as had his own father, but he did not know Robbie had been scaling it. He told the inquest that had he known of his son's activities he would have 'told him off'. 'I didn't want him to do it, obviously if I'd found out I would have really told him off,' Mr Williamson said. He added that despite the iron shield being installed, children could still jump down onto the pipe. 'That shield that they have put on, you can still climb round,' he said. 'Why can't they slope the pipe so there would be no climbing at all, there would be no access. If sloped you have no chance to get onto it. You can still drop onto it.' Tributes left at the scene where Robbie died . In a statement read to the court, Mr Williamson described his son as 'an absolutely brilliant child' and that since his passing his house had been, 'extremely quiet without him'. He added that Robbie had 'absolutely loved life' and had been an outdoors type of child. Year 7 pupil Robbie had only started at his secondary school the day before his death. Representatives from the National Grid said they had believed that the pipe had been underground and was not aware that it was in fact exposed until after the accident - despite work being carried out at the location in 2001, 2004 and 2006. 'Some of our crossings have contact details around the site, this one didn't,' said National Grid's engineering policy manager Ian Aldridge. 'You wouldn't have known who to contact.' The inquest was told there had been no complaints about the pipe to Health and Safety or the National Grid. Coroner Mr Richard Taylor recorded a conclusion of accidental death said he would be contacting other gas and utility companies to report the incident in order to prevent similar tragedies. He added: 'There may be exposed, raised pipe works for which you are responsible either attached to bridges or otherwise, that are accessible to members of the public.' 'The loss of a child is the hardest to bear. We who have heard the evidence today can't possibly appreciate your grief, we can only share it with you. After the inquest Ruth Trippier, speaking on behalf of Robbie's family, said: 'Today has been a great ordeal for them and understandably it hasn't actually allayed any other disquiet about the circumstances that led to the accident. They are glad that National Grid are now, albeit too late for Robbie, taking steps to prevent it from happening again. These unguarded pipe crossings are just an accident waiting to happen.' National Grid said: 'We have installed protection on the pipe over Dugdale Bridge and have carried out a thorough review of all the other pipe crossings we own to see if there is a need for additional measures to be taken to prevent access. We will share details of our review with the wider gas industry. 'Our investigations found we had no record of anyone contacting us or our predecessor companies to report an issue with children climbing on this pipe.'","Robbie Williamson, 11, hit his head and fell into Leeds and Liverpool canal .

"Bungling: Stewart Garner suffered a grazed chin after being tackled to the ground by Paul Thomas . A bungling burglar was spotted and caught by his victim - because of the graze on his chin from when the pair had grappled the day before. Stewart Garner suffered facial injuries when he was tackled to the ground after Paul Thomas caught him in his home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Garner, 49, fled the house after grabbing £8 in cash and a £65 pair of trainers from the kitchen counter of the property in Abbey Hulton. But the thief returned to the home 12 hours later and bumped into Mr Thomas, who recognised his grazed chin and distinctive limp. The father-of-two confronted Garner and managed to detain him until the police arrived. Officers then arrested him on suspicion of burglary. Garner - who has 43 previous convictions - was jailed for two years and four months after he admitted burglary. He asked for four other offences to be taken into consideration. Sentencing him at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge David Fletcher said: 'You are going to have to think very hard about how you deal with your life on your release from prison. 'Nobody is too old to change. If you do not, the rest of your life will be continued institutionalisation, as it has been for the last 33 years.' The court heard Mr Thomas had chased Garner through his home after catching him rummaging around his kitchen at 8.30pm on November 26 last year. The next morning Mr Thomas and his 24-year-old partner were waiting for their son's school taxi when they recognised Garner walk past their house. Speaking after the case, Mr Thomas said: 'What are the odds of us seeing the burglar walk past our house the very next day? 'It was pure chance he walked past at that moment. 'I could tell it was him because he had a grazed chin and I was determined to make sure he was jailed so he can't do this again. 'I knew it was him straight away but I made him remove his hood to be sure. Garner - who has 43 previous convictions - was jailed for two years and four months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after he admitted burglary . 'He kept protesting his innocence but I kept him talking until the cops showed up. I basically did the police's job for them. 'It didn't cross my mind that he might be dangerous. It was my instinct to protect my family but I heard my little girl shouting so I went back. 'It's not a long sentence considering he's a repeat offender. I'm just glad I can give people peace of mind knowing he can't do anything while behind bars.'","Stewart Garner had broken into the home of Paul Thomas in Stoke-on-Trent .

"The family of Private Cheryl James, 18, pictured, died from a single gunshot wound to the head at Deepcut Army Barracks in Surrey in 1995 . A female soldier was subjected to sexual violence before her death at Deepcut Army base in November 1995, it has been claimed. Private Cheryl James was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002. The 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head. An army investigation ruled that Pte James took her own life, while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death. Now Pte James' family want a new inquest following the discovery of new evidence which could provide a different explanation for the tragedy. Last July, the family were successful being granted a new inquest, but the hearing his being delayed by Surrey Police. The family's legal team claim that new ballistics evidence as well as claims of bullying and sexual violence in the weeks leading up to Pte James' death. The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbigshire, north Wales died on November 27, 1995. She suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose. Ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by Pte James could have been self inflicted. Just five months before Pte James' death, Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest. The army maintained that Pte Benton took his own life in June 1995, despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range. In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London suffered two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty. Pte James was one of four young army recruits to have died at Deepcut Army Barracks, pictured . Doreen and Des James , pictured, want a new inquest to find out what happened to their daughter in 1995 . On March 23, 2002, Private James Collison, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound to the chin. Once again the army insisted that another young recruit had taken their own life. Although the families of the dead soldiers believe that authorities are trying to cover up the real cause of the deaths. During the most recent hearing, Alison Foster QC told the High Court: 'We will present shocking details which will pertain only to this girl. Private Sean Benton . The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide. Private Cheryl James . The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death. Private Geoff Gray . The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area. Private James Collinson . The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. An inquest in February 2006 recorded an open verdict . 'We will be looking at the circumstances surrounding Cheryl's death including ballistics, harassment and sexual violence towards her.' Pte James' family want to have their daughter's body exhumed for a new examination which they hope prove that the young recruit did not take her own life. The 20-year-long legal battle is being supported by Liberty. Pte James' family are anxious that the new inquest into their daughter's death is opened as quickly as is reasonably possible. But Surrey Police want the inquiry delayed as the families of the three other recruits may wish to reopen their inquests. Pte James had been stationed at the controversial Deepcut Barracks near Frimley in Surrey for just 11 days at the time of her death as part of the Royal Logistics Corps. She was found on November 27, 1995 at 8.30am near her guard post. The was armed with a standard-issue SA80 rifle. Surrey Police conducted their own investigation into the death which formed part of a 44-volume case file. It included statements, documents, notes, photographs and forensic evidence. Liberty successfully managed to force Surrey Police, using the Human Rights Act, to hand over the dossier, which is central to the latest legal bid. Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: 'Cheryl died in 1995. Surrey Police held onto all the sensitive material about Cheryl’s death, refusing to hand it over to the family until 2012 – and then only under threat of litigation using the Human Rights Act. 'The content of the disclosure is shocking and it was on the basis of that evidence that the High Court ordered a fresh inquest. 'After almost 20 years her case is finally ready to proceed. 'That it should now be Surrey Police – again – that is standing in the way of the investigation by asking for the case to be delayed is deeply upsetting to Cheryl’s parents.' An independent investigation into the four deaths published in 2006 found 'clear evidence of found abuse', 'institutional failings' and a 'culture of intimidation' at Deepcut Barracks. But the report, which had been commissioned by the Ministry of Defence found that Pte James and her comrades had not been 'bullied to death' and had probably taken their own lives. Last July, Mr Justice Mitting and Judge Peter Thorton granted permission for a new inquest into Pte James' death. After reviewing the most recent evidence, they agreed there had been 'an insufficiency of inquiry' during the 1995 inquest and quashed the open verdict. Judge Thornton added: 'The discovery of new facts or evidence made a fresh investigation including a fresh inquest necessary or desirable in the interests of justice.' A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said: 'Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which Pte Cheryl James died. 'The Force continues to provide voluntary disclosure of documents relating to Pte James and has as a dedicated team to complete this as quickly and effectively as possible. 'At a pre inquest review on February 27th, His Honour Justice Barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of Pte Cheryl James, Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson, together or individually. 'This was raised as a matter for consideration and Surrey Police will fully support the coronial process. Our thoughts remain with the family of Pte James.'","Private Cheryl James died at Deepcut Barracks on November 27, 1995 .

"Condemned Australian Bali Nine drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are 'talking to each other through their cell walls and with another prisoner due for execution' in a jail on Indonesia's Death Island, Daily Mail Australia has learned. After being transferred from Bali to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran are being held in semi-isolation cells in Besi prison on the island. It's where the men will spend at least ten days, with preparations for their execution having been delayed. Scroll down for video . The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five-hour drive to Cilacap . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan . Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not signalled their 72-hours notice period has begun. 'About notification, it's a minimum three days before the execution,' he said. 'It could be 10 days.' His comments come after President Joko Widodo reportedly told an al-Jazeera reporter off camera that the executions would not be this week. Mr Joko on Thursday responded to a prisoner swap arrangement floated by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in her last push to save Chan and Sukumaran from the firing squad. The president laughed when asked about a swap arrangement. 'No way,' he said. He was determined that Chan and Sukumaran be executed. 'Look at how many die, our young generation,' he said, referring to victims of drugs. 'We have to look at the future.' In contrast to their group cells at Kerobokan jail in Bali, the men now have a cell each but with little in it other than a toilet and tiny washing area. They reportedly are allowed an hour outside their cells in a secured exercise area and have been medically checked since their arrival. They have been talking through the prison cell walls with another death row inmate, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who was also transferred to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, although without the massive display of force for the Australians. It is not known whether Chan and Sukumaran's families - who were due to arrive in the island's port town of Cilacap on Thursday - will be able to visit the men on Friday, when visits are usually banned. Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan on Thursday. Daily Mail Australia has learned Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman are taking to each other through their cell walls in semi-isolation . Angelita Muxfeldt (centre) talks with officials as she heads off to visit Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte who is on death row . Sukuraman (left) and Chan (right) were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali into Australia . Armed military troops have increased their presence around Nusakambangan following the transfer of the Bali Nine duo . A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan inside the plane before take off . Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo . 'They are still in isolation, they wouldn't let me visit them. No one can visit them,' he said. The last time Mirdjaja spoke to Chan was on Tuesday afternoon, just hours before he was moved from Kerobokan. 'Andrew said he wanted to be in the company of his family and he said I am his family,' Mirdjaja said. 'Myuran asked me to help with his exhibition at the Hard Rock Hotel on Saturday.' Mirdjaja said he would be staying at Cilacap for 'a few days' in the hopes that he would be granted access to see Chan and Sukuraman. 'I can't describe how I feel. It's really, really bad. It's really hard for me,' Mirdjaja said. This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions . It is located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan . The Australians' newest cellmate Raheem Salami, convicted on trafficking 5.3kg of heroin through Surabaya airport in East Java in 1998, was transferred to Nusakambangan from a prison in that region. Chan, Sukumaran and Salami are now occupying three of the four cells in Besi prison where they are allowed a small amount of clothes, Chan his Bible and virtually nothing else. They are expected to be transferred to Batu or 'stone' prison on the island and into a complete isolation area at least 72 hours before the announced execution date. There are a total of 10 death row drug dealers slated to be executed simultaneously, Chan, Sukumaran, an Indonesian, a Filipino woman and six other male foreigners. This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday . Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Kerobokan prison . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in Central Java . Indonesia is already under fire over their practice of the death penalty but pictures of a smiling police commissioner posing with the Bali Nine duo has landed them in more hot water. Djoko Hariutomo was seen posing with the pair before their plane takes off on the two-hour flight to Cilacap. The police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar had his hand on Andrew Chan's back and smiling for the camera. He appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer. This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold the Australians . Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation . Chan and Sukuraman are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms. The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers. And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.","The Bali Nine pair are in their own cells with a toilet and a washing area .

"The wrong man was cremated in place of MEP Philip Bradbourn (pictured) at his funeral in January . A mortuary cremated the wrong body at the funeral of Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn in an astonishing mix-up which saw the politician's family bid farewell to a stranger with the same name. Mr Bradbourn died shortly after being re-elected as an MEP for the West Midlands. The 63-year-old had been battling bowel cancer. But at a ceremony at Bushbury Crematorium in Wolverhampton on January 16, another man's body was cremated in his place. The blunder came after officials confused the politician's coffin with that of Philip Bradburn, an unknown man whose own funeral had been arranged by social services. Mr Bradbourn's family slammed the mix-up after having to hold a second funeral for him the following month. The 63-year-old died in Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield in December after battling the disease. His body was taken to the Central England Co-operative Funeralcare mortuary, where another man, Philip Bradburn, also lay. Mr Bradburn died in Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth's Hospital around the same time. A month after the funeral, Mr Bradbourn's family were told of the blunder. Earlier this week politicians gathered to pay their respects to Mr Bradbourn at St Peter’s Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton. Yesterday Tory West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre spoke of her horror at learning her former colleague's body had been mixed up. 'I attended Phil’s funeral in January and it was a smallish affair which was what Phil wanted. It was very moving and his friends planned a memorial day in March. 'I was telephoned by his executor informing me that a man with a very similar name had died and his body was mistakenly cremated. Mr Bradbourn died shortly after being re-elected as an MEP for the West Midlands. The 63-year-old had been battling bowel cancer . Mr Bradbourn was taken to Bushbury Cemetery and Crematorium in Wolverhampton (above) after losing his battle with cancer . The 63-year-old was being treated at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield which has launched an investigation into the incident . Another man, called Philip Bradburn, had also been taken to the crematorium from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (above) 'It is deeply distressing and my first thought was there has been a family who have been robbed of a funeral for their loved one. 'My understanding is that the gentleman did not have any close family or relatives but nevertheless this should not be allowed to happen. Mr Bradbourn (pictured in 2005) spent 20 years in local government before becoming a political adviser . 'The hospital trust has launched an investigation and I know that serious questions have been sent right to the top of Government on this issue.' It is not clear whose shoulders the mistake falls on but all parties involved said they were conducting investigations into the incident. 'We are very sorry that this has happened - we are carrying out a full and urgent investigation between all the parties involved. 'This is a rare incident and we are offering support to those close to the deceased,' said Andrew Catto of Good Hope Hospital, where Mr Bradbourn died. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Queen Elizabeth, where Mr Bradburn died, said: 'We have been asked to be part of the investigation into this unfortunate incident and will fully co-operate with the parties involved.' A spokesperson for Central England Co-operative Funeralcare said: 'The Society is supporting one of our partners in a full and open an investigation, but is not able to comment further while the investigation is ongoing.' Mr Bradbourn had been a town planning officer in local government for more than 20 years before becoming political adviser to the Conservative group at Wolverhampton City Council. He was awarded an OBE in 1994 for his public and political service. At the time of his death Prime Minister David Cameron led tributes to the 'dedicated' and 'well-respected' politician who served in the European Parliament since 1999. A memorial service was held at St Peter's Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton (above) for the politician in March with senior Westminster figures among those there .","Philip Bradbourn, 63, died in December after battling bowel cancer .

"Tony Blair has given the Labour Party more than £100,000, in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with Ed Miliband. The former prime minister, who has a strained relationship with the Labour leader, announced last night that he had given £1,000 to each of the 106 candidates fighting target seats for the party in May. In a letter to candidates, Mr Blair said: ‘I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital. This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, right, has given the Labour Party more than £100,000 in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with Ed Miliband, left . ‘As one of our key seat candidates, you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government.’ Labour indicated that Mr Blair will also play a role in the election campaign, despite having made clear that he disapproves of Mr Miliband’s Left-wing stance. The donation represents a relatively modest gesture from Mr Blair, whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £100million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high-profile property deals. The source of the cash is likely to provoke unease among some Labour MPs, given controversy over Mr Blair’s dealings with dictatorships such as Kazakhstan, and the fact that he remains under the shadow of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, which is due to be published after the election. His intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his creation, New Labour. The donation is a relatively modest gesture given controversy over Mr Blair's dealings with Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, pictured . Although Mr Blair has said he has no desire to return to front-line politics in the UK, friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him. Mr Blair is known to have backed Mr Miliband’s elder brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010. And he has made little secret of his dismay at the way Ed Miliband has dragged Labour to the Left and alienated business. In December, Mr Blair warned that the tactics were likely to lose Labour the election, telling the Economist magazine that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ He ‘clarified’ his comments the next day, saying he had been ‘misinterpreted’ and that he wanted and expected Mr Miliband to seize power. A Labour spokesman last night welcomed Mr Blair’s intervention, adding: ‘We’re delighted that Tony Blair has given so generously to the local campaigns in the battleground seats our party is targeting at this general election. ‘Our campaign is not based on big posters, talking over the heads of voters, or the sound and fury of Westminster politics. It is based on millions of conversations with people on their doorsteps and in their communities.’","Former PM has given £1,000 each to 106 candidates fighting target seats .

"Wellesley College has revised its admissions policy to formally allow transgender students who identify as female. The women's-only liberal arts school in Massachusetts - which costs roughly $59,000 per year to attend - never explicitly banned transgender applicants. However, it said in a statement on its website Thursday that it felt compelled to clarify its policies 'in an era of a changing understanding of gender identity.' Wellesley College (the campus seen above) has revised its admissions policy to formally allow transgender students who identify as female . The college’s board of trustees approved the new policy on Wednesday night. Under the new guidelines, Wellesley College says it will consider for admission any applicant who 'lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman.' It adds that if gender identity is not 'clearly reflected' in application materials, the college will request additional information 'that may include a letter from a parent, healthcare provider, teacher, or clergy.' The updated code will come into effect in time for the next admission cycle for the Class of 2020. The move follows similar policy changes at all-women's colleges such as Mills College in California, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and Mount Holyoke and Simmons College, both in Massachusetts. Wellesley said it will not accept applications from transgender men, but would 'continue to support' any student who decides she no longer identifies as a woman during her education there. Wellesley, which was founded with the intention to prepare women for 'great conflicts' and 'vast reforms in social life' first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875. Prominent graduates include former First Lady Hillary Clinton and ABC news anchor Diane Sawyer.","The women's-only liberal arts school in Massachusetts, which costs roughly $59,000 per year, never explicitly banned transgender applicants .

"Thousands of furious Indians swarmed the streets to publicly - and violently - kill a man who was suspected of being a rapist. The pictures have emerged after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. Taking justice into their own hands, the angry crowd was a terrifying portrayal of the country's increasingly aggressive stance against sexual violence. Scroll down for video . Furious: Several thousand people gathered as the man (pictured, top) accused of raping a girl last month was mercilessly beaten to death . Chilling: Despite the horrific and public nature of the attack, the violent mob is an embodiment of the country's increasingly tough stance towards - and disgust for sexual violence . Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image . Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later . It overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man who apparently raped a female student multiple times last month. According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. He has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express. The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. 'A mass protest rally against the rape was held at Dimapur  this morning after which students and angry people forced into the district jail and managed to pull out the accused,' the Press Trust of India news agency said. It has been reported the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower. It's said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. The police later removed the man's body. 'The situation is very tense,' town police superintendent Meren Jamir told the Hindustan Times. 'We are trying our very best to restore order.' Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express . Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur today by those who oppose the rape of a student last month . India is already in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student. The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country. Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame . The Indian government has also asked  YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker. But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. India's Daughter was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack. The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday. But it was dropped by NDTV following the ban and the BBC brought forward its screening to last night, citing a strong public interest. Today India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it. 'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.' The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India online. Today the victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think. 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it . The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'. 'Everyone should watch the film,' he said. 'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?' The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India. 'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.' Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012. Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. Protest: The woman's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . Mass protests: The December 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young physiotherapy student highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in India and led to a major reform of the country's rape laws . Yet many still hold the firm belief that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after ""doing her"", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted: 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night. 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. 'Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. About 20 per cent of girls are good.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Caution: Vince Cable urged universities to 'think twice' about vice-chancellors' pay . Vince Cable has urged universities to ‘think twice’ about vice-chancellors’ pay after it emerged that their average earnings topped £260,000 last year. The Business Secretary said large pay rises would be ‘hard to swallow’ when many institutions were short of funding. Figures obtained from 150 institutions by the University and College Union under the Freedom of Information Act show the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290. A total of 18 vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by more than 10 per cent, the lecturers’ union calculated. The best paid was the former vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, Professor Neil Gorman, who pocketed £623,000 with bonuses accrued over the past five years. The UCU also found the average expenditure on flights for university leaders was £9,705, with many travelling first or business class. The average for hotel accommodation was £3,202 and personal expenses £3,112. Funding shortages: Graduates leave the the Great Hall after a degree ceremony at Birmingham University (stock photo). Figures reveal vice-chancellors earned an average £260,000 last year . Mr Cable said yesterday: ‘At a time when most university staff are seeing modest wage increases, if any at all, news of these large pay rises for university bosses will be hard to swallow. It would be wise for the sector to think twice before increasing vice-chancellors’ salaries.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Soaraway pay at the top has been matched by zero-hours contracts and big real-wage falls for staff across higher education.’ Last year, ministers said they had serious concerns about the ‘substantial upward drift’ of salaries and that university leaders should show ‘much greater restraint’. UK universities are independent institutions but they receive public grants, and students receive government loans to pay tuition fees. UCU asked 155 UK universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors’ pay packages, including benefits and pensions, as well as money spent on air fares, hotel accommodation and personal expenses, for the year ending July 31 last year. Around 16 per cent- 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information. The findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290 based on data from 150 institutions. The average expenditure on flights for university leaders, with information from 128 universities, was £9,705.75. The most was spent by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which paid out £59,811.14 on flights for director Professor Craig Calhoun. Overall just over two-thirds of air fares were for first or business class, UCU said, according to data from 114 universities. The average spend on hotel accommodation during 2013/14 was £3,202.05, based on data from 122 institutions. The most was spent by Glasgow Caledonian University for Professor Pamela Gillies at £27,271.13. The average received by vice-chancellors in personal expenses was £3,112.61, according to information gathered from 125 universities. The highest amount - £33,526 - was given to Professor Gavin Henderson of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Richard Bullock, chairman of Nottingham Trent University’s board of governors, said: ‘Former vice-chancellor Professor Neil Gorman received a 2 per cent salary pay rise in his final year as vice-chancellor. ‘The additional monies reported in this year’s financial accounts were paid under a scheme that was instigated in 2008 to operate over a five-year period. 'This scheme was put in place by the board following independent, external advice, at a critical time in the university’s strategic development which required continuity of leadership. 'The board were keen to retain Professor Gorman for this five-year period following a very successful initial five years.’ He added that monies accrued annually were subject to meeting clear terms, with accruals declared each year. An LSE spokesman said: ‘A key part of the director’s role at LSE is to maintain the array of international relationships and establish new links with universities, businesses and non-governmental organisations around the world. 'Inevitably this involves a significant amount of international travel. None of this travel is in first class.’ A Glasgow Caledonian spokeswoman said: ‘GCU is the first Scottish university to open a campus in London and it established the UK’s first campus in New York in 2013/14, with further key partnerships in Bangladesh, Oman and South Africa. ‘This has inevitably required extended trips to our overseas locations and having increased costs. The university is transparent about expenses incurred.’","Large pay rises 'hard to swallow' when many institutions short on funding .

"When Cindy Batchelor looks back at her first encounter with money, she remembers counting each cent of her single mother's waitressing tips, at the age of eight, to see what groceries they could afford to buy that day. Then, only two years ago, she found herself stepping into the role of a single mother herself when her husband tragically died in a paragliding accident. Now, a head figure of one of the country's biggest banks, the executive general manager of National Australia Bank (NAB) has defied the odds and is helping other women do the same. Cindy Batchelor (far right) and her three siblings (pictured) were raised by their mother (left) and grandmother (right) after being abandoned by their father. 'We were very much living on the edge of the poverty line. Mum got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips. She would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money,' Ms Batchelor said . Ms Batchelor, who works with business women around the country, first recognised the importance of women being financially literate and independent at an age far younger than most. Decades later, as the executive general manager of NAB Business, Ms Batchelor is inspiring other women to overcome their adversaries . Her mother, Elizabeth, was left to raise four children on her own when Ms Batchelor's father abandoned them, deciding he no longer wanted to see his children. 'Mum is very bright, but she was not educated. She had left school at 16 and never worked because she was the wife of a doctor in the 1960s with a young family,' Ms Batchelor told Daily Mail Australia. 'She found herself with four children under the age of nine by the time she was 27, so she had to quickly work out how to manage money and a household. 'She became a waitress and started studying. She got a scholarship for a bachelor in science and law and was waitressing at night. We were very much living on the edge of the poverty line and as the eldest daughter I stepped into the surrogate mother role. 'Mum got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips. She would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money.' Ms Batchelor 's family situation meant that she was forced to become financially independent at 19 when she began studying an accounting degree by night and working through the day, leading her into a human resources position that lasted for 20 years. It was watching her mother's financial confidence and literacy grow that helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband John died in 2013. Pictured with her two son's, Jackson and Billy, Ms Batchelor found herself stepping into the role of a single mother . Watching her mother's financial confidence and literacy grow is one of the reasons Ms Batchelor was proud to launch NAB's Start Counting program, which focuses on teaching women from all walks of life strong money and life habits while instilling financial confidence and awareness. But it also helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband John died in 2013. 'He was fond of flying, but paragliding was his passion. He spent seven years doing it and it was one of those days when it was a beautiful day and the sky was blue, but it's all about the wind,' Ms Batchelor said. 'Half of his paraglider collapsed and he wasn't able to recover that and he was too close to the ground. It wasn't a lack of experience, it was that moment in nature that you can't control. Grateful for the strong women in her life, including her mother and grandmother, Ms Batchelor said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly . 'The hardest thing I've ever done in my life was telling their children they'd lost their father - not through something they couldn't prepare for, but just so suddenly. 'It has been challenging, and having children living through that means I think back to mum and how my father wasn't there, and now I have to step into that void for my own children.' 'I go back to my roots and who my mum was and the values and skills she taught me - she's 71 and retired now and lives on the Sunshine Coast and she still rings me once a fortnight to tell me what's happening on the share market and what Bloomberg says today.' Grateful for the strong women in her life, including her mother and grandmother, Ms Batchelor said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly. Aside from the financial programs she supports, the mother-of-two has now been a supporter of the Women's Agenda Leadership Awards for the past three years. She has supported the Women's Agenda Leadership Awards for the last three years and helped to launch NAB's Start Counting program, which focuses on teaching women from all walks of life strong money and life habits while instilling financial confidence and awareness . The awards honour womens' achievements in businesses and the community and saw the likes of Lucy Perry and Tracy Howe recognised for their work with Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia (Australia) and the NSW Council of Social Services, respectively. 'We had 400 people together sharing stories about positivity where women are making a difference, supporting each other and creating really powerful networks,' Ms Batchelor said. 'Women are 50 per cent of the population; we have to make sure we give them opportunities to shine. Historically and culturally women haven't been supported, rewarded or recognise for their achievements. We need to create more environments for that, for them to share the great things they do.'","Cindy Batchelor's father abandoned their family in the 60s, leaving her jobless mother to raise four children on her own .

"A sticky-fingered octopus has turned the tables on a videographer at a Vermont research lab who was trying to record him, snatching his camera and snapping a few photos of his own. Benjamin Savard, a digital media producer at Middlebury College, was testing out a GoPro camera in the octopus tank Monday when the mischievous sea creature took matters into his own tentacles. After the impromptu photo session, the California two-spot octopus tried to take a bite out of the pricey camera submerged in his tank, but eventually lost interest. Say, 'Cheese'! Benjamin Savard (bottom), a digital media producer at Middlebury College in Vermont, was testing out a GoPro camera in the octopus tank when the mischievous creature grabbed the device . Camera shy: The octopus reached a tentacle and grabbed hold of the camera in its waterproof casing . Photographer turns subject: The cephalopod swung the GoPro device around and trained it on Savard and a female researcher . Experiment: Savard (left and right) was hoping to make a sequence of images to accompany research work on the behavior of the California two-spot octopus - a species known for its intelligence and friendly demeanor . In focus: After a few blurry attempts, the octopus got this crystal-clear shot of the filmmaker . Neuroscience students at Middlebury College have been studying whether the octopus species, known for their intelligence and friendly disposition, can open boxes containing food more quickly by observing their eight-legged peers. Savard placed the GoPro camera in a waterproof casing and set it to automatically take rapid-fire photos per second before placing it inside the octopus tank, reported the Washington Post. The filmmaker was hoping to make a sequence of images to accompany the students' research work on cephalopod behavior. Most octopuses in the reservoir ignored the device, but one feisty specimen took hold of the camera and trained it on Savard, snapping a couple of good-quality pictures showing the bespectacled producer dressed in a white lab coat. Savard shared the snapshots on Reddit, where they became a huge hit with users. Some wary redditors have accused Savard of staging the photo shoot, but the filmmaker assured them that it was not a stunt. As proof, he posted the entire series of photos featuring the moment the critter reaches a tentacle to grab the camera, turns it around and trains it on Savard and a female researcher standing behind him. Savard later compiled the photo sequence into a gif. ‘I was just trying to brainstorm different ideas of how to show off the kind of unique research that’s going on here and in ways that would be engaging,’ Savard explained on Reddit. ‘I think the octopus’s timing was great. I was just in the right place at the right time.’ Snack attack: After the impromptu photo shoot, the sassy octopus tried to take a bite out of the pricey camera submerged in his tank .

"A fallen tree branch became much more frightening when it not only held up traffic, but began to slither. Jette Petersen and her family had just moved to Davidson on the Northern Beaches and did not expect a welcoming present so large. Petersen told Daily Mail Australia she heard a car on the street slam on its brakes and assumed a branch had fallen down from a tree, but then it moved. ""I screamed and called out to the whole family that there was a huge snake on the street,"" she said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The 2 metre long python shocked the locals when it slithered into the piping of the car before making its way to the roof and stretching out . ""We all went out to have a closer look and it got scared of us all and the closest place to escape was under my car."" The 2 metre long giant slithered under the bonnet and took refuge within the pipes before again emerging and stretching along the entire roof of the car. Petersen had called an Australian Wildlife Rescue Organisation (WIRES) representative who told her volunteers were too busy to respond immediately so they chose to act themselves. ""I screamed and called out to the whole family that there was a huge snake on the street,"" Petersen said . The family attempted to hose the python out of the piping, to no avail. With a neighbour's advice, they then took to spraying it with a small dose of vinegar which irritated the snake enough to slither out of the bonnet. It moved toward another elderly neighbour's home to whom she warned of the incoming but were not phased as pythons were a regular occurrence in Davidson. Petersen said her family were very curious about the snake while she was less impressed. The Danish family were fascinated by the python as snakes were not a frequent occurence . ""At 12, 14 16 and 19, the children were fascinated,"" she said. ""But I hate snakes and it was really really long."" This is Petersen's fourth snake encounter since moving to Australia from Denmark and she says her friends were amazed by the video. ""We don't have snakes in Denmark,"" she said. ""We used to have two diamond pythons living in our roof in our first house in Killarney Heights and then not long after I saw a red bellied black snake on my run about Narrabeen Lakes that was just laying on the path in front of me.""","Jette Petersen was shocked to find a giant python holding up traffic .

"A survivor of the Boston Marathon bombing has posted an open letter to bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on her Facebook page, just hours after testifying on the first day of the 21-year-old's trial. Rebekah Gregory, 27, from Houston, Texas, lost half of her left leg after 18 surgeries following the April 15, 2013 blast. She and her 5-year-old son, Noah, had been watching her boyfriend's mother compete in the race when the explosion occurred. Scroll down for video . Rebekah Gregory, pictured left in a courtroom sketch from Wednesday, who lost half of her left leg as a result of the bomb, wrote a lengthy Facebook post in which she said seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she isn't afraid anymore . On Wednesday night she wrote a lengthy post in which she said seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her come to terms with what happened that fateful day. 'TODAY...I looked at you right in the face....and realized I wasn't afraid anymore,' Gregory wrote. 'And today I realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that I needed all along.' The emotional letter has been shared more than 2,500 times and received over 11,000 'likes' within hours of being posted. Earlier Ms Gregory had told the court that the last thing she remembered before the explosion was entertaining Noah who was bored watching the runners. She said that the force of the blast had thrown her backwards and immediately she began looking for her son - but realized she had bones sticking out of her legs and arms and flesh hanging from her body. 'My bones were lying next to me on the sidewalk,' Gregory recalled during her testimony in federal court in Boston. 'I felt that was the day I would die.' Ms Gregory's boyfriend Pete DiMartino, 30, was also present at the bombing and suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast . She told the court that she could hear Noah screaming 'mommy' and asked God to take her but not her son. Ms Gregory began to weep as she said that as she scanned for Noah, she saw the body of Krystle Campbell lying behind her. She recalled that an emergency responder told her she was going to be OK then yelled: 'We have an amputee!' Several jurors were close to tears as Ms Gregory told the court that she still has shrapnel in her body and each time a piece works its way to the surface, she will have an operation. Her son Noah suffered a shrapnel injury to his leg and head. Ms Gregory was shown a photo in court in which she was able to identify herself and her family with bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, standing directly behind. Ms Gregory's boyfriend Pete DiMartino, 30, was also present and suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast. The couple announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage. Gregory and DiMartino announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage, left, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is on trail for his role in the marathon blast on April 15, 2013 . Despite getting married and staying together as Gregory had her leg amputated, the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain, The People reported. Gregory, who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation, told The People: 'After the decision was made to amputate my leg in November, I found myself having to make an even more painful choice – to separate from my husband Pete. 'Over the last several months I've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast-forward on our relationship that we each handled differently. 'While my heart is beyond broken, I have a certain peace knowing from day one, I truly gave it my all, and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage, and my commitment before God. 'I still love Pete with all of my heart and ask that everyone respect our privacy as we try to figure out our next steps. 'As for now, I am focused on doing what I feel is best for my son and I, and will concentrate my time on healing, both physically and emotionally.' The couple had a fairytale wedding, documented on the season finale of TLC's popular reality show, Say Yes To The Dress. They wed in Asheville, North Carolina, in April last year then moved to Houston, Texas. Seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she isn't afraid of him anymore, wrote Rebekah Gregory . Dear Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, . My name is Rebekah Gregory. We don't really know each other and never will. But over the last two years, I have seen your face not only in pictures, but in almost every one of my nightmares. Moments before the first blast, your stupid backpack even brushed up against my arm, but I doubt you remember because I am no one to you. A complete stranger. And although I was merely just a blip on your radar, (someone that happened to be standing 3 feet from your designated 'good spot' for a bomb), you have been so much more to me. Because you have undoubtedly been my source of fear since April 15th, 2013. (After all, you are one of the men responsible for nearly taking my child, and for the permanent image embedded in my brain of watching someone die.) Up until now, I have been truly scared of you and because of this, fearful of everything else people might be capable of. But today, all that changed. Because this afternoon, I got to walk into a courtroom and take my place at the witness stand, just a few feet away from where you were sitting. (I was WALKING. Did you get that?) And today I explained all the horrific details, of how you changed my life, to the people that literally hold YOURS in their hands. That's a little scary right? And this afternoon before going in, I'm not going to lie..my palms were sweaty. And sitting up there talking to the prosecution did make me cry. But today, do you know what else happened? TODAY...I looked at you right in the face....and realized I wasn't afraid anymore. And today I realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that I needed all along. And I think that's the ironic thing that happens when someone intends something for evil. Because somehow, some way, it always ends up good. But you are a coward. A little boy who wouldn't even look me in the eyes to see that. Because you can't handle the fact that what you tried to destroy, you only made stronger. And if your eyes would've met mine for just one second, you would've also seen that what you 'blew up' really did BLOW UP. Because now you have given me (and the other survivors) a tremendous platform to help others, and essentially do our parts in changing the world for the better. So yes...you did take a part of me. Congratulations you now have a leg up...literally. But in so many ways, you saved my life. Because now, I am so much more appreciative of every new day I am given. And now, I get to hug my son even tighter than before, blessed that he is THRIVING, despite everything that has happened. So now...while you are sitting in solitary confinement, (awaiting the verdict on your life), I will be actually ENJOYING everything this beautiful world has to offer. And guess what else? I will do so without fear....of YOU. Because now to me you're a nobody, and it is official that you have lost. So man that really sucks for you bro. I truly hope it was worth it. Sincerely, . Someone you shouldn't have messed with . ‪#‎bostonstrong .","Rebekah Gregory, 27, wrote that seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she isn't afraid of him anymore .

"‘Toxic’ pollen from GM corn can travel miles to contaminate the countryside, researchers claim. Currently, European Union regulators assume pollen from the crop, which has been manipulated to include a toxin that kills pests, can travel only 20 to 40 metres. However, research suggests that significant amounts of the pollen, which harms butterflies and moths, can be carried up to 4.45 kilometres – 2.7 miles – on the wind. Watchdogs have launched an investigation into GM corn following a study showing ‘toxic’ pollen from the plants can travel miles to contaminate the countryside . Critics say that if this is correct the rules must be redrawn to protect the countryside and stop the pollen contaminating conventional and organic farms and food over vast areas. The European Food Safety Authority is now reviewing the approval process for the corn – known as Bt maize – following the German study. Its investigation is particularly important because the European Commission is in the final throes of approving a type of GM maize that was assessed under a safety regime that did not take account of the new information. The researchers measured the spread of pollen from maize crops over ten years at hundreds of sites in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They discovered that assumptions that maize pollen is heavy and falls to the ground over a short distance from the plants were spectacularly wrong. The research found the concentration ranged from 23.3million grains of pollen per square metre close to the fields to 2,857 grains at greater distances. Significant amounts of pollen were found more than 2½ miles away. Previous assumptions on pollen dispersal were based on the premise that the air was still, but the German researchers pointed out that these conditions are ‘practically non-existent’ in the real world. They said some studies suggest that the pollen can be lifted high in the air by strong winds and carried for more than 40 miles. The experts, whose research was published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, said even small amounts of pollen containing the toxin – as little as four grains – will harm or kill sensitive butterflies and moths. The European Food Safety Authority is reviewing the approval process for the corn – known as Bt maize - following a research study by German academics, while one environmental group called for it to be banned altogether . They concluded that measures would be needed to ensure any GM maize crops are more than half a mile away from sensitive areas of countryside which are home to important populations of butterflies and moths. Mute Schimpf, of Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ‘The only logical and scientific conclusion is to halt the cultivation of all GM maize in Europe.’ Last month, MPs on the science and technology select committee said the term ‘GM food’ should be abandoned because it had become a ‘lightning rod’ for fears about designer crops. Anti-GM groups accused MPs of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public.","New evidence shows spread of GM pollen cloud is enormous .

"A public memorial will be held on Friday for popular Australian blogger  the 'Wellness Warrior', who died of cancer at the age of 30 after seven years of sharing her battle with the disease. Jessica Ainscough, 30, passed away last week after a long battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma, which she chose to fight with natural and often controversial methods. When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she tried conventional treatments but when her cancer resurfaced she opted instead for a natural treatment called Gerson Therapy which involves drinking raw juices and coffee enemas. Ms Ainscough's family spoke out about online backlash she faced as a result of her views on alternative medicine in a statement published in the Queensland Times - saying that when her cancer returned in 2014 she again tried conventional treatment but it did not help. Scroll down for video . Popular Australian blogger Jessica Ainscough, the 'Wellness Warrior', has died of cancer at the age of 30 . 'It has been speculated by people who have never met or treated Jess that, had she chosen to amputate her arm or undergo further conventional treatment, her chances of survival would have increased,' they said. 'Her treating oncologists do not agree with this uninformed view.' Ms Ainscough was cremated in a private ceremony on Monday, and her public memorial will be held Lifepointe Baptist Church, at Buderim on the Sunshine Coast, at 10am on Friday. Her family have requested donations be made to animal rescue group Edgar's Mission in lieu of flowers. Ms Ainscough's father Col Ainscough said the family was deeply appreciative of the love and support coming in from around the world. 'I'm so proud of my beautiful daughter for her achievements, style, grace, sincerity and affection. I'm devastated although comforted to know that she is now reunited with my wife, Sharyn,' Mr Ainscough said. Her partner Tallon Pamenter said his heart was broken. 'But I feel incredibly blessed to have experienced a love and connection few are lucky enough to have,' Mr Pamenter said. 'Jess and I shared the highest of highs and lowest of lows, and because of this we developed a love so deep that I will forever be grateful for.' Ms Ainscough adopted a strict vegan diet, and additional supplements to 'heal' her body without chemotherapy. Ms Ainscough's mother was diagnosed with cancer, and after embracing Gerson therapy, died in 2013 . Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, 'The Wellness Warrior' 'I didn't chop off my arm. I didn't go into aggressive, full-body chemotherapy. I didn't accept that my doctor's 'solution' was the only course of action,' she wrote on her Wellness Warrior blog. 'I decided that I would do everything in my power to thrive in life, in spite of the looming expiration date I'd been given. I learned how to treat myself with absolute kindness & self-respect. I radicalised my diet. I systematically detoxified my body — and mind.' Ms Ainscough's approach has no scientific support but has garnered enthusiastic adoption from a small proportion of cancer sufferers around the world. 'Somewhere along the way, I realised that I was more than a 'cancer story' — I was a leader, a role model, an educator, and a champion,' she wrote on her blog. 'Part of an empowering wellness revolution, sweeping the planet. Someone who could change lives & provide HOPE — simply by showing up, and telling my story.' Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, attracting thousands of followers on social media and publishing a book called 'Make Peace with Your Plate'. When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she refused conventional treatment . Her unusual approach to fighting cancer attracted significant criticism from the public, and bodies such as the Cancer Council. 'The data that are available are not sufficient to warrant claims that the Gerson therapy is effective as an adjuvant to other cancer therapies or as a cure,' a page on the Cancer Council's website says. 'At this time, the use of the Gerson therapy in the treatment of cancer patients cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed clinical trials.' Her mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by Ms Ainscough's success, also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. 'I've been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before. After my mum died at the end of last year, my heart was shattered and it's still in a million pieces,' she wrote on her blog in December last year. 'I had no idea how to function without her, and it turns out my body didn't either. For the first time in my almost seven year journey with cancer, this year I've been really unwell,' she wrote. 'I've been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before,' said Ms Ainscough on her blog . Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January . 'I've lived with cancer since 2008 and for most of those years my condition was totally stable. When my mum became really ill, my cancer started to become aggressive again. After she died, things really started flaring up.' Ms Ainscough reportedly began pursuing conventional treatments after she suffered through ten months of constant bleeding from the tumours in her arm and shoulder. 'This has been a game-changer for me and also very strange. Some weeks I've felt nothing but overwhelming sadness, others I've been really bitter and angry,' she wrote. 'I've also spent my time doing lots of research into treatment options. I've been speaking to doctors, healers, and specialists and I've been completely opening myself up to attracting the right people who will help me heal – whether they are from the natural medicine world or conventional,' 'My beliefs have been completely shaken up and I've had to drop any remnants of fear and ego that were preventing me from exploring these options sooner.' Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January. Her website now features a photograph of Ms Ainscough, with the memorium 'On February 26th, 2015, the world lost one of its brightest sparks'. 'After 30 years, seven of which were spent thriving with cancer, Jess Ainscough peacefully passed away.'

"A plum, which was 'accidentally created' , has been touted as the next superfood to rival the acai berry. The Australian Queen Garnet contains some of the highest levels of antioxidants ever found in a fruit and has just gone on sale in the UK. According to studies the fruit has five to ten times more anthocyanins than a normal plum. The Australian Queen Garnet has five to ten times more of the antioxidant anthocyanins than a normal plum . The superplum was created during a breeding programme for a disease-resistant version of the common plum . Anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries and red peppers. Research suggests that the plant antioxidants, which mop up harmful molecules, can help protect arteries and prevent the DNA damage that leads to cancer. The plum was accidentally created during a breeding programme for a disease-resistant version of the common plum in Queensland, Australia. It is currently undergoing trials in studies with obese rats, and early results relating to the fruit's potential to aid weight loss have been positive, reports say. Rats were fed a diet high in fats and carbohydrates until they were obese. Then a few drops of the plum juice was added to the rodent's drinking water, which the rats consumed during their daily 30 minutes of exercise. The previously obese rats shed most of their excess weight in eight weeks. Anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries and red peppers. They have high levels of antioxidants which appeare to reduce inflammation and reduce the effects of arthritis in the body. The compounds in the antioxidants  have similar effects as drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Professor Lindsay Brown,  from USQ Biomedical Sciences who led the research told the BBC that the results from the rodent-led research are enough to make a case for the plums health claims. 'All the changes that rats experience with obesity - glucose levels, cardiovascular functions, inflammation - all those occur the same way in humans,' Prof Brown said, adding: 'The plums taste really nice.' Marks & Spencer claims it is the first retailer in the UK to stock the new variety of plum. M&S fruit technologist Andrew Mellonie said: 'This is one of the most exciting new fruits to hit the UK in the last decade. 'It is a win-win fruit. Not only is it delicious but also incredibly healthy. It was created purely by chance and is an amazing discovery that could offer significant health benefits.' Similar levels of anthocyanins in berries usually made them inedible, but the Queen Garnet is incredibly sweet and a 'delicious addition to the fruit bowl' with a 'delicious jammy taste - similar to that of a black fig', Mr Mellonie continued . But not everyone agrees with the positive claims. The plum can be consumed as a juice (left) or stewed and eaten with ice-cream for pudding (right) Professor Manny Noakes, research director for nutrition and health at the Australian science agency CSIRO, said it wasn't a clear-cut case. 'It's very good research and very interesting research,'  Prof Noakes said to the BBC. 'But when I last checked, humans and rodents were very different. You can feed rats an entire diet to test a hypothesis but that doesn't mean you'll get the same results in humans. 'To make a claim that the consumption of a food will make a difference to people's weight is a pretty long bow to cast,' she continued. 'Unfortunately, this is something that happens a lot when it comes to promoting the health benefits of food. Similar claims have been made by research on animals using everyday grape seeds.' Mr Mellonie said: 'We're constantly working with our growers around the world to develop new fruits and vegetables for our customers to try. 'When our supplier came to us with the Queen Garnet we knew we had to get it on our shelves for consumers in the UK to enjoy.' The plums are currently being grown for M&S in Australia, although the retailer said it hoped to grow them closer to the UK in future. They have gone on sale for £3 for 400g, or two packs for £4. Moringa . Best for: Liver protection and blood sugar regulation . Most popular in powder form, this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle' tree, native to Africa and Asia and one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet. It has been claimed that it boosts immunity, lowers blood pressure, alleviates stress, fights fatigue, improves digestive health and increases libido. And that's just on the inside. It's also a tonic for hair, nails and skin. So what makes moringa so miraculous? It contains almost 25 per cent protein, including all nine of the essential amino acids, which are important for the body's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells. It is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including skin-supporting vitamins such as zinc, which includes strong, supple healthy skin, nails and hair among its beauty benefits. Holistic nutritionist Nikki Baker advises: 'Moringa has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood, goji berries. It contains over 90 nutrients, 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals. 'Gram for gram, Moringa contains more vitamin B12 than steak, more vitamin A than eggs, and more calcium than milk. 'Its antioxidants detox and protect the liver, boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels.' Chlorella . Best for: Liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery . We’ve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as Nikki stresses, there’s more to this trend than just a fad, especially when it comes to the morning after. The one to look out for, she says, is Sun Chlorella A, a green algae and superfood detoxifier, popular in Japan. In 1996, research from Sapporo Medical University, Japan, suggested that chlorella, a freshwater green algae, can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking. The idea is that the antioxidant-packed algae neutralises the free radicals (chemicals that damage cells) in alcohol. Chlorella - which also contains iron, folic acid and energy-boosting B vitamins - is also lauded for its gut-soothing properties, as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten. Mushrooms . Best for: Adrenal recovery and digestion . These aren’t the kind of fungi you’ll find in the veg section of the supermarket. These medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night. One such example is chaga, a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in Siberia. Nikki said: 'Chaga is a nutrient-rich medicinal mushroom, it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree. 'Chaga contains numerous B vitamins, flavonoids, minerals and enzymes. 'It is also one of the world’s densest sources of pantothenic acid, an essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs.'","Australian Queen Garnet has five to 10 times more anthocyanins than a normal plum .

"Return: Comedienne Tracey Ullman is to comeback to BBC with six-episode sketch show . She made her fortune when her career took off in the US and now comedienne Tracey Ullman is set to mark her UK comeback - with a six-episode of her sketch show on BBC1 . Worth an estimated £75million, the mother-of-two is a far cry from the star who was introduced to the public in Three of a Kind and A Kick Up the EIghties. And thanks to The Tracey Ullman show, she became one of the few British acts to break the American market. Also a Hollywood actress, Miss Ullman said yesterday the BBC had transformed since her original stint at the Corporation. She said: ‘It’s a privilege to be doing this. I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on the windowsill in my mother’s bedroom, putting on a show. ‘The BBC has changed a bit since the last time I worked here, when it was all men in bow ties who had completed National Service. Now there are a lot more women. Great ones. 'The important things haven’t changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you to the freedom to create the best shows possible.’ Shane Allen, head of comedy at the BBC, called Miss Ullman’s return to BBC1 a ‘homecoming’ and said: ‘We’ve got Tracey Ullman returning to our screens to do what she does brilliantly – a multi-character sketch show. 'She’s won 7 Emmys for her work and she’s always been the one who got away for British comedy, a huge talent and it’s an enormous privilege to welcome her back to the BBC.’ A source at the BBC added: ‘Tracey is a huge talent who has the comedy world at her feet so for her to choose to come back to the BBC feels like a real coup for the corporation. Before heading across the Atlantic, she had built a career on the stage and then found fame on television among a generation of comics that included Lenny Henry, Rik Mayall, Robbie Coltrane and David Copperfield. But it was not enough for Miss Ullman, who headed to across the Atlantic to forge a new career. With The Tracey Ullman Show in the late 1980s, she became one of the few British acts to successfully break the American market and the first foreign-born female comedian to do so. The variety show not only won a string of top awards, including a Golden Globe, but also gave cartoon The Simpsons its first chance of television as a regular segment on the programme. She is now bringing the programme to the BBC as part of its new comedy line-up, announced yesterday. Other highlights include The Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture, in which a big comedy name – yet to be announced – will discuss the role the art form has in a free society. Original: The Simpsons Family as they first appeared on the Tracey Ullman Show . Other BBC stalwarts will be making their usual appearances. A programme has been commissioned to mark the 25-year partnership of Harry Enfield, 53, and Paul Whitehouse, 56, and there will also be new offerings from Rory Bremner, 53, and Death in Paradise star Ben Miller, 49. As well as acting, Miss Ullman has appeared in Hollywood films such as The Corpse Bride and Into the Woods, and made her fortune flipping high-value homes in Los Angeles with her husband, Allan McKeown. The Award-winning producer of his wife’s show Tracey Takes On…, Mr McKeown died on Christmas Eve 2013 at the age of 67 from prostate cancer, three days before the couple’s thirtieth wedding anniversary. They had two children, Johnny McKeown, 26, who has followed in his mother’s footsteps to become an actor, and Mabel, 28, who is a manager at charity International Medical Corps and previously worked for Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman. She unsuccessful sought selection as the Labour candidate for the Neath constituency, in Wales, at this year’s general election. Early days: Tracey Ullman (middle) with comedian David Copperfield (left) and Lenny Henry with their awards for television programme 'Three of a kind' at the Variety club awards in 1984 . This political inclination towards left-wing politics runs in the family as Miss Ullman is a known Labour supporter and is friends with the party’s former leader Neil Kinnock. While she has gone on to such stellar success, Miss Ullman did not have an easy start to life. She was born in Slough in 1959, to a middle class family. She was the youngest of two daughter born to Polish émigré Anthony Ullman. Mr Ullman was a key figure in the local Eastern European community and sold suits made by his English seamstress wife Dorin. She lost her father at the age of six when he collapsed and died from a heart attack while reading her a bedtime story. His death saw the family’s fortunes change and they moved to Hackbridge, southwest London, where her mother was forced to work a series of odd-jobs to make ends meet. She has previously said of the loss: ‘After he died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and had to give up the business. 'When I meet other girls who lost their fathers when they were young, I really relate to them. You become independent quickly; I could cope with anything because of that terrible loss.’ Despite struggling for money, Miss Ullman has said her mother would only ever refer to the family as middle class out of a sense of pride and because ‘we had money at one time.’ Mrs Ullman then had an unhappy second marriage and, after it ended, the family moved around the country several times. Miss Ullman always had dreams of performing and would put on shows for her mother with her sister Patti. At 13, she visited a clairvoyant who predicted she would find fame in America. She won a scholarship to respected stage school Italia Conti and, aged 16, she landed her first job dancing in Berlin. The following year she was performing in a show in Blackpool alongside Les Dawson. She said: ‘He was terrific. He had a great brain and he liked smart women. I used to drink scotch and smoke cigarettes with him in his dressing room. ' And he was the first person to say to me: `You know, you’re very funny. You should do more comedy. You won’t be a dancer for ever.’ I remember taking that very seriously.’ She went on to have a short-lived career as a pop singer before marrying Mr McKeown, 15 years her senior, in 1983. A successful producer with interests in Los Angeles as well as London, They moved into Steven Spielberg’s old house in California when she was pregnant with Mabel and she was happy to try her hand at comedy in America.","Found fame alongside comics including Rik Mayall and Lenny Henry .

"No free speech: Ryan Pate was arrested in Abu Dhabi last month after complaining about his UAE employer on Facebook - a violation of the country's law against slandering an employer . A hallmark of American life - griping about work - has landed a Florida man in a Middle Eastern jail. Ryan Pate, a helicopter mechanic from Belleair Bluffs, Florida, took to Facebook after a dispute over sick leave with the company he was working for in the United Arab Emirates. He was home in Florida at the time, but when he returned to Abu Dhabi last month, he was told to report to the police station, where he was arrested for breaking an Emirates law on slandering his employer. He spent about 10 days in jail, he said, and is now free on bail awaiting a March 17 trial. His supporters say he faces up to five years in prison and a steep fine if convicted. 'I just couldn't register it in my head because as an American growing up in the United States, the First Amendment right is just ingrained in my brain,' he said in a phone interview Wednesday. 'I never even entertained the fact that I would wind up in prison out here for something I put on Facebook in the United States.' Pate, 30, said the incident stemmed from a trip to Florida in December. During his return he spent the holidays with family and proposed to his girlfriend, Jillian Cardoza, but also was trying to get treatment for a back injury. There was disagreement with his bosses about extending his leave to see a doctor, he said, and after a particularly unsatisfactory phone call with them, he took to a Facebook. He says he can't remember precisely what he wrote, but knows he called his bosses 'backstabbers' and warned other contractors not to work for them. He didn't give the rant much thought until he was back in the Persian Gulf, where he planned to handle paperwork to end his employment as well as empty his apartment and sell his car. Soon after, he says he received a call from police telling him to come to the station, where officers showed him screen shots of his comments. Pulled apart: Pate (left) had just proposed to his girlfriend Jillian Cardoza (right) when he was arrested by authorities in the UAE. His trial is set to begin on March 17 . 'I'm being arrested. I'm so sorry. I love you,' Cardoza said he texted her from the station. Pate's congressman, Rep. David Jolly, intervened on his constituent's behalf, lobbying the State Department and Emirates officials for help. In a letter to the Emirati attorney general, Jolly emphasized respect for the sovereignty of the country, but argued because the posts occurred while Pate was on American soil, those laws shouldn't apply. 'It is deeply troubling that Mr. Pate now faces judicial proceedings over an action that was done legally in his home country,' the Republican said. The Emirati Embassy in Washington said it did not have much information about the case and couldn't comment. An after-hours email to the company, Global Aerospace Logistics, did not get an immediate reply. Pate said he's trying not to think too much about the sentence he could face. He says he's remorseful for letting his emotions get the best of him. A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Pate.","Ryan Pate was on a break from work, visiting his home in Florida, when he complained on Facebook about spat with UAE employer .

"All he wanted to do was talk about how nice his hair was - but in doing so, Jackie Chan has created a word which has taken China by storm: Duang. Pronounced 'dwong', the actor was being filmed discussing a shampoo commercial he appeared in when he used the sound in a similar way to how Westerners would present something special and exclaim: 'Ta-da!' In the footage he says: 'I didn't want the commercial to have lots of special effects and my hair look ""duang!"" - suddenly blacker and shinier.' People's Daily report that the footage was recorded in 2004 but recently reappeared online, sparking an online frenzy over the sound. Hair today, duang tomorrow: Jackie Chan is seen discussing how he did not want to use special effects to make his hair look duang . Although many people are using the word to mock the actor, who is seen as a pro-Beijing political figure by many in China, Chan has been a good sport about it all. 'It's quite funny,' he told reporters on the steps of Beijing's Great Hall of the People this week. And speaking about it at the studio of Hidden Energy, a Chinese reality TV show where he appears as a judge, he said: 'When I came here this morning, everyone was saying ""duang duang"". I’m confused myself.' While Chan is all smiles about the commercial now, it was a different story after the advert aired in 2004. Authorities ruled that the commercial made false claims, and Chan's reputation suffered. But now parodies of Chan's shampoo endorsement are spreading online. There is even a new - unofficial - Chinese character for the sound, which has been made by overlaying the two characters of Jackie Chan's name. And the actor has joined in the fun, tweeting yesterday: 'So ""duang"" today!' He's looking duang! The actor shakes his head as he demonstrates how he wanted to look .

"Driving has been blamed for making many people lazy. So Italian engineers at Italdesign Giugiaro have teamed up with Audi and Technogym to get car owners to exercise when they’re stuck in traffic. The result is a high-end self-driving electric car with basic gym equipment built into the seats and floor, a fridge for drinks and a Wellness mode. Italdesign Giugiaro has created the world’s first autonomous electric car with gym equipment built into the seats and floor. Two handles are fitted into the rear seats and pop out of their compartment at the press of a button. For lower limbs, two flat boards designed by Technogym have been fitted to the floor . The concept model is called Gea and was presented at Geneva's 85th International Motor Show this week. It is dubbed 'the future of luxury mobility.' It has so-called 'book-type' doors that can be opened remotely and beam a red carpet from the car onto the floor. Two aluminium handles designed by Technogym are fitted into the rear seats. By activating a sensor, the handles pop out of the compartment and can be used for upper body routines. Senzati recently unveiled its luxuriously modified Jet Sprinter van. Its layout and features, such as the colour of the seats, can be customised. It boasts a 6.5ft (two metre) sunroof, luxury bathroom, office, fridge and entertainment system - among other features - depending on the specification. The vehicle was built by Coventry-based Senzati and is based on Mercedes’ Sprinter van, sometimes used by tradesmen. It set out to design a vehicle to provide passengers with ‘the space uniquely found in a decent sized private jet’ that is able to be manoeuvred in cities and be discrete from the exterior. The vehicle starts at £209,000 ($318,000) and is made to look discrete from the outside. For lower limbs, two flat boards have been fitted to the floor. These can be made to be raised and used for stepping exercises. And a built-in monitor displays a video tutorial of Technogym exercise routines to help the user vary their workouts. There is also room between the seats for a small fridge where drinks  can be stored. And at the top to this compartment, a small drawer contains cosmetics and a perfumed pouch for aromatherapy. Elsewhere, when the driver selects Wellness mode dashboard LED lights turn to amber to create a ‘warmer, more relaxing atmosphere’. A Business mode turns the Gea into a mobile office with two 19-inch screens that drop from the roof to let passengers choose what information is shown. The front passenger seat can also turn through 180 degrees to hold meetings on the move. And in Dream mode the front seats join and fold-out to add a footrest, while the right rear seat can turn into a fully flat bed. LEDs project a relaxing blue light, the windows darken and  pictures of galaxies and starry skies appear on the monitors and on the front dashboard.

"Rugby union has a well-worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof, that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah-rahs best in action. In a Daily Mail Australia investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football, the Queensland Reds' Super Rugby games at Suncorp Stadium came in a long last, costing about $90 more than the best value - the Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium. With family budgets on a tighter rein than ever before, the challenge is where to best spend your sporting dollar. And judging by the secrets kept by some stadia and their teams, you get the distinct impression they don't really want you to know. So we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument, once and for all, by piecing together a direct comparison of a day (or night) out, for a family of four, to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code. Winners are grinners. Asian champions Western Sydney Wanderers have played before packed houses at Pirtek Stadium for the past two years but while they are testing their fans' resolve this season in the A League they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing . The Rabbitohs, with almost 32,000 members to their name, kick off their title defence in the NRL on Thursday against rugby league's other best supported club, the Brisbane Broncos but both fall just short in the pricing against AFL's best supported club Collingwood . The Magpies playing at both the MCG and Etihad provide good value for a family of fans, particularly after the home of AFL announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages. Collingwood can boast the biggest following of any Australian football club with almost 70,000 members . The Queensland Reds have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up. While Suncorp Stadium is considered among the best to watch football in Australia following the Super Rugby does not come cheap, ranking last in the Daily Mail's assessment in value for money . Rugby League launches into action tonight with the premiers South Sydney tackling the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium, considered by many the premier sporting venue in Queensland. But does it stack up against Victoria's home of AFL, the MCG? Or what about the tight-knit groups at Pirtek Stadium which back Asian Champions League winners, Western Sydney Wanderers or AAMI Park's A League toppers, Melbourne Victory. It was on the following criteria; a family ticket in general admission (2 adults and 2 children), with the purchase of two meat pies, two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer, one soft drink and two bottles of water, as well as two supporter caps. Clubs, governing bodies, trusts and stadiums were invited to provide the relevant information. And the winner is: Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium in Parramatta. The Asian Champions League title-holders provide their 17,000 (capped) devoted followers with great value at $147.80. Such was the push for membership that officials had to restrict the number in line with the capacity at Pirtek and the club placed more than a thousand hopefuls on a waiting list. 1. Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium Parramatta $147.80 . 2. Collingwood Magpies at Melbourne Cricket Ground $155.10 . 3. South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium Homebush Bay $163.50 . 4. Adelaide Crows at Adelaide Oval $178.78 . 5. Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium $202.80 . 6. Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium $236.04 . *Based on prices from clubs, stadiums and governing bodies . Sometimes it's the little things, as Pirtek catering officials were quick to point out, that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price. The MCG was fast out of the blocks, this week, ahead of the AFL bounce, touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy, a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters. A game at 'the G', watching Collingwood do battle against Essendon on Anzac Day, for instance, will set you back just $155.10 for a family outing. Souths at ANZ Stadium and the Crows at Adelaide Oval come in 3rd and 4th. Suncorp Stadium is arguably the best venue in Australia to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt, is that you pay for the privilege, as can be seen by the price of a Broncos game $202.80. The Reds confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon, by far the most expensive at $236.04. There's no argument that the matter of pricing in the competitive Australian market has become an increasingly thorny issue. While some happily revealed the costs, others were not so forthcoming. Of those who were requested the information, the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Queensland Reds were fastest to act, providing all the details requested within in a relatively short period of time. So too, the Wanderers and Broncos. But others were not so forthcoming, preferring to completely sidestep the issue, including the NSW Waratahs. The Super Rugby champions simply referred DMA to their website and Ticketek for details of pricing. Their home ground of Allianz Stadium, run by the SCG Trust, refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer. Perhaps worse, the Adelaide Crows did not reply to repeated requests for the figures, even over a 48-hour period. However, in stark contrast, Adelaide Oval officials, provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of South Australian sport, including the ability for supporters to take their own 'packed lunch and thermos'. More reason to cheer their team. Western Sydney Wanderers fans get the best deal when it comes to supporting a football club in Australia. They topped the ranks in Daily Mail's value for money investigation . The heat is on. While Suncorp and the Reds offered up all details, Allianz Stadium, which is home to Super Rugby champions the NSW Waratahs, chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game . A WSW home game at Pirtek ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in Australia, its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters . And Adelaide Oval is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas. On the same day the NRL season was to kick off and with ANZ Stadium playing host to both last year's grand finalists - the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs, officials there said there was no information on pricing which could be provided, only a week out from hosting their first league game of 2015. Melbourne Victory was also unable to provide a breakdown. The pressure has been turned up on all codes as a result of the new deal struck by the Melbourne Cricket Club with its catering contractor. They've reduced the price of a range of products on sale at the stadium in a bid to make going to the football and cricket more family-friendly. In all, eight items have been reduced with bottled water undergoing the biggest price drop from $5 to $3 - that's a discount of about 40 per cent. Suncorp also plays host to the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. The cost of a family going to watch Queensland's most successful rugby league club is about $202 . MCC chief executive Stephen Gough estimated the price restructure will cost the MCC about $14 million in lost revenue over the course of the seven-year contract. 'We've listened to the fans,' Gough said. 'We understand their affordability concerns and we are very confident that this initiative will be extremely well received.' AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan called on venues around the country to follow the MCG's lead. 'They've made a big statement,' McLachlan said. 'They're leading the agenda now on this issue. Hopefully it's a great outcome for all of our fans across Australia because I think they've put a position out there that people are going to have to respond to.' Etihad Stadium is still negotiating with the AFL on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season. The Adelaide Crows huddle before a match at the Adelaide Oval - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game .","Western Sydney Wanderers are Asian champions and also best on ground when it comes to fans' value for money .
Super Rugby is the most expensive with a day out to watch Queensland Reds at Suncorp getting the wooden spoon for costs .
A decision by the MCG to cut the price of food and drinks means a Collingwood game at the home of AFL is good value for a family .

"An NHS trust accused of making a woman infertile after a botched appendix operation is  trying to cut compensation for the mistake because they say she would not have been earning as much if she'd had a baby. Sarah Marquis claims she was 'rendered infertile' by doctors at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, after her appendix burst in 2008. The 41-year-old lawyer is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for £1.5million in the belief that it is to blame for her infertility. Sarah Marquis, 41, is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust after a botched operation left her infertile . But while the trust admits causing her injuries, it claims it does not owe her so much money in compensation as if she had been able to give birth she would not be earning as much. Instead it believes she is entitled to £300,000, with lawyers acting on its behalf telling the High Court that Ms Marquis's career would have been hampered if she'd ever given birth. The Court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her GP. She was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ. But by the time they got round to operating, Ms Marquis's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in. As a result she lost her ability to have children naturally. Describing the hospital's role in her ordeal, Ms Marquis's counsel Cara Guthrie said: 'Had it not been for the negligence of the defendants, Ms Marquis’ appendix would not have perforated. 'She would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery, avoiding an extended hospital stay, and she would not have been rendered infertile.' As a result of the botched operation Ms Marquis had to take time off from her £85,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad, she added. While the Trust's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications, he denied her claim that she was entitled to £1.5million. The 41-year-old lawyer was treated at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, )pictured above) in 2008 . Lawyers acting on behalf of the trust said Ms Marquis, who is also a Labour councillor, would not have been earning as much money if she had a baby. The hearing at the High Court (above) continues . He argued that rather than move up the career ladder her earnings would have slowed down as a result of giving birth. 'The Trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that,' said Bradley Martin. '(But) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence. Speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added: 'You moved in together in order to have a baby.' He rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company's American offices as he said she would have been pregnant. Ms Marquis rejected his accusations. The 41-year-old had undergone IVF treatment in the past to become pregnant. 'If that was my only time to have a child then I would have done so...(but) I do value my career at the same time. 'I wanted to get my life back to normal. I had been off work effectively for three and a half years.' The hearing continues.","Sarah Marquis was left unable to have children following botched surgery .

"These magnificent snow-capped mountains, found deep within a country very few Western tourists dare to visit, are virtually untouched. Every year a handful of adventurous skiers are brave enough to make the long trek to Bamyan, in Central Afghanistan, even though it’s one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Those who make the trip are being inspired by locals, who are some of the poorest people on the planet, and joining in a grassroots effort to grow the sport in Afghanistan and develop the region into a destination for tourists. Scroll down for video . A local man learns how to snowboard with ski tourists in Bamyan Province in Central Afghanistan . With so few tourists visiting and a small local population, the mountains are virtually untouched . Organisations and companies have launched a programme to develop the sport in Afghanistan . Foreigners may picture Afghanistan as a hot, arid land thanks to images shown on television during a decade-plus war that followed the 9/11 attacks in America. But Bamyan, which lies on the Silk Road that cuts through Asia, is a picturesque setting in the winter thanks to the snow-covered Hindu Kush mountains, one of the least explored ranges in the world. For years, locals have been using primitive skis fashioned from planks of wood and homemade poles to go up and down the mountains, which are home to peaceful minority groups. They’re now being joined by more Westerners who are looking for adventure, including a select few who are trying to improve their lives. A professional snowboarder from Australia leaps over a donkey and locals during a film shoot . A grassroots effort is underway to transform Bamyan into a destination for ski tourists . Organisations and companies are introducing modern equipment and training, and providing jobs to locals. The Aga Khan Foundation launched the programme in 2008, with Swiss brand Volkl providing equipment and training for locals, and the Swiss ski resort of St Moritz raising funds and inviting two Afghan skiers to the Alps for training. In 2011, Untamed Borders, a British tour operator, became the first company to take ski tourists to Afghanistan. Since then it has been bringing 10 to 20 foreign skiers to the mountain range every year, taking great care with respect to safety and security, said co-founder Kausar Hussain. With no ski lift or rope tow, skiers must hike up the mountain before skiing back down . But Bamyan, which lies on the Silk Road that cuts through Asia, is a picturesque setting in the winter . Each holidaymaker pays £1,700 for a 10-day trip, which includes accommodation, food, local transport and instruction from an internationally qualified ski guide. They are usually joined by local guides as well. Mr Hussain said: ‘The ski conditions are good. Very dry powder. Afghanistan does have a high risk of avalanches, so on many days we have to stick to low elevations. ‘In Bamyan, in winter it is cold, it snows. However there are many more clear days when in Europe. In the summer it has warm days and cool nights.’ It is the definition of raw skiing, as there are no ski lifts, meaning skiers must hike up the mountain. A ski tourist has a laugh after taking a tumble while on holiday in Central Afghanistan . The Hindu Kush mountains in Central Afghanistan are one of the least explored ranges in the world . Unlike other areas in Afghanistan, Bamyan is not under threat from insurgent groups and is quite safe for tourists, said Mr Hussain. He said: ‘Bamian is one of the few places in Afghanistan where it is possible to do such type of outdoor activities. Afghanistan is a melting pot of different religious and ethnic groups. ‘Whilst this is one of the reasons for its troubled history it is also why certain areas of the country can be perfectly safe, or at least no riskier than other Asian developing countries, to visit whilst others would be extremely dangerous.’ The tour groups avoid dangerous areas, including unstable regions in the Pashtun heartland, and they keep a low profile and are cautious when they travel into Kabul, the capital, about 100 miles south-east of Bamyan. A professional snowboarder soars through the air during a visit to Bamyan Province in Afghanistan . In 2011, Untamed Borders became the first company to take ski tourists to Afghanistan . The British tour operator takes 10 to 20 ski tourists to Central Afghanistan every year . Mr Hussain said: ‘If we walk in the city we will always have a car nearby, we will continually check safety reports and we will stay in discreet guest houses, not in the big hotels that are well-known targets. ‘However, the cities are well covered by security personnel and are generally very calm. If we thought that there was a major risk in any particular city then we would avoid it.’ He added: ‘Driving between cities is also something we take a long look at with regards to security. We check reports from a service that provides security updates to NGO workers and also ask drivers we know who regularly take passengers on the roads we take. We also get calls and texts from a security service should there be problems on the road.’ ‘The security on the road is actually currently not too bad but it has been bad in the past and it makes sense not to take any undue risk if flights are available. Bamyan is home to Afghanistan's only ski race, which pits locals against ski tourists . Competitors in the Afghan Ski Challenge race up the hill before skiing back down . ‘Many of our guests have some safety concerns. It is Afghanistan after all. However by the end of their trip their perception of Afghanistan has changed a lot.’ Of all the things that help to change visitors’ perceptions of Afghanistan, the locals of Bamyan play a massive role. Tourists have plenty of opportunities to interact with them as locals work as ski guides, drivers and tour organisers, and some sell drinks and snacks. Another opportunity is the annual Afghan Ski Challenge, an incredible event where local and foreign skiers compete in a race up and down the slopes. The event, Afghanistan’s only ski race, is operated by the Bamyan Ski Club, which also arranges training and equipment for local skiers. Kausar Hussain said the local skiers usually beat the tourists in the Afghan Ski Challenge . Mr Hussain said locals, who strap planks of wood to their feet, usually beat the foreigners as they ski up the mountain and then ski back down. Last winter three professional snowboarders visited Bamyan to record Afghanistan’s first ever snowboard film, calling it White Silk Road. During the summer, Bamyan is a popular stop for Afghan tourists, who visit the lakes at Band-e-Amir National Park. The region is also a draw for those who compete in or watch buzkashi, the country’s national sport. It is a fierce competition where athletes on horseback carry the corpse of a decapitated goat, instead of a ball, and attempt to throw it into a scoring circle.","A few adventurous ski tourists make the trek to Bamyan every year .

"A single mother has revealed how she fell for an online charmer who trawled dating websites looking for available women – so he could steal from them. Rosheen Gosney, from Ipswich, Suffolk, hoped Daniel Olley, who she knew as Danny, would be the man of her dreams when she found him on Plenty Of Fish. But the 45-year-old thief went on to steal her car – and she only found out when she spotted it in the forecourt of a dealership weeks later. Rosheen Gosney, pictured with her daughter Somer, 11, met Daniel Olley, who was jailed for three years after stealing the mother-of-three's car, on the website Plenty Of Fish . Daniel Olley told Miss Gosney he was taking her car in to be repaired - she then saw it for sale . The mother-of-three was on the bus, looking out of the window, when she saw the Peugeot. Miss Gosney, 45, contacted the police and it emerged Olley was a prolific thief who hunted for prey on dating websites so he could plunder from them. Speaking for the first time since Olley was convicted of theft, Miss Gosney has told how she will never go online dating again. She wanted to warn other women not to be lured in by Olley, who tricked at least four others and was described as ‘a cautionary tale for vulnerable women’ by Judge David Goodin. Miss Gosney told how she met Olley in January 2013 after moving from Warrington to Essex. After a few weeks of dating, she introduced Olley, who said he was a mechanic, to her children Ryan, 27, Ellis, 22 and Somer, 11. After convincing Miss Gosney that her car was broken, Olley went on to blag a further £500 from her, which he claimed was needed to cover the cost of the repairs. ‘I don’t have a clue about cars and he seemed to know what he was talking about. He flipped the bonnet up and looked horrified at what was underneath,’ she said. ‘He listed things that needed repairing and it sounded like it was going to cost a fortune. I told him I couldn’t afford it, so he offered to fix it for me at the garage where he worked. ‘Although we’d only been dating a few weeks, I trusted him. He seemed so genuine, like he was just happy to help.’ Miss Gosney, who works in a salon, handed over her keys to Olley, who later demanded £500 from her to cover the cost of car parts needed to fix the vehicle. Miss Gosney said she was forced to get the bus to and from work after Olley took her car . But two weeks later, she still did not have her car back. ‘I knew something wasn’t right,’ she explained. ‘I kept asking him where my car was and he just made up excuses. He told me there was more wrong with it than he first thought and that it was taking him longer than expected. ‘I had to get the bus to and from work, and to pick my daughter up from school. ‘When he asked for money to pay for car parts, I thought it sounded expensive. But by that point, I was desperate for my car back, so I gave him the money hoping it would hurry things up a bit.’ Four weeks later, Miss Gosney’s suspicions grew when she had not seen Olley in days and struggled to get hold of him. He told Miss Gosney, who has since moved back to Warrington, that he was in hospital being treated for diabetes. Rosheen, pictured with her daughter Somer, said she felt 'stupid' for not realising Olley was a fake . But Miss Gosney’s patience ran thin and she reported him to the police, only to discover he was already wanted in connection with conning other women out of cars and money. ‘They told me he’d served a prison sentence in 2012 for similar crimes. I felt so stupid for not realising he was a fake,’ she said. ‘He even stole from my little girl because her Nintendo DSi was in the car’s glove compartment when he took it. She never got it back.’ Amazingly in March 2013, weeks after reporting Olley to the police, Miss Gosney spotted her car for sale in a car dealership, while on the bus home from work. She said: ‘It was on sale for £600. I couldn’t believe it. He’d had the nerve to steal my car from me, then sell it to my local car dealership. Miss Gosney reported Olley to the police, only to discover he was already wanted in connection with conning other women out of cars and money . ‘I contacted the police and they managed to get it back for me. But I’d been without a car ages by then and was still out of pocket £500.’ In May 2013, Olley appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court and admitted four charges of theft against Miss Gosney and another woman, who he’d stolen £70 from which belonged to her eight-year-old son, and her young daughter’s phone. He was jailed for three years. Since then, Olley has appeared in court again in October 2013 to face similar charges against other victims and has been jailed for 46 months. Miss Gosney said: ‘I’m still embarrassed for not realising Danny was a fraud. I really liked him and thought he was a decent man. But he took advantage of me and so many other women. ‘The whole experience has put me off online dating. I’ve met someone new now – and didn’t meet him online. ‘I hope my story will serve as a warning to other women, to steer clear of Danny. ‘You’ll only end up paying for him to break your heart.’","Rosheen Gosney met Daniel Olley on the dating website Plenty Of Fish .

"A teenager from Tennessee has miraculously regained the ability to walk again - just six weeks after being diagnosed with a rare spinal disease that could have paralaysed her for life. 15-year-old Jessica Shainburg woke up one morning in January to discover she could not feel anything below her waist, according to an ABC report. Doctors diagnosed her with a disorder which causes the spine to inflame known as transverse myelitis - and said it could be permanent if she was not walking within six weeks. The chances of that happening were less than one in three but incredibly, Jessica recovered in time thanks to another rare disorder in her brain that catalysed her recovery. Jessica from Nashville told WKRN-TV: 'I'm so blessed and lucky to be able to be walking again.' Miracle: 15-year-old Jessica Shainburg (pictured) is up and running - literally - just six weeks after being diagnosed with a spinal disease which could have left her paralysed for life . Grateful: Jessica (pictured) from Nashville, Tennessee said: 'I'm so blessed and lucky to be able to be walking again.' Blessing in disguise: Doctors told her father Jeff (left) that her rapid return to health could be down to another inflammation they found in her brain which improves recovery rates . A few days before she completely lost the use of her legs, she claimed to experience some tingling in her lower limbs but the emergency room doctors could not find anything serious and sent her home. Even her father Jeff did not believe her at first and told Jessica: 'You gotta wake your legs up and we got to go to school.' A few days earlier, Jessica said she felt a tingling in her legs, but emergency room doctors found no signs of anything serious and sent her home, said her father. She was eventually diagnosed with a disorder which inflames the spinal cord called transverse myelitis. Jessica surpassed all doctor's expectations during the weeks of rehabilitation at Scottish Rite Hospital, according to her father. After her recover, he said: 'It's a miracle... Every day she's getting better and stronger. 'She just always had a great attitude and was willing to do the work with the therapist. They loved her attitude and they wanted to work with her continuously.' The doctors at the hospital in Atlanta, Georgia also discovered Jessica had signs of a rare inflammation of the brain known as Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

Jeff Shainburg added: 'The doctors didn't expect her to recover like that... They were so impressed with her rehab. They hadn't seen a patient like this in a while.' He says Jessica - who is still too weak to return to her High School studies - has a personal walker and wheelchair which she only uses when she has been standing for long periods of time. While the teen is likely to start school in a few weeks, doctors are keeping a close eye on her as she recovers. If the rare symptoms reappear, there is a chance it could be a sign of multiple sclerosis.","Jessica Shainburg was diagnosed with a rare spinal disease six weeks ago .

"An Australian businessman could now face the death penalty in the Philippines after being accused of killing a child and orchestrating an international paedophile ring. Last month Peter Gerard Scully from Melbourne was arrested after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. The 52-year-old had allegedly established a 'pay for view' scheme where clients from across the globe paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused as per their requests. It has created such outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Sherwin Gatchalian, an MP with the Nationalist People's Coalition, said. Filipinos across the country took to social media to call for his execution. It's alleged that Scully, from the Melbourne suburb of Burwood, took part in perverted acts against children as young as one, which he filmed. He was also running a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police said Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clientele, who were mostly based in Europe. Scully managed to avoid being arrested until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'I started crying, I don't know what we were doing,' a tearful Daisy said. Scully then allegedly rubbed mineral oil on the girls' bodies and sexually assaulted them, while Alvarez took photos. They were then told to keep digging and Daisy was made to sleep in the same room where they had been digging the holes. The next day Daisy said they were forced to perform sexual acts on the man. 'I was crying and screaming so much that Alvarez covered my head with a pillow. I choked so much but Scully continued his abuses on me,' Daisy said. 'Alvarez slapped me and said that I if don't stop crying, Peter will continue doing this.' The girls were then told to keep digging after the horrendous ordeal. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . That evening, Daisy said they were forced the alcohol and she managed three drinks before passing out and woke up  the next morning to discover she had slept in one of the dug-out graves because she had kept crying and calling for her 'mama'. It was on the fourth day that became unbearable for the little girls. 'They were filming, taking photographs while we dug our graves, and they again brought us to their room, this time, I was tied with a nylon cord, my hands, my feet – I could not move,' Daisy said. 'I wanted to kill myself, I wanted to die that night, because I could not bear it any longer.' However, it was the very next day that the girls fled for their lives when Scully and Alvarez left the house. Queenie’s mother took the girls to the local police station to file a complaint against Scully and Alvarez. When the police turned up to the house - they apprehended Alvarez but Scully escaped. Agents assigned to the case described the video footage as 'the worst video we have encountered in our years of campaign against child pornography' which led to seven young victims being rescued, the inquirer.net reported. Alvaraz, now 18, revealed her bizarre lifestyle to a prison warden at the Cagayan de Oro City Jail where she was detained. She met Scully when she working as a prostitute at just 14 years old and allegedly endured a similar ordeal to Daisy and Queenie before paid by Scully to entice the children into their home.","Peter Gerald Scully was arrested in Philippines on child sex abuse charges .

"The bodies of a newborn and another 'mummified' stillborn have been discovered hidden in a box in the ceiling of an Indiana funeral home. The gruesome discovery was made at Smith, Bizzell & Warner Funeral Home, in Gary, on Wednesday. It is thought babies had been stashed in the ceiling of the home's morgue for years - although it is unclear why, and police say foul play is not suspected. Gruesome: Police removed the bodies of two babies from this funeral home in Indiana on Wednesday . The stillborn may have been concealed for almost two decades, as papers found with it suggest it was born in March 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune. The identity of a woman is also said to have been revealed in the papers. The other baby - a boy, according to Eyewitness News - is thought to have been born in March 2012, according to a hospital bracelet it was wearing. It may have died when it was a few months old. Police have emphasized they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding how the babies came to be hidden above the ceiling tiles. But a spokeswoman for Concord Family Services, which has owned Smith and Bizzell since 2005, denied they had been hidden in the ceiling. She told the Tribune the babies were stored 'in the morgue', and the home had simply been trying to ensure they had a proper final resting place. The spokeswoman went on to tell Eyewitness News that both babies - which she described as 'unclaimed fetuses' - had been at the home since before Concord Family Services purchased the business. According to its website, Smith, Bizzell & Warner has been 'serving the community' for more than 90 years, and boasts it is the only funeral home in Gary which is a member of the Order of the Golden Rule'. 'Membership of the ""Order of the Golden Rule"" simply put, says you are the ""best of the best"" in funeral service,' the website explains.","Police removed  bodies from funeral home in Gary, Indiana, on Wednesday .

"The SIM card that helped revolutionise the mobile industry in the early days of bulky car phones is now approaching its 25th birthday. But while the handsets they are used in have developed and evolved significantly during that time, SIMs still look the same - albeit smaller - and are still lodged inside devices. A Cambridge computer science experts believes the small microchips' days are numbered and we should be signing into our phones in the same way we log into online accounts. Dr Markus Kuhn from the University of Cambridge said the SIM (stock image) could have been replaced long ago. He believes alternatives include typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone . 'The fact is, the SIM could have been replaced long ago with a simpler alternative: typing in a user identifier and password directly into the phone is an option - just as we do to access WiFi,' said Dr Markus Kuhn from the University of Cambridge. Or QR codes - the square, 3D barcodes - are a more convenient alternative for smartphones with cameras, where an app can read the details encoded in the QR straight from the camera. Dr Kuhn continued: 'SIM cards were a useful feature when they came onto the market in 1991. 'At the time mobile phones were bulky devices, usually mounted in cars [and] a SIM would help customers quickly and easily transfer their phone number and contacts from one phone to the next, without the need to type in long identifiers and access codes each time. Alternatively,  QR codes (example pictured) are a  convenient way to store and access data using a smartphone camera . 'But the days of huge or rented car phones are gone, and today smartphones are lightweight, personal devices that we entrust with passwords to many sites and services - access to WiFi, email, social networks, app stores, and online shopping.' He believes replacing SIMs with passwords or extra software would make it easier to have multiple several pay-as-you-go contracts from different providers on a single phone. They could subsequently switch to the cheapest rate depending on where they were, and apps that functioned as brokers could even negotiate which network to select based on best price automatically. Customers would also not be hindered by the complicated switching process currently used when moving phone numbers across networks. In terms of security, Dr Kuhn explained that SIM cards are also vulnerable to attack. Gemalto, the Dutch SIM card manufacturer, was reportedly the victim of an NSA and GCHQ attack for example. Although the firm said that little information was stolen, 'the reality is that SIM cards are now more of a drawback than a benefit,' added Dr Kuhn. The University of Cambridge lecturer also believes the time is right to switch from SIM cards because modern cryptographic techniques mean passwords no longer have to be very long. A Global System for Mobile (GSM) network was established in the late 1980s to create a communication standard throughout Europe. Communications. In 1991, German smart-card maker Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish operator Radiolinja. In 2014 5.2 billion SIMs (different sizes shown) were sold making them lucrative for manufacturers . SIM stands for subscriber identity module, which is the name of the integrated circuits found in the chips. Phone numbers and other files can be added to these chips too. These modules store data that lets a phone identify who, and which device, it belongs to and connects it to the network. Each card has a serial number as well as network information, and users can remove the card from one phone and install it in a new one without registering the device. The first SIMs were credit card-sized but has become smaller in recent years. In particular, many new handsets take micro-SIMs and Apple devices use nano-SIMs. The next level is embedded SIMs that can be attached directly to circuit boards. Dr Kuhn said SIM cards were a useful feature when mobile phones were mounted in cars (pictured) and customers wanted to transfer contacts from one phone to the next. But as phones have become more mobile, he believes the technology is outdated and should be replaced with a modern alternative . Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) techniques exist that use passwords as a five-digit PIN to create highly secure encrypted connections that even the supercomputers of eavesdropping intelligence agencies can't break. Meanwhile, app stores use modern authentication technique and these could be used to easily transfer all the functionality of a SIM into the phone using an app. 'All that’s needed is a new standard interface for mobile operating systems such as Android or iOS that would allow software to take over the functions of the SIM, said Dr Kuhn. 'Technically, a mobile network login is no more challenging than similar applications such as payment wallets, online banking, digital rights managed content, and so on.' But he recognises that operators prefer the SIM model because they can lock customers to their network, preventing easy access to competitors. Plus, in 2014 5.2 billion SIM cards were sold, making it a lucrative business for manufacturers. 'Manufacturers are understandably against anything that would eliminate their business. Modern SIMs are tiny, difficult to access, and easy to lose once taken out of the phone. 'In fact many users may not even know how to find or remove theirs, because it was inserted for them when they bought the phone. 'This inconvenience allows providers to charge high roaming fees when customers use their phone abroad, when using a local operator would be cheaper.'","Dr Markus Kuhn said the SIM could have been replaced a long time ago .

"American cinema chains are refusing to screen Idris Elba's new film Beasts of No Nation because Netflix exclusively bought the film's distribution rights for £7.8million. The country's four biggest theatre companies - AMC, Regal, Cinemark and Carmike -  told Variety they will not show the film about child soldiers in Africa. They believe the deal breaks the unwritten rule of waiting 90 days between the movie's cinematic and home entertainment release. Netflix has said the movie will still get a limited run in 'selected theatres' so it can be considered for the Oscars and other major awards. Exclusive: The distribution rights to Beasts of No Nation starring Idris Elba (pictured) have been bought exclusively by Netflix, prompting a furious backlash from America's cinema chains . Based on the best-selling novel by Uzodinma Iweala, it stars Idris Elba as a warlord in an unnamed west-African country who captures a child soldier. According to the Guardian, the £3.9million film was shot in Ghana last year. 42-year-old Elba is currently in London filming the fourth series of award-winning British drama Luther, in which he plays the lead character. Netflix beat distributors like Focus and Fox Searchlight for the rights to his latest film because the its backers believed it would reach a much bigger audience online. One of the producers Amy Kaufman told Variety: 'This movie will have the muscle of Netflix behind it. 'It will definitely be seen by a lot more and different kinds of people through Netflix than it would have through a traditional platform.' She believes the quality of programming on the site is altering people's perceptions about the way they consume entertainment content. She added: 'It could be a game changer. This has the potential to change the way people perceive how movies and art are delivered to them.' Netflix encountered a similar stalemate last year when it announced a partnership with Weistein Company and Imax on the 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' sequel. Star: Idris Elba (pictured) is back in London filming the fourth series of award-winning British drama Luther . According to Variety, independent chains such as the Alamo Drafthouse which has 19 theatres in Texas, New York and California has said it will screen the movie. Its Chief Executive Tim League said: 'I'm agnostic about this sort of thing. I look at films I want to play and I play them regardless of the release strategy.' 'I don't look at myself as a competitor to Netflix. I think that argument is a little bit of a red herring. I watch a lot of movies at home, but there comes a time where I want to get out of the house. 'I look at cinemas as one of those options that compete with restaurants or baseball games or all of those things I can't do in my living room.' Movie experts say Beasts could be shown in as many as 250 art-house cinemas. It is being directed by California-born Cary Fukunaga who was responsible for Jane Eyre starring Billy Elliot star Jamie Bell - and hit TV series True Detective featuring Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey.","Netflix bought distribution rights for 'Beasts of No Nation' for  £7.8million .

"At least 68 people, including children, were massacred by suspected Boko Haram militants as they attended morning prayers. Men and boys were targeted by gunmen after they stormed Njaba in eastern Nigeria before burning the remote village to the ground. The assault took place early on Tuesday as many villagers in the isolated community were heading to morning prayers. 'The attack was not immediately known because the village is very remote and our men couldn't access the area,' said a military source. Nigerian troops have been struggling to control Boko Haram. Pictured: Chardian soldiers near the front line in Gambaru, Nigeria . One woman, Falmata Bisika, 62, lost four of her grandchildren in the raid, which she said was carried out by gunmen 'armed to the teeth' with weapons and explosives. The militants destroyed homes and businesses with petrol bombs and shot anyone attempting to flee, 'especially teenagers and the elderly', she said. Muminu Haruna, 42, said he hid in a grain silo behind his house for several hours with about eight other people until the gunmen left. 'I participated in the counting of dead bodies... 68 people were killed,' he said in an account supported by two civilian vigilantes. 'These included both males and females, some were slaughtered and others shot dead and most of the houses in our village have been destroyed.' Njaba is 20 kilometres from the town of Damboa, which was seized by Boko Haram last June, forcing thousands to flee, but later recaptured by troops helped by civilian vigilantes. Boko Haram's six-year insurgency to carve out an Islamic state in the northeast of Nigeria has killed thousands and displaced over 1.5 million people. The group gained worldwide notoriety in April 2014 after its members kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibokin Borno state, the heartland of Boko Haram. The slow government response sparked the movement Bring BackOur Girls that has been seeking international support and lobbying the government to keep up the search. Today, a representative for President Goodluck met the girls' families in Maiduguri. Boko Haram control a large area of Borno state and have also carried out cross-border raids in Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. A military coalition has recaptured several towns in recent weeks. Chadian soldiers patrol in the border town of Gamboru, Nigeria, after taking control of the city, February 4, 2015 . A screen grab made on January 20, 2015 from a video of Nigerian Islamist extremist group Boko Haram shows Abubakar Shekau, the group's leader, delivering a message at an unknown location . Chad's well-trained army has offered a huge boost to Nigeria in recent weeks, recapturing towns in border areas and pushing into territory near Boko Haram's Sambisa Forest training camps. Chadian President Idriss Deby yesterday claimed he knew where Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau was and called on him to surrender or be killed. The Nigerian authorities have declared Shekau dead three times but the military has since reportedly said that they want the militant leader captured alive.","Armed militants stormed village of Njaba in eastern Nigeria at dawn .

"A Buddhist nun claims she ended up in hospital after being badly beaten up by a rival who wanted to take over her job running a Chinese temple. Wei Hui, who is a Buddhist nun known as a bhikkhuni, claims religious leaders are refusing to take action after she was left lying in the gutter covered in blood following the attack. She was given the prestigious job as head nun at the Jingzhou Tienv Temple in central China's Hubei Province, but it was also wanted by rival Xi Jing, who now stands accused of attacking Wei Hui to put her out of action. Buddhist nun Wei Hui pictured lying in the gutter and covered in blood following the alleged assault . She was then taken to hospital, where she said a medical report proved she had been badly injured . Wei Hui, 39, who is still in hospital, said she released the picture of her after being badly beaten to media because her religious leaders were refusing to take action over what had happened and were not treating it seriously, The People's Daily reported. She said: 'I was left lying in the gutter with my clothes covered in blood. There is a medical report that confirms I was badly hurt, yet there seems to be some suggestion that it was my fault that I ended up like this.' Wei Hiu's medical report, which showed she had suffered serious injuries in the alleged assault . Her rival Xi Jing, 41, meanwhile says that the allegations that she was the one who was responsible for the attack are nonsense, despite the fact Wei Hui claimed to have identified her. She said: 'Wei Hui is merely unhappy that I was asked to take over while she recovered in hospital. 'The fact that I had been offered the chance to stand in for her was clearly proof that our religious superiors believe the allegations were nonsense.' According to Buddhist scriptures, the order of bhikkhunis or female nuns was first created by Buddha five years after he created the first Buddhist monk. Although the female order eventually died out, it was reinstated in 2007 after a congress held in Germany with representatives from Buddhist countries all round the world. Zhao Yongqin, the director general of Jingzhou national religious affairs management institutions, when contacted for comment claimed to be unaware of the fact that Wei Hui had been beaten despite the medical report testifying to her injuries.","Buddhist nun claims she was badly beaten by a rival who wanted her job .

"A diplomat has been freed more than 18 months after he was snatched by terrorists on his way to work at the Iranian embassy in Yemen. Nour-Ahmad Nikbakht's return was broadcast today on Iran's state media as he thanked the country's secret services and foreign ministry for getting him home. Mr Nikbakht was working at Iran's embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in July 2013 when he was kidnapped by suspected Al Qaeda gunmen. Increasing danger: Iranian diplomat Nour-Ahmad Nikbakht was working at Iran's embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa (pictured) in July 2013 when he was kidnapped by terrorists and held for more than 18 months . The militants held him in a remote area between the southern provinces of Shabwa and Baida, tribal and Yemeni security sources said. As he returned today to Tehran's Mehrabad Airport, he told state media: 'I was kidnapped by unknown gunmen and terrorists as I left my home to go to work.' He added that 'many efforts were made by soldiers from (Iran's secret services), the intelligence ministry and the foreign ministry' to secure his release. The state news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian as saying: 'A special team from the Intelligence Ministry was able to . free Nikbakht from the clutches of terrorists in a series of . complex and difficult operations in a very particular part of . Yemen'. Mr Nikbakht was the second high-profile hostage to be freed in . Yemen this week after a Saudi diplomat kidnapped in 2012 and held by Al Qaeda was . released on Monday. With oil giant Saudi Arabia on its northern border and Al-Shabaab base Somalia a short way across the sea, Yemen is in a crucial position in the fight against terror. But the United Nations has warned Yemen is 'on the brink of civil war' after Iranian-backed Shia Muslim militants known as Houthis seized the capital in September. The move prompted a violent backlash by Sunni Muslim militants - including Al Qaeda, many of whose terrorist operations are run from Yemen. 'On the brink of civil war': Yemeni gunmen loyal to the Houthi movement which has swept to power in Sanaa . Last month Al Qaeda-linked fighters seized an army base in  the southern province of Shabwa which had held up to 2,000 government soldiers. The Ansar al-Sharia group said on Twitter that it had set off a suicide bomb at the gate, took control of three guard towers and a tank and imprisoned some of the troops. The Houthis, meanwhile are continuing their spread across the country too prompting violent clashes with Sunni tribesmen. Jamal Benomar, the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, said last month: 'We believe the situation is very dangerous. Yemen is on the brink of civil war'. He accused all sides of contributing to the political and economic turmoil and called for more talks. Yemen has been gripped by unrest since president Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down in early 2012 after a bloody year-long popular uprising. In January last year, another Iranian diplomat, Ali Asghar Assadi, was shot dead in an attack in a neighbourhood in Sanaa housing several foreign embassies.","Nour-Ahmad Nikbakht's return to Tehran was broadcast on state media .

"The future headquarters of Germany's spy agency has suffered millions of pounds of flood damage after  thieves stole water taps from the site in what is being dubbed as the country's 'Watergate'. Burglars targeted the heavily guarded building site which has been hit by several setbacks since construction began in the heart of the German capital nine years ago. They ripped out water taps from bathrooms on the fourth, fifth and sixth floors in a passageway leading to the main part of the sprawling complex early Tuesday.

Burglars targeted the heavily guarded building site which has been hit by several setbacks since construction began in the heart of the German capital nine years ago . That led to a massive leak that caused an estimated millions of euros  in damage, according to media reports. The motive was unclear as the taps are only thought to be worth a few hundred euros. The foreign intelligence agency (BND) declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the federal construction agency which manages the building site only confirmed the theft. The site is guarded by a private firm and monitored by dozens of security cameras. Heavy security: The site is guarded by a private firm and monitored by dozens of CCTV cameras (above) German media leapt on the incident as one more embarrassment for the country's spy chiefs over the new complex. Berlin's daily Tagesspiegel splashed the headline: 'Watergate at the new BND building'. The move of the BND to the German capital from its current headquarters in Bavaria with some 3,000 staff members has been delayed several times and is currently scheduled for 2017. In 2011, the agency was forced to admit that the blueprints for the new complex had been stolen but played down the security risks posed by the loss.","Thieves stole taps on various floors of future HQ of German spy agency .

"Child benefit could be limited to only three children, under plans being considered by the Tories. The proposals will only hit babies born after the law has been changed and could save the Government £300million a year. At the moment there are around 320,000 families with four or more children. The Chancellor George Osborne is resisting proposals from the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to cap child benefit at three children . Child benefit is paid to families with children under 16 – or under 20 if they are in education or training. But since 2013 families with one parent earning more than £50,000 a year have been excluded from claiming the benefit. It currently pays £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. James Browne, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the move would eventually save hundreds of millions of pounds  – but not for another 18 years because it only affects babies born after the law is changed. Child benefit is paid families with children under 16 - or under 20 if they are in education or training - and is worth £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has previously proposed a two-child limit, but George Osborne is understood to have rejected it. The Treasury is now ‘softening’ to the idea and is examining the details. Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was not purely about cost but could ‘send a message about personal responsibility’. He said: ‘There is a much broader point than just the financial bean counting,’ he said. ‘It's the kind of welfare system we want - do we want a social safety net or are we saying that welfare is somehow a lifestyle choice? ‘And I think we do want the welfare system to send a message about personal responsibility, and yes that includes parents saving and taking some responsibility for the size of their family, making sure it's according to their means.’ But Labour MP Dame Anne Begg said people did not have children for child benefit and asked ‘why pick on’ large families. She said: ‘I don't think you have a child because you're going to get an extra... £13.55 a week.’ Dame Anne added: ‘Only one in seven families have three or more children - it's a small number - so why pick on them?’","Controversial proposal would only hit babies born after rule is introduced .

"One piggy went to market and this little piggy went 'nom, nom, nom' all the way home. Hanna Balicki from Palm Beach, Florida, filmed the moment she treated a miniature porker to a dinner of potato chips. Footage shows the snouted animal making a string of ecstatic squealing sounds as he snuffles up the salty snacks. As soon as a chip is put near his lips, the little hog quickly gobbles it up. He then proceeds to oink and grunt at the top of his lungs. 'Nom, nom, nom,' he seems to say, as he awaits another helping of nibbles. Another chip is presented and the pig literally inhales it in a snap. He then whines away for more. Although the clip was filmed in 2012 it has recently resurfaced. Many viewers have commented on the pig's bizarre vocal range, while others have criticized his high-sodium diet.

"A Virginia teenager was arrested Friday for helping a man travel to Syria in order to join ISIS forces, according to a report. The 17-year-old was taken into custody during an FBI raid on the teen's home in Woodbridge, neighbors said. The Washington Post reports that the boy, who is a student at Osbourn Park High School in nearby Manassas, is being charged as a juvenile, although officials are working to try him as an adult. High schooler: FBI officials arrested a 17-year-old in connection with a man who traveled to Syria and joined up with ISIS . According to officials whose names were withheld by the paper, the teenager allegedly used online contacts to help another slightly older man travel to Syria and link up with ISIS. Officials said they conducted surveillance on the home for about a month before the teenager's arrest. The man who traveled to Syria is expected to face charges, according to officials, who also looked into another 17-year-old student at Osbourn Park, before judging him to have played a much smaller role. A neighbor said that FBI officials knocked on the front and back doors of the home before someone inside opened up. The boy was later led out in handcuffs, with the officials also carrying a computer and other electronic equipment, the neighbor said. Though she did not give her name, the neighbor said that the boy had attended middle school with her daughter and that in spite of spending most his time in the home, remarked the boy seemed like a typical teenager. Drawn to extremism: The man helped by the teenager in Woodbridge successfully reached Syria through contacts overseas to join up with ISIS (file photo) The boy's alleged online ties to individuals close to the Islamist extremist group surprised some who knew him as a smart young man interested in business and technology. 'He was a brilliant kid,' said Dustin O’Bryant, who hired the teenager to write  for his site Coin Brief. 'His English wasn’t perfect, but I was willing to overlook that because the content was great.' O'Bryant said he hired the teenager for the site, which covers BitCoin and other digital currencies, after being impressed by a chemistry paper the boy wrote. He 'had a really strong understanding of the technology behind digital currency in general and even more advanced systems,' O'Bryant said. BuzzFeed reports that the teenager had not communicated with O'Bryant, who lives in Alabama, since February, when he told him he was going through personal issues. 'He in no way came across as any sort of extremist,' O'Bryant said. 'My hope is that there was some kind of misunderstanding, that he didn’t know who he was helping.'","The boy allegedly used online contacts to help another slightly older man travel to Syria and link up with ISIS .

"A Colorado boy, six, was given a one-day suspension after aiming his fingers at a classmate in the shape of a gun while saying 'you're dead'. Elijah Thurston, a first grade student, was given the punishment from Stratton Meadows Elementary School for threats against peers following the incident on Monday. His father, Austin Thurston, said the disciplinary action was 'a little extreme' for the young child who was 'playing', and that no recess might have been more suitable. Scroll down for video . Six-year-old Elijah Thurston (above), a first grade student, was given the punishment from Stratton Meadows Elementary School in Colorado for threats against peers following the incident on Monday . His father, Austin Thurston (above), said the disciplinary action was 'a little extreme' for the young child who was 'playing', and that no recess might have been more suitable . 'Of course I think he was playing. What six-year-old doesn't play cops and robbers, or cowboys and Indians?' Mr Thurston told KRDO. A school administrator spoke to Elijah, who has been attending the school since January, about the meaning of the word 'dead' and how he should not confuse games or make-believe things with reality, according to the behavior report. The school takes into consideration previous and current behaviors and also speaks to both the student and parents before issuing a suspension, said a spokesperson for Harrison School District Two. They feel they gave the appropriate punishment following the incident. Specific details of the case cannot be released because it is a part of the student's personal record.

"A recent survey has revealed that more than a third of Brits take four or fewer baths a year — preferring instead to opt for the convenience of a shower. More fool them, I say. I’m part of the Tom Ford school of thinking — the fashion designer has been reported to take up to five baths a day, revering them for their ‘meditative’ properties. And he’s right. When it comes to relaxation, nothing beats a long, hot soak. These days, you can make your bath even more self-indulgent with gadgets that let you lounge in the tub while watching films, reading books or listening to music. And some of them will even run the water for you. I slipped beneath the suds to try them out . . . RELAX INTO PILLOW PERFECTION . The Savoy Bath Pillow . Lounge in utmost comfort with a bath pillow from one of the world’s swankiest hotels — The Savoy Bath Pillow (£15, Savoy Tea Shop). While a night at The Savoy will cost you the best part of £400, one of their bath pillows — described to me by one travel editor as ‘the best I’ve found anywhere, ever’ — can be yours for a fraction of the cost. Unlike its cheaper cousins, this luxurious pillow is not inflatable or square. Instead, it’s a foam cylinder, covered in spa-style waffle cotton, which can be removed for washing. Two suction cups on a flap of fabric hold it firmly against the bath, and the cylinder sits at the nape of your neck, cradling you gently as you drift off. Pure bathing bliss. KEEP A GLASS OF WINE SAFE . Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder . Relaxing with a glass of red by candlelight sounds like a dream — until you knock it onto the floor or into the bath. To avoid such mishaps, look for holders, such as the Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder (£6.95, homearama.co.uk), a sleek, stainless-steel design that works best on a perpendicular bath side. They also do a tealight holder (£6.45). For an all-in-one solution that will hold not only a glass of wine and a candle, but also a book, check out the Bathroom Bath Tub Caddy with Wine, Candle and Book Holder (£14.99, amazon.co.uk). It may look a little twee, but it does the job so well, you’re unlikely to care. Extending handles mean that it will fit over any bath up to 90 cm wide (a standard bath is 70 cm) and the candle holder, book stand and wine glass holders are all detachable. LIGHT UP YOUR LATHER . Colour Changing Spa Lights . If candles don’t light your fire, there’s a wealth of other lighting options to try out at bathtime. Colour Changing Spa Lights (£6.95, prezzybox.com) are fully submersible and come with a suction cup, which means they can stick to the sides and the base of the bath. They change colour gradually and will even float on the surface. For a real Saturday Night Fever effect, try the Underwater Disco Lightshow (£7.99, firebox.com), a floating gadget that projects multicoloured patterns of light around your bathroom — rather like a watery mirrorball. It sounds bonkers but, with the lights off, it’s truly mesmerising. HAVE A RAVE WHILE YOU BATHE . The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker . If you enjoy being lulled by Handel’s Water Music while you bathe, then a waterproof speaker is a must. The best solution is a Bluetooth speaker that connects wirelessly to your computer, tablet or smartphone, meaning your pricey gadgets can stay safe and dry outside the bathroom, while you listen to your music inside. The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker (£6.15, amazon.co.uk) has a suction cup attached, so you can stick it to tiles. It doesn’t offer the best quality sound — what do you expect at that price? — and for best results, you need to turn the volume right up on the source device, then adjust on the speaker. But it’s rechargeable and does everything that you need it to, including skipping tracks. You can even use it to answer your phone. That is if you don’t mind your bath being disturbed. For a better sound experience, though at a significantly elevated price, try the rechargeable waterproof Ultimate Ears Megaboom Speaker (£249.95, amazon.co.uk). Only about the size of two stacked tin cans, it produces seriously impressive sound. And if you really love your music, you might consider an upgrade to the Kaldewei Soundwave Sound System (£396.25, ukbathrooms.com), which turns your whole bath into a speaker that wirelessly connects to the music source using Bluetooth. The sounds aren’t just audible, they can actually be felt as vibrations through the water — fine if you’re listening to waves or whales, though less relaxing if you have a penchant for heavy metal! WATERPROOF YOUR IPAD . LifeProof’s nuud iPad case . Back in the old days, reading a book or magazine in the bath was the ultimate escape — until, of course, you dropped it in the water and had to leave it splayed on a radiator to dry. Now that an estimated two in five of us own a tablet or eReader, the ramifications of dropping your novel in the bath have become a little more significant. So, although the Kobo Aura H2O eReader (£139.95, johnlewis.com) is £60 more than the basic model and around £80 more than the cheapest Kindle, it might be a worthwhile investment, because it’s waterproof for up to 30 minutes. If you’d rather watch television in the bath, you could either splash out on a Hafele Waterproof TV (from £470, hafele.co.uk) or invest in a waterproof case and stream films or TV through your tablet. LifeProof’s nuud iPad case (£89.95, apple.com) does the job, but comes at a price. If you’re just planning on leaving your device on the side, then a water-resistant one (which is splash-proof, but not submersible), such as the Griffin Survivor Case (from £19.99, amazon.co.uk), which comes with its own stand, will do. An even cheaper option is a Go Travel Waterproof Case (from £5.09, amazon.co.uk) — effectively a heavy-duty plastic bag, which uses a Velcro closure to keep the water away from your gadget if it accidentally gets dunked. ... AND THE BATH CAN EVEN RUN ITSELF! Crosswater Digital . If you dream of having a butler to draw a bath for you, then this gadget could make all of your Downton Abbey fantasies come true. Crosswater Digital (from £499, crosswater.co.uk) is a seriously high-tech bath system that lets you take control of your bath or shower from an app on your smartphone. You can dial in the temperature and depth you want — and even store up to three presets, just in case you prefer a hotter or deeper bath than your partner. You’ll need to be on the same wifi network (so you can’t start running the bath when you’re on the train on the way home), but it can be used from anywhere in the house. And if you’ve got the additional electronic plug system, you can even drain the bath using the app, too. Unfortunately, the one thing it won’t do is to clean the bath for you!","A survey revealed that over a third of Brits take four or fewer baths a year .

"An abandoned three-year-old girl from India who was refused by many couples seeking to adopt because she didn't have a nose has finally found a new home. Kristen Williams, 44, from Cincinnati, adopted little Durga after a number of couples refused her because insects had eaten away her nose when she was abandoned at birth. But Durga has now started a new life in  Ohio, with her eight-year-old sister Munni, who Kristen also adopted from India in 2012. Kristen Williams, a teacher from Ohio, adopted little Durga who was abandoned at work causing her nose to be eaten by insects . Kristen said: ‘I look at my girls and I’m so happy. I had set out to adopt a child but this journey has brought me so much more. 'I feel so much love for my girls. They’re my world and I can’t wait to start our lives together. To call them my family just fills me with joy.’ Kristen, who is still single having never met the right man, started her adoption journey in Nepal, in 2010. But the following year the US suddenly suspended all adoptions with the country. So Kristen was introduced to India and very quickly came across little Munni who had been in an orphanage since 2009. She said: ‘I was looking through the lists and lists of children up for adoption on my computer screen from an agency and there were just so many. 'It was heartbreaking to see how many girls need a loving home in India. But I suddenly felt this pull for this little girl. 'Her name was Munni and she was just five years old at the time. I don’t know what it was but we connected. I just knew she was my daughter, I felt we had to be together and I got the ball rolling.’ Durga was abandoned at birth, since then many parents have rejected her because of her deformity . Kristen says that she has taken some time off work so that she can help both Durga and Munni settle in to their new homes . Over the next two years Kristen was put through paper work and court processes in order to adopt Munni, but she never gave up. ‘I knew I wanted Munni in my life so I did everything in my power to make it happen,’ she added. ‘I wasn’t giving up on her no matter how long it took.’ Eventually in December 2012 Kristen met Munni for the first time. Kristen came to know that Munni had a scar on her forehead in the shape of a horseshoe but no one could tell her how it got there. Munni was quiet and withdrawn but Kristen felt nothing but love for her. And on 14 February , 2013, Kristen finally became Munni’s adopted mother. She said: ‘I call her my forever valentine because it was all finalised on Valentine’s Day. 'It was such a special day. I was so blessed. She opened my eyes to so much. And I knew I wanted to adopt a little sister or brother for Munni.’ Kristen, who works as a secondary school teacher in Loveland, told her adoption agency as soon as she arrived that that she wanted to adopt again. And they promised to keep her notified of availabilities. Kristen proudly shows off her girls Munni and Durga having adopted both of the little girls from India . The adoption process relies heavily on agencies and its caseworkers matching prospective parents with children. And it was Kristen’s caseworker that told her about Durga. She had been abandoned in a bush at birth and insects or animals had eaten away her nose. Apparently the police found her clinging to life and took her to a nearby clinic in Kutch, in Gujarat, western India. Chances of her survival were slim, but she fought on. Eventually she made a full recovery and she started her life in an orphanage. But there was no funding or money available for treatment to her nose. Durga had spent all her life with no nose. When Kristen first saw a photo, she didn’t hesitate. She said yes immediately and knew that Durga would be happy with her and Munni, . ‘I remember that Munni and I were driving home from the part one day and my case worker called saying: ""We have a little girl for you and you’d be a perfect family for her"", and I told her to send her information over immediately,’ Kristen remembered. As soon as Kristen and Munni walked through the door they logged on to the computer and Durga’s face smiled back at them. Kristen said: ‘I cried straight away. This gorgeous little girl with such beautiful eyes had suffered so much. Munni looked at her photo and said: ‘Is that my little sister?’. I said yes immediately. The case worker asked if I needed 24 hours to think about it but I said no, not needed.’ Munni is a proud big sister to Durga, both little girls were adopted from India but now live in Ohio with their mother, Kristen . The adoption process meant Durga was then locked to Kristen and no other prospective parent could meet her. But Durga had been refused by many couple because of her missing nose. Ilaben Anjaria, the Superintendent of Kutch Mahila Kalyan Kendra centre, in Gujarat, said Durga arrived at the care centre in September 2011, weighing just 1lb 3oz and was just a day old. ‘Her nose was badly nibbled by insects and she was very weak and we were afraid she wouldn’t survive. We tried our best to take good care of her and we used to feed her with cotton balls soaked in milk. ‘We named her Durga. For three years we tried our best to find a home for her. Three couples that initially volunteered eventually rejected her because of her nose. Then we contacted an agency licensed with foreign adoptions. Finally Kristen’s agency got in touch.’ There have been only six children at the centre and more than 25 families are waiting to adopt a baby but none of them wanted to adopt Durga. ‘We’re so happy for Durga that she now has a mother and a wonderful new life in the US. She’s very cute and lovely child. Kristen has assured us Durga will be happy and she said she will bring her back to meet us when she’s older.’ Kristen has now taken eight months off work to spend time helping Durga settle into her new home. She said her parents, her older sister who has four children, and brother in law, have been a big support and having embraced both Munni and Durga as members of the family. Kristen has also been to see surgeons in Ohio to discuss Durga’s nose and when she’s older - at around seven  - she will be able to start the process of having a new nose. ‘Munni is over the moon with her little sister,’ Kristen added. ‘She’s the doting older sister already. She won’t want to go to school in case she misses out but we need to get a nice family routine going so life can become as normal as possible for Durga.’ Kristen would still like to marry one day but said any man she meets needs to be completely happy becoming a father to her girls. ‘It will take a very special man to take all three of us on. I’ll never say never, of course I would love for them to have a father, but I’ll be very careful about who enters our lives.’","Kristen Williams, 44, from Ohio, adopted Durga, three, from India .

"Andrew Hennells, pictured, posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob a Tesco supermarket 15 minutes before holding up staff . An armed raider threatened staff at a Tesco supermarket with a knife less than fifteen minutes after he boasted on Facebook that he was going to rob the store. Andrew Hennells, 31, of Gaywood, King's Lynn posted the message 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on Friday, February 13. Withing a quarter of an hour, Norfolk Police received an emergency call that a man brandishing a knife was demanding cash from staff at the supermarket. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived but he was arrested by armed police in a nearby pub with £410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Hennells, who appeared in court by video link from Norfolk Prison admitted one count of robbery and one count of carrying a knife as an offensive weapon. Judge Katherine Moore adjourned the case until April 8 as she requested full pre-sentence and medical reports on Hennells. The judge said: 'I want all the up-to-date information as to his mental state.' Judge Moore remanded Hennells in custody and warned him that all sentencing options would be open. 'These are serious matters,' she said. Commenting after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Pete Jessop, of King's Lynn CID, said a member of the public had tipped them off about the robbery. He said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells also posted on Facebook hours before carrying out the robbery that he had 'shared' a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . Earlier in the afternoon of the raid, Hennells posted a photograph of a large knife on his Facebook page .

"A Florida middle school student was found with an arsenal of weapons in his backpack last Wednesday. The 13-year-old boy, whose name is being withheld, was caught when another boy was seen handing him a knife in the cafeteria at Sunrise Middle School in Fort Lauderdale. Upon further inspection, it was revealed he was also carrying a .357 Smith & Wesson firearm, another knife,  ammunition, a mask and fireworks. Scroll down for video . A 13-year-old boy was found carrying a .357 Smith & Wesson firearm (similar to the one above), another knife, ammunition, a mask and fireworks in his backpack at a Florida school . The Sun-Sentinel reports that the student was placed on involuntary hold under the Baker Act, which allows authorities in Florida to examine the mental health of an individual and see if they are a harm to themself or others. The teenager was eventually released, but could now face charges of weapons possession and disruption of a school function. Both the boy's mother and attorney, Jim Stark, refused requests for comment. The student who was caught giving the other boy a knife was also taken in under the Baker Act and released. His age and identity are not known at this time. Principal Michael Walker notified parents of the incident in an email last Friday, and this week assured them that the school was safe, though he did not reveal any specifics of what had occurred on that day. Despite his assurances however, many teachers are still afraid. 'It seems calculated, whatever the [student's] plan was,' said Mary Fitzgerald, a schoolteacher for over 35 years and the school's teachers union steward. 'I've never, never in all the years of teaching, even heard of this in Broward County.' The incident occured at Sunrise Middle School (above) in Fort Lauderdale . Another meeting has been scheduled for Thursday evening with faculty, and a more detailed account of what happened has been posted in an online forum only accessible by staff at the school. Under school guidelines, possession of a Class A weapon is grounds for expulsion. 'Student safety is always the District's highest priority, and the school followed all the proper protocols and have worked to keep parents informed,' said Cathleen Brennan, a spokeswoman for Broward County Public Schools. Teachers however still seem unsure of how to deal with last week's event with their students. 'If teachers feel safe, the students will feel safe,' said Fitzgerald. 'They sense it.'","A 13-year-old boy at Sunrise Middle School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida was found with an arsenal of weapons in his backpack .

"A woman wielding a shotgun forced her 7-year-old son to jump out of a second-floor St. Petersburg, Florida, apartment window early Thursday before she jumped as well in an apparent suicide attempt, police said. According to authorities, 7-year-old Oscar Vail said his mother, Michelle Vail, said a serial killer was after the family. Spokeswoman Yolando Fernandez said police got a distress call from the 32-year-old woman around 6:30 a.m. She told the dispatcher that her ex-boyfriend was at the door and she needed help. Mother: 32-year-old Michelle Vail (seen left and right) forced her 7-year-old son Oscar to jump out of a second-floor apartment window, police said . Officers arrived at the apartment a short time later, but Vail wouldn't let them in, saying she didn't believe they were police officers, Fernandez said. 'She was babbling incoherently, none of it made any sense,' Fernandez said. The St. Petersburg Police Department said in a news release 'The caller, Michelle Vail, said that a former boyfriend was standing outside her door and she was fearful that he was going to kill her. 'Vail also said that she [was] armed and officers arriving on the scene determined that she was in possession of a shotgun.' Police also 'noted that she appeared distraught and seemed mentally unstable,' the release said. Contact: Spokeswoman Yolando Fernandez said police got a distress call from Michelle Vail around 6:30 a.m. She told the dispatcher that her ex-boyfriend was at the door and she needed help . As officers walked away, they heard the sound of glass breaking. They returned and could see that Vail had a shotgun and was banging it against a door and a wall. Fernandez said officers heard the boy scream. At that point they knocked down the door, but by the time they reached a back room, the child and mother had already jumped. Oscar was taken to a hospital, where officials say he is in stable condition and being kept for observation. His mother's injuries were superficial, according to Fernandez. The news release said that 'The child was interviewed by detectives at the hospital and stated his mother had told him that a serial killer was coming to get them and he needed to jump out the window, which he did.' The family recently moved from Ormond Beach, Florida, to the area, police said. Police told WTSP that three weapons - a handgun, large knife and a shotgun - were discovered in the apartment. Vail is being charged with one count of aggravated child abuse. It wasn't known whether she's hired a lawyer who could comment on the case. The St. Petersburg Police Department said that the Department of Children and Families was contacted in order to arrange custody for Oscar upon his release. WTSP reported that the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Child Protection Investigation Division is now investigating. Confidential support is available through calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. For more information, visit www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

"Snooker champion Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in his back garden . Snooker champion Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in the back garden of his mansion – just a stone's throw from Gleneagles. The seven-times world champion, 46, is set to build a multi-million pound housing development on land currently used as a horse paddock and stables on his Perthshire country estate. He and neighbour Alexander Birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world-famous course at Gleneagles. But the move upset  residents in the upmarket village who voiced fears that  it will invade their privacy and spoil the natural beauty of the area. The Auchterarder development was originally given the go-ahead in 2012 but construction never started because of the decline in the housing market. Renewed plans were submitted to Perth and Kinross Council last month by Mr Birnie's company Craigmount Developments and they have now been given the green light. Drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on Mr Hendry's land show a large four-bedroom property. The proposed house has a massive snooker room at the rear as well as a studio, a TV room, a drawing room and a built-in garage. Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy, but he still owns the land. The couple moved into the turreted five-bedroom mansion in 1996 after paying £300,000 and they carried out extensive renovations. They rented the house out for rumoured five-figure sum during the golf tournament. Council planners approved the application after finding it complied with the local development plan and that there were no 'material considerations' to justify refusal. The snooker player and his neighbour Alexander Birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world-famous course at Gleneagles, pictured are planned new homes . In an objection letter sent to the council, neighbour Colin Campbell said: 'You have requested comments from property owners bordering this development. What is the point? 'Your department has already rubber-stamped every housing development plan for Auchterarder in recent years. 'Bett Homes, Cala, Robertson Homes, Muir Homes, Milne Homes etc together will build in excess of 1,000 new homes. 'When occupied this will double the population of Auchterarder with little or no consideration given by you to the impact of schooling, town parking, medical facilities or shopping facilities. 'This application is yet another example of a developer squeezing many properties onto a small plot.' Another neighbour said: 'I am concerned about the loss of privacy this would cause and because it spoils the status quo. 'The area is absolutely beautiful in terms of the visibility I have right up to the Grampians and we thought we were very lucky to find this house. 'I'm not surprised our concerns have been ignored. I don't have much faith in the system.' Drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on Mr Hendry's land show a large four-bedroom property with a large snooker room . Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy, but he still owns the land (pictured together with their oldest son Blaine in 1999) Last year, it was reported that the father-of-two, who has estimated £11 million fortune,  left his wife and moved to England with 26-year-old actress Lauren Thundow. Mrs Hendry, 46, has launched divorce proceedings against him at Liverpool County Court. Following their split Mandy said: 'I am heartbroken Stephen has made the decision to leave the marital home and relocate to England for a new relationship.' Mr Hendry, widely regarded as the greatest ever snooker player, retired from competitive sport in 2012 and now works as a BBC pundit and as an ambassador for the sport. He was not available for a comment when contacted. The new luxury homes will be located less than two miles from world-famous golf course Gleneagles, pictured in the PGA Centenary Course .","Stephen Hendry, 46, is set to build 11 luxury homes in his back garden .

"It all began with a joke but resulted in an incredible cash windfall for a 23-year-old, who has used the opportunity to treat his mother who raised him single-handedly. In January Sydney-based Mat Carpenter, then 22, made global headlines with his kooky business idea to help people get revenge by shipping envelopes filled with glitter to their enemies. He was astonished when the website, ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com went viral, attracting so much attention that just ten days after its inception he sold the website for an incredible six-figure sum. 'I was blown away by the success of the website,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was completely unaware of how successful the idea was going to become. 'I started off with no glitter & no envelopes which sort of shows you how much I didn't believe in what I thought was a stupid idea.' Scroll down for video . Mathew Carpenter's mum (right) was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the surprise . His mother had no idea where she was or what was in store as she was led over to the car . He sold the domain for $US 85,000. Although he joked it was the equivalent of '$11 in Australia', incredibly Carpenter pocketed over $AUD 100 000 . Rather than indulging himself with a lavish lifestyle, the first thing Mr Carpenter wanted to do was take the chance to thank his mother. Mr Carpenter bought his mother her first ever new car for her birthday to say thank you for her sacrifices for her children. 'Buying a car for mum was a no brainer,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 'Her old car was (rubbish) that only liked to work when it could be bothered which is basically a lazier version of me. 'When you're growing up with a single parent & see them working three or four jobs at a time just to put a roof over your head it's extremely rewarding to give back.' The brains behind the business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise. The 23-year-old's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she couldn't afford to get it fixed. The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits . The footage shows his mother blindfolded in the front seat of the car throughout the 40-minute trip. With a glass of wine in hand, she gets into the spirit by grooving to the music on the radio. 'Mum, where do you think you are right now?' Mathew asks. 'I have no idea,' she replies. 'Do you know where we're going?' 'Nup,' says Ms Carpenter, making dance moves in her seat. 'She's drunk,' a female voice can be heard to say. The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits. She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her first ever brand new car in front of her . Difficult to grasp what was happening, his mother silently walked over to the car . As she is guided by her daughter to the car she comments that it: 'it feels like we have gone around in a circle' when Mathew confirms that she had. He then says 'mum take your blindfold off' which she does and turns away after being blinded by the sunlight. Mathew goes on to proudly announce the generous gift: 'mum this is your brand new car.' His mother managed to say 'oh my god' in between her jaw dropping to the floor and clapping her hands in delight. Difficult to grasp what was happening, she silently walked to the car. She slowly gets in the pink vehicle and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his kind deed. 'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at her first ever brand new car. It's an incredible start for the young entrepreneur who clearly has a lot of promise - particularly when it comes to quirky concepts. 'My plans going forward is to continue on with my New Years resolution of working on more projects,' he said. 'I'm currently developing a mobile application for both Android & iOS and we'll be accepting BETA users at the end of this month. 'I can't go into too much detail but as you can imagine any project I'm involved with is going to be a bit offbeat.' She slowly got in the car and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his gift . 'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at the brand spanking new car .","Mathew Carpenter bought his mum a brand new car for her birthday .

"The families of two Australian drug smugglers  today made the torturous journey to Indonesia's notorious 'Death Island' to say their final goodbyes before the pair are executed by firing squad. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were convicted of being ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the  island's airport for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia. They have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed this week. Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael were today pictured at Yogyakarta airport as they made their way to the island via boat from Cilacap in central Java. They were accompanied by Sukumaran's mother Raji and sister Brintha, although it is not known whether they will be allowed to see the men as hoped tomorrow when visits are usually banned. Scroll down for videos . The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five-hour drive to Cilacap in central Java and take a boat to Nusakambangan island where Chan is waiting to be executed . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Chan and Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia that prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan today. Earlier, a 'chilling' picture emerged of an Indonesian police chief posing with a smile on his face next to Chan on the flight to the island. In the photograph, Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, grins as he stands with his hand on the shoulder of the convicted drug smuggler. In another picture, Hariutomo is seen with his hand on the shoulder of another condemned Australian, Myuran Sukumaran, on the same flight who gazed up at him as the camera flashed. Amnesty’s UK Director Kate Allen described the images as disturbing. She told MailOnline: 'The pictures of guards smiling while escorting their prisoners to Indonesia’s so-called ""Execution Island"" are chilling.' A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight . The planned executions of Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, have caused diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Australia to fray. The pair are among a group of up to 11 convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed on the prison island of Nusakambangan. Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the holiday island's main airport for trying to smuggle 8kg (18lb) of heroin to Australia. The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia. On Thursday, Indonesia rejected an Australian proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of Sukumaran and Chan. Indonesia's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for Indonesia to act on the proposal that had been made by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . 'Basically Indonesia does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap,' said Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir. 'This idea was put forward to our minister two days ago and we told them then.' Australian politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on Thursday, when Bishop said she had spoken to Indonesia's foreign minister earlier this week. 'I raised the fact that there were Indonesian prisoners in Australian jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap, a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners,' Bishop said. 'I just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan so that we could have officials explore these ideas,' she told Sky News Australia. Australia does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank showed nearly two-thirds of the public disapproved of the executions. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had asked to speak again with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday. This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18 . It is not known how the prisoners will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java . In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo said the men would be executed soon, but not this week. 'I am still convinced that the justice system in Indonesia, if you look at drug crime, is valid and based on facts and evidence,' he said. 'That's why when I rejected their clemency, I looked at their cases, how many drugs they were carrying.' Indonesia is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days, said Tony Spontana, spokesman for the attorney general's office. Widodo has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row, denying clemency appeals. Executions resumed in 2013 after a five-year gap and nationals from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Vietnam have been among those put in front of a firing squad. Meanwhile, an old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp. This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, 'yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands'.' At least once during their exchange, Chan texted him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' The spot where the executions are due to take place is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south. The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner. Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali . This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad . In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner. When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution. A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place. Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.","Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran due to be executed by firing squad .

"The BBC should be overseen by a tough external regulator instead of being allowed to govern its own affairs, the chairman of the BBC Trust has said. Rona Fairhead admitted there is a problem with ‘blurred accountabilities’ between corporation bosses and the BBC Trust she heads, and that it is time for proper outside oversight. Her comments echo MPs’ claims that the trust is ‘too close to the BBC and blurs accountability… rather than it being a sharp and effective overseer’. Rona Fairhead (pictured) admitted there is a problem with ‘blurred accountabilities’ between corporation bosses and the BBC Trust she heads, and that it is time for proper outside oversight . A report by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new Public Service Broadcasting Commission, which would regulate the BBC’s spending and strategy. Mrs Fairhead did not agree with all of the committee’s recommendations, but said the Trust should be replaced with a rigorous external regulator whose sole purpose would be to hold the BBC to account. She also called for the BBC to have a stronger board, with more non-executive directors and an independent chairman to help keep the corporation on track and prevent problems that might need regulatory intervention. ‘Responsibilities for strategy, financial and operational management need to sit with the BBC executive to allow them to respond to a rapidly changing environment,’ she said. ‘Responsibilities for regulation and broader accountability need to sit at one remove. A report by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new Public Service Broadcasting Commission, which would regulate the BBC’s spending and strategy . ‘That way, there should be no possibility of vagueness or uncertainty about who will be held responsible for what when the chips are down.’ She added the ‘cleanest form of separation’ would be to transfer the BBC Trust’s responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external regulator. ‘That’s an approach we want to explore further. I think it’s the front-runner,’ she said. Mrs Fairhead made her speech at a media conference in Oxford, where many were surprised at her apparent willingness to get rid of the body she runs. However, others were wary about her links to HSBC. Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs . Mrs Fairhead, 53, has spent more than a decade as a director of the embattled bank, which is facing allegations that it helped wealthy clients evade tax. Last year, she was paid more than £500,000 for 50 days’ work there. She and the rest of the bank’s directors say they had no knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing. The former Pearson executive, who is also on the board of PepsiCo, will be grilled about her role at HSBC by the Public Accounts Committee on Monday. Mrs Fairhead said yesterday she was ready to be questioned and that her role as chairman of the BBC Trust was her priority. ‘I was very clear when I took this role that the BBC was my priority and that I would keep under review my positions on the HSBC and PepsiCo boards,’ she said. Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs alongside his £110,000-a-year position at the BBC Trust. The former Tory Cabinet minister had five paid posts and five voluntary posts, helping him to earn an extra £200,000 a year. Lord Patten managed to survive that scandal, but resigned from the governing body last year after a string of other controversies. He quit his role at the BBC Trust in May after heart surgery and Mrs Fairhead became chairman in September.","Chairman of BBC Trust said it should be overseen by external regulator .

"A four-year-old girl has been found distraught and dehydrated after she was left inside a hot school bus for several hours in Victoria's west. A statement on behalf of the driver from Bus Association Victoria  says the service collected the girl from her home however upon dropping her to kindergarten the driver 'couldn't locate the child.' He says he then parked at the bus depot and performed a routine check of the vehicle before leaving at approximately 9am. The four-year-old should have been dropped to Warracknabeal Memorial Kindergarten on Tuesday morning . The girl's parents only learnt of her absence upon arriving at the school to collect her at about 1:30pm Tuesday afternoon. Unable to find their daughter they contacted the bus company and the police. The driver was contacted by the bus company and was the first to the scene. He says he found the child in the bus 'in good spirits and well'. 'This is a terribly unfortunately circumstance. The child may have been asleep under the seat - but we're unsure,' says the statement. The bus driver alleges a parent of the child physically assaulted him at the depot causing him to be visibly shaken. The police confirmed they attended an incident at Warracknabeal bus depot where two men were involved in a 'scuffle'. Police were called to the scene however the investigation is ongoing and no charges have been laid. Warracknabeal was 'lucky' to be experiencing mild weather on Tuesday unlike the hot day that claimed the life of a 22-month-old child in February . Yarriambiack Shire Council chief executive Ray Campling told the ABC it's lucky the girl got out unscathed however if it was much hotter she may have been seriously hurt. Noah Krespanis was found unconscious and was unable to be revived . 'The little girl either fell asleep at the back or just slipped down between the seats and unfortunately she was left in the bus for a few hours,' he said. 'It's a sad case, but if anything it's a reasonable outcome for what could have been a drastic outcome.' This comes less than two weeks from when a 22-month-old boy was found dead after being left inside a hot car at Kyneton, just north of Melbourne. Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton in 31 degree heat. The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. It's been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day. Public Transport Victoria are investigating the bus provider Annascott Pty Ltd who is contracted to provide the Willenbrina to Warrackanbeal service. The operator says they consider this a very serious matter and will co-operate fully with the authorities. Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents during February, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015 .","Four-year-old girl has been locked on a bus for several hours in Warrackanbeal, Victoria .

"The Bank of England risks being dragged into a criminal investigation into how it propped up ailing lenders during the financial crisis, it emerged last night. The central bank supplied high street lenders with emergency funds in 2007 and 2008 through so-called money-market auctions to stop the banking system freezing up as the credit crunch intensified. But it last year instructed a leading barrister to look into whether any of its staff knew of, or even participated, in attempts to rig the auctions. The Bank of England (pictured) risks being dragged into a criminal investigation into how it propped up ailing lenders during the financial crisis . The Bank has since passed on the results of the inquiry by Lord Grabiner QC to the Serious Fraud Office which is now examining the findings. The SFO said it was ‘investigating material referred to it by the Bank of England concerning liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008’. It is thought that the probe could lead to a full-blown criminal inquiry – although it is unclear whether such an investigation would focus on Bank officials or traders outside the central bank. An official criminal investigation would be a blow to the reputation of the Bank following a series of scandals that have rocked the financial sector. Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee in the Commons, said the bank was right to refer inquiry to Serious Fraud Office . In a statement last night, the Bank said: ‘Following the confirmation by the SFO that it is investigating material referred to it by the Bank of England, the Bank can now confirm that it commissioned Lord Grabiner QC to conduct an independent inquiry into liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. ‘Following the conclusion of that initial inquiry, the Bank referred the matter to the SFO on 20 November 2014. ‘Given the SFO investigation is ongoing, it is not appropriate for the Bank to provide any additional comment on the matter at this time.’ Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee in the Commons, said the central bank was right to refer the findings to the SFO. He added: ‘We must now await the outcome of the SFO’s work. The sooner their findings are published the better.’ The Bank launched the money-market auctions during the financial crisis in an attempt to ensure that high street banks could continue to lend to households, businesses and each other. The investigation into the auctions comes as the central bank faces increased scrutiny over its governance and oversight of the financial system. A separate inquiry by Lord Grabiner into the rigging of the foreign exchange markets cleared Bank officials of any wrongdoing. The Bank revealed on Tuesday it has uncovered 50 instances of market manipulation and that 42 of them have been handed to the Financial Conduct Authority.","Bank gave high street lenders emergency funds via money-market auctions .

"Screaming into a towel stuffed in my mouth, sweat pouring down my forehead, tears running down my face, I squeezed the breast pump again. Such was my determination to give my newborn daughter the best start in life, I was expressing milk for her, despite the huge abscess across the centre of my right breast. It was torture; far, far worse than giving birth. Rather than give Summer, then just two weeks old, a bottle of formula, I battled on. Months of brainwashing by the ‘breastapo’ and their mantra ‘breast is best’, made me feel the only thing worse than this torment was giving up. Laura Wright (pictured with her daughter, Summer) was so determined to breastfeed Summer as a baby that she went through weeks of agony . It was an attitude that not only threatened my health but also tarnished the first weeks with my precious firstborn and made me angry that women are put under such pressure to breast-feed that common sense flies out of the window. The questions about whether I intended to breast-feed began at my first prenatal appointment when I was 12 weeks pregnant and continued for the next six months. Advice, leaflets and DVDs were doled out in earnest, extolling the virtues and the rewards. Friends, family, colleagues; it seemed everyone wanted to know my intentions and to preach how breast-feeding was natural, easy, the right thing to do. I wanted to breast-feed; it can be a wonderful, bonding experience and mother’s milk protects against illnesses and allergies but the constant pressure to breast-feed takes no account of the fact not every woman can. My problems with Summer began immediately. When she was born at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in July 2013, she weighed 5lb 2oz. When I put her to my breast she was too weak to latch on so the midwives gave her formula. For the next two days, at three-hour intervals, I kept trying. I was surprised how uncomfortable it was but when I winced, the midwife shook her head, insisting: ‘It doesn’t hurt.’ I felt pathetic, like I was failing Summer. Thankfully, on day three, with the help of a breast-feeding consultant, Summer finally latched on. There was no pain and I cried with relief. The next day I and my husband Ralph, a 30-year-old commercial manager, took Summer home. Laura (pictured with Summer) wanted to breastfeed because she knew it could be a bonding experience and that the mother’s milk protects the baby against illnesses and allergies . Over the next few days I continued to breast-feed but Summer was so hungry, I followed advice and relied on formula and expressed milk to top her up. Anxious to know if I was doing things right, I asked a breastfeeding consultant’s advice. ‘Why are you using formula?’ she asked in a disapproving manner, before feeding Summer my three remaining containers of expressed milk. I panicked; it had taken me a day to express that. So I put pressure on myself to quickly produce more. For the next six days I spent three hours a day with the breast pump and expressed at night after Summer had finished feeding. When I found a hard, round mass in the tissue of my right breast I asked the breast-feeding consultant to take a look. ‘It’s fine,’ she said dismissively. ‘A blocked duct. Give it a rub.’ Three days later my breast looked red and sore and was tender to touch. Feeding was extremely painful. Laura had problems with breastfeeding Summer (pictured at 4 days old) right from the very beginning as Summer was initially too weak to latch on . My GP diagnosed mastitis (inflammation of the breast) and gave me antibiotics but instead of being supportive and reassuring, the breast-feeding consultant insisted I use my left breast. The next day, when I woke from an afternoon sleep I was dizzy and delirious. Ralph took me to A&E. Infection was running rife in my body and I had an abscess, 4cm wide and 3cm deep, under the skin of my right breast. Doctors said I could either have it opened in surgery and drained or wait to see a specialist at the clinic when it opened on Monday morning. Not wanting to be in hospital over the weekend without Summer, I chose to wait. The next morning the pain was excruciating. The abscess had grown and the pressure from my building milk supply meant I had no choice but to start expressing again. That was when, in agony, I bit on that towel. While trying to breastfeed, Laura (pictured with Summer at one month) developed a 4 cm wide and 3 cm deep abscess under the skin of her right breast . The next day, while waiting to be seen at the clinic, the abscess burst, leaving a deep, gaping wound across my breast. I was rushed into a treatment room and seen by a consultant. I asked him if I should feed with my left breast. ‘It’s up to you,’ he said. ‘If you want to keep going you can.’ I wish he had just told me to stop. A mother’s instinct is to do everything to help her baby but sometimes you need a professional to step in and say ‘no’. When the breast-feeding consultant visited me a few days later she found me crying out of shock at the size of the wound. She was sympathetic but gave me no advice on feeding and, in my distress, I forgot to ask. She cancelled the next appointment and I never saw her again. She was doubtless rushed off her feet but I felt she abandoned me when I needed her most. By now, so nervous I was doing things wrong, I was spending hours travelling all over Cardiff to various breast-feeding workshops for struggling new mothers. Each time I found waiting rooms packed with worried women and fraught staff. One midwife insisted on examining my abscess in the middle of a crowded waiting room. When the abscess burst, Laura (pictured) was left with a gaping wound on her right breast, despite this she carried on trying to breastfeed with her left breast . Any advice I got was contradictory. One midwife said to give Summer as much formula top-up as she wanted, another to keep it to a minimum. No one could say whether I should breast-feed or not. Within a month my wound had almost miraculously healed and I went back to feeding with my right breast but two weeks later, it again felt inflamed. A second abscess was duly drained but further ultrasounds revealed four more absesses in that breast. Each time I asked whether I should stop breast-feeding I got a noncommittal answer. As a new mother, I was not strong enough to decide to stop on my own, not when I was supposed to be doing the best for my baby. Finally, when Summer was three months old, I was prescribed an 11th course of antibiotics and my consultant said I could not breastfeed while taking that drug. Laura (pictured with Summer at five weeks), says it's astonishing that she was never told to stop breastfeeding despite all the issues she had and the amount of medical professionals she consulted . At last the decision was out my hands; I had medical approval to stop. It was official – I was not failing my baby and almost immediately my breasts recovered and I suffered no further abscesses. I still felt guilty though; I couldn’t tell anyone what I had done and once ran out of a coffee morning because Summer was crying with hunger and I didn’t want the other mothers to see me pull out a bottle of formula. Looking back, it is astonishing that despite speaking to 17 health workers about breastfeeding over three months, while suffering from six abscesses, I was never told to stop. It took a drug that could potentially harm my baby to make someone intervene and help me to make the right decision. Laura (pictured) says it was the pressure to breastfeed from the NHS, society and herself meant that she was too scared to stop because she felt the consensus would be that she had not tried hard enough . When you have been through childbirth and are looking after a baby round the clock, you are already a physical wreck, unable to make sensible decisions. Yet no one acknowledges the physical and mental strain you are under. The pressure to breast-feed, from the NHS, society and even from yourself, means you are too scared to stop. If you do, the consensus is that you did not try hard enough. All I wanted to hear from an expert was that it was OK to stop. Doctors and other medics should silence the ‘breast is best’ mantra and treat new mothers as individuals, taking into account what they have been through. Until then, how many more mothers like me will have those first few precious weeks with their baby blighted?

Several merchant ships helped the coast guard rescue hundreds from six other boats on Tuesday, and from a seventh on Wednesday . Between Tunisian and Italian authorities, about 1,100 migrants were brought to safety, including 30 children and 50 women, one of them pregnant . The Italian coast guard said one of its ships had rescued 121 people after their boat capsized on Tuesday about 50 miles north of Libya. Ten bodies were recovered. Several merchant ships helped the coast guard rescue hundreds from six other boats on Tuesday, and from a seventh on Wednesday. Tunisia's navy rescued all 81 migrants on a boat that had started taking on water near the Tunisian island of Djerba on Tuesday night, the country's defence ministry said. Between Tunisian and Italian authorities, about 1,100 migrants were brought to safety, including 30 children and 50 women, one of them pregnant. Authorities said they were mostly Syrians, Palestinians, Tunisians, Libyans and sub-Saharan Africans. The number of boat arriving in Italy this year is already outpacing a record set in 2014, with 7,882 counted during the first two months of 2015, a 43 percent increase on the same period a year earlier, according to the Interior Ministry. The U.N. refugee organisation UNHCR says at least 218,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean by boat in 2014 and 3,500 lives were lost. The surging numbers prompted Interior Minister Angelino Alfano to renew calls for the European Union to do more to help Italy handle the massive immigration flows. The leader of Italy's opposition anti-immigration Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, accused Rome and Brussels on Twitter of ""having blood on their hands"", saying rescue efforts encouraged migrants to make the dangerous crossing. Italy ended its large-scale search-and-rescue mission Mare Nostrum last year partly because of the cost. It has been replaced by an EU border control mission, Triton, that does not have a specific search-and-rescue mandate and which has fewer ships and a much smaller area of operation hugging tightly to the Italian coast.

"A San Francisco man has claimed he is the son of the late former Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers NBA star Wilt Chamberlain. During a 12-year long search to find his real parents, Aaron Levi, 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player  is his father. After he found his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, the white British woman told him she conceived him after a one-night stand with Chamberlain, he told Sports Illustrated. Documents with background information about Levi's biological parents noted that Elizabeth would not identify the father to protect his name, and that she gave Levi up for adoption because she felt she could not raise a bi-racial child. Scroll down for video . During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child . The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above. He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old . Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children. Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior  player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different. Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up. 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived . He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information  in 2004. The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree. However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree. As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her. He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.' After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain. Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment. When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption. When Chamberlain learned of the news, he  chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim. In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did. Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall. He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him. 'She sees him as a womanizer...to me, he's my father.'","Aaron Levi, 50, said he received confirmation from his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons .

The Californian has since found employment, but with rental prices continuing to creep up, she has decided to stay put for now. In a bid to make the garage cosy she has installed a gas fire and dark wood flooring. A microwave grill perches on top of a clothes cabinet, and a stroller sits next to the television. Jones' bed doubles up as a couch. The other downside to Jones' abode, along with the lack of space, is that there is no easy way to get inside.

"The chubby-faced boy grinning happily at the camera in a slightly-crumpled school uniform is an image that millions of families up and down the UK have sitting on their mantelpiece. But few of those children go from dodging their homework and playing hopscotch in lunch break to ruling the country. Gordon Brown has now shared the school photo that he had taken aged five when he was a pupil at Kirkcaldy West Primary School. Gordon and Sarah Brown shared their old school pictures as part of social media campaign called #UpForSchool by the initiative A World At School, which Sarah co-founded. (Pictured left: Gordon Brown, aged five, pictured right: Sarah Brown, aged 11) The former PM shared the snap as part of a social media campaign organised by his wife Sarah Brown, to push for better education for girls in the developing and third world. Sarah, who runs the charity Theirworld and is the co-founder of the initiative A World At School, also shared her old school photo on Twitter with the hashtag #UpForSchool. The aim of the campaign is to attract signatures for the initiative's upforschool.org petition, which will be delivered to world leaders in September to ensure they keep a promise they made in 2000 to get every girl and boy into school and learning by the end of 2015. The petition has already attracted three million signatures on their site. The actress and comedian Miranda Hart has also shared a picture of herself as a child with the words: 'My old school photo (hot) to support International Women's Day and #UpForSchool.' Miranda Hart as a school child left, and at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in London, in June 2013, right . TOWIE star Lydia Bright's (right) mother Debbie also posted a picture of her daughter at school (left) The petition reads: 'Every child has the right to go to school, without danger or discrimination. 'Help create a message no government, politician or leader can ignore and demand that every child can go to school safely. Nothing changes without pressure. 'We are standing up to bring an end to the barriers preventing girls and boys from going to school, including forced work and early marriage, conflict and attacks on schools, exploitation and discrimination. 'All children deserve the opportunity to learn and achieve their potential.' Education of girls not only further their independence, it also cuts the rate of child deaths, teen pregnancy and helps to provide more stable families. Illiteracy among women contributes to greater numbers of preventable child deaths. A child born to literate mother is 50 per cent more likely to survive past the age of five than a child born to an illiterate mother. Left: Gordon Brown speaks at Dumbarton Town hall to No campaigners last September in Glasgow, right: Sarah Brown at a 'Girl Rising' Screening at BAFTA in April 2013 . Education also has a great impact on sexual and reproductive health outcomes for girls and women. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the birth rate among girls with no education is over 4x higher than those with secondary education. Providing education for girls also helps to fuel economic growth of a country. An educated female population increases a country's productivity, yet some countries lose more than £650 million  a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. For example, if all girls in Kenya completed primary education, their additional output would equal 20 per cent of Kenya’s GDP. If all adolescent girls completed secondary education and delayed pregnancy until their twenties, this would add £2 billion to the Kenyan economy every year.

"Four patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant 'superbug' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year. The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with the bacteria known as CRE. The revelation comes two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria. Scroll down for video . Four patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant 'superbug' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year. The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (above) in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with bacteria known as CRE . Cedars-Sinai said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the UCLA outbreak and launched its own investigation. However, the germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope  during procedures performed between last August and January. The hospital said there is no evidence other patients are at risk, but as a precaution, it sent free home-test kits to 64 patients who had procedures to diagnose pancreatic and bile-duct problems. Cedars-Sinai said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the UCLA outbreak and launched its own investigation. The germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope during procedures performed between last August and January (above illustration of how a duodenum is used during procedures) In recent years, hospitals across the country have grappled with cases of CRE, or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, with some linked to hard-to-clean medical scopes made by Olympus and other companies. The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs and can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients. Last month, two people died and 16 were hospitalized in North Carolina after contracting CRE at an unnamed hospital. The latest cases come two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (above) where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria . The latest infections were reported to state and local health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One patient died, but Cedars-Sinai said the cause was an underlying medical condition  not related to the superbug infection. UCLA and Cedars-Sinai said infections occurred at the hospitals despite cleaning the devices to the manufacturer's standards. Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics. They typically live in the soil or water. Patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic, but can develop pneumonia, kidney and bladder infections, and bloodstream infections. They began appearing in the U.S. roughly twelve years ago, and have since spread to at least 41 states. There is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria, which can linger in the body more than a year, and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent. Both have since implemented more stringent disinfection procedures, and Cedars-Sinai said it removed the contaminated scope from use and will resume endoscopic procedures after consulting with other hospitals and government agencies. In the UCLA outbreak, the hospital offered free testing to about 170 patients who were potentially exposed, and the hospital said Wednesday it does not have an update on the results. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it received reports of 135 patients in the U.S. who may have been infected by contaminated scopes between January 2013 and December 2014. On February 19, it alerted hospitals with a safety warning that even with thorough cleaning, the risk of infection may persist, according to CBS News. The agency has acknowledged that the design of the scopes can make them hard to clean, but it said pulling them off the market would deprive patients of 'this beneficial and often life-saving procedure.' Olympus Corp. of the Americas declined to comment on the Cedars infections. It previously said it is working with the FDA on the infection problem and providing guidance to hospitals.","Patients were at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where they were confirmed with bacteria CRE .

"A U.S. Coast Guard ship was cutting ice on frozen-over Lake St Clair Thursday morning when they came across a bizarre sight: a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures. When crew members brought the curious 25-year-old man on board, he said he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto. Detroit lies on the southwestern shore of Lake St Clair, and the unidentified ice-walker was found just half a mile from Seaway Island on the opposite shore. From there it's a 201-mile journey on land to reach the Canadian capital. Scroll down for video . Rescued: The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man on Thursday morning, who they found walking alone on the middle of frozen-over Lake St Clair . Ice walker: The man told his rescuers that he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto. Detroit is on the southwestern shore of St Clair, and the unidentified man was found just a half-mile from an island on the opposite shore . All alone: Coast Guardsmen say the man stood out since he wasn't wearing the type of clothes used for snowmobiling or ice-fishing on the lake . U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Second Class Scott Sjostrom first spotted the Michigan man walking on the lake around 9:30am on Thursday. The sight was especially odd considering how the man was dressed: in regular pedestrian clothes - not the heavy gear used for snowmobiling or ice fishing. He also wasn't carrying a flotation device, and Sjostrom says he could have easily broken through the ice and drowned. 'That raised flags right off the bat,' Sjostrom told MLive. Sjostrom and another Coast Guardsman then put on gear to walk on the ice towards the man who, though able to stand and walk, was clearly suffering from hypothermia. 'When we got to him, you could tell the cold was getting to him,' said Sjostrom. 'He was very lethargic ... He was shivering very bad.' He also wouldn't speak at first and had a '1,000-yard stare'. When they got him back to the ship and started treating him for the cold, the man started talking and revealed his travel plans. It's believed he had been walking for two to three days when the Coast Guard found him. The Coast Guard then brought the man back to port just after noon where he received further treatment. It was the first rescue by a Great Lakes ice cutter boat in four years. The boats break up ice on the lakes to clear travel for commercial shipping. 'Most of us joined the Coast Guard to protect life,' Lt. Joshua Zike, commanding officer of the Neah Bay, said in a prepared statement. 'Our primary mission during the winter months is breaking ice to keep commercial traffic moving, but preserving life will always come first.'","The unidentified 25-year-old man was spotted walking about a half mile from Canada's Seaway Island on Lake St Clair Thursday morning .

"Fierce fighting between Islamic State militants and soldiers from the Iraqi Army has forced 28,000 residents of the Iraqi city of Tikrit to flee their homes in recent days. Citizens of the strategically important city, which lies midway between regime-capital Baghdad and the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, are making desperate efforts to escape the fighting, the UN says. More than 30,000 Iraqi Army soldiers are currently fighting ISIS militants in the suburbs of Tikrit, or are otherwise making their way towards the city alongside tens of thousands of Iran-backed Shia volunteer militias, many of whom are accused of carrying out ISIS-style atrocities themselves. Although the troops are aiming to liberate the  city from ISIS control, many of the predominantly Sunni population have spent the past few days cutting up white clothes and fabric to make flags of surrender, fearing the Shia armies even more than their terrorist occupiers.

Most residents of Tikrit fled in the months after the extremist group took over in June. Those who stayed have fled in recent days, but a tiny fraction are still there, awaiting their fate. 'Some people say they would rather die in their own homes,' said 37-year-old Abu Saif, who sought refuge in Kirkuk after leaving Tikrit yesterday as the Iraqi army and Shia militants advanced. The forces have made gradual but steady progress, slowed by bombs and snipers as they approach from the north, south and east. They have yet to enter the city itself, but could soon launch attacks on the adjacent towns of al-Dour and al-Alam. 'The situation is frightening,' Abu Saif said. 'We are more afraid of the Hashid Shaabi, because they are seeking retribution.' Thousands of ISIS militants have poured into the city from other parts of the group's self-proclaimed caliphate and are preparing to fight to the death, said Abu Saif, predicting the battle would be long and bloody.

Fleeing residents admitted many of them had initially welcomed the militants as saviours from the oppression they felt under the Shi'ite-led government that came to power after Tikrit-born strongman Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. They came to resent their presence after the extremist group began executing people it considered a threat, failed to provide public services, banned smoking and forced women to cover themselves. But they feared they would receive the same treatment as Sunnis in neighbouring Diyala province, where Shia militia have been accused of massacring civilians and torching their homes as they drove the militants out - charges they deny. 'We are between the hammer and the anvil,' said 32-year old Omar al-Tikriti, who managed to escape al-Alam several days ago with seven members of his family. 'Either we'll be burned by the fire of the (ISIS) militants, or the fire of the militias,' he added.

Some militia fighters have vowed to avenge the deaths of 1,700 Shi'ite soldiers who were killed by Islamic State militants when they overran Tikrit in June with the support of several local tribes. A spokesman for the Salahuddin tribal council said there was nothing to fear from the security forces or militia, and that Islamic State was spreading terror to rally Sunnis behind them. Marwan Jebbara pointed out that some 4,000 Sunnis were taking part in the campaign to retake Tikrit. Shia fighters advancing from the east have said they are accompanied by local Sunni people who are in contact with Tikrit residents to reassure them their safety will be guaranteed if they raise white flags when the fighters enter the city. A Shia cleric travelling with the advancing force reminded fighters they should respect civilians. But residents expressed deep unease about the involvement of Iran, which backs some of the militias involved in the assault. Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani has been spotted on the eastern front, where he appears to be directing operations. Human Rights Watch yesterday said civilians in Tikrit were at 'serious risk' from both ISIS and government forces. 'All commanders in Tikrit need to make sure that their forces protect civilians and allow them to flee the combat zone,' said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director.","Thousands of Sunni residents of Tikrit have fled the ISIS-held city in fear of Iraqi regime forces and Shia militias .

"He's not known for his friendships with the Royal Family but actor Martin Sheen looked remarkably at ease as he posed with Princess Beatrice at a London event last night. Joining Mr Sheen and the Princess was Holly Branson, who was enjoying her first solo night out since becoming the mother of twins Etta and Artie in December. The unlikely trio were at the Bulgari Hotel in central London for a gala dinner held in support of We Day, which is part of a charity movement that aims to give young people more understanding of global events. Scroll down for video . Unlikely combination: Martin Sheen (centre) with Princess Beatrice (right) and Holly Branson (left) Ms Branson will co-chair a day of festivities on Friday and last night gave a speech to an audience that included her father Sir Richard Branson and her brother Sam. Sam is himself a new father with wife Isabella Antruther-Gough-Calthorpe giving birth to the couple's first child, a daughter Eva-Deia, late last month. Like the Branson clan, Princess Beatrice, who recently embarked on a finance course in the US, is a supporter of We Day, as is her cousin Prince Harry. Ahead of the event, she took to Twitter to declare her support, writing: 'Proud to be supporting @weday this Friday @HollyBranson is making the opening speech, good luck you’ll do great.'

Although the trio have not been photographed together before, Mr Sheen is, it seems, their newest recruit, with the 74-year-old actor set to speak at Friday's event at Wembley alongside all three Bransons. Last year's event, which also featured actor Clive Owen, saw Prince Harry take to the stage at Wembley Arena, where he called on young people to get involved with charity work. 'Some people don’t think it’s cool to help others…personally, I think it’s the coolest thing in the world,' he enthused.

"A disgusted father was horrified to find maggots wriggling around in a steak and kidney pie when he opened it to cook for his children. Stuart Pay, 39, had opened the oven to cook the Fray Bentos pie when he noticed chunks of its pastry were missing. After taking a closer look, the electrician from Evesham, Worcester, saw three tiny maggots swimming around in the £2.49 pie. Stuart Pay was horrified to discover three maggots swimming in the Fray and Bentos steak and kidney pie he was about to cook for his children . The electrician was about to give the pie to children Cody, four, Kurtis, 12, and Jade, 14 when he noticed the maggots wriggling around . The father of three said he was 'disgusted' by the discovery but was glad to have made it before feeding children Cody, four, Kurtis, 12, and Jade, 14. 'We were about to put it in the oven but then we noticed there was a bit of pastry missing and then we saw the maggots,' he said. 'We were going absolutely mad. We were disgusted. 'I will never buy them again. I will never buy a pie out of a tin again. 'It is disgusting. It could have made my kids ill because at the start I just thought some of the pastry casing was missing but then I looked further. 'So the maggots must have eaten it away. It is very gross. I only bought the pie days before. It is really horrible.' The 39-year-old said he fears the maggots may have landed up in the pie after flies laid eggs in its case in the factory. Baxters, who produces the product, has not commented . Mr Pay said he would never buy another pie from the company again after the 'disgusting' discovery . Mr Pay added he thought the maggots may have wormed their way into the pie when it was being made in a factory. 'We think there may have been flies in the factory and they may have laid their eggs in the containers there,' he added. The family bought the pie from their local branch of Iceland just days beforehand. Mrs Pay said the store was however not at fault and that the responsibility lies with Baxters. 'I don't think the store are at fault at all. They cannot see what is inside the pies.' A spokesman for Fray Bentos said: 'We have been informed of the claims made by Mr & Mrs Pay regarding one of our Fray Bentos products and are treating their complaint as a priority.' 'Our immediate request on being contacted was to ask for the product to be returned so we could instigate an internal investigation into the can and its contents. 'As of yet we have not received the product therefore it is impossible for us to speculate further on these claims.'","Stuart Pay was about to heat up the steak and kidney pie for his children .

"Sharing a platform: Nick Clegg and Sir Richard Branson yesterday . Nick Clegg ignited a huge controversy last night by claiming that all drug users should be treated as ‘victims’. The Liberal Democrat leader said they should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances – even if they they are caught with ‘harder’ drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine. Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson made the astonishing claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause ‘any harm’ – despite evidence that a quarter of new cases of psychosis are linked to it. Announcing his party’s new drugs policy yesterday, Mr Clegg said: ‘We shouldn’t be treating the criminal “Mr Bigs” the same as the users. The latter are the victims of the former.’ But his comments were dismissed by the head of the Chatham House think tank Robin Niblett, who said: ‘Are all users victims or is there a large proportion of people who enjoy drugs and take them recreationally? It is a question of demand, rather than people who need to be treated for an addiction.’ Other experts have also questioned whether it is right to label all drug users as victims. Stuart Waiton, senior lecturer in sociology at Abertay University, said: ‘The problem we have today is that society finds it difficult to hold people to account for their actions. ‘The idea of moral responsibility is very weak because we assume that everyone’s a victim. People don’t need medical support – unless their bodies are falling to bits – they need to take responsibility for their own actions.’ The Lib Dems’ new policy would end prosecutions for people caught with small amounts of drugs for ‘personal use’. It would cover all drugs. Mr Clegg said the policy would be included in the Lib Dem manifesto. It is widely seen as a pitch to win back young voters disillusioned by the party’s betrayal over university tuition fees. The Liberal Democrat leader said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances – even if they they are caught with ‘harder’ drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine . Mr Clegg (bottom left) is facing opposition to his plan from David Cameron (pictured at Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon), who claims decriminalising drugs would increase their use . With neither Labour nor the Tories backing decriminalisation, it is unlikely to become government policy even if the Lib Dems remain in power after the election. Yesterday's announcement follows a controversial ‘research’ project ordered by Lib Dem Home Office ministers, which used taxpayers’ money to study drugs policy around the world. Jeremy Browne and Norman Baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs. They travelled to ten countries, including the US, Portugal and Sweden, at a cost of almost £40,000. The Lib Dems seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like Portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs. But critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen. Mr Clegg received a public endorsement yesterday from Sir Richard, who suggested that smoking skunk is safe. The Virgin tycoon shared a platform with the Lib Dem leader to promote the party’s pledge. He said: ‘Of people taking hash [cannabis], something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... Take people taking skunk. ‘It’s slightly worse than alcohol. But there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it’s not doing them any harm.’ A study last month by Kings College London found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk. The report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode. Last night, Mr Clegg also insisted that the so-called ‘war on drugs’ was ‘not working’, although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in Britain for years. Downing Street rejected Mr Clegg’s analysis and said it was not supported by David Cameron. Sir Richard Branson (pictured at an event in Knightsbridge with Martin Sheen, left, and Princess Beatrice and Holly Branson, right) made the claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause ‘any harm’ Andy Cook, chief executive of charity Twenty Twenty, which works with disadvantaged young people, said: ‘Cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with, so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy. ‘Making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it. The result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential.’ ■CANNABIS could be available on the NHS under Liberal Democrat plans. Under the proposals, doctors would be able to prescribe the drug for medicinal reasons.","Nick Clegg said users should not be given criminal records for possession .

"The allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false. Yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher Brendan O’Brien. Brendan, 45, had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues. Yet in just a year his reputation was shattered, he lost his job and became clinically depressed, prey to anxiety and panic. Brendan O'Brien (pictured with his wife, Jane) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse . A £25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents. His reputation unjustly besmirched, he and his wife Jane — who has two grown-up daughters by a previous relationship — had to give up their dream of adopting a child. And this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his West Yorkshire primary school who accused him of sexual abuse. It’s the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher. And in today’s climate, where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing, the police, quite rightly, had to act. Yet the most cursory of checks would have revealed that his accusers were troublemakers: disruptive, aggressive, defiant and precociously sexualised. But once the boys — present and past pupils aged ten to 12 — had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity, the machinery of the law was set in motion. And despite the complete absence of evidence, it would destroy the name of a good man in the process. In January, a year after Brendan was first arrested, a jury at Leeds Crown Court acquitted him, swiftly and unanimously, on all charges. He had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity. Brendan and Jane's (pictured) lives were destroyed when the allegations against Brian were made . So how could Brendan be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble-makers are carrying on with their lives, without so much as a telling off? These are questions Brendan and Jane, 43, a reflexologist and sales assistant, are asking themselves. Brendan says: ‘When I was charged, I was no longer Mr O’Brien, a respected village primary school teacher. Instead, I was a pariah. I was too scared to leave the house. I became introverted, and I lost 2 st. Yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised. ‘My accusers should be punished for making false and damaging claims against me. But they are all carrying on as though nothing has happened while I have to piece together my shattered life.’ Shattered is the correct word: Brendan’s teaching contract was terminated in July. ‘I don’t know if I can ever face standing in a classroom of pupils, wondering if one of them is about to make a complaint,’ he says. Brendan’s nightmare began in January last year. He had driven to school and by 6.45am was sitting at his desk, planning his lessons. One matter was preying on his mind: how to deal with a particularly disruptive pupil. Brendan had already spoken about him to the school’s headteacher. The day before, he had called the ten-year-old’s mother, inviting her to school to discuss her son’s behaviour. It was getting virtually impossible to teach with him interrupting, shouting wisecracks and refusing to do any work. Then an hour later, he was summoned to his head’s office. Facing him were two police officers. ‘I was told I was being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor,’ he recalls. ‘And the child making the accusations was the same pupil causing problems. Brendan (pictured) had, for 16 years, been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues . ‘I was completely, utterly dumbfounded. But my first thought was: “This will all be dismissed when the police investigate it and realise there is absolutely no foundation in it at all.” ’ But in the space of 12 months his life would be thrown into tumult as 18 charges were made against him concerning the children, the first boy and four others the ten-year-old knew. On that January day, Brendan spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised. He had, on his own admission, a tactile approach. He explains: ‘I would often praise children by giving them a pat on the back or a tap on the knee. I’d never questioned that it was inappropriate. But this boy claimed I had touched him in a sexual manner.’ Child sexual abuse costs the UK an estimated £3.2 billion a year because of social care, health problems and legal bills . Jane, his wife of ten years, was by now dealing with her own shock. Two-and-a-half hours after her husband was arrested, two officers arrived at their four-bedroom terrace house in Barnsley. Jane recalls: ‘My initial thought was that Brendan had been in an accident. I asked if he was dead. ‘But when they said he had been arrested for sexual assault, I was floored. The officers had come to search our home for possible evidence and to seize electronic equipment. ‘My legs would hardly hold me up as the police rooted through our bedroom. It was horribly intrusive. Although I knew Brendan had done nothing wrong, I felt as though we were criminals. ‘They looked through my work files and took away our iPad, mobiles, a Kindle and memory sticks. They spent months examining them, but didn’t find a single suspicious thing.’ When Brendan arrived home at 6.30pm, he was exhausted and bewildered. Jane says: ‘He could barely speak. But I never once doubted his innocence. The claim was ludicrous.’ Both he and Jane were confident a short investigation would swiftly exonerate him. They told only close friends and family of the accusations. Jane (pictured) says: ‘I never once doubted his innocence. The claim was ludicrous.' But the nightmare escalated. Last March, Brendan was arrested again. A further four ex-pupils who knew one another in some way claimed he had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity. ‘I had no idea why they would make up such malicious and despicable lies,’ he recalls. In April, he was formally charged with the sexual assaults against five boys: a ten-year-old current pupil; three 11-year-olds and a 12-year-old. But their stories were inconsistent. Some attested the assaults took place while he was teaching, others said it was while he was alone in his classroom talking one-to-one with them. And evidence read out in court supported the fact that each of the accusers was a known troublemaker. The youngest had boasted he would ‘get Mr O’Brien fired’. One of the 11-year-olds had grabbed another boy’s genitals, exposed himself and pinned down a female pupil until she cried. Even his own mother admitted in a meeting at his school, after Brendan’s arrest, she’d seen nothing in her son’s behaviour to indicate he had been abused. Jane recalls the fallout of the allegations. ‘Brendan had always been so full of life and very jovial, but overnight his character changed.’ Her husband — a caring step-father to her two daughters — barely spoke and became consumed by fear. He suffered from anxiety and tremors, and his GP prescribed antidepressants. ‘I felt utterly useless,’ says Jane. ‘But I had to be the strong one.’ Brendan endured further distress when a local radio station misinterpreted the charges against him and broadcast that he’d had sex with young boys. And the case brought one devastating side-effect. Brendan and Jane — whose daughters are 19 and 22 — had long dreamt of having a child of their own. Jane had, however, suffered from fertility problems, and they had enquired about adoption. ‘But with abuse charges hanging over Brendan, we would never be considered,’ says Jane. The legal proceedings consumed their savings, and Brendan’s parents — in no doubt of their son’s innocence — chipped in. Brendan (pictured) says he became consumed by fear and was prescribed antidepressants for his anxiety and tremors . As the case approached, a swell of support buoyed them up. Brendan recalls: ‘Parents of ex-pupils would stop me in the street and give me a hug, all of them telling me they didn’t believe a word of the claims. ‘But I still felt terrified. My solicitor had warned me if I was found guilty I faced up to seven years in prison and my name would be tarnished for ever. Mercifully, the jury took just an hour to dismiss each of the charges against Brendan. Jane was with her daughters in court and when the verdict came, she was euphoric. ‘I squeezed my daughters’ hands,’ she recalls. ‘I just wanted to run to Brendan and hug him.’ Justice had prevailed, but at what cost? ‘I don’t know whether I will ever completely recover,’ says Brendan. ‘Everyone who knew us supported me, but there will always be strangers who believe there’s no smoke without fire.’ Jane adds: ‘I can never forgive Brendan’s accusers. I truly believe the youngest of them was acting in revenge, and then the other boys joined a nasty, ill-conceived vendetta to try to destroy him. ‘And if this is what teachers face — and we are told that false sexual accusations against them are not uncommon — the whole profession must feel under threat. ‘And one thing is certain: I don’t want Brendan to return to a classroom ever again.’","Vindictive and damaging allegations destroyed  Brendan O’Brien .

"It has been revealed Indonesia is considering putting a moratorium on the death penalty as the country is just days away from killing convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. This news emerged during a panel discussion at the United Nations' Human Rights Council in Geneva, with more than 24 countries - including Indonesia and Australia - in attendance. At the meeting, which aims for the 'abolition of the death penalty', UN assistant secretary-general Ivan Simonovic called the practice an 'inhuman and outdated punishment'. Just days before the impending executions of Myuran Sukuraman (left) and Andrew Chan (right), Indonesia has revealed it could be reinstating its moratorium on the death penalty . He told the gathered countries there was no evidence death row stopped criminal activity, the UN News Centre reported. Mr Simonovic added it was 'too often applied to the poor and marginalised foot soldiers' rather than on those who were leading drug organisations. During the meeting, human rights organisation Franciscans International urged nations - singling out Indonesia - that still dole out the death penalty to adopt a moratorium and grant mercy to inmates on death row. In response, Indonesia diplomats said the death penalty was a constant topic discussed by their country, according to a summary of the debate. UN assistant secretary-general Ivan Simonovic called the death penalty an 'inhuman and outdated punishment' They also called on the countries that still had the death penalty to observe the full process of law. The officials went on further to say Indonesia already had a moratorium in place and could reinstate it for crimes they thought were most serious. In 2013, Indonesia executed its first prisoners after a four-year stay on executions, Fairfax Media reported. This comes as Australia plans to lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema, at their outrage and ethical displeasure with images of a Balinese police chief posing and smiling with Chan and Sukuraman during their transfer to Nusakambangan for their execution. This comes as Australia plans to lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema (above) The complaint is over images of a Balinese police chief posing and smiling with the Bali Nine duo, which caused outrage . One of the pictures depicts Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, placing his hand on Andrew Chan's shoulder and smiling for the camera. Another shows his hand on the shoulder of Myuran Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer. Although summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador Kesoema is understood to be in Perth and cannot appear at the in person. A senior official, likely to be department secretary Peter Varghese will inform the ambassador of Australia's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency. The police chief has denied it was a 'selfie moment', saying he was telling the Bali Nine duo to stay strong, according to Fairfax Media. Chan and Sukuraman are spending their second night on Nusakambangan, awaiting their execution at Besi prison .

"Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed suddenly at White Hart Lane in scenes reminiscent of Fabrice Muamba’s near-fatal cardiac arrest in March 2012. With no one near him, the Swansea star appeared to lose consciousness in the centre circle, slumping to the floor, moments after Nacer Chadli had given Tottenham a 1-0 lead. Both sets of medical staff came rushing onto the pitch to care for the stricken Frenchman as the two groups of players looked on in despair. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff . Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Gomis was treated for five minutes before being stretchered off holding an oxygen mask to his mouth, although he appeared to be conscious as he left the field. The striker, who suffers from vasovagal — a medical condition that can lead to fainting — was taken straight to the White Hart Lane medical room where he was given more treatment. However, good news emerged from Swansea at half-time that Gomis was fine and had not been hospitalised. ‘He is fine,’ said a Swansea spokesperson. ‘He is in the medical room.It is something we have been aware of — it is something called a vasovagal condition. We have always been aware of it and it has happened before. He has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us.’ The condition occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as physical or emotional distress. This can then cause a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces the blood flow to the brain. A brief loss of consciousness can follow. The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I Wanted to reassure you concerning my Health , it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now . 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France . 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order . 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get Well messages .' Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game . In the early moments of the second half, Swansea also confirmed on their official Twitter account that Gomis had improved. The striker has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times in the space of three months after joining Lyon in 2009. One of those episodes occurred while training with the France national squad in October 2009. After reportedly losing consciousness for six minutes, he re-joined the session 15 minutes later. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said at the time: ‘We can’t not be worried, it scares you each time. A vasovagal episode (fainting) is part of the things that can happen to people who have this type of constitution. It’s now three times that it’s happened. Yes, I’m worried.’ A stunned silence came over White Hart Lane as the incident unfolded last night, no doubt re-kindling memories of Muamba’s cardiac arrest which occurred nearly three years ago to the day and almost on the same spot on the White Hart Lane pitc . On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 . Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football. Former players immediately took to Twitter to express their shock and wish Gomis a speedy recovery. Gary Lineker said: ‘Very worrying images at White Hart Lane where Bafetimbi Gomis has been stretchered off after collapsing to the ground with no one near him. Gomis has a condition with a history of fainting. ‘Hopefully it’s nothing more serious than that.’ John Hartson, who was born in Swansea, added: ‘Hope Bafetimbi Gomis is ok and recovering after collapsing in the game tonight at white hart lane. Thinking of him. #Swans.’ Nacer Chadli wheels away to celebrate after giving Tottenham the lead against Swansea .

"Kelly Emery, 34, was convicted of the manslaughter of son Fenton Hogan, two, at Nottingham Crown Court after they found she had deliberately fed him methadone to make him sleep . A drug addicted mother who fed her toddler son a heroin substitute to 'knock him out' so she could smoke crack has been jailed for six years. Kelly Emery, 34, was convicted of the manslaughter of son Fenton Hogan, two, at Nottingham Crown Court after a jury heard she had deliberately given her son methadone to make him sleep. The mother refused to give evidence at her trial  insisting that she had never given her child the drug, despite being negligent in leaving bottles of it 'lying around' her house. The Crown alleged that Emery gave the heroin substitute to Fenton to 'knock him out' so she could smoke crack cocaine. Fenton, who had no obvious injuries, was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital from the family's former home. Emery, formerly of Frankley, Birmingham, was given a concurrent 12-month prison sentence after admitting gross neglect of Fenton by allowing him access to methadone. But the seven woman, five man jury cleared her of giving the toddler methadone on two other occasions before his death in July 2013. In a statement issued after the case, Detective Inspector Bob Sutton, who led a West Midlands Police investigation into the death, said: 'Any child death is a tragedy. 'Fenton Hogan should have had the rest of his live to look forward to. 'Instead his short life was taken by the actions of his mother, who should have been there to safeguard and protect him.' The officer said of Emery: 'Her daily routine revolved around the consumption of drugs. This was to the detriment of those she had direct care for. 'Fenton's extended family agrees that no sentence is sufficient or will help to heal what happened to Fenton. The impact of Kelly's actions will remain with all of the family forever.' Blood samples taken from the child showed he had as much of the drug on his system as an adult on methadone maintenance therapy. And hair samples showed that, in the months before his death, he had ingested the drug on at least two other occasions. Blood samples taken from the child showed he had as much of the drug on his system as an adult on methadone maintenance therapy . Hair samples showed that, in the months before his death, he had ingested the drug on at least two other occasions. Emery was cleared of giving him the drug on other occasions . The court heard she gave Fenton methadone knowing it 'would knock him out and enable her to do what she wanted without the interference from a fractious child that was difficult to put to sleep' When he opened the case, prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC told the jury: 'That Sunday evening, she had crack and she wanted to smoke it. 'We say she gave Fenton methadone knowing, to put colloquially, it would knock him out and enable her to do what she wanted without the interference from a fractious child that was difficult to put to sleep.' Emery, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by gross negligence and a charge of child neglect, wept in the dock as she was jailed for six years. Mr Justice Robin Knowles told her she had not faced a murder charge because she had no intention of killing her son. The judge told her; 'Fenton died because you actively administered about 10mg of methadone to him. Emery, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by gross negligence and a charge of child neglect, wept in the dock as she was jailed for six years for the manslaughter of her son . 'That is about half the amount you, as an adult, were taking for you addiction, at that point, to heroin. 'You did this to get him to sleep so that you could focus on what you saw as your need to take drugs.' Emery was sentence to six years for manslaughter and 12 month concurrent for a charge of child neglect which she pleaded guilty to. The jury, by their verdicts, the judge said, found Fenton had consumed methadone in the past from bottle left lying around by Emery. However it was only on one occasion, on June 30 2013, she actively gave him the drug. Emery was sentence to six years for manslaughter and 12 month concurrent for a charge of child neglect which she pleaded guilty to . The judge went on; 'I accept the death of Fenton is crushing in itself. 'I accept there is genuine remorse. This case is a tragic one. 'The offending was so unnecessary yet so culpable, the consequences so grave. 'The offence is so serious that a prison sentence is necessary.' Before she was taken down, the judge said finally to Emery; 'Your options include dedicating yourself now to your own recovery in honour of the memory of Fenton and in respect of the life your daughter has to live. 'It is not too late to give in memory of Fenton and towards the life of your daughter the gift of a mother who does not take drugs. 'Few things are irreparable over time.'","Kelly Emery, 34, convicted of the manslaughter of Fenton Hogan, two .

"Forensic tests on the body of Argentine state prosecutor Alberto Nisman who accused the President of a cover-up with Iran indicate that he was murdered, his ex-wife said today. He was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in January, hours before he was due to testify against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in the Argentinian Congress. He was trying to arrest the President after claiming she helped cover up Iran's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. The mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Nisman's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories. His ex-wife, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, hired a private team to analyse the autopsy results and run additional tests. On the offensive: Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (left) has denied claims helped Iran cover up a terrorist attack. The claims were made by Alberto Nisman (right) - who was mysteriously shot dead . Argentine authorities have not released full results of his autopsy, more than six weeks after he was found sprawled in a pool of blood in his flat. The few details made public so far have suggested suicide, although the lead investigator into Mr Nisman's death said she could not categorically say if he shot himself in the head or was killed. But today, his ex-wife - the mother of their two children - said: 'Nisman didn't have an accident. He didn't commit suicide. They murdered him.' Earlier today, Ms Arroyo Salgado, who is a judge, deposited the forensic evidence backing up her allegations at the state prosecutors' office in Buenos Aires. She did not give details of the findings to journalists. Yesterday, a full-page advert, signed by the Government of Argentina and bearing an Argentinian flag, questioned Mr Nisman's motives and attacked his argument. 'One must ask oneself what objectives Nisman was pursuing with a complaint plagued with contradictions, lacking logic and without legal basis,' it declared. Mrs Kirchner: The president's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of Alberto Nisman . 'Can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect?' Mr Nisman had accused the President and top administration officials of helping Iranian officials hide their and Iran's alleged role in the country's worst-ever terrorist attack. His 289-page investigation, which was published a few days after his death, was based on wiretaps of top administration officials that he argued proved the secret deal with Iran. According to Mr Nisman, the President allegedly orchestrated the deal in exchange for economic trade. Ms Kirchner rejected the allegations, and Iran denied any role in the bombing. The prosecutor was found shot in the head in his apartment in the capital's upmarket Puerto Madero district on January 18, triggering protests in the streets. His mysterious death triggered a PR fightback by the government, whose officials said the prosecutor was trying to smear the nation. Senior government official Gustavo Lopez claimed last month the allegations were part of an attempt to unseat the President and bring neoliberals back to power. 'We are facing an attempted coup d'etat, that aims to get rid of the president,' he wrote. But the alleged smears have upset other politicians. Cornelia Schmidt-Liermann told the Associated Press: 'It's awful to see so many accusations against a person who can't defend himself. 'Instead of clarifying anything, Fernandez is damaging the investigation into Nisman's death.' Anger: Protesters clashed with police after the death of the prosecutor in his locked apartment in January . Horror: The 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, left 85 dead and remains the country's most deadly terrorist attack. Iran has denied it was involved . Yesterday's newspaper advert highlighted a judge's ruling which said Mr Nisman's argument had a lack of 'coherence and integration'. Judge Daniel Rafecas, who made the ruling, said: 'There is not a single element of evidence, even circumstantial, that points to the head of state.' That ruling was appealed yesterday by prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, who has taken up the case following Mr Nisman's death. He said the judges' decision was 'premature' and an investigation was needed to 'prove or disprove the facts'. The appeal sends the case to the Federal Chamber of judges, which can uphold or reject last week's decision by federal Judge Rafecas. Argentinians will go to the polls in October, but the President is barred from running for a third term by the country's constitution and will have to step down. She has nevertheless gone on the offensive, accusing opposition parties of using the row for political gain and claiming the U.S. and Israel were meddling in Argentina's affairs.","Alberto Nisman's body found in January a day before Congress hearing .

"Desperate: Marilyn Barnes, pictured outside court today wanted to sell her home in Arnside, Cumbria . Prospective buyers were lured in with an enticing description of the Lake District views from the property when it appeared on the market. What they were not told was that the vistas should never have existed in the first place. For the property’s owner illegally felled dozens of protected trees in an attempt to increase its value by creating the views. Marilyn Barnes, 61, was fined £15,000 after a court was told she arranged for the trees facing her home to be chopped down in a desperate attempt to command a higher selling price. The divorcee had included information about a tree preservation order affecting a small area of land included in the sale when the house first appeared on the market. But after failing to attract a buyer, the four-bedroom semi-detached house overlooking the Arnside Estuary in Cumbria was remarketed a year later. This time, the details mentioned ‘fine distant views’ and the asking price rose from £399,000 to £425,000. South Cumbria Magistrates’ Court heard Barnes was no longer able to afford the home after being forced to give up work in 2010 when she fell off ladders while painting a ceiling. Facing mounting debts, she approached local pig farmer and joiner Stephen Lawton to cut down the trees, telling him she wanted to ‘open up views’. Lawton felled 27 trees, including ash, hazel, elm, sycamore, holly, beech and willow. He was not paid but used the trees as firewood. John Batty, for Barnes, said she was ‘extremely embarrassed’ and that it was a big mistake that ‘should never have happened’. South Lakes District Council, which managed the protection order for the trees, said the property was originally put on sale in October 2013 before being remarketed in November 2014. Nicola Hartley, for the council, said: ‘It is the prosecution case that the unlawful felling has opened up the view and this has the potential to increase the saleability of the property. ‘The court must have regard to any financial benefit that has been accrued or likely to accrue as a consequence of the offence.’ Room with no view: Marilyn Barnes had the trees cleared that were obscuring a potentially great sight . Beautiful view: Removing the trees revealed the breathtaking landscape of the Lake District beyond (above) For sale: Barnes said she could no longer afford to live in her four-bedroom house, pictured above . Barnes, who pleaded guilty to breaching the protection order, was fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £1,260 in court costs and a £120 victim surcharge. She is understood to have moved out of the property, although a selling price has yet to be listed with the Land Registry. Lawton, 25, was fined £3,000 and told to pay the same costs as Barnes. After the case, Miss Hartley said the unlawful felling of such a large number of trees had a significant detrimental impact on the environment, particularly in the loss of habitat for birds and other wildlife. Before: This Google street view from 2011 shows a section of the woodland adjacent to Barnes' former home (not pictured). She asked a 25-year-old man to cut down 27 of the trees, a court was told .

"Two California teachers appeared sheepish in court as both pleaded not guilty to having drunken cocaine-fueled sex with their high school students on a beach. Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, originally escaped sex charges as prosecutors could not find evidence linking them to one of the five boys implicated in the trip. But on Wednesday, both answered to charges of unlawful sexual intercourse at a Newport Beach court. Lippert and Ghirelli, both teachers at South Hills High School in Covina, spoke only to deny the charges. Scroll down for video . First appearance: Michelle Ghirelli, who was studying for a Master's degree, in court to deny charges of sexual assault and giving cocaine to a minor that could see her jailed and placed on the sex offender's register . Case: Melody Lippert, 38, allegedly organized a beach trip and invited Ghirelli and five of their students. She allegedly had sex with an 18-year-old boy then coerced Ghirelli into engaging in sexual acts with a 17-year-old . Case: Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations but were not charged initially as prosecutors could not link them to one of the boys . Prosecutor Kristin Braic said: 'The bottom line for teachers out there is: keep your hands off your students.' Outside court Ghirelli's attorney, Stephen DeSales, told KTLA: 'There were drugs and then marijuana and alcohol heavily involved in everybody's adventure on this beach. It was a lot of confusion about who was who.' The teachers were arrested on January 17 after Lippert allegedly organized a camping trip to a beach, inviting Ghirelli and five male students. The pair allegedly provided at least one minor with cocaine. Lippert is accused of having sex with an 18-year-old student an pressuring Ghirelli, who was studying for a Master's degree after being promoted, to engage in sexual acts with a 17-year-old student. Lippert was charged with conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The South Hills High School teachers allegedly organized an out-of-school beach trip with five students . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.","Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, from South Hills High School in California appeared in court for charges of having sex with male students .

There, the glamorous political wife was spotted winking at the royals as she arrived with her husband, before smiling and laughing her way through the ceremony - indulged by an equally cheerful Queen. Ms Rivera, a former soap star, was then squired on a tour of the Royal Collection by a clearly charmed Duke of Edinburgh, with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to Prince Philip during a visit to Mexico in 1975. Her whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of Downton Abbey alongside the Countess of Wessex yesterday, with her husband spending much of the day at Downing Street instead. But it was for the final evening of her stay that Ms Rivera really pulled out all the stops, arriving at London's Guildhall in a spectacular floor-length black dress, teamed with a pair of diamond drop earrings and a matching bracelet.

Ms Rivera, who was presented with a pretty bunch of spring flowers as she arrived, spent much of the evening chatting happily to the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, who were also at the event, and Mrs Gilly Yarrow, the wife of the Lord Mayor. On arrival, the couple were welcomed with a  Royal Salute fired from the cannons at the Tower of London during which a total of 62 shots were fired - the basic 21-gun Royal Salute, plus another 20 because the Tower is a royal palace and a further 21 for the City of London. The Mexican National Anthem was then played and President Peña Nieto was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour before making his way inside. At the end of the banquet, both President Peña Nieto and Lord Mayor Yarrow made speeches - in President Peña Nieto's case, for the second night in a row.

The plans were revealed to Aviva Rutkin at New Scientist by bioengineers from Gingko Bioworks. Rose oil used in perfume is typically harvested from large fields of the flowers planted across Europe. But because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly, which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives. To make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible, the bioengineers at Gingko coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell.

But because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly, which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives. To make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible, the bioengineers at Gingko coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell. From these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour. They then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions. The key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the compounds found the scent of a rose. From these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour. They then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions. The key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose. And the firm told Ms Rutkin that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast's genome to force these reactions. The Boston-based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company Robertet and sends samples of each stage to the French firm for analysis and feedback. The goal is to create a designer fragrance that can be created in bulk and sold to consumers. Gingko is also working on other fragrances as well as cultured flavours and sweeteners. 'We're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth,' Jason Kelly from Gingko Bioworks told MailOnline. 'These flowers smell wonderful when growing on the plant but the extracted floral oil doesn't capture the scent. 'Perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using Ginkgo's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish.' 'The natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients,' added Gingko's Reshma Shetty. 'Aroma chemicals that previously were made via extraction from plants or synthetic chemistry can now be made via fermentation. 'The mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production: the raw material (often sugar) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid.' In 2013 Dutch scientists grew ‘cultured beef’ in a lab using cells from a living cow. The world's first test-tube patty was dubbed Frankenburger, cost £250,000 and took three months to form.

The world's first test-tube burger made from lab-grown meat (pictured) was  cooked and eaten in London in August 2013. The  patty was developed by Professor Mark Post (pictured) of Maastricht University in the Netherlands and cost £250,000 to produce . Its creator, . Dutch scientist Mark Post, believes it could revolutionise the food . industry and help save the planet. He believes that artificial meat . products could be sold in supermarkets within a decade. Similar to the cultured fragrances, the burgers are created in a four-step . process. In 2013 Dutch scientists grew ‘cultured beef’ in a lab using cells from a living cow. The world's first test-tube patty was dubbed Frankenburger, cost £250,000 and took three months to form. The stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth, allowing them to proliferate 30-fold. Next they are combined with an . elastic collagen and attached to Velcro 'anchor points' in a culture . dish. Between the anchor points, the cells self-organise into chunks of . muscle. Electrical stimulation is then used . to make the muscle strips contract and 'bulk up' - the laboratory . equivalent of working out in a gym. Finally thousands of beef strips . are minced up, together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat, and . moulded into a patty. Around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger. Other non-meat ingredients include . salt, egg powder, and breadcrumbs. Red beetroot juice and saffron are . added to provide authentic beef colouring. First, stem cells - which have the power to turn into any . other cell - are stripped from cow muscle, which is taken during a . harmless biopsy. Next, the cells are incubated in a . nutrient ‘broth’ until they multiply many times over, creating a sticky . tissue. This is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of . exercise - it is anchored to Velcro and stretched. Finally, 20,000 strips of the meat are . minced and mixed with salt, breadcrumbs, egg powder and natural red . colourants to form an edible patty. The project was backed by billionaire . Google founder Sergey Brin. Professor Post  spent seven years trying to . turn stem cells into meat, and was first successful with mouse burgers. He then tried to grow pork - producing strips with the rubbery texture . of squid or scallops - before settling on beef. More recently, biohackers in California discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow DNA, before growing them in baker’s yeast and using them to create a ‘milk’ substitute. This milk can then be churned using traditional cheese-making methods to become real vegan cheese. Real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious in California. The technology has already been proven on an individual scale. Last year Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands presented the first lab-grown hamburger . To create the proteins, the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences. They optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch. This DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk-protein. The genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows, and raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast. To make real vegan cheese, the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients, including, fat, or in this case vegetable butter, vegan sugar in place of lactose, and water. Mixing these creates the vegan milk, which can then be then turned into cheese. Although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals, they are actually made from scratch.

"A teenager caught with a car boot of 20 cannabis joints should not be banned from becoming a teacher or a nurse, Nick Clegg suggested today. The Lib Dem leader was challenged over his call for drug users not to be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances. He said it was ‘ridiculous’ that young people’s future careers could be ‘blighted’ by nothing more than a ‘teenage indiscretion’. Nick Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record . The Liberal Democrat manifesto will commit the party to ending imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and ensure that those arrested with small amounts of illicit substances do not get a criminal record. But during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record. LBC host Nick Ferrari said: ‘I’m an 18-year-old student, I get stopped by police, I have 20 joints in the boot of my car. I subsequently want to become a teacher. Can I become a teacher?’ Mr Clegg insisted that as the law stands that person would not be able to become a teacher. But he said the law needed to be changed: ‘I think it’s completely wrong if some teenager, 17 or 18 year old, dabbles in… I don’t know whether it’s 20 [joints] or one. ‘Do I think their chances of working as a nurse, as a teacher, or a lawyer or a taxi driver should be blighted forever, of course I don’t. ‘If you are a teenager, one in five youngster use drugs, a third of adults have used drugs at some point in their life in this country. ‘What you are saying to me is someone who as a 17 or 18--year-old and has smoked some hassish, and they are caught doing that, you’re saying they should never ever… work as a nurse, as a teacher.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clergg shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson to argue said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances . Yesterday's announcement follows a controversial ‘research’ project ordered by Lib Dem Home Office ministers, which used taxpayers’ money to study drugs policy around the world. Jeremy Browne and Norman Baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs. They travelled to ten countries, including the US, Portugal and Sweden, at a cost of almost £40,000. The Lib Dems seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like Portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs. But critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen. Pressed again on the scenario of 20 joints, Mr Clegg hit back: ‘If he has got 20 joints is he allowed to be a teacher. ‘Your fixation is whether it was 20. My fixation is whether do I think they should be ruled out forever to work as a teacher. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that we turn what might be a teenage indiscretion into a lifelong ban from public service in our schools and hospitals. ‘I think that is one of the many, many features of our approach to the so-called war on drugs which is irrational, and counter-productive.’ Mr Clegg yesterday shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson  who claimed that smoking powerful cannabis does not cause ‘any harm’. The Virgin tycoon shared a platform with the Lib Dem leader to promote the party’s pledge. He said: ‘Of people taking hash [cannabis], something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... Take people taking skunk. ‘It’s slightly worse than alcohol. But there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it’s not doing them any harm.’ However, he today sought to clarify his remarks, insisting he was talking about 'hash' and not 'skunk'. Sir Richard said in a blog: 'What I did say was that many people take hash for recreational purposes and enjoy it without doing themselves any harm. 'The same way that drinking alcohol, if you do it in moderation, is not going to do people any harm.' A study last month by Kings College London found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk. The report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode. Last night, Mr Clegg also insisted that the so-called ‘war on drugs’ was ‘not working’, although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in Britain for years. The Home Secretary Theresa May has blocked any softening of the drugs laws. The Lib Dems want to take drug policy away from the Home Office and place it in the Department of Health . A poll of 100 charities by the Centre for Social Justice last night found that 69 per cent of charities in the field would be concerned if the Government decriminalised cannabis. More than half (56 per cent) said cannabis use would increase if its use was decriminalised. Andy Cook, chief executive of charity Twenty Twenty, which works with disadvantaged young-people, said: ‘We are scared by the idea of liberalising cannabis laws. We work tirelessly to get the most disadvantaged and disengaged young people back into learning and to hold down jobs. If they are taking cannabis it makes it almost impossible to succeed – sapping their motivation and effectively tying our hands in the support we can give. ‘Cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with, so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy. Making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it. The result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential.’","Nick Clegg said users should not be given criminal records for possession .

"It is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain, glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs. Scientists in London have developed a ‘self-cleaning’ coating that can be sprayed or painted onto almost any material. The substance, made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, works because it is very, very water resistant. Scientists in London have developed a ‘self-cleaning’ coating that can be sprayed or painted onto almost any material. The substance is made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles and any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up any dust or germs in its path . Any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up any dust or germs in its path. The breakthrough, by chemists at University College London, comes after years of research into highly water-resistant - or ‘superhydrophobic’ - substances. The idea was inspired by copying elements from nature. Waxy feathers, for example, repel water, keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean. The petals of a lotus flower, in a similar way, shed moisture, meaning they are not weighed down and damaged by rain. Within weeks of after Samsung releasing its waterproof Galaxy S5 last year, Apple filed a patent that took its rival’s technology a step further. Called ‘Methods for shielding electronic components from moisture’, the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside. Individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone, even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing. Professor Ivan Parkin, head of chemistry at UCL, said: ‘If we can do this as well as nature does it, we will have a series of breakthrough products.’ Applications for the spray might include self-cleaning paint, which is resistant to coffee spills, damp or mould. The substance may also be used in hospital theatres to stop bacteria accumulating. Or it might be used on the hulls of boats, reducing friction with the water, allowing more speed and requiring less fuel. Professor Parkin, whose work is published in the journal Science, added: ‘If it goes well you might see products on shop shelves in the order of two to four years.’ PhD student Yao Lu, whose lab work at UCL contributed to the breakthrough, has shown in a series of tests that the substance can be applied to the threads of textiles which could allow it to be used to create waterproof and stainproof clothes. Mr Lu demonstrated that cotton-wool coated with the substance could be dipped into blue coloured dye and yet emerge pristine white. Crucially, the student and his colleagues managed to develop a material that is far more robust than previous ‘self-cleaning’ substances. The experts demonstrated that cotton-wool coated with the substance could be dipped into blue coloured dye and yet emerge pristine white (pictured). In addition, the coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper . The idea was inspired by copying elements from nature. Waxy feathers, for example, repel water, keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean. The petals of a lotus flower, in a similar way, shed moisture meaning they are not weighed down and damaged by rain (pictured) Previous attempts have failed because the coating could be wiped off with a napkin. But coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper. Mr Lu said: ‘Being waterproof allows materials to self-clean as water forms marble-shaped droplets that roll over the surface, acting like miniature vacuum cleaners picking up dirt, viruses and bacteria along the way. ‘For this to happen, the surface must be rough and waxy, so we set out to create these conditions on hard and soft surfaces by designing our own paint and combining it with different adhesives to help the surfaces withstand damage.’ Professor Claire Carmalt, co-author of the work, said: ‘The biggest challenge for the widespread application of self-cleaning surfaces is finding a way to make them tough enough to withstand everyday damage. ‘The surfaces tend to be mechanically weak and so rub off easily, but by pairing our paint with different adhesives, we’ve shown it is possible to make a robust self-cleaning surface. ‘We used materials that are readily available so our methods can be scaled-up for industrial applications.’ Brigham Young University researchers in Utah recently created a technique to make any surface super-waterproof by adding tiny structures to the surface instead. This causes droplets to bounce (pictured), rather than roll, off. Researchers claim it could be used to make solar panels, ships and planes waterproof .","The substance is made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles .

"Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee is accused of laundering £1m through her bank account, stolen by Barclays Bank fraudster John Skermer . A Thai call girl laundered £1million stolen from a worker at Barclays Bank after they met through an escort agency, a court heard. Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee, 43, is accused of accepting £996,999 from convicted fraudster John Skermer, of Widnes, Cheshire, who set up ‘ghost bank accounts’ to steal from his employer. Skermer has previously confessed to being responsible for a £2.1m fraud after writing computer programmes to exploit inadequacies in Barclays’ system, the Old Bailey heard. Pruankaewmanee is accused of meeting Skermer through Oriental Angels, an escort agency she worked for in London, and transferring the stolen cash to different accounts. It is claimed she received almost £1million from Skermer and transferred £951,728 to her TSB bank account. She then allegedly returned £565,988 to Skermer, who was responsible for 30 million retail bank accounts. John Evison, prosecuting, said: ‘The prosecution say that Ms Pruankaewmanee was working as an escort for an agency called Oriental Angels when she met Mr Skermer and that is how she was introduced to him. ‘She was not the only escort he had seen because as you will hear there were many escorts who received the bank’s money. ‘Mr Skermer also spent money entertaining his friends royally on golfing weekends, buying his wife a present - he was married with children - and helping friends with, not his money, but the bank’s money.’ Pruankaewmanee regularly travelled from her home in Canary Wharf to Cheshire to see Skermer, the court heard. ‘She became a money launderer because he wanted to get the money from Barclays Bank into another account and Ms Pruankaewmanee was the person who, the Crown say, facilitated that,’ the prosecutor added. Pruankaewmanee was arrested last June when her name came to light during the course of the investigation. She admits receiving the money and making the transfers, but claims she believed Skermer was a rich businessman with several legitimate businesses in the UK and abroad. Mr Evison said: ‘She accepts she met him as an escort and he was very generous. She says their relationship developed and she believed she was in a loving relationship with a wealthy man and she says she fell in love with him.’ Pruankaewmanee (left) accepts she met convicted fraudster John Skermer (right) when working as an escort for Oriental Angels but claims she never knew or suspected the £1million he gave her was criminal property . Pruankaewmanee claims she was ‘naive and vulnerable’, but never knew or suspected the money was criminal property. ‘The Crown say her account is not a credible one. She knew, the Crown say, this money was the proceeds of criminal activity or if she didn’t initially have that knowledge she must have suspected that was the case,’ Mr Evison added. Skermer, from Widnes, Cheshire, admitted carrying the £2.1million fraud last March, the Old Bailey heard. The software manager, now 46, spent the money on escorts, ‘royally’ entertaining his friends on golfing weekends and gifts for his wife, jurors were told. Pruankaewmanee denies acquiring criminal property, entering into a money laundering relationship and transferring criminal property between 22 December 2011 and 19 February 2013. The trial continues.

'In effect, the New Zealand spy agency gathers information on the country's nearest neighbours to help secure its place in the US-led alliance,' the New Zealand Herald said after conducting a joint investigation into the leaks with US-based website The Intercept. Separately, the Sydney Morning Herald said the documents also revealed New Zealand and Australian intelligence services worked together to spy on Indonesia's largest mobile phone network Telkomsel.

It suggests the Scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in May, winning as many as 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats – up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat.

The poll also revealed that Ukip leader Nigel Farage, left, is associated with tough guy actor Ray Winstone, right . Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year’s independence referendum had thrown a ‘giant spanner in Labour’s works’. The poll suggests a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be likely. The two parties would have a combined total of 328 seats – producing a Commons majority of just three. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, could become deputy prime minister in any deal. His party has ruled out supporting the Conservatives. Gordon Brown’s seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country . And it has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. Gordon Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead. In Edinburgh South West, where former chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll predicts an SNP win with a 22 per cent swing. The Scottish nationalists are also set to win Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983. New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire – but he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining. Polling was also conducted in a number of marginal seats in England and Wales. The Tories are set to hold on in Vale of Glamorgan as well as Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, where they are narrowly ahead. But Labour is edging towards victory in two other Tory-held marginals – Norwich North and High Peak, in Derbyshire.","New poll has shown which TV characters voters associate with leaders .

British supermodel, Georgia May Jagger, 23, poses next to a floral plane designed by Masha Ma . The livery design, created by Chinese fashion designer Masha Ma, features a bamboo and a rose in an eye-catching blend of east-meets-west. It took an engineering team over 2472 hours, using 186 individuals to complete. 'Bamboo and roses have significant cultural connotations in China and Britain respectively, and are each cherished symbols,' said Ma, who studied at Central Saint Martins art college in London. 'In Chinese culture, bamboo represents modesty, integrity and vitality. For Britain, the rose symbolises love, nobility and dignity,' she said. The Duke of Cambridge is the first senior royal visit to the Chinese mainland in almost three decades . 'As Sino-British ties continue to bloom and flourish, I felt that the meeting of bamboo with a rose would be the perfect way to celebrate the growing friendship and collaboration between the two countries.' Richard Tams, British Airways executive vice president in China, said: 'We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with Masha on such an iconic project . 'Her inspiring design delivers a strong message: that of a growing and flourishing relationship between the cultures of Britain and China. The livery design depicts a bamboo and a rose in an east-meets-west fusion of symbols and artistic styles . The livery design took over 2472 man-hours and 186 individual stencils to apply . 'We hope it will encourage individuals and businesses in both countries to forge closer ties.' The festival, which ran from March 2 to 4, is part of the GREAT Britain campaign aimed at promoting the UK as a world-class destination for trade, tourism, investment and education to generate jobs and growth. British Airways  collaborated with VisitBritain to showcase the best of British hospitality as they welcome visitors to a unique garden party, inspired by the royal tradition.

"A man accused of carrying out attacks on five separate public places had a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition stored at his house. Hong Young chose his targets at random with the first attack taking place at Arundel Mills mall, Maryland, on February 24, police said. The 35-year-old, from Beltsville, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with attempted murder and assault after police spotted a 1999 Lincoln Town car linked to him near the site. Scroll down for video . A man accused of firing at five public places in Maryland had a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition stored at his house . After searching his two-storey house they found ten weapons including several handguns. The mall shooting was the first of five attacks by Young in the last week. It involved a 61-year-old man who had the windows of his car shot out as he was driving through the shopping complex on February 24 around 7.30am. The following Saturday the footage of the Lincoln Town car was released, according to the Baltimore Sun. But police were notified of a second shooting at a Walmart in Laurel on Monday. That same day, cleaning crew staff reportedly heard gunshots around 5.10am at the AMC Theater in Columbia. Hong Young (left) has been charged with attempted murder and assault after the five attacks. Police searching his house (right) found ten weapons . After searching his two-storey house police also found a variety of ammunition kept in wooden drawers .

Tuesday, March 3, 3pm: Intercounty Connector in Laurel . Tuesday, March 3, 5pm: National Security Agency in Fort Meade . On Tuesday a dump truck carrying two Nelson Tree specialist workers was travelling eastbound on the Intercounty Connector when it was struck by gunshots coming from a nearby wood. The attack, which happened just before 3pm, left both passengers with injuries. One was hurt by shattered glass and the other bruised from a bullet fragment, according to the Washington Post. Just two hours later the National Security Agency (NSA) in Fort Meade was targeted and several gunshots struck one of its office buildings. No injuries were reported, a spokesman for the NSA told the Daily Mail Online. A police spokesman said Young was being monitored at a nearby hospital under police guard. Investigators will look into whether Young is tied to all five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties (above map showing where the shootings took place) Police were searching for a grey or blue Lincoln Town car (above), which was spotted near some of the crime scenes. They believe it belongs to Young . He said: 'Clearly, he was continuing to do it until he got caught. 'This guy apparently has some other issues going on that our detectives continue to follow up on.' Young filed for divorce in September after nearly seven years of marriage, but the case was dismissed on Monday because his wife had not been served with documents in the case. Stephen Moyer, Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary, said Young was a prison guard from January 2012 to May 2014. Surveillance videos captured the car (above) but did not determine the number plate or identity of the shooter . One attack involved the National Security Agency (NSA) in Fort Meade (above). There were no injuries to any staff, a spokesman said . He said: 'There was nothing significant about his employment. 'He was assigned to one of the medium security facilities in Jessup. He resigned. There was nothing remarkable about his file.' Investigators are working to determine a motive, but do not believe the shootings are terrorism related. It is a case with chilling similarities to the DC sniper attacks of 2002 when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue Chevrolet Sedan. But this time County Chief Timothy Altomare said everyone was 'alive and well'. He said: 'Most of us here probably, in some way, shape or form, are aware of the events 15 years ago with the DC sniper case. 'As soon as we started to hear about the possibility of this stuff being linked, we kicked every effort we had into overdrive.' The back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper, John Allen Muhammad (left) and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (right), terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings . Back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings. Ten people were killed and three injured in the October 14 shootings, which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem. John Allen Muhammad and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo started their spree in February 2002, with murders in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Washington State. The cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured. It was only in October that they began to target the Virginia and Maryland areas immediately surrounding DC - earning the name the Beltway sniper attacks. The attacks left DC residents afraid to leave their houses for weeks. People would be shot at random and from a distance, so were never confronted with the attacker. But Muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a Tarot card inscribed with the phrase 'Call me God'. Muhammad and Malvo's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on October 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in Myersville, Maryland and taken into custody. The following September, Muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death. His accomplice Malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed. When Malvo went on trial, his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of Muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes, which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole. Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009.","Ten weapons found at Hong Young's house in Beltsville, Maryland .

"Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson has been forced to apologize for comments made on Wednesday in which he said prisoners' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice. The retired neurosurgeon posted a statement on his Facebook page just hours later in which he said he 'realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues.' 'I do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive. For that I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended,' he added. Scroll down for video . Republican presidential hopeful Carson has been forced to apologize for comments on Wednesday in which he claimed that prisoners' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice . However Carson's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it isn't certain whether people are born either gay or straight. 'Some of our brightest minds have looked at this debate, and up until this point there have been no definitive studies that people are born into a specific sexuality,' he said. Carson's opinion is at odds with many in the medical community, including the American Psychological Association, who says 'most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.' Carson had landed himself in hot water on Wednesday morning after appearing on CNN's New Day. Asked by Chris Cuomo if being gay was a choice, Carson replied: 'Absolutely.' 'Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question,' Carson said. He then spoke out against gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights - property rights, visitation rights,' he said. Carson's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it isn't certain whether people are born either gay or straight . 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' Carson said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson has long been outspoken on the subject of gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. It's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews. The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.","The Republican presidential hopeful said prisoners' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice on CNN's New Day .

"Cockroaches might not be the most beloved of all critters - but is it ethical to control their movement with mind-control technology? That’s a debate engineers at Texas A&M University are stirring with their latest ‘robo-roach’ device, which can control the path a cockroach takes with wireless technology. They have created little backpacks for the bugs and implanted electrodes into their nervous system to control their movement. Scroll down for video . Texas engineers have developed a method to control cockroach movement. Their backpack stimulates the nervous system in the bugs' brains (image provided by Dr Hong Liang). Doing so allows the direction of their movement to be altered. It is different to previous technologies that stimulated antennae . This is not the first technology to turn cockroaches into controllable insects - others have even released products you can buy to create your own remote-controlled roach. But previous attempts to manipulate the movements of cockroaches relied on stimulating their antennae, tricking them into avoiding objects. The technology developed by Texas A&M University, meanwhile, works by stimulating nerves in the cockroach’s brain to allow for greater control. The paper, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, details how the team built a small micro-controller, wireless receiver and a rechargeable lithium battery. These were packaged together in a ‘backpack’ weighing 0.007lbs (3g) that was attached to the cockroach. Next, they inserted electrodes into the body of a cockroach to stimulate its nervous system. By stimulating either left or right side, the team then found they could control the bug, although it only responded correctly about 60 per cent of the time. In tests, the researchers were able to control the movement of the cockroaches around obstacles (shown). While they can only control their direction for now, the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control, such as making it walk, run and stop on command . Speaking to The Guardian, lead researcher Dr Hong Liang said the benefits of such technology could include attaching cameras or sensors to cockroaches, and having them explore areas humans cannot - such as disaster zones. ‘Insects can do things a robot cannot,’ she said. ‘They can go into small places, sense the environment, and if there’s movement, from a predator say, they can escape much better than a system designed by a human. ‘We wanted to find ways to work with them.’ While they can only control their direction for now, the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control, such as making it walk, run and stop on command. In November 2014 researchers from North Carolina fitted the hardy creatures with electrical backpacks complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds. The idea is that cyborg cockroaches, or ‘biobots’, could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes, for example, and help emergency workers find survivors. ‘In a collapsed building, sound is the best way to find survivors,’ said Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at North Carolina State University. ‘The goal is to use the biobots with high-resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that don't matter - like a leaking pipe. ‘Once we've identified sounds that matter, we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero-in on where those sounds are coming from.’","Texas engineers have developed a method to control cockroach movement .

"A New Jersey appellate court says a man cannot seek damages for burns he suffered while bowing his head in prayer over a sizzling steak fajita skillet at an Applebee's restaurant. The ruling made public Wednesday upheld a lower court ruling that dismissed his lawsuit. The man - identified in court papers as Hiram Jimenez - claimed a waitress didn't warn him the dish was hot. The lower court, however, found that the food posed an 'open and obvious' danger. Ruling: A New Jersey appellate court says a man cannot seek damages from Applebee's for burns he suffered while bowing his head in prayer over a sizzling steak fajita skillet at a restaurant . The incident happened in March 2010 at an Applebee's restaurant in Westampton, New Jersey. Jimenez said he bowed his head, then heard a loud sizzle followed by a grease pop. He then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and on his face. Jimenez said he panicked and knocked the food on his lap, causing more burns. The burns didn't cause scarring. The appellate court ruling said 'Plaintiff alleged that, on March 4, 2010, while a business invitee at Applebee's, he was injured solely as a result of defendants' negligence when he came in contact with a dangerous and hazardous condition, specifically, ""a plate of hot food.""' 'Here, the danger posed by a plate of sizzling hot food was self-evident,' the ruling said. 'Therefore, we conclude that the motion judge correctly determined that defendants had no duty to warn plaintiff that the food was sizzling hot and should be approached with due care.' Darren Audino, an attorney representing Applebee's, declined to comment. A message seeking comment from Jimenez's attorney, Richard Wiener, wasn't immediately returned.

"The ancient mound of Silbury Hill was built as lighthouse and harbour to help Neolithic traders navigate  waterways, an expert has claimed. Archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in Wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in  rituals. But a cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a  stone avenue between the mound and the nearby  stone circle of Avebury. Land ahoy! The expert a claims southern Britain was a series of islands linked by waterways, channels and swollen rivers, and that Stonehenge was effectively located on the coast. The mound (pictured) would have acted as a lighthouse and harbour for those travelling by boat . Robert John Langdon said this suggests the hill was a lighthouse for travellers who docked at the mound and walked to the circle for goods. He said: 'The maps I have produced indicate that Avebury was a trading place for our ancestors. 'My assumption is that the nearby monument of Silbury Hill would have been used as a harbour, once the waters had eventually receded from the main site of Avebury.

Mr Langdon says southern Britain was a series of islands linked by waterways, channels and swollen rivers, and that Stonehenge was effectively located on the coast. He believes he has discovered an avenue leading to the massive stone circle at Avebury - an older and bigger site than Stonehenge. He said this indicates Silbury Hill was merely a beacon to guide people to Avebury and added: 'This concept and use of hills are commonplace at the time of the Roman Empire and thereafter, but it was not their invention. 'The Romans inherited the idea from other cultures such as the Egyptians, who had their ""Lighthouse of Alexandria"". 'We have now found our very own 'Lighthouse of Avebury', but some 2,000 years earlier.' 'Therefore, a direct pathway would have been used from Silbury Hill to Avebury for goods, which according to archaeologists doesn't exist. 'If you are going to spend years or even decades building such a construction, there has to be a social or financial reward for your endeavours. 'We now know through recent excavations that this mound was built in stages, starting small, then getting taller. 'If it was purely symbolic you wouldn't need to change the size. 'You only change the height of this monument if it serves as a beacon to attract ships and boats to the trading place of Avebury, for the higher you build, the greater the visible range.' Iconic Silbury Hill is a 98ft (30 metre) high prehistoric artificial chalk mound which is part of the Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in Wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals . The Neolithic period  - also known as the 'New Stone Age' - spanned from around 4000 to 2,500 BC and was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and a more sedentary style of living. Gods: New importance was placed on religion, and ritual  (Neolithic religious monument pictured) The preceding period of the last, post-glacial hunter-gatherer societies is known as the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age. To make room for the new farmland, deforestation took place which permanently transformed the landscape. This moment is sometimes referred to as the 'Neolithic revolution' but radiocarbon dating has revealed that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer was relatively gradual. It was believed that the introduction of farming into Britain was the result of a huge migration from mainland Europe, but genetic research suggests that the influx  was probably  small - somewhere around 20 per cent of the total population. These people also brought with them the first seed grains of wheat and barley, which had been bred from wild grasses that grew in the region of modern-day Iraq. New types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced too. The Neolithic also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape, many of which were enormous. The earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the Early Neolithic but later stone circles were built, a trend that continued into the  Bronze Age. These constructions reflect a shift in culture - a new importance that was placed on religion, ritual and social hierarchy. The people that lived during this period left behind no written records, however, so all that is known  comes from archaeological evidence.

His QC said: ‘Please recognise how disturbing a development it is that journalists that only report the news accurately, honestly and fearlessly now face being prosecuted in our criminal courts. ‘From John Kay’s perspective that is exactly what’s happening right here.’ Mr Burke told jurors they would be ‘all too familiar with journalists being silenced by courts’ and spoke of oppressive regimes such as Russia and Egypt that sought to crush a free Press and free speech. ‘You might be aware of events in Moscow over the weekend, where a free Press has long ceased to exist,’ he said. ‘It never did in China. ‘And we have seen in recent years protests – people demanding a fraction of the rights we enjoy here, which include but are not restricted to a free Press.’ Mr Burke said the jury would have to rule on public interest. ‘It is the very basic function of a journalist in a free society to report the news without fear or favour,’ he said. ‘To expose hypocrisy and to reveal the truth.’ Mr Burke told the jury how the Press had exposed child sex abuse in Rotherham as well as the MPs’ expenses scandal. The public official who leaked the documents revealing the expenses story has not been prosecuted, the court heard. ‘Nobody could ever conceivably justify a prosecution of the official because of the overwhelming public interest,’ Mr Burke said. ‘Paying an official can be trumped by a public interest defence.’ Mr Burke said Kay saw it as his ‘fundamental duty to hold the powerful to account and to speak for those who have no voice’. ‘He saw it as his role to expose, to correct, to reveal the very truth,’ he said. ‘If John Kay and his profession do not do it on your behalf who will?’ The trial has heard that MoD official Bettina Jordan-Barber, 42, was paid £100,000 by the Sun while working as a strategy officer who briefed the Defence Secretary and that Kay knew she was a public official. Mr Burke described the sum paid to Jordan-Barber as ‘compensation’ for the risk she ran in losing her job if her bosses found out she was leaking information to the Press. ‘The public interest was part of her motivation,’ he added. Also on trial is Sun royal correspondent Duncan Larcombe, 39, who is accused of paying ex-Sandhurst colour sergeant John Hardy, 44, for details about the Army base where Prince Harry trained. Hardy funnelled some of the 34 payments totalling £23,000 through his 41-year-old wife Claire, the court has heard. Sun executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 60, is accused of plotting to pay a public official for stories and deputy editor Geoff Webster, 55, is accused of authorising payments worth thousands of pounds to public officials in return for information. All four Sun journalists deny charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office. Hardy, of Accrington, Lancashire, denies misconduct in public office. His wife Claire denies aiding and abetting misconduct in public office. The trial continues.

"Accused: Jordan McKay Nelson, 23, has been accused of locking the four children in dog cages . A step-mum has been accused of locking her four young children in a dog cage in a dark basement as punishment, it has been reported. Jordan McKay Nelson, 23, also allegedly forced the youngsters to eat dog food, which caused one six-year-old boy to vomit violently. The children, aged between five to nine years old, were held under 'terrorising conditions', according to court documents in North Dakota, USA. Nelson is also accused of turning out the lights when the children were locked into the cages as a form of punishment. During a police interview, one nine-year-old boy drew a picture of himself in the kennel with the words 'Help me'. A police affidavit says Nelson is in a relationship with the children's biological mother. The complaint read: 'The previously stated actions are also enough to cause permanent mental injury to the juveniles.' Nelson has been charged with four counts of abuse, neglect of a child and felonious restraint. A preliminary hearing has been set for April 13. Her lawyer has not yet returned phone calls seeking comment on his client. She was released on bond and ordered to stay away from the children, who live in the city of Grafton in North Dakota.","Jordan McKay Nelson, 23, punished children by keeping them caged .

"Thanks to missions like Nasa's Curiosity rover, we know Mars once had water - but until now we didn't know how much. Scientists have provided the best estimates yet, claiming it once had more water than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years. The findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but  over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry. Nasa scientists in Maryland have calculated how much water was once on Mars. They found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the Arctic Ocean. Most of this would have been in the northern hemisphere of the planet (illustrated). Since then, 87% of the water has been lost to space, with the rest stored in ice at the poles . The study by scientists at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the first to determine just how much water Mars had in its past. During its wet Noachian period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet (137 metres) deep. However, it’s likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of Mars, which would have been as deep as one mile (1.6km) in places - comparable to the Mediterranean Sea on Earth. Published in the journal Science, the research estimates that, in total, what is now the planet’s arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles (20 million cubic kilometres) of water. Microsoft’s ‘HoloLens' headset, which allows wearers to see 3D images superimposed over their vision, may look like it belongs in a sci-fi film. And now Nasa has revealed the prototype technology will be used to enable its scientists to work virtually on Mars. The headset will work with OnSight software to give scientists a means to plan experiments on the red planet, with the help of the Curiosity rover. The software was developed jointly by the two companies, including a team at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘Our study provides a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had, by determining how much water was lost to space,’ said Dr Geronimo Villanueva, first author of the paper and a scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center. ‘With this work, we can better understand the history of water on Mars.’ It is thought that while 87 per cent of the water has since been lost to space, owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere, the remaining 13 per cent resides in the ice caps. But in the past, the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet’s surface area. The most interesting conclusion, though, is that Mars stayed wet for longer than previously thought, which means it was habitable for longer. ‘We now know that Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before,’ said Dr Michael Mumma, co-author of the study and Senior Scientist at Nasa Goddard. ‘Curiosity shows it was wet for 1.5 billion years, already much longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on Earth. ‘And now we see that Mars must have been wet for a period even longer.’ During its wet Noachian period, 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, it is estimated that Mars had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet (137 metres) deep. However, it’s likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of Mars (illustrated) as deep as one mile in places . It is thought that while 87% of the water has since been lost to space (illustrated), owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere, the remaining 13% resides in the ice caps. But in the past, the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet’s surface area . The research was carried out using two telescopes at the Keck Observatory on Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. To make the discovery, the scientists produced maps showing the distribution of normal water in the Martian atmosphere and 'heavy' water containing deuterium, a more massive form of hydrogen. By analysing the ratio of 'heavy' to regular water they showed that Mars must have lost a volume of water 6.5 times larger than the amount trapped in the present day polar ice caps. An ancient ocean containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet’s surface. It would have had a greater volume than the Arctic Ocean, which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres (11.7 million cubic miles) of water. By comparison, the Atlantic Ocean covers 17 per cent of the surface of the Earth and contains more than 310 million cubic kilometres (192.6 million cubic miles). It is possible that Mars once had even more water, some of which may have been deposited below the surface. Because the new maps reveal microclimates and changes in the atmospheric water content over time, they may also prove to be useful in the search for underground water. An ancient ocean on Mars containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet’s surface. It would have had a greater volume than the Arctic Ocean (shown), which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres (11.7 million cubic miles) of water . Missions like the Curiosity rover (illustrated) have shown that Mars was once wet for 1.5 billion years, but the scientists now think it had water for even longer. This is longer than the time it took life on Earth to arise, providing tantalising hints that Mars might once have been habitable .","Nasa Goddard scientists in Maryland studied past water on Mars .

"Fresh security fears have been raised in Paris after a drone was seen hovering over the current offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. The sighting was one of around a dozen reported over sensitive sites in the French capital in just one day earlier this week. One of those came from a police officer who claimed he saw an unnamed aircraft flying over the offices of Liberation newspaper where staff from Charlie Hebdo are now based after their building was targeted by Islamic militants in an attack that killed 12 people. New alert: A drone was seen hovering over the current offices being used by staff at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper (above) following the terror attack on their building that killed 12 people in January . New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States earlier this year . Police pursued the drone, but lost it at the porte de Montreuil, which leads to the ring road southeast of the capital. However, it was later spotted at  Porte de Vincennes, where a fanatical accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo killers shot dead four people at a Jewish supermarket, the Daily Telegraph reported. Another drone sighting was reported over eastern Paris where witnesses saw three men retrieve the aircraft and drive off in a black car before police could arrest them, a police source said. No arrests were made over the flights, which also reportedly took place near the River Seine, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum. French police have vowed to track down and . arrest the operators of the drones amid fears from the public they could be used to attach explosives or toxic chemicals. Earlier this week, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told . parliament that some 60 drone flights over Paris and over . nuclear power plants had been reported since October 5. Tension: In other sightings, drones were also seen flying around the  Eiffel Tower earlier this year . Drones were also spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . Flights over Paris without authorisation from aviation . authorities are illegal, as is the use of airspace up to 1,000 . metres above a nuclear site. 'We need to be very vigilant on this, we're going to have to . be extremely careful,' government spokesman Stephane Le Foll . told France Info radio, referring to the drones. 'The day that . we find the people who are doing this, there will be penalties... we will find them, sooner or later.' France is still on high alert following a series of attacks . in January that killed 20 people, including three attackers. Interior Minister Cazeneuve also told parliament he wanted . to equip police with 'new legal tools' to crack down on the . illegal use of drones in sensitive areas. On Tuesday, a court fined a British journalist 1,000 euros ($1,100) for flying a drone over central Paris and confiscated his machine. Tristan Redman, 34, from the Qatar-based network Al-Jazeera, was arrested last month in the Bois de Boulogne park on the western edge of the French capital along with two other journalists. The two others were released and Redman pleaded guilty to flying a drone over the capital, which is illegal under French law. France remains on high alert after jihadist attacks in and around the French capital in January left 17 people dead.","Police officer saw aircraft flying over current office of satirical newspaper .

"Frat boy: Jeffrey Yam, 21, is one of two Syracuse University students charged with first-degree hazing for allegedly making three fraternity pledges to crawl in the snow . A Syracuse University pledge may lose four fingers after being forced to crawl in the snow and perform late-night push-ups, and two fraternity members now face charges for the hazing stunt. Three young men pledging the Nu Alpha Phi fraternity were taken to Lower Hookway Park around midnight Saturday and made to do exercises wearing hooded sweatshirts, pants, boots but no gloves for 'failing to perform their daily duties,' according to Syracuse police. Pledges usually perform physical exercise in the attic of the fraternity house at 739 Ackerman Avenue, according to police. After about 30 minutes of crawling and rolling around in the snow, the pledges were given hand warmers and told to walk back to the frat house, according to police. One of the pledges, an unidentified 20-year-old man, experienced extreme pain in his hands and sought treatment Sunday at a hospital. 'He ran his hands under warm water, but his hands were still extremely painful,' police said in a release. Doctors told him he may lose his ring and pinkie fingers on both hands because of severe frostbite. Syracuse police Lt. Eric Carr said the unidentified victim will have an appointment Thursday or Friday to check the condition of his fingers. 'Obviously he's concerned because this could be a life-altering injury,' Carr said. Police on Wednesday arrested frat members Tae Kim, 19 and Jeffrey Yam, 21 and charged them with first-degree hazing, a misdemeanor. They were released and will appear in court March 18. It could not immediately be determined if the two men had lawyers. Syracuse University has suspended Nu Alpha Phi, which is described on its website as an Asian-interest fraternity with seven chapters at New York colleges and one in New Jersey. Harsh measures: A trio of Syracuse students were pledging to Nu Alpha Phi fraternity Saturday night when they were herded to a nearby park and forced to do push-ups without gloves. A 20-year-old suffered severe frostbite as a result,  which may cost him four fingers . Response: Syracuse officials said the college has zero tolerance for any form of hazing . 'The university has zero tolerance for any form of hazing and takes this matter extremely seriously,' the school said in a statement. Yam and Kim will be subjected to a code of conduct hearing to determine their future at the university. Police said the two other pledges refused to participate with the investigation. One of the other pledges had swollen hands and blistering, Carr said.","Tae Kim, 19 and Jeffrey Yam, 21, charged with misdemeanor first-degree hazing .

"Her choice of thigh-high patent boots, mini skirt and above-the- knee red-and-gold bobble coat was certainly eyecatching. If Theresa May’s intention was to upstage Angelica Rivera, Mexico’s rather beautiful First Lady, then she succeeded — though unfortunately not for the right reasons. Rather, the Home Secretary looked a disturbing mix of one part dominatrix and one part Fifties housewife, with those gloves that put me in mind of a pair of Marigolds. Home Sexetary!Sporting S&M thigh boots, miniskirt and red and gold bobble coat this week, May goes into fashion meltdown on her way to meet the Queen and the President of Mexico . At 58, what May appears to be suffering from is a classic 50s fashion crisis. Having been there, I know the form this crisis takes. What happens is this. One day you survey yourself in the mirror and decide you’re looking like a middle-aged frump and that if you don’t watch out you’ll soon be morphing, before your time, into a little old lady. Your wardrobe is in a rut. You buy the same boring basics for weekends and the same smart suits or skirts and tops for work, year in year out. So, in an effort to update yourself, you rush out and start buying things that will make you feel fresher, flirtier, more youthful. Unless you have teenage children to put you in your fashion place (and May doesn’t have children), you may find yourself with a whole new wardrobe that just doesn’t chime with your looks, age or, in May’s case, profession. Husbands, being husbands, tend not to notice these things. Girlfriends don’t want to upset or undermine you, so they generally keep schtum. In May’s case, the trajectory was slightly different because it appears that for one brief year in her early 50s she did hit her fashion stride with a wardrobe of flatteringly cut separates in a stylish palette of navy, white, black and taupe. It’s not known whether she feared they made her invisible, however, but what’s certain is that since 2010 her style has been characterised by eccentric and flamboyant outfits. Her look has certainly changed over the years. In the early days after her election to Parliament in 1997, and the years from 2002 when she served in the Shadow Cabinet, her style evolved from ill-fitting suits in drab colours to garish: think of the voluminous orange mac she wore to the Tory conference in 2009. But once the Tories came into power and she was promoted to Home Secretary, she seemed to embark on a brief transformation after losing weight and finding her fashion feet. Shortly after, though, the crisis set in and has been growing worse, culminating in this week’s sartorial disaster. While her fetish for S&M style boots — she also wore them in 2013 for the South Korean president’s state visit — is Fifty Shades of Embarrassing, I can empathise. When my marriage broke up in my mid-50s, I bought a pair of similar boots in suede rather than patent or PVC, but after catching my reflection one day in a shop window, I thought: ‘Who am I trying to kid?’ Admittedly, my 50s fashion panic was partly about attracting men in the wake of my divorce, which is not an issue for the happily married May. But it reflects a loss of fashion confidence at this stage of our lives when the shops are full of temptations that look great on hangers and 25-year-olds, but not necessarily on us. The big difference between May and rest of us, of course, is that her fashion faux pas have to be played out in the full glare of the camera. If you play it safe, as the Duchess of Cambridge does, you get criticised for being bland. Go too trendy and you will be mocked for trying too hard. Perhaps, when it comes to fashion, May should take a leaf out of Sam Cam’s book. The Prime Minister’s wife always looks elegant and low-key, while promoting British fashion to an international audience. Theresa May is an attractive woman and has shapely and slender legs that are amazing for a woman of any age, but if when you think of the Home Secretary the first thing that springs to mind is her footwear and snazzy coats rather than her policies, she’s getting something wrong.

"Contest: Author James Patterson has given £25,000 to encourage reading . When they asked for entries, organisers expected a modest response. Yesterday it emerged that more than 800 schools had applied for a share of a £25,000 book fund. World Book Day director Kirsten Grant said the response was proof of the continuing demand for books, despite the popularity of e-readers. ‘World Book Day is all about the celebration of traditional books,’ she said. ‘For children there is still that wonderful thing of sitting down with their parents and reading a book and that amazing bond it performs. 'Children don’t want physical books to be replaced, they already spend so much time on the internet and devices so books actually provide them with a break from that.' To earn a share of the fund, which was donated by best-selling crime author James Patterson, schools were asked to respond to the statement: Why I can’t live without books. Miss Grant and a panel of judges then drew up a shortlist, selected for their creativity and passion for books. The £10,000 first prize went to Hexthorpe Primary in Doncaster. Six other schools split the remaining £15,000 between themselves. She added: ‘World Book Day is all about the celebration of traditional books. Children can go into a bookshop with a £1 World Book Day token and get an actual physical book. 'So many children don’t have access to physical books so this is an opportunity for them to get one. There is definitely a huge demand. 'School libraries are suffering, book budgets in schools are being slashed, so this is a brilliant way to counter that.’ Huge response: More than 800 schools applied for a share of a £25,000 book fund as part of World Book Day . Mr Patterson, who has also written several children’s books and has donated another £25,000 for an award fund next year, said: ‘Libraries are shutting their doors left and right. 'I firmly believe that every child needs access to a school library, which is why I’m supporting WoBoD: they encourage a love of reading in our children that we can’t afford to lose. ‘Reading is one of the building blocks of life and can take you to another world. Reading encourages imagination and helps with education.’ World Book Day is an annual celebration of reading for children. Set up by UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations, it aims to encourage children to buy books by giving every school child given £1 book token.","Huge response shows books still popularity despite e-readers .

"Nick Clegg today bet a Ukip candidate six pints that the Lib Dems would have many more MPs than Nigel Farage’s ‘pipsqueak’ party. The Lib Dem leader dismissed Ukip’s ‘bluster, anger and brave talk’ ahead of May’s general election, despite being behind in the polls. The Deputy Prime Minister has grown increasingly confidence that despite his slump in popularity nationally, the Lib Dem vote is holding up in the 57 seats where they already have an MP. Scroll down for audio . Nick Clegg was challenged on live radio by Ukip candidate Keith Fraser, who boasted his party would win more MPs than the Lib Dems . One poll this week put the Lib Dems on just 5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, while Ukip were on 14 per cent. However, the concentration of Lib Dem support in a few dozen seats means they are likely to hang on to many of them despite their national collapse. By contrast, Ukip has built support across the country but party insiders admit it is unlikely even to get 10 MPs on May 7. Mr Clegg made the provocative boast that he will win more MPs than Ukip during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC. One poll this week put the Lib Dems on just 5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, while Ukip were on 14 per cent . Ukip candidate Keith Fraser called into the programme to attack Mr Clegg’s stance on civil liberties and boast that the Lib Dems face wipeout. But Mr Clegg hit back: ‘Rather than making slightly silly political points on the radio… . ‘How about this, I will bet you, I don’t know, what shall I bet you, I will bet you several pints that the Liberal Democrats will have many, many, many, many, many more MPs than your party after the election. Ukip leader Nigel Farage boasted his party would win more than 10 MPs and could hold the balance of power . ‘I can not only bet, I can close to guarantee you that your party is going to be a little pipsqueak party after May 7 compared to the Liberal Democrats. ‘All your bluster, and all your anger and all your brave talk I think will dissolve.’ Mr Clegg initially appeared reluctant to commit his own money to the bet, but when LBC host Nick Ferrari offered to pay the money, Mr Clegg replied: Oh alright then, six pints. ‘Let me be absolutely clear Keith, you believe on behalf of Nigel Farage, that you Ukip will have more MPs than the Liberal Democrats after May 7, is that right?’ Keith replied: ‘I think there’s a very good chance of overtaking your party. Am I taking the bet? Two pints will go to each: if I lose, I’m buying Nick Ferrari two pints, I’m buying Nick Clegg two pints, how about that?’ But Mr Clegg insisted: ‘Bad luck Keith, you might as well set the money aside already. Brave talk.’ Later Mr Fraser told MailOnline: 'If I lose, or Ukip loses, I will be more than willing to buy Nick Clegg and Nick Ferrari a beer. 'In fact, after the election Nick Clegg will have plenty of time to have a beer.' However, Mr Farage later insisted his party was on course to win more than 10 seats and could hold the balance of power. Appearing on ITV's Loose Women, he said: 'It'll be more than a handful. It'll be in double figures.' He added: 'Ukip is not going to win the election. What Ukip is going to do is win a number of MPs. 'And given no-one is going to have a majority we might just find ourselves in a position where nick Clegg was five years ago if we do that I'll do a better job than Nick Clegg did.'","Lib Dem leader takes up bet from Ukip candidate Keith Fraser on radio .

"A dating website which claims to cater for only the world's best looking single people has dumped more than 3,000 members for letting themselves go. The cull was conducted by BeautifulPeople.com of members whose looks they say no longer come up to the 'rigorous standards expected' of the 'exclusive community' and who now need to look for love elsewhere. One member, Tawnie Lynn, from LA who previously underwent a make-over herself so that she could win a place on the site says she is glad they are being so tough. Scroll down for video . Beautifulpeople.com has ditched 3,000 members who they felt did not match up to their standards. Tawnie Lynn (pictured) says if they did not make the cuts people would leave . Tawnie, who poses seductively in a bikini for her profile pictures said: 'If the management failed to maintain the quality of the site by polluting the gene pool, most members would leave. 'It would make Beautiful People just like every other dating site - full of the kind of people you wouldn't want to share an elevator with, let alone date.' The most often cited reason for members being removed from the site were piling on the pounds and 'graceless' ageing. More than 500 Brits, the second largest nationality, were among those axed. The people behind the website say they cull has sent a 'very clear message' to its good-looking members: 'you don't just need to be beautiful to join; you need to stay that way, or you are out.' The global website periodically reviews the suitability of all its members, to make sure that quality is maintained. Beautiful People is run by married couple Greg and Genevieve Hodge and was started in 2003. Since then there have been over 7.5million people rejected from the site. Tawnie was previously kicked off the site herself but had a make-over so she could stay, now she says that the site needs to keep their standards up .

'If their looks aren't up to our members' exacting standards and they do not secure a majority of positive votes, then their profiles are immediately removed.' Mrs Hodge said: 'This may sound harsh, and it is the most difficult part of managing the business. 'We take no pleasure in removing members, but it is a necessary evil in order to maintain the beautiful community and our prized business model.' Mr Hodge added: 'We regret the loss of any member, but the fact remains that our members demand the high standard of beauty be upheld. 'Letting unattractive people populate the site would compromise the very concept for which BeautifulPeople.com was founded.' He said that, as ruthless as it may sound, the website has been 'kind' in breaking the news to former members. Mr Hodge added: 'Each has received an email encouraging them to re-apply when they are back looking their best.

"An unassuming object has appeared on the shopping list of Chinese nouveau riches: Japanese toilet seats. According to People’s Daily, Chinese shoppers swarmed into stores in Japan during the Chinese New Year holidays and bought up all electronic toilet seats in stock. But while those who trade in luxury bathroom gadgets were celebrating in Japan, the demand for lavatories with 'built-in cheek warmers' has sparked condemnation in China - with even the prime minister entering the debate. Ambitious shoppers: Chinese tourists have been reported to buy up all toilet seats in Japan during the Chinese New Year holidays . Bottomless suitcases: Other hot items on their shopping list include rice and rice cookers . The furore was sparked when it was discovered that these toilet seats were made in China - but only available to Chinese people who are prepared to fly abroad. It’s been joked online that these seats went on a ‘self-guided tour to Japan just like their new owners’. Some Chinese tourists to Japan bought as many as five toilet seats without checking the price beforehand, wrote Wu Xiaobo, a renowned Chinese columnist, in one article. 'Toilet seat' has since become an internet buzzword in China. The other popular items Chinese shoppers buy in Japan are rice cookers and rice (imagine the weight of the luggage). 'As long as Chinese tour groups are here, toilet seats will go out of stock,' said a shopkeeper in Japan in Mr Wu’s article. Advanced toilet seats from brands such as Panasonic are regarded as the representation of Japanese technology in China and are a status symbol to own. Toilet seats are considered to be the typical symbol of advanced Japanese technology in China . Functions: From spray washing to blow drying to massaging, a Japanese toilet seats can do it all . A separate article lists 14 different functions a typical Japanese toilet seat has, which includes spray washing, blow drying, massaging and auto-deodorisation. These seats are reported to be compatible with all toilets. A sales representative from Panasonic told People’s Daily that such toilet seats are common in Japan and appear in public toilets too. He said Chinese buyers were not familiar with the product in the past few years, but once they found out the benefits and found the products affordable, they came to buy up all. Made in China: Some of the toilet seats in Japan are produced by Chinese factories which prompts public outcry over the motivation of purchasing it overseas . Eagle-eyed Chinese netizens have also found out that the packaging of some of the toilet seats were full of Chinese characters. They later found out that many seats were originally made in China in cities such as Hangzhou. This has prompted public outcry over the reason why they travelled overseas to buy homemade products. An experts on home electronics told People’s Daily that the only solution to restore Chinese shoppers’ confidence in buying in China is to eradicate low-quality made-in-China products once for all. Common scene: High-tech toilet seats can be found in many places in Japan, including public toilets . The buzzword also made its way to the ongoing Lianghui, the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In responding to the news, China’s premier Li Keqiang said a more tolerant attitude and rights of choice should be given to consumers and that Chinese companies should strive to produce similar products. 'At least, (this) can save the flight fare for the consumers,' said Mr Li.","Some shoppers buy as many as five without asking the price .

"He was knocked to the ground for just £5 by a mugger who thought he was a ‘soft touch’. But 93-year-old former amateur boxer Stanley Evans came out fighting yesterday – saying he wished he had given his attacker a right hook. The frail pensioner said he would have fought back if only the robber had launched the assault on his ‘good side’. Stanley Evans, 93, (pictured left) a former amateur boxer has said he wishes he had given his mugger, Soloman Bygraves (right) a right hook. Mr Evans was attacked waiting for the lift in his block of flats . Mr Evans (right) pictured boxing as a teenager - he went on to join the Home Guard . Mr Evans, who was attacked in the lobby of his block of flats as he returned from a shopping trip, said: ‘He went straight for me and pushed me against the wall. ‘He got me on the left hand side, which is not my good side. If it was, I would’ve given him a punch with my good arm.’ The OAP spoke as convicted robber Soloman Bygraves, 29, appeared in court over the ‘callous and sickening’ attack. He had offered to carry the frail pensioner’s shopping bags before knocking him to the floor as he lunged for his wallet. The pensioner said he would have fought back if only the robber had launched the assault on his ‘good side’ Mr Evans as a teenager (pictured left) and (right) in the Home Guard with a jewish refugee girl and dog . Mr Evans, a retired film cameraman, suffered injuries to his arm and shoulder and was left lying on the floor of his London tower block before raising the alarm. He said: ‘He was quite friendly and sympathetic and offered to carry my shopping for me. 'When I got to the door, I fumbled with my keys and felt him slip in behind me. ‘He said he knew someone on the second floor. I knew he was lying but I wasn’t going to oppose him. 'He got in the lift and then he attacked me. I was just lying there. I felt like a seal out of water, just flapping about, but eventually I got up and called the police.’ These shocking CCTV images show the moment Mr Evans was attacked as he waited for a lift . Bygraves is seen shoving the pensioner to the ground as he steals his wallet- which contained just £5 . The callous robber then casually walked from the scene, leaving Mr Evans stricken on the floor . The former assistant cameraman, who once worked with Richard Attenborough, Liz Taylor and Diana Dors, said he had previously lent Bygraves £10 when he said he needed money. But the robber returned to the Soho building and mugged Mr Evans on January 31 this year, rifling through his pockets after knocking him to the ground. Bachelor Mr Evans, who is originally from Cardigan, Wales, said he could not forgive Bygraves for the attack. ‘He was probably waiting for someone like me to come along,’ he said. ‘I was an easy touch. 'He was so friendly at the beginning but he changed all of a sudden and became aggressive. ‘The world’s full of evil people using other people to help themselves. 'He deserves to go to prison as it could have been worse. I could have slipped and knocked my head.’ Mr Evans says he had previously lent Bygraves £10 when he said he needed money . Mr Evans, originally from Cardigan in Wales, once worked as an assistant cameraman at Welwyn Studio . Mr Evans pictured with his first love, Gillis Evans . He said members of the public had already donated money and another mugging victim had set up an online fundraising campaign. Yesterday, homeless Bygraves admitted robbery at Southwark Crown Court via video link from prison. John Causer, defending, said his client had a lengthy criminal record – including three convictions for robbery – and had a background of ‘mental health and drug’ issues. Bygraves was remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing on April 13. Bygraves entered his guilty plea has been remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing next month .

"Lucious Lyon started losing his family - and almost his beloved Empire on Wednesday night's episode of the hit Fox show. The record mogul played by Terrence Howard at the start of the one-hour drama saw his fiancee Anika storm out of his life after being exposed for double crossing him with his rival record label boss Billy Baretti [Judd Nelson]. Lucious then increasingly pushed away his sons - ending with terrifying scenes as his eldest, Andre, had to be stretchered out of their offices and placed on a 48-hour psychiatric hold after freaking out after he stopped taking his bipolar medication. Wedding planning: Lucious Lyon and his fiancee were planning their wedding at the start of Wednesday's episode of the hit Fox show Empire . But as his personal life was crumbling around him, Lucious clearly had a far bigger worry - the fear that his record label could come crushing down. Even Anika [Grace Gealey] was shocked when he started begging her not to march away from him - but just so he could find out what Beretti was planning to do to try to destroy him, not to try to keep her. And Andre's melt-down also contained a whispered confrontation that hinted at heavy story lines to come. Kicked her out: Cookie exposed that Anika was double crossing Lucious and tossed her out of the mansion . After Lucious insisted he had yet to decide who would take over Empire after him, Andre put his head against his father and menacingly said: 'Piece of business advice from the Wharton education you paid so handsomely for: You pick the one who knows you're a murderer.' The latest episode, titled Unto The Breach, started with Lucious and Anika seemingly in domestic bliss planning their upcoming nuptials with a wedding planner. 'We'll have more doves, more champagne, more everything than anyone else they know', Lucious assured his fiancee as he nuzzled her ear in his mansion. Father and son: Andre got up close and personal to deliver a warning to his father . But their bliss was shattered when Cookie [Taraji P. Henson] and Porsha stormed in, and Cookie excitedly toldhim: 'She playin' you! She working with Baretti. 'While you up here planning weddings this b**** up here planning how to steal everything you got, which is everything I've got and I'm not gonna let that happen.' Anika stuttered at her first attempt at responding and then just stormed out, making business calls as she tried to steal away artists. Wedding off: Anika stormed off after Lucious was told of her betrayal . Lucious finally confronted her again outside, asking: 'Were you playing me with all those wedding plans just trying to buy time?' But Anika was having none of it: 'You are accusing me of betrayal? After all those women, all those lies?' She added: 'This is not even me. I am not a treacherous person Lucious but you - you! - you have twisted my love and made it some awful thing.' Lucious appeared to be at his weakest when he pleaded with her: 'I'm scared - I'm dying. You have to understand that when a man in my position says please it means something.' As she expected him to beg her to stay, he instead said: 'Please, I need to know what you planned with Baretti so I can fix this.' Heated conversation: Lucius and Anika angrily shouted at each other after she stormed out . 'Yeah, when a man like you says please it means something - it means you're lying,' she shouted back angrily. He then told her to listen because 'you're life could depend on it', then warned her: 'If you tell Baretti about my ALS, and my IPO goes down, your father's gonna be convicted of fraud.' As Baretti arrived in one of two SUVs to rescue Anika, Lucious made it clear that war had been declared with his rival. Warnings issued: Anike was warned that her father would be convicted of fraud if Empire was harmed . 'You started it. Now I'm gonna finish it,' he threatened him. As the rivalry between their labels heightened - with Baretti stealing more Empire artists - they soon had an even more chilling confrontation as their entourages meet outside of Teterboro airport. The music moguls exchanged slurs as security on each side pulled guns. Baretti pulled a pistol after Lucious told him: 'I got what I needed from her and I got rid of her. Oops, I think that I did that to you too,' referring to their closeness when Lucious started his musical career - and when Baretti lost his son to leukemia. Pistol out: Rival music mogul Billy Baretti at one point pulled a gun on Lucious . 'I used to pity you when you first lost your son,' he told his rival before they leave. 'You're beyond pity.' Lucious spent no time worrying about losing his fiancee - instead going straight into survival mode to make sure to save Empire. 'This morning Baretti tried to test our heart,' he told his staff in their 'war room'. 'Where I'm from, someone tried to test your heart you take their head off. Now the heart of Empire is its family. When a family is in crisis they put the differences aside and they come together. 'We have less than 24-hours to assure these streets that Empire is stronger now than it has ever been before. You draw blood.' War room: Lucious gathered his staff as they went to war with Creedmoor Entertainment . But throughout the crisis, he continually distanced his sons, especially Jamal after he came out as gay and accues him of 'prancing about with your little freak flag'. Jamal hit back at his dad insisting the only 'sexual proclivity' that has got them in trouble was 'the fact that you can't manage to simply keep it in your pants'. But Lucious's ignorance was so strong he continually ignored the fact that Jamal had opened the doors to signing British sensation Delphine, a far bigger star than the artists Lucious was fighting to maintain. That ended when Jamal put it all in business terms. 'You said that families put aside there differences,' he told his father. 'So put aside your played out homophobia, unless it's more important to you than Empire.' Fighting back: Jamal confronted his father over his homophobia as he joined the effort to save the label . Meanwhile, Hakeem showed he has learned some deceptive tricks from his family, confronting Anika in the street to beg her to stay with their family - but really just delaying her from a meeting to poach his ex, Tiana, with Cookie taking her place to keep her at Empire. Cookie also showed her dedication - taking part in a drinking competition just to keep another artist from leaving. Things appeared to be looking up by the end, with Lucious waking up and going along with Jamal to sign Delphine - and even taking over a nightclub piano to sing his old hit, You're So Beautiful, with his son and their new signing. Learning fast: Hakeem showed that he has picked up some of his family sly tricks . They were then joined mid-song by Hakeem, Cookie and Tiana, a clear sign that the initial crisis may have passed. The happy mood didn't last long as Lucious returned to his office - and saw Andre mid-meltdown, having to be restrained, given a shot and stretchered off, with his wife signing papers allowing a 48-hour psych hold. It came after he was earlier seen flushing away his medication - and had another meltdown when stuck in an elevator with his two brothers, ending when they tearfully hugged after singing Lean On Me together as they had as children. Freaking out: Andre had a meltdown in the elevator after going off his bipolar medication . Early numbers have shown that the ninth episode of the series marked the eighth week of growth in the ratings for the hip-hop centred programme. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Empire hit a viewership high of 14.2m viewers including a 5.7 rating among adults 18-49. The show has already surpassed The Big Bang Theory and is in position to end the season as the top-scripted show on all the national broadcast networks.","The series continued it's upward trend as the latest episode hit it's eighth week of growth .

"An armed robbery of  an 18-wheeler truck transporting bars of gold from Florida to Massachusetts was most likely an inside job, according to police. The $4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards  said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over. But Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip from Bridgewater, Massachusetts on I-95. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of heist . Suspects: Woodard shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger - there are three suspects altogether . White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate . In the latest account of events, one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and this is why the driver pulled over. However, in an earlier description the guards,  employed by Miami-based company, TransValue Inc. said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop. The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground. They then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold. Woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations. 'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,' a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC. 'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added. Search: Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $4million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Above, deputies investigate a wooded area near the road . Location: The men 'ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs gold' Cone: This photo is of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back . 'It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. 'The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.' Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case. Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC. Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police. He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck. Wilson County Sheriff's Deputies investigate an area near Interstate 95 in Wilson, North Carolina, on Monday . Investigation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. Neither of the guards was injured during the 'very rare incident', TransValue said . A reported 275lbs of gold were stolen and silver was also being carried in the truck, which was stopped near mile marker 114 on the highway. Locks on the back of the truck were sawed off, according to WITN. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. A reported 275lbs of gold were stolen, though it is not known which form the truck's precious metal took (file photo) The metal was owned by Republic Metals Corporation in Opalocka, Florida, according to a search warrant. TransValue, which specializes in transporting valuable goods and money between financial centers, keeps goods they move insured for up to $100million. A $50,000 reward is on offer for information leading to an arrest. Shortly after the heist confused drivers told 911 dispatchers that they saw uniformed drivers run into the North Carolina highway with their hands bound, motioning for help, according to recordings.","Investigators say there are different accounts about the heist .

"Country singer Glen Campbell's two oldest children have launched a court fight to take medical and financial decisions away from his wife of 32 years. The move has emerged days after Kim Campbell, whose husband has late-stage Alzheimer's, was forced to stand in for 78-year-old as he was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars. Now it has been made clear how deeply the singer's two oldest children, Debby Campbell-Cloyd and Travis Campbell, are unhappy with the arrangement. Scroll down for video . Frail: Country music legend Glen Campbell is now the subject of a court battle between his wife of 32 years and his two eldest children, who say she is isolating him from other family members as he battles Alzheimer's . The pair filed a court petition in January, saying Kim Campbell is keeping their father 'secluded from the rest of the family' which has been 'prohibited from participating in his care and/or treatment.' The petition claims that Kim Campbell is not providing her husband with needed toiletries and clothing, not visiting him regularly and possibly mishandling his finances. It says several of his eight children - the three youngest of which were with Kim - are not on his list of allowed visitors. And it alleges that Kim Campbell has allowed her husband to be interviewed and filmed at the facility, even though his disease has progressed to the point where that is inappropriate. The petition to a Nashville court concludes by asking a judge to appoint conservators and a guardian to protect Glen Campbell's interests. Standing in: Kim Campbell, pictured second from left with  director James Keach, producer Trevor Albert, songwriter Julian Raymond and guests at this year's Oscars, where the singer was nominated for Best Song . Health: Glen Campbell revealed he had Alzheimer's in 2011 but has played hundreds of shows since . The 78-year-old Country Music Hall of Fame member is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and living at a Nashville long-term care facility. His daughter had already criticised Mrs Campbell for moving him into the facility - but she insisted it was the best thing for the aging legend. Mrs Campbell said: 'It is crushingly sad to see him afflicted with Alzheimer's but indulging those feelings does not help him. 'I am his wife and no one wants him home more than me but I must do what is in his best interest.' When questioned by the Associated Press Kim Campbell referred questions about the petition to her attorney, Bill Harbison, who said he could not comment because the judge has placed the petition under seal. Glen Campbell revealed he had Alzheimer's disease in 2011, but he went on to record two albums and play more than 150 concerts. Family bond: Glen Campbell and his daughter Debbie, then 17, at Heathrow Airport in 1975 . At the time, Kim Campbell said the tour was a way to help her husband combat the brain-ravaging disease and spend time with family members who made up his band and traveled with him. He also starred in a documentary about life with Alzheimer's, Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me. Last month, he won a Grammy for his song I'm Not Gonna Miss You, which plays at the conclusion of the documentary. The song also was nominated for an Oscar. Mrs Campbell stood in for him at the ceremony, telling reporters on the red carpet: 'I'm not sure if he's really aware but he will be at his own little Oscar party tonight. 'It would be lovely to go back and let him hold one. It's just hard for him to understand. The Best Song gong went to rap artist Common and R&B star John Legend for Glory, the anthem from Selma.","Petition filed in Nashville court by singer's children Debby and Travis .

"One of the oldest human brains ever to be discovered was probably preserved for more than 2,000 years thanks to mud, archaeologists claim. The intact Iron Age organ was discovered inside a decapitated skull in York seven years ago and since then experts have conducted tests to explain how the tissue could have stood the test of time. Tests have revealed that the brain and other remains are 2,600 years old and have survived because the head was buried in a sealed clay pit devoid of oxygen, soon after its owner’s death. The oldest human brain ever to be discovered, was probably preserved for over 2,000 years thanks to mud, archaeologists claim. The intact organ (pictured) was discovered inside a decapitated skull in York seven years ago and since then experts have conducted tests to explain how the tissue could survive . In 2009, archaeologists from York Archaeological Trust uncovered a skull with the jaw and two vertebrae still attached to it, in Heslington, York. The skull was found face-down in a pit without any evidence of what had happened to the rest of the body. At first, archaeologists thought they had found a normal skull and it was not until the bones were cleaned that they came across 'something loose' inside. Rachel Cubitt, the Collection Projects Officer said: ‘I peered through the hole at the base of the skull to investigate and to my surprise saw a quantity of bright yellow spongy material. ‘It was unlike anything I had seen before.’ An archaeologist at the University of Bradford confirmed the tissue was brain and experts from York Hospital’s Mortuary they were able to remove the top of the skull in order to reveal the astonishingly well-preserved human brain. The skull (pictured) was found face-down in a pit without any evidence of what had happened to the rest of the body. In this image it is still covered in mud, protecting the contents inside . Archaeologists first thought the skull was unremarkable, but upon closer examination, saw the 'bright yellow spongy material' which turned out to be a brain.  Here, Dr O'Conner examines the remains . Experts can't be certain but think that the delicate brain tissue survived the ravages of time because of a mixture of a sealed clay pit and fats and proteins linking together. They think that the head was cut from the man’s body almost immediately after he was killed and buried in a pit dug in wet clay-rich ground. This environment provided sealed, oxygen-free burial conditions. While over time, the skin, hair and flesh of the skull rotted away, the fats and proteins of the brain tissue linked together to form a mass of large complex molecules. This resulted in the brain shrinking, but it also preserved its shape and many microscopic features only found in brain tissue, the surmise. As there was no new oxygen in the brain, and no movement, it was protected and preserved. They have now carbon dated the jaw bone to confirm the man probably lived in the 6th century BC. An examination of the teeth and skull revealed he was between 26 and 45 years old when he died. It appears that he was first hit hard on the neck, which was then severed with a small sharp knife, according to marks on the vertebrae, but experts can only guess why the man died such a violent death. There has previously been a suggestion that he was hanged, but experts have largely ruled out his head being used as a trophy – which was a grim practice in Iron Age societies – because there are no signs of preservation or smoking. Speaking two years ago, Sonia O'Connor, research fellow in archaeological sciences at the University of Bradford, said: 'The hydrated state of the brain and the lack of evidence for putrefaction suggests that burial, in the fine-grained, anoxic sediments of the pit, occurred very rapidly after death. Scientists said there was no trace on the brain of the usual preservation methods such as embalming or smoking. This x-ray shows the position of the shrunken brain inside the skull . Speaking two years ago, Sonia O'Connor, research fellow in archaeological sciences at the University of Bradford, said: 'The hydrated state of the brain (pictured) and the lack of evidence for putrefaction suggests that burial, in the fine-grained, anoxic sediments of the pit, occurred very rapidly after death' 'This is a distinctive and unusual sequence of events, and could be taken as an explanation for the exceptional brain preservation.' However, the larger mystery is how his brain was preserved naturally, when bodies buried in the ground typically rot because of a mixture of water, oxygen, as well as a temperature allowing bacteria to thrive. When one or more of these factors is missing, preservation can occur. In the case of the Heslington Brain, the outside of the head rotted as normal, but the inside was preserved. Experts believe the head was cut from the man’s body almost immediately after he was killed and buried in a pit dug in wet clay-rich ground. This environment provided sealed, oxygen-free burial conditions. In 2009, archaeologists from York Archaeological Trust uncovered the skull with the jaw and two vertebrae still attached to it, in Heslington, York, (marked on this map) The skull was found face-down in a pit without any evidence of what had happened to the rest of the body. This image shows archaeologists sifting through the muddy pit at the site near the University of York where the brain was found . While over time, the skin, hair and flesh of the skull rotted away, the fats and proteins of the brain tissue linked together to form a mass of large complex molecules. This resulted in the brain shrinking, but it also preserved its shape and many microscopic features only found in brain tissue, they explained. As there was no new oxygen in the brain and no movement, it was protected and preserved, allowing scientists to study it today. Speaking two years ago, Sonia O'Connor, research fellow in archaeological sciences at the University of Bradford, said: 'It is rare to be able to suggest the cause of death for skeletonised human remains of archaeological origin. 'The preservation of the brain in otherwise skeletonised remains is even more astonishing but not unique. 'This is the most thorough investigation ever undertaken of a brain found in a buried skeleton and has allowed us to begin to really understand why a brain can survive thousands of years after all the other soft tissues have decayed.'","Brain was found inside a severed skull buried in Heslington, York, in 2009 .

"The Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch a banned documentary which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. India's Daughter was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack. The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday. But it was dropped by NDTV following a ban on the film by the Indian government, and the BBC brought forward its screening to last night, citing a strong public interest. Scroll down for video . 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it . Today India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it. 'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.' The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India on sites such as YouTube. Today the victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think. The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'. Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame . 'Everyone should watch the film,' he said. 'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?' The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India. 'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.' Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012. Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. Yet many still hold the firm belief that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after ""doing her"", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted: 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night. Film-maker Leslee Udwin, an award-winner who produced the 1999 hit East is East, said: 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it' Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. 'About 20 per cent of girls are good.' The views, which have prompted horror around the world, are not exclusive to the girl's attacker. The rapists' own defence lawyer ML Sharma told the documentary: 'We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman.' Home Minister Rajnath Singh said of the film: 'Under no circumstances should this be telecast' A second defence lawyer, AP Singh, said if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'. The exact reasons for the government's ban were initially mired in confusion. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament yesterday that the government sought the ban because Singh's comments were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'. One government minister, M Venkaiah Naidu, called it a 'conspiracy to defame India'. There were heated questions over how the documentary crew gained permission to interview the convicted rapist amid concerns he was being given a platform. Spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the New Delhi police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film's 'objectionable content' could cause public disorder. Yet campaigners criticised the government for appearing more worried about the country's reputation than about the dangers women face. 'Banning this movie is not the answer,' said Anu Agha, an independent MP. 'We have to confront the issue that men in India do not respect women and any time there is a rape, blame is put on the woman.' Film-maker Ms Udwin said: 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it.'

"NASCAR driver Kurt Busch will not face criminal charges after his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll claimed he grabbed her by the throat and slammed her head into a wall three times. But the state attorney general's office has now said it could not establish 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that Busch committed a crime during the September incident. Last month Busch was indefinitely suspended from NASCAR after Driscoll was granted a 'protection from abuse' order from the Delaware Family Court. Scroll down for video . NASCAR driver Kurt Busch will not face criminal charges after his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll claimed he grabbed her by the throat and slammed her head into a wall three times . Busch and Driscoll attend court in December. State prosecutors said there was not enough evidence to establish 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that Busch committed a crime during the September incident . Busch has lost two rounds of appeals for his reinstatement and has missed the first two races of the season, but officials said he will be following their recommended guidelines to be eligible in the future. His attorney Jim Liguori said Busch knew 'all along' he was going to be exonerated and that Driscoll tried to destroy the racecar driver's image in the press. 'But the truth wins out,' he said. 'The truth is its own defense.' Driscoll's attorney Carolyn McNeice said they were disappointed with the state attorney general's decision, but that it only made the no-contact order from the family court 'that much more important'. Under the order, Busch is not allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition, must undergo evaluation for 'mental health problems related to anger control', and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll - with the exception of NASCAR races and related events - for one year. Driscoll,  37, testified that she and her son went to Busch's motorhome at the Dover International Speedway the night of the assault after receiving a slew of worrying texts from the racecar driver that seemed to indicate he was depressed. The couple had broken up a week before the alleged assault in September following a fight after one of Busch's races. Driscoll said after she entered the home, her ex-boyfriend accused her of 'having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him'. Then, she said in documents filed in November, he jumped up, grabbed her face and smashed her head three times against the wall next to the bed before she ran to a nearby bus to put an ice pack on her head and neck. Last month Busch was indefinitely suspended from NASCAR after Driscoll was granted a 'protection from abuse' order from the Delaware Family Court . Under the order, Busch is not allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll - with the exception of NASCAR races and related events - for one year . Driscoll said she suffered severe pain, difficulty breathing and bruising on her neck following the assault. Busch testified that he was having a spiritual experience after watching Brad Pitt's 'Seven Years In Tibet' and was naked and sobbing on the floor when Driscoll showed up at his home. He said he only touched Driscoll when he cupped her cheeks with his hand so he could look her in the eye when he told her again to leave his home. A Dover police detective testified that Busch had said Driscoll's head then 'tapped' the wall. In his testimony, Busch said he could never have laid a hand on Driscoll because she was a trained assassin and a 'badass' who told him she had killed people before. He told the court, 'I know that she could take me down at any moment', and said his former girlfriend had once shown him images of dead bodies with gunshot wounds, as well as a scar from a stab wound on her stomach. Driscoll, a narcotics and homeland security consultant for a defense consulting firm in Washington, D.C., called the allegations 'ludicrous' and said Busch had ripped them from a screenplay she wrote. Conflicting testimony came not only from the former couple, but from supposed witnesses who had seen Driscoll following the fight. One of Driscoll's neighbors testified that she saw marks on the woman's face and neck hours after the alleged assault. NASCAR chaplain Nick Terry said he and his wife saw Driscoll 'immediately after the alleged assault' and did not see any marks on her. A Family Court commissioner agreed and said Driscoll had presented false testimony that conflicted with what Terry saw. But the court judge said he didn't believe Driscoll's 'false testimony' amounted to 'perjury or intentional falsehood'. The judge also said that Bush appeared to have snapped during a 'situational' event that he was unable to cope with and thus could not control his 'tendency to act out violently in response to stress'. Known as 'the Outlaw' in racing circles, Busch has a reputation for his temper. Busch's attorneys have asked the Family Court commissioner to re-open the hearing so that they can present testimony from three acquaintances of Driscoll who have come forward to contradict statements she made about her relationship with the driver. In court Driscoll said that Terry was being threatened and bribed by Busch's attorneys, claims he denies. Busch was fined $50,000 by NASCAR in 2011 after a fan filmed him verbally abusing an ESPN reporter and posted the video on YouTube, and was suspended again for a race in 2012 after verbally attacking another reporter.

"Rare heart condition: Sarah Brautigam (pictured), of Doncaster, has been close to death dozens of times . A canoeist with a rare heart condition has been pronounced clinically dead 36 times in a year. Sarah Brautigam, 21, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, has been close to death dozens of times due to an affliction which makes her heart stop beating - and said that each time her hearing is the last thing to go. The former Great Britain canoeist saw her life turned upside down four years ago when she was diagnosed with a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Miss Brautigam, who wants to be a burlesque dancer, has rapid palpitations that cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to fall to what doctors record as clinically dead. On occasion she has to wait up to 30 minutes for her heart to refill with blood. She also suffers joint hypermobility syndrome, which means her joints are more prone to injury and dislocation. The two combined resulted in her visiting A&E 64 times in the same year. But Miss Brautigam insisted that she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back. She said: ‘There are signs before it happens - I’ll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then I feel as though I’m falling asleep. ‘I can hear everything around me and feel as though I’m trying to shout but nothing is coming out. They say when you die your hearing is the last thing to go and that’s been my experience. ‘After an attack I’ll wake up and my chest will be killing and I’m really tired.’ Miss Brautigam said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life. She cannot be given CPR until her heart has re-filled with blood. She said: ‘When it happens paramedics try and do anything to inflict pain to try and shock me into coming back to life. 'A lot of the time I’ll wake up with big bruises. On one occasion they ripped an acrylic nail off but that still didn’t make me flinch.’ In hospital: A combination of her postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and joint hypermobility syndrome have resulted in Miss Brautiga visiting A&E 64 times in the same year . Miss Brautigam was a canoeing fanatic who made it to the GB squad and was training six days a week when she was diagnosed and her dreams 'came crashing down'. She was told she could no longer take part in the sport and her dreams of joining the Navy were also left in tatters. Even getting a job and driving were affected by the condition. Miss Brautigam added: ‘I had 10 years of being out every weekend canoeing and being so active and it all came crashing down. I piled on the weight because I couldn’t exercise and was really upset. ‘I can’t even work at the minute because I would need a job that could be very flexible. Then I was told I couldn’t drive, it was like everything was being taken away from me. Medical device: Miss Brautigam is pictured with the remote she has to trigger when she has an episode . Helping hand: A previous implantable loop recorder which saved 21-year-old Miss Brautigam from death . ‘I lost a lot of friends, in fact I only have one friend from school. Everyone seemed to be too busy with their own lives to bother with me when I was diagnosed.’ Miss Brautigam was pronounced clinically dead 36 times in 2012 but has since began burlesque chair dancing, which she said ‘has given me a new lease of life’. She added: ‘I made so many friends and everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I didn’t think I’d be able to do anything like his with my illness but everyone looks out for me at the class. I’ve only passed out once since I started. 'I’m determined not to let this beat me, joining the group has given me a life back. ‘It might kill me but at least I’d die happy - for me. I’d rather live to the full rather than live longer and be wrapped up in cotton wool – it’s all about quality of life.'","Sarah Brautigam, of Doncaster, has been close to death dozens of times .

"This is the picture that nearly cost a teenager his life when he plunged 2,500ft down a mountain after stepping back to fit a bit more scenery in his shot. Jack Fox, 14, from Southport, fell on the last run of the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps during half-term. He suffered ice burns to his arms but miraculously survived the ordeal relatively unhurt. The costly picture: Jack Fox took this snap the moment before he fell on the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps . Jack's injuries: Despite bouncing off rocks and ice during the fall he only needed treatment for ice burns on his arms after his jacket was pushed up to his elbows during the plunge . Jack's iPhone 4S, containing the last picture he took, also survived the fall. He said: 'The battery goes quite quickly now, but there is not a crack on it. After I had stopped falling I just saw it there and tried to turn it on but it wouldn't. Then, when I got to the hospital and it had dried out, it turned on.' Mum Amanda, 41, said Jack was disappointed the phone still worked. Jack had hoped the accident would land him a phone upgrade but his old mobile survived . She said: 'Jack has been after an iPhone 6 for ages and when it wouldn't turn on, he thought he was going to get a new one. But we are glad it came on because that was when he first spoke to me. 'My husband had been told that he had been airlifted off, but we didn't know about any injuries. His phone coming back on was like it was meant to be.' Jack said: 'I was facing forwards taking pictures of the scenery, and I was about to put my phone away when I started to slip and lose my footing. I was shouting for help as I was falling – but then I couldn't because I had snow in my mouth.' Most of Jack's horrified friends feared the worst as he tumbled down the mountain. Amanda added: 'Jack said when he got to the bottom of the mountain he knew he hadn't broken anything as everything moved.' At the top of the mountain, Jack said a lot of people had taken their helmets off to take photos. His mum Amanda said: 'Luckily he hadn't, because his helmet was all smashed. Kids think helmets are not cool but Jack has now realised that they are.' 'It was cracked and bits had fallen off it,' said Jack, 'As I was going down I was trying to stop myself by digging my boots in, but it flipped me over and hit my head – it was a scary experience and was the first time I've ever thought I was going to die.' He added: 'You do need a helmet. It has saved my life.' Reunited: The teenager (centre) is embraced by his mother Amanda (right) with his brother Ryan (left) After being airlifted off the mountain near Salzburg, in Austria, Jack was later treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital for severe ice burns. He said: 'As I fell, my jacket pushed up to my elbows and I got to one point when I started to slow down and I moved over on to one arm because the other one was hurting. That is when the left arm went bad.' Amanda said Jack's left arm was 'quite a mess'. She added: 'He is lucky to be here. It could have been a totally different story. 'He is here and can tell the tale, which is the important thing.' Jack feared the snap had cost him his life and said for the first time ever he thought he was going to die during the experience .","Jack Fox, 14, fell 2,500ft while taking this holiday picture in the Alps .

"Jodi Arias was sentenced to life behind bars today after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'. The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty. Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April. Scroll Down for Video . Impassive: Jodi Arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in Phoenix on Thursday morning . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . Agony: Tanisha Sorenson becomes inconsolable after hearing that Jodi Arias has escaped the death penalty . Arias' mother, Sandra, broke down too and received a hug from a friend. It is the second time a jury has failed to decide on life or death for Arias, 34, and under Arizona state law she cannot be tried again - a sore disappointment for the prosecution who have always sought execution. Indeed, it was revealed afterwards that jurors who deadlocked on punishment for convicted murderer Jodi Arias say they were split 11-1 in favor of the death penalty and that they tried unsuccessfully to get the lone dissenter, a woman, kicked off the panel. Fourteen jurors, including at least one alternate and one woman removed from the panel earlier, talked to reporters Thursday after the verdict. None of them would reveal their names. Many of the jurors said Arias lacked remorse and some said she tried to manipulate them. Jurors also said they believed the holdout was biased and that the woman even had an agenda. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Realization: Sorenson raises her hand to her face as she breaks down in tears after Jodi Arias verdict was announced . The Alexander family released a statement to say they are 'saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' 'Obviously, as I said, during the closing arguments, during the opening statements, and several times during the trial, that the events of June 4, 2008 were a tragedy, and the no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness. I don't think today's victory will repair any sadness or change anything but we hope it can begin the closure process for all those who were affected by that tragedy. Thank you,' Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi told reporters Thursday. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis ""Greg"" Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' The controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which Arias was found guilty of in 2013. Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. In closing statements, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi called for Arias' life to be spared, describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood. Prosecutor Juan Martinez accused Arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty. On Tuesday, the jury of eight women and four men were told by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to try harder to come to a decision, after apparently deadlocking. Arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after Stephens denied the defendant's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments. The original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony. Grief stricken:Sorenson cries as she leaves the court house with family and friends on Thursday in Phoenix . Tears for her brother: Family members of victim Travis Alexander wept when the judge said jurors couldn't reach a decision. They sobbed as they left the courtroom . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the Jodi Arias sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation.","Judge Sherry Stephens was told of impasse on Thursday morning .

"Apple and Google are making a play to dominate your car’s dashboard, but they’re not the only firms working on the technology. At this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, chip maker Qualcomm is showcasing a Maserati kitted out with optical and ultrasonic sensors, touchscreen displays and rear-view cameras. And with 4G technology built in, the concept car doesn’t need a phone to get online so can double up as a Wi-Fi hotspot for all passengers. The Maserati (pictured) is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and uses Qualcomm technology to power its sensors, camera and on-board modems. It has 4G technology built in, so doesn't need a phone to get online, and this means it can double up as a Wi-Fi hotspot for all passengers . Like with Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, the Maserati concept has a display that can be used with voice control, touch and hand gestures. By default, the screen displays map info, controls, music playback, and phone calls but it also splits into three to show ‘Now Playing’ along the bottom, maps on the top left and media on the top right. Although the system can sync with smartphones and tablets - and uses a screen mirroring technology called MirrorLink - it is more advanced than Apple and Google’s systems because it doesn’t need one to work. Instead it comes with built-in apps and 4G. Multiple phones and tablets can then connect to this 4G network to share the car’s ‘Wi-Fi’. Qualcomm’s vice president for product management Nakul Duggal told MailOnline it is also developing a system to project phone displays over USB to the head unit. The Maserati (pictured) is a concept but Qualcomm’s vice president for product management Nakul Duggal said it showcases the potential for connected cars and believes these kinds of systems will be in cars soon . The concept has a display that can be used with voice control, touch and hand gestures. By default, the screen displays map info, car controls (left), music playback, and recent calls. The system syncs with phones using screen mirroring technology called MirrorLink (right) but also comes with its own mobile network . The Maserati is also kitted out  cameras that provide an almost 360-degree view of the car and warn of impending collisions, obstacles and more. The rear-view camera can additionally be used for parking assist features (pictured). This technology runs on BlackBerry's QNX car platform . Earlier this week Ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style. Called MyFord Mobile, it also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house. The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars. It specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage. But Ford spokesman Abraham Phillip told MailOnline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range. Elsewhere, the car features a WiPower wireless charging surface. The sensor and camera setup provides an almost 360-degree view of the car and warns of impending collisions, obstacles and more. Plus a ‘digital instrument cluster’ - or screen behind the wheel - shows the driver information from all the car’s systems at a glance. Details about fuel, speed and any technical faults are updated in real-time, including an 8-inch image from the rear-view parking assist camera to show the road behind. And advanced map data plots the road ahead - even if it is beyond the view of the driver. This technology runs on the QNX car platform which is already running in more than 20 million vehicles. At the same time, a network of sensors work together to boost driver safety. These include a light detection and ranging (Lidar) sensor that shows a forward-facing collision warnings up to 164ft (50 metres). A set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror spot pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles in the blind spots, helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns. A set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror (pictured) spot pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles in the blind spots, helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns . A ‘digital instrument cluster’ - or screen behind the wheel - shows the driver information from all the car’s systems at a glance plus navigation details (pictured). These details are updated in real-time and advanced map data plots the road ahead - even if it is beyond the view of the driver . The mirrors show real-time video footage to offer a wide field of view, plus a warning bar that goes from green (shown) to red when an obstacle approaches . And the mirrors themselves show real-time video footage offering a wider field of view than traditional mirrors. Meanwhile, the rear-view camera, with ultrasonic proximity sensors, provides an unobstructed view of what’s coming up from behind. And when a warning is made it appears on a strip of LEDs on the windshield. This means, for example, that if a driver starts indicating right but it isn’t safe to move over - if a cyclist is approaching for example, or they’re too close to a car - the strip will glow red. If it’s safe to move over or change lanes, the light glows green. A similar system is used on the wing mirrors to warn of nearby obstacles. The car is a concept but Mr Duggal said it showcases the potential for connected cars and believes these kinds of sensors and systems will be in vehicles in the near future. Apple firm first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2013. At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay (Apple Maps on CarPlay pictured) Elsewhere Google used its  annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop.

"A have-a-go-hero was so badly beaten and covered in blood after he challenged a car thief that his family thought he had been shot. Danny Mason, 37, was repeatedly punched in the face and left with a fractured cheek, broken nose and cut lip after he approached the would-be-thief in Blackburn, Lancashire. He had just left a family party at around 11.45pm on Saturday when he tried to stop the would-be-thief from stealing a number of cars. The 37-year-old, who now lives in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was found slumped unconscious on the ground by family members and is now in so much pain that he cannot sleep or work. Danny Mason, 37, was repeatedly punched in the face and left with a fractured cheek, broken nose and cut lip after challenging a car thief . He said: 'It all happened so quickly that I did not have a chance to think about it. 'Looking back, I thought I was doing the right thing by speaking to this man, but now I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep or work.' He was taken by ambulance to Royal Preston Hospital before being transferred to the facial injury unit at Royal Bolton Hospital. Police have now released CCTV images of a white man around 6ft tall who they would like to speak to in connection with the incident. Mr Mason's sister Sue Bannister said that the family have been 'deeply shocked and upset' by the attack and asked anyone with information to come forward. She said: 'We had come to Blackburn for a family party and were having a really good time until the incident happened. 'Danny had gone outside for a cigarette when he spotted a man who looked like he was trying to break into vehicles. 'He spoke to him and asked him what he was doing and the man just started attacking him. 'A neighbour spotted what was happening and the man took off. He said that he had been punching him over and over. The 37-year-old (before the attack, left) was found slumped unconscious on the ground by family members and is now in so much pain that he cannot sleep or work (after the attack, right) Police described the attacker as white, between 6ft and 6ft 2in tall, of an average to medium build with short light brown or dark blonde hair . 'Our cousin came outside to see where Danny was as he had been a long time and saw him slumped unconscious on the ground. 'He has been in a lot of pain and the whole family have been left deeply shocked and upset by the incident. 'We really want anyone who has any information to come forward in order to try and catch whoever is responsible.' Councillor Jackie Slater, who represents the Fernhurst ward, described the attacker as an 'evil thug' and said she was appalled by the assault. 'My thoughts are with Mr Mason and his family. It was such a brave thing for him to do and he has to be applauded in a lot of ways. 'It is just unfortunate that in today's society, it is not a wise thing to do. 'I hope the police catch whoever did this quickly.' He had just left a family party at around 11.45pm on Saturday when he approached the would-be thief and was viciously attacked in Parkes Way, Blackburn . Mr Mason's sister Sue Bannister said that the family have been 'deeply shocked and upset' by the attack . Police described the attacker as white, between 6ft and 6ft 2in tall, of an average to medium build with short light brown or dark blonde hair. Detective Inspector Eric Halford of East CID said: 'We are keen to identify the man in the CCTV images as we would like to speak to him as part of our on-going enquiries. 'I would appeal to anyone with information about the incident to contact us as soon as possible. We are determined to find whoever is responsible for this vicious assault.' Anyone with information about the incident which happened at 11.45pm on Saturday should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1567 of February 28 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Danny Mason, 37, challenged car thief .

"A police community support officer has been left devastated after arriving at the scene of a fatal crash and discovering the 10-year-old victim was her nephew. PCSO Lisa Crocker, 39, was on duty when she was called to the collision involving her young nephew Samuel Crocker in Crediton, Devon. The 'generous and kind' schoolboy was knocked down as he walked into the town centre to visit a friend on Saturday afternoon. He was taken to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter but later died from his injuries. His family said a 'bright light had been extinguished'. PCSO Lisa Crocker, 39 (right), was on duty when she was called to the collision involving her young nephew Samuel, 10 (left), who was knocked down while walking to meet a friend in Crediton, Devon, on Saturday . Cameron Trivett, 24, of Crediton, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision. He will appear at Exeter Crown Court later this month. It has now emerged that Mrs Crocker, who is part of Devon and Cornwall Police's neighbourhood team in Crediton, arrived at the scene to discover the victim was her brother's son. Chief Inspector Matt Lawler said: 'Clearly this is an absolute tragedy for the entire family. 'No-one in the force knew the connection until Lisa arrived at the scene and recognised Samuel. 'There has been a great deal of support locally for Lisa and many local people have been asking if she was personally connected to the incident. 'In order to allow her to focus on supporting her family, Lisa has asked us to confirm her involvement and thereby end the speculation. Mrs Crocker, 39, (pictured) was unaware her young nephew was involved in the collision until she arrived at the scene. The youngster later died in hospital . 'While she has been inundated with messages, Lisa would like everyone to focus on Samuel, not on her connection to the events of last Saturday.' Emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at about 1.30pm on Saturday after Samuel was struck by the white Vauxhall Combo van. Following his death, his family led an outpouring of tributes to him. In a statement, they said: 'On Saturday afternoon our life was turned upside down when our darling Samuel was knocked down while on his way to visit his friend. 'Later that night the bright light that was Samuel was extinguished. 'We all miss our little 'mole' so much and can't begin to imagine how we move on from the devastating situation we are in now. 'Someone so small has left a massive hole that can never be filled, but he will always be remembered for his cheeky, fun-loving nature and we are grateful to have had him in our lives, albeit for such a short time.' A book of condolence has since been opened at Landscore Primary School where Samuel was a pupil. Gary Read, the school's headteacher, said: 'Samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest, attentive, generous, loyal and kind. 'To be taken from his family and friends in this way feels incomprehensible.' Hundreds of people also attended a candle lit vigil at Holy Cross Church on Monday in memory of the youngster. Reverend Nigel Guthrie, Rector of Crediton, said: 'We wanted to give people a chance to express their feelings about what happened to Samuel. Samuel was walking to meet a friend in Crediton, Devon (pictured) when the collision occurred. Cameron Trivett, 24, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision . 'It's a huge shock to the whole community as the family are so well-known and loved. 'There has been a very large response and we hope it can help bring everyone together in the wake of it.' The Bishop of Crediton, Rt. Reverend Nick McKinnel, added: 'This is terribly sad news and my heart goes out to the family of this young boy and to his friends at school.' Terry Keen, who lives next-door to the Crocker family, also paid tribute. He said: 'They are a wonderful, local family who have lived here for some time. He was a terrific young boy. 'We would often see him playing out the back, practising his basketball. He was getting very good at it. 'He went to Landscore School with his older brother. We do not know much about what happened.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the coroner had been informed of the death.

"A wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the DNA and languages of modern Europeans. This is according to a study that found evidence of this Stone Age migration by analysing DNA of 69 people who lived across Europe between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago. Among the shifts in the genetic make-up of ancient Europeans they found that DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany. Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe . There are two main theories as to how Indo-European languages spread in Europe. The first is the Anatolian hypothesis, which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East (currently Turkey) brought it to Europe. The Kurgan hypothesis, meanwhile, proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the Black and Caspian Sea. This theory suggests their language spread throughout Europe after the invention of wheeled vehicles, from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago. The Yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the Black and Aral Seas. This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers, led by David Reich of Harvard Medical School. Such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the DNA but ancient cultures as well. Although genes can't determine what people spoke, the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of Indo-European tongues. Indo-European languages include more than 400 tongues, from modern languages such as English and Polish to ancient languages like Hittite and Sanskrit. Basque, which is spoken in south-west France and northern Spain, is not Indo-European, and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely, according to the BBC. Linguists have long debated whether Indo-European languages came to Europe with farmers migrating from the Middle East or some other group, such as the Yamnaya. Previously, researchers had believed that Indo-European language spread some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the Neolithic Revolution. Farmers from Anatolia travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. This was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today Ukraine and Russia. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe . As well as genetic evidence, researchers point to the fact that many Indo-European languages share words for things like axles, harness poles, and the wheel. These devices were invented long after the Neolithic Revolution began in Europe. 'Major language replacements are thought to require large-scale migration,' said the authors of the study, which was published Monday by the journal Nature. 'Our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the Indo-European languages in Europe.' Andrew Garrett, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study, said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for Indo-European expansion. 'It fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle,' said Garrett.","Study looked at DNA of Europeans who lived  8,000 and 3,000 years ago .

"The decision not to press charges over the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during an SAS training exercise was correct, prosecutors have confirmed. Edward Maher, Craig Roberts and James Dunsby died of heat exhaustion on the Brecon Beacons  after a 40-mile hike as part of a gruelling training exercise in July 2013. The Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing charges of gross negligence manslaughter but found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'. Corporal James Dunsby was among three soldiers that died after taking part in a training exercise on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, when temperatures reached 29C . Lance Corporal Edward Maher, 31, (left) was taken to hospital and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, (right) died on the mountainside . Prosecutors announced its initial decision not to press charges in July last year, but it is understood they were asked to re-examine the case by two of the soldiers' families. They were among 100 men taking part in a four-week trial for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists on Pen Y Fan, when temperatures hit 29C on July 13, 2013 - one of the hottest days of the year. Lance Corporal Roberts, 24, of Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, was pronounced dead on the mountainside, while Lance Corporal Maher and Corporal Dunsby, both 31, were taken to hospital. L/Cpl Maher died three hours later in Merthyr Tydfil's Prince Charles Hospital, while Cpl Dunsby, from Bath, was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and died on July 30. L/Cpl Roberts, who had served with the TA for more than five years and nicknamed 'CJ' by family, was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment. He is believed to have served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan and with United Nations peacekeepers in Cyprus. They were taking part in a gruelling selection process for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists on Pen Y Fan . L/Cpl Maher had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy lines. Cpl Dunsby was a member of the Army Reserves (The Royal Yeomanry). The Brecon Beacons are a notoriously inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both regular units and the special forces. A spokesman for the prosecution service said: 'The CPS Appeals and Review Unit has completed a review of the case relating to the tragic deaths of soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. 'This review was requested under our Victims' Right to Review scheme. 'Case reviews completed under the Victims' Right to Review scheme involve a completely independent assessment of the available evidence against the evidential and public interest standards set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. 'In this case, our review concluded that the original decision not to charge any individual in respect of this matter was correct. There is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction in this case. 'The families involved have been informed of this decision and the reasons for it. Our thoughts remain with them.' A large amount of detailed material, including reports provided by expert witnesses, was considered during the original review of the evidence, the CPS said. It is believed that two of the soldiers' families asked for the charges of gross negligence manslaughter to be reviewed. The CPS found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction' A Dyfed Powys Police spokesperson said: 'Following a joint police and Health and Safety Executive investigation into the events leading to the tragic deaths of three soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, files of evidence were submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service for review, who concluded that that there is insufficient evidence to support charges of gross negligence manslaughter. 'All families have been informed of the decision and police will continue to support them. 'Police will continue to support the Health and Safety Executive who continue with their investigation into the deaths. A file will be prepared for the coroner.' An inquest in to the deaths of soldiers was delayed after senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, ruled last September that a full inquest could not take place until after the CPS review of the deaths. The inquest, expected to last for up to three weeks, was rescheduled to begin on June 1. It is expected to hear from soldiers who were manning checkpoints at the time of the training exercise and other military personnel involved in its management.","Edward Maher, Craig Roberts and James Dunsby died after overheating .

"Within weeks of Samsung releasing its waterproof Galaxy S5 last year, Apple filed a patent that took its rival’s technology a step further. Called ‘Methods for shielding electronic components from moisture’, the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside. Individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone, even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing. The patent said protective cases have ‘little value’ once water has entered the phone and details a system of adding ‘hydrophobic coating to components’. This coating would be applied using plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition in which thin films are applied from a gas, or vapour, states to a solid state . Samsung’s Galaxy S5 is IP67 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset. The firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and added a waterproof coating inside the headphone jack. IP stands for Ingress Protection, and was created by the International Electrotechnical Commission. It is used to classify how much a coating provides protection from 'intrusion or immersion'. The rating is typically followed by two numbers - the first is the level of dust resistance, the second is water resistance. Dust resistance ranges from zero to six, and water resistance ranges from zero to nine. If an X is included, the device doesn't offer a classified rating for that substance. A rating of seven on the waterproof scale means: 'Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water (up to one metre).' As a result, the S5 can be submerged for up to half an hour at around 3ft (0.9 metres). However its latest models, the S6 and S6 Edge, have removed this feature. Apple’s patent would instead involve coating individual components inside a phone, and within an already assembled circuit board. This coating would be applied using a method called plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD), which desposits thin films from gas, or vapour, states to solid states. The plasma is typically created between two electrodes where reacting gases are added to form the solid. In the case of the fully-assembled circuit board and its electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields, Apple proposes perforating ‘portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics.’ The coating would be applied through these perforations, and the board-to-board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal. The filing said: ‘People who rely on electronic devices tend to carry them along to locations in which the electronic devices can incur damage. ‘One form of damage that can be detrimental to an electronic device is water damage. Samsung’s S5 (pictured) is IP67 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset. The firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and waterproof coating inside the headphone jack. As a result, the S5 can be submerged for up to 30 minutes at 3ft (0.9 metres) In the case of the fully-assembled circuit boards and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields, Apple proposes perforating ‘portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics.’ The coating would be applied through these perforations, and the board-to-board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal . ‘Many electronic devices are susceptible to water damage because they are not fully sealed and include various openings for charging, connecting peripherals, and inputting and outputting audio. ‘While bulky cases have had a certain amount of success at mitigating water entry through the aforementioned openings, a protective case is of little or no value once water has entered a device housing. ‘When water enters into the device housing, some high powered components and wiring are often subject to damage even when a minimal amount of water enters the electronic device. ‘In particular, corrosion of soldered components is quite common and can lead to device failure.’ Meanwhile the board-to-board connectors inside the phones (components illustrated left) would be covered by a silicone seal. Despite adding waterproof features to its Galaxy S5, Samsung removed this for its latest Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge handsets unviled at Mobile World Congress on Sunday (right)","The patent was filed in the US in March 2014 and awarded today .

"A horse-drawn beach hut in Cornwall has been placed on the market for the first time since it was purchased 92 years ago, and the price has certainly increased. Holidaymakers who want to snap up the holiday chalet will have to splash out £80,000 for the property - compared to just £10 spent on the hut back in 1924. The beach hut, named Roskear, was bought by the Truan family from Camborne in 1924, when farmers were still using horses to pull their ploughs. Scroll down for video . The Cornish beach hut is expected to fetch around £80,000 when it goes up for sale, and has a whole lot of history behind it . Electricity was added in the 1950s, and despite the cramped nature of the hut, there are plenty of facilities . It might be small, but a bit like Doctor Who's Tardis, appearances can be deceptive for inside it has two bedrooms, a hall and a toilet extension . Every year on April 1, the Truans, along with many other local families, could get permission to simply hitch up a horse and tow their chalet on to the seaside dunes at Riviere Towans in St Ives Bay for the summer season. In 1926 the chalet was the first to be given a permanent fixed and anchored position in the dunes where it remains today. Now the little hut, the oldest still existing on Riviere Towans, is up for sale and is expected to fetch at least £80,000. A reminder of a bygone age, it is largely untouched from the time it was purchased for £10 in 1924, say selling agents Driftwood Properties. It might be small, but a bit like Doctor Who's Tardis, appearances can be deceptive for inside it has two bedrooms, a hall and a toilet extension. The beach hut, named Roskear, was bought by the Truan family from Camborne in 1924 . While it may need a bit of touch-up work here and there, the beach hut offers a real escape from everyday life . There is enough room to add your own personal touches to the beach hut should you wish . Over the years the Truans added extensions for sleeping accommodation and toilet facilities, adding electricity in the 1950s - another first - and cladding a decade later. During the war years, trenches were dug outside its door, and later more chalets were built around it and larger holiday companies arrived in St Ives Bay. Original features dating back to 1924 include the doors, windows, a Belfast sink and a meat safe. It has a living room, two bedrooms and an attached outside toilet cubicle. The Truan family added extensions for sleeping accommodation and toilet facilities, adding electricity in the 1950s . Audrey Chivers, daughter of John Truan, who bought the property the day she was born, inherited it as a wedding gift. She died last year. Family friend John Prela, who was charged with selling the hut, said: 'John Truan worked for Camborne Railway Station and was transferred to Reading but they would come down several times a year. 'All different relatives used to come down. It slept up to eight people - I don't know where they all went! 'For about 30 years Audrey and her husband would come down in April and stay till September. She loved her hut.' The property was enjoyed by all the Truan family, and their extended relatives, and is now described as 'the most original property on the park' by the estate agents . Ben Downton, of Driftwood Properties, which is selling the chalet, told MailOnline Travel: 'It has got to be the most original property on the park. 'I think it would be for a specific kind of person, but we expect there to be a good deal of interest. 'I think there is massive potential to extend the property, on that park this is happening all the time. 'We would expect the new owner to want to develop and modify the hut, but it would be nice if some of the history and core features of the property can remain.'","The beach hut, named Roskear, was bought by the Truan family from Camborne in 1924 .

"Nick Clegg launched a bizarre class-war attack on David Cameron yesterday as plans for election TV debates descended into acrimony and farce. The Deputy Prime Minister accused his boss of a ‘Downton Abbey attitude’ after he brought an end to years of negotiations on the terms of debates. Mr Cameron claimed he was ‘unblocking the logjam’ by agreeing to take part in one contest featuring seven party leaders but ruling out two further debates. He attacked broadcasters for ‘the mess’ they had made of plans for debates and accused them of wanting to talk about no other issues. However, even the single seven-way debate is in doubt after the BBC said Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party – the fourth largest in Parliament – would not be allowed to take part. The DUP is threatening a judicial review. David Cameron tonight insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders' debates . Mr Cameron insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders' debates after he was accused of treating the public with 'lofty pomposity' by telling TV bosses how the debates are going to happen. Labour aides pointed out that the Prime Minister had mocked Gordon Brown for initially refusing to take part in three debates in 2010. At Prime Minister’s Questions in 2008, Mr Cameron also suggested Mr Brown was ‘frightened’ of TV debates. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that the Prime Minister was 'cowering from the public', after Downing Street rejected broadcasters' proposals for three TV debates during the election campaign and made a 'final offer' of a single 90-minute show featuring at least seven party leaders to take place before the official start of the campaign on March 30. Mr Miliband added the Prime Minister was ‘running away from the face-to-face debate with me that he said he wanted and that the public deserve’. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said that he was willing to take the PM's place in the one-on-one debate with Mr Miliband if Mr Cameron refused to turn up for the clash, scheduled to be shown on Sky News and Channel 4 on April 30 - exactly a week before the May 7 election. He was accused of treating the public like Downton Abbey's Lord Grantham by telling TV bosses how the debates are going to happen . Mr Clegg said he was 'bemused by the lofty pomposity of the Conservatives' adding: 'They're behaving as if they're ordering a drink in the drawing room of Downton Abbey. 'It's not for the Conservatives to start telling people how these debates are going to happen, they belong to the British people. 'If David Cameron is too important or too busy to bother to actually defend the record of this government in a debate with Ed Miliband then, yeah, I'll offer up myself to do it instead.' But Labour dismissed the suggestion as 'ridiculous', suggesting that the Deputy Prime Minister should instead debate with their deputy leader Harriet Harman. If the PM did not turn up, Mr Miliband was ready to subject himself to a solo grilling by presenter Jeremy Paxman and a studio audience, said Labour campaign chair Lucy Powell. Ukip's Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron was trying to 'sabotage' the debates. Mr Clegg said he was 'bemused by the lofty pomposity of the Conservatives' adding: 'They're behaving as if they're ordering a drink in the drawing room of Downton Abbey' The Electoral Reform Society said it would be a 'national embarrassment' if the debates did not go ahead. In a process of negotiations stretching over months, Mr Cameron has previously raised objections to broadcasters' proposals, first on the grounds that they excluded the Greens, and then that the Democratic Unionist Party had been left out. Labour have accused the Tories of working behind the scenes to scupper the live broadcasts - first tried in a UK general election in 2010. Speaking during a visit to Staffordshire, the Prime Minister insisted he had been 'completely consistent' on the debates, saying: 'I haven't put hurdles in the way, the broadcasters came up with a series of proposals that other people realised were flawed. 'I am unblocking the log jam and saying let's have this seven-cornered debate and get on with it before the campaign. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that the Prime Minister was 'cowering from the public' 'Then we can actually do what needs to be done, which is to get round the country during the election campaign.' He rejected claims that staging the debates before party manifestos are published would limit the opportunity to scrutinise their plans, insisting: 'Everyone knows what the Conservative proposals are and the Labour proposals are, and the other parties can speak for themselves.' Mr Miliband said he was ready to debate the Prime Minister 'any time, any place, anywhere'. 'It is now clear that David Cameron is ducking the debate with me. He is cowering from the public,' said Mr Miliband. 'The British people deserve this debate. I'll debate him any time, any place, anywhere. He should stop ducking and weaving and name the date.' The Labour leader's comment echoed Mr Cameron's own 2007 challenge to Gordon Brown to face him in a TV debate, when he said: 'Any time, anywhere. I will even pay for the taxi to take him (Gordon Brown) to the studio. In fact, I'll even drive the cab.' Meanwhile, Mr Clegg said he would happily take his coalition partner's place and spare the nation from an 'Ed Miliband monologue'. Mr Cameron's latest terms for taking part have been set out in a letter from his director of communications, Craig Oliver, to Sue Inglish, chairwoman of the broadcasters' leaders' debates committee. In a joint statement, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky said they would respond to the Conservatives' proposal in due course. As well as the April 30 two-leader clash, the broadcasters have proposed seven-way debates also involving Mr Clegg and the leaders of Ukip, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party on ITV on April 2 and BBC on April 16. Nigel Farage accused the Prime Minister of having 'sabotaged the whole thing' while Nick Clegg said he was prepared to take the Prime Minster's place in a one-to-one debate against Ed Miliband . Asked if he thought Mr Cameron was running scared, Mr Farage said: 'Yes, he is. He has sabotaged the whole thing. 'He has now said he will do one debate, but he will do it before the proper campaign starts, so it's not going to be a proper debate.' The Ukip leader told ITV's Loose Women: 'I suspect, had it been a four-headed debate, there are one or two conversations I wanted to have with the Prime Minister that I don't think he would have been able to answer. I suspect that's why they have sabotaged it.' A spokesman for the Greens said: 'Not only is Cameron's announcement cowardly but it also shows his contempt for the electorate. People want to see a set of debates between all major party leaders, yet the Prime Minister is clearly scared of scrutiny.' Electoral Reform Society chief executive Katie Ghose said: 'This unseemly squabble over TV debates has to end now. 'I have to say to the Prime Minister that if he really thinks that these exchanges once a week are a substitute for a proper television debate, then he is even more out of touch than I thought … I have to ask him: What on earth is he frightened of?' - David Cameron To Gordon Brown at PMQs, 2008 . 'What I have done is to unblock the logjam the broadcasters helped to create and said let’s get on and have the debate that I think matters the most, which is the one that gives everybody a say, and let’s get on with it before the campaign. So hopefully, by putting forward this proposal for a debate, we will actually see one take place.' - David Cameron, 2015 . 'Compared to other advanced democracies around the world, Britain has been extremely late to the party when it comes to TV debates. It would be a national embarrassment if we end up being the first to leave that party as well. 'No TV debates in 2015 would be a backward step in terms of our democratic development.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: 'David Cameron is clearly running scared of having to answer for his Government's record of failure and incompetence - and this arrogance in trying to lay down the law is all about getting out of debates, not taking part. 'I will debate him any time, anywhere, on any number of occasions. However we have accepted the broadcasters' proposals, and believe we should stick with that, rather than allow a Tory Prime Minister to dictate the terms of debate.' The BBC Trust said it had rejected the DUP's appeal to be included in the debates format. A panel said there was no evidence the corporation had made an 'error in principle' or acted unfairly by refusing the party's claim. A DUP spokesman said it was prepared to launch a judicial review of the decision if any debates were going ahead. Broadcasters are still considering going ahead with three debates, and believe they may have legal grounds to ‘empty-chair’ the Tories on the basis that they turned down an invitation, but rules requiring political balance will make such a programme difficult.","Downing Street has rejected broadcasters' proposals for three TV debates .

"THE CHAPS' VIEW - by Quentin Letts . One of the great mysteries of mankind — and I mean mankind — may have been solved. Scientists from King’s College London have measured 15,000 penises in 16 countries. This work has allowed them, after feeding the findings into computers, making boffinish statistical adjustments, twiddling knobs and squinting at graphs, to announce an average size for chaps’ undercarriage. That, in turn, has been seized on as having psychological significance. Apparently, we men are now less likely to have a nervous collapse about our own shortcomings. Quentin says that Michelangelo’s 16th century statue of the naked David (pictured), can sometimes be a source of fun for being a 'tiddler' We have not been told the logistical ins and out, if that is the term, of this ground-breaking global operation. The research demanded at least two readings (one at ease, one standing to quivering attention) for each handsome specimen. The mind boggles. Were the laboratory assistants who took the data dreary, middle-aged men speaking in the monotones of E. L. Wisty (the know-it-all creation of the comedian Peter Cook)? Or were they busty, sultry ladies with husky larynxes and widening eyes? To what level of exactitude were the measurements taken? What instruments were employed — school rulers, tape measures, laser micrometers or (ouch) cold, industrial calipers? While we’re about it, exactly how, in 16 languages, do you say ‘sorry to interrupt your busy day, monsieur, but would you mind dropping your drawers so that my pouting assistant Miss Droop can take the bore and length of your old man’? But back to the conclusions. Dr David Veale, the fine body of a man who led the psychiatrists from King’s, has announced that the average length of an erect penis is 5.16 in. Typically, it sounds more in Continental centimetres — 13.12 cm. The figure shrivels to 3.6 in when the member is in a state of genial repose. If we can place this in context, the late Sue Townsend’s spotty schoolboy character Adrian Mole fretted that his ‘thing’ rose to a mere 4.3 in, something that gave the poor lad hours of angst, while the once accepted norm, at least of myth, was nearly half as much again — the old ‘six inches of proud British manhood’. Michelangelo’s 16th century statue of the naked David, sometimes a source of fun for being a tiddler, may not have been so unusual after all. You may think it peculiar that I dwell on these matters, not least for what I am about to say: I seriously doubt that many blokes are much concerned by these readings. I do not mean that they will not have been interested and amused by yesterday’s news reports. Indeed, I bet most of us, when we read the Mail, discreetly did some thumbwork to try to work out what 5.16 in looks like, and then had a rough gander below decks to see how we fared by comparison. But will men have been psychologically affected? Does size matter to us as it is said to matter, particularly to our wives and girlfriends? Or is this yet another attempt by the medical/psychiatric world to create collywobbles where previously few existed? Dr Veale said his findings would ‘help doctors reassure the large majority of men that the size of their penis is in the normal range’. He said he would ‘use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position’. Another doctor disclosed that some men, poor fellows, suffer from something called body dysmorphic disorder, which can cause a person to have a distorted view of how he looks. Apparently, this is a serious source of anxiety to some gents, who become convinced they are laughably tiny. One does not wish to downplay the gravity of body dysmorphic disorder, which no doubt exists. One naturally has sympathy with those who may worry that they have been given short commons in the trouser department by the Almighty. But is this perhaps a case of publicly employed scientists going to expensive lengths to investigate a not particularly widespread problem? Is male appendage size quite possibly a false hoo-hah created by society? It has been said that the late Dame Elizabeth Taylor (pictured) had physical difficulty with one of her early husbands, so enormous was his manhood . There may be extreme cases of smallness or vastness, where it can create disharmony between men and their sexual partners. The late Dame Elizabeth Taylor had physical difficulty with one of her early husbands, so enormous was his manhood. Wide as a beer can, apparently. In the rock music world there was a falling out between Rolling Stones Richards and Jagger after Keith made public remarks about Mick being a little chap. And what are we to make of the vast codpieces that bed-hopping Henry VIII had made for his suits of armour? Real need or a figment of Henry Tudor’s imagination? Only his six wives could have told us. But does any of that truly justify a research operation of the size (dread word) just carried out by these London medics? There was a famous falling out between Mick Jagger (pictured) and fellow Rolling Stone, Keith Richards, after Keith made remarks about Mick's manhood . And anyway, are women really so concerned with measurements? Is there not something more important than size — namely, love? For millennia, the male member has occupied a curious place. Immediate riposte: Yes, mate, between your legs! But please, let the class pipe down for a few moments. In ancient civilisation, penises were considered to have mythical significance linked to male power and eternity. At Pompeii, there is an ancient Roman mural of the fertility god Priapus walking around with the most tremendous todger, as long as a trombone. Well played, that man. Closer to home we have the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, cut into a hillside with his John Thomas riding high. The eternity aspect of this symbolism is easily explained and the ability to sire offspring could bestow power, for the more sons you had, the better you were able to defend your household. But those were primitive concerns. The correlation between penis size and power in the modern era, even 200 years ago, is less persuasive. Napoleon was notoriously small. For this information, we can thank a cruel pathologist who allegedly removed his ‘item’ after his death and pickled it in formaldehyde. It was later auctioned in Paris. Heaven knows if the object in that jar, indeed, belonged to the 19th century French emperor, but it was used against him posthumously as a way of diminishing his reputation. How trivial and cheap, to mock a great man after his death in such a fashion. Even if he was on the ‘petit’ side, Bonaparte was a mighty general with unarguable power. From the sublime to the ridiculous, that silly oaf John Prescott suffered something similar when he was caught having an affair with his typist a few years ago. I recall a front page of the Daily Mirror that featured an illustration of a cocktail sausage. Poor old Prescott. However, the mockery did not do his reputation harm. If anything, it made the one-time deputy Prime Minister more popular. Footballer, David Beckham (pictured) has also been the subject of much speculation thanks to the numerous photos of him advertising underwear . Last year, a statue of peacocking footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was unveiled in Madeira. Necks were clutched and faces fanned when it was first shown to the public because the shorts featured an implausibly large bulge. Our own David Beckham has been the subject of speculation after his numerous poses in underpant adverts. He claims he has never stuffed socks down his front to create a bigger impression. But if he did, would it matter? Shrinks might say so, but I am unconvinced. Men know there is not much they can really do to alter the equipment fate has given them. Women can increase or decrease the size of their busts by visiting a plastic surgeon, but medical science offers men much less chance to vary their dimensions. Similarly, despite all those baldness cure adverts, there is not much they can do to stop their hairlines receding. You just have to accept it and get on with life. A statue of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) was unveiled in Madeira last year and caused public shock because the shorts featured an implausibly large bulge . Adrian Mole may have agonised about this subject, but he was created by a woman. I simply don’t believe, even in this age of explicit advertisements with endless commercial emphasis on sex, that blokes give much thought to their willy size. I attended boarding schools in the Seventies and barely recall anyone mentioning how well hung they were. We did have one boy who was nicknamed ‘Chopper’, but that was because he was a notoriously dirty tackler on the football field. Did we size up one another in the communal showers? Not that I recall. Mind you, I have always been short-sighted and in showers you naturally have to remove your spectacles. If I had been interested in seeing how Sproggins Minor measured up, then I would have had to peer down quite close for a proper gawp, and I’m not sure that would have been appreciated. For all I know, Sproggins Minor is now running a bank and earning millions of pounds a year — a big player one way or another.","Scientists from King’s College measured 15,000 penises in 16 countries .

"Professor Christina Slade, Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University, spent £42,000 in a year on luxury flights across the world, it has been revealed . A £300,000-a-year university vice-chancellor spent £42,000 in a year on luxury flights across the world, it has been revealed. Professor Christina Slade, vice-chancellor of Bath Spa University, used her expense account to fly business class in order to 'drum up interest' around the globe. She is of a number of well-paid university Vice-Chancellors who used expenses accounts for luxury travel. Her expenses were revealed in a study by the University and College Union (UCU), which has criticised the 'murky world' of university pay. UCU asked every university in the country to reveal how much their top staff were paid and how much they claimed in expenses in 2013-14. The top paid Vice-Chancellor is Neil Gorman, of Nottingham Trent University, who raked in a staggering £623,000 including bonuses. Prof Slade said that her travel bill is essential for drumming up interest among foreign students and that travelling business class is 'the norm for Vice-Chancellors'. The travel bill is on top of her £299,000-a-year salary, which rose 16 per cent last year. UCU spokesman Nick Varney said: 'It's a chaotic state of affairs where some vice chancellors spend thousands on travel or enjoy large pay rises. 'This lifts the lid on the inconsistent and arbitrary nature of senior pay and perks in our universities and shines a light on the murky world of the shadowy remuneration committees who sign off these deals. 'We need a far more transparent system that allows for proper scrutiny of the spending at the top and the rationale behind pay rises.' Figures obtained from 150 institutions under the Freedom of Information Act show the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290. A total of 18 vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by more than 10 per cent, the lecturers’ union calculated. A spokesperson for Bath Spa University said Prof Slade had gone abroad to recruit international students after falling numbers put courses and jobs at risk. 'The increase in international students has replaced the student numbers removed in the wake of an earlier decision on fees. 'There have been no staff redundancies as a result of downsizing at Bath Spa University, making it unique in its part of the sector. 'Without the international students, redundancies would have been necessary. Prof Slade, vice-chancellor of Bath Spa University, used her expense account to fly business class in order to 'drum up interest' around the globe.She is of a number of well-paid university Vice-Chancellors who used expenses account for luxury travel . 'This international development has involved an enormous amount of travel, often at short notice and generally long haul. 'Business class is the norm for V-Cs. Professor Slade has not travelled first class.' UCU asked 155 UK universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors’ pay packages, including benefits and pensions, as well as money spent on air fares, hotel accommodation and personal expenses, for the year ending July 31 last year. Around 16 per cent- 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information. The findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290 based on data from 150 institutions. The average expenditure on flights for university leaders, with information from 128 universities, was £9,705.75. The most was spent by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which paid out £59,811.14 on flights for director Professor Craig Calhoun. Overall just over two-thirds of air fares were for first or business class, UCU said, according to data from 114 universities. The average spend on hotel accommodation during 2013/14 was £3,202.05, based on data from 122 institutions. The most was spent by Glasgow Caledonian University for Professor Pamela Gillies at £27,271.13. The average received by vice-chancellors in personal expenses was £3,112.61, according to information gathered from 125 universities. The highest amount - £33,526 - was given to Professor Gavin Henderson of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.","Professor Christina Slade, is Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University .

"RAY DAVIES: A COMPLICATED LIFE . by Johnny Rogan . (Bodley Head £25) The exhilarating finale of a musical called Sunny Afternoon currently offers one of the great nightly spectacles in London’s so-called ‘theatreland’, as hundreds of mostly middle-aged punters leap or, in some cases, creak to their feet, jigging and jiving to the music of The Kinks. Just a few weeks ago, I was one of them, and resolved as I left to learn more about the singular life of Ray Davies, the band’s brilliant but melancholic frontman, who wrote such timelessly wonderful hits as Waterloo Sunset, You Really Got Me, Lola and, indeed, Sunny Afternoon. Ray Davies (pictured) is the brilliant, but sometimes melancholic, frontman of The Kinks . Well, Johnny Rogan’s monumental biography has filled all the gaps in my knowledge of one of the men who made the Sixties swing (while simultaneously lampooning the Swinging Sixties with his mickey-take of Carnaby Street dandies, Dedicated Follower Of Fashion). Gloriously rousing though it is, the stage show hardly does justice to the enigma that is Raymond Douglas Davies. Mercurial, introspective, sometimes cruel and spectacularly, almost sociopathically, mean with money, but also sensitive, principled and capable of great kindness, Davies is above all one of the creative geniuses of our age. Those who are or have been close to him, including his brother Dave and the singer Chrissie Hynde (the mother of one of his four daughters), might not always echo the sentiment, but we are lucky to have him. Davies was born in 1944 in Muswell Hill, North London, on the night of an air raid. It was a suitably explosive beginning. He was the seventh child in a boisterous, tight-knit, working-class family but, more significantly, the first son. One of the pivotal episodes in shaping his complex personality came before he was three years old, when baby David arrived, rudely undermining his status. Much later, Dave’s musicianship would also be central to the success of The Kinks, but he was resented by Ray from day one. Indeed, David still remembers a childhood mock fight in which he thought he’d accidentally knocked his older brother unconscious. He bent over him, whispering, ‘Are you OK?’, only for Ray to spring up and punch him hard in the face. ‘I felt the pleasure that I’d knocked him over, then concern that I’d hurt him,’ says Dave now, ‘but all he really wanted was to get back at me. It’s symbolic of our whole relationship, really.’ While Dave grew up happy and outgoing, Ray was troubled and solitary and was even sent to a child therapist, which can’t have been usual in working-class North London during the Fifties. The sudden death of much-loved older sister Rene compounded his torment. But he found refuge in music, especially in the records of the American blues singer Big Bill Broonzy, a discovery he credits with changing his life. With Dave, and schoolfriends Pete Quaife and John Start, he formed the Ray Davies Quartet. He auditioned a cocky boy from the year below him at William Grimshaw Secondary Modern, but the lad’s voice was so raspy that Start’s mother wouldn’t let them rehearse in her house. His name was Rod Stewart. While young Stewart forged his own path towards superstardom, the Ray Davies Quartet, shedding Start and adding drummer Mick Avory, mutated into the Boll-Weevils, the Ravens and, finally, The Kinks. Pop group 'The Kinks' (pictured in 1964) left to right: Pete Quaife, Ray Davies, Mick Avory and Dave Davies . There are various contradictory explanations for the famous name, but the best guess is simply that ‘kinky’ was a fashionable adjective in the early Sixties. Rogan implies that inspiration may even have struck thanks to a Mail cartoon of a girl praying beside her bed, captioned: ‘All I want for Christmas is a Beatle, failing that, a pair of kinky boots . . .’ Similarly uncertain are the precise origins of The Kinks’s first hit, You Really Got Me, in the summer of 1964. But it reached number one and made Davies a star. Not that success tempered his extraordinary tight-fistedness. He would habitually hold open pub doors for his bandmates to enter — not out of politeness, but to ensure he was last to the bar. And the band’s manager, Larry Page, was present on the day Ray’s first wife, Rasa, who he’d met when she was a schoolgirl attending one of their gigs, pleaded with him, ‘Ray, what about that coat?’ He replied, ‘No, you can’t have it . . . it’s a lot of money.’ She continued begging him, pointing out how bitterly cold it was outside, until finally he relented, and told their driver to take them to Sketchley’s. She wasn’t asking for a new coat. He just hadn’t wanted to pay the dry-cleaning bill. the Ray Davies Quartet, mutated into the Boll-Weevils, the Ravens and, finally, The Kinks (pictured in 1964) Ray’s parsimony is one of the reasons why the story of The Kinks is a tale of epic in-fighting, as well as marvellous music. But only one of the reasons. Besides, he was merely a spectator at their most notorious scrap when, during a show in Cardiff in 1965, his brother Dave spat at Avory, and Avory hit Dave with a cymbal so hard that many there thought they’d witnessed a murder. Four decades later, Davies himself was almost the victim of a murder, when he was shot in New Orleans while chasing a mugger who’d stolen his then-girlfriend’s handbag. It was yet another traumatic incident in what has been, to quote this book’s barely adequate sub-title, a complicated life. But shining through the violence, the personality clashes, the litigation with former management, the volatile relationships with women, even a mental breakdown, are the songs — none of them more enduringly haunting than Waterloo Sunset. Ray Davies (far left) wrote timelessly wonderful hits such as Waterloo Sunset, You Really Got Me, Lola and Sunny Afternoon . His voice might not be what it was, but Davies was the perfect choice, and it was the perfect song, to close the London Olympics three years ago. Yet this book reveals it was, at first, tentatively titled Liverpool Sunset, and he intended it to represent the death of Merseybeat, which he felt was presaged by the Beatles moving away from their roots and buying big houses in Surrey and St John’s Wood. That wasn’t for Davies. He stayed in or near Muswell Hill and he’s still there now, with wispier hair but the same familiar, gap-toothed smile, which we might never have known had he had his teeth capped one afternoon in 1964. He was actually sitting in the dentist’s chair, the drill whirring, when he leapt up and left the room. If he was going to make it, he told himself, it would be through his songwriting, not his looks. It was a firm statement of artistic intent and still ‘the most important decision I’ve ever made’, insists the man who, happily for us, has never been a dedicated follower of anyone’s fashion but his own.","Ray Davies was the frontman of iconic band The Kinks .

"Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (£1.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea,  the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham . Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review:  'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. Dragons: Estate agent Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest .","Lucky new owner of the Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, will be neighbors with 350 magical characters .
The 38-acre property features figurines of Humpty Dumpty, Captain Hook and much, much more .

And all for not much more than the cost of a two bedroom flat in some of the world's most expensive cities ."
"This is the moment a tearful Chinese mother and her two daughters knelt down to beg forgiveness from the parents of a student who died while saving the two girls' lives. The youngsters, aged seven and nine, had gone with their mother Li Xiaoli at the end of last month to visit a man-made lake near the village of Xizhaolou in Qingfeng county, in central China's Henan province. But as they were playing on the side of the lake, the younger of the girls - named Chao - slipped and started to fall towards the water, and when her sister Liao went to grab her, she fell in as well. Li Xiaoli and her two daughters beg the parents of the man who died saving them for forgiveness . Meng Ruipeng drowned after rescuing the two girls pictured, but their mother failed to report it for fear of a compensation claim . Both girls were wearing winter coats and it was clear they would not survive long as they struggled to get back to the shore. The girl's mother, who was unable to swim herself, started screaming, alerting a nearby university student named Meng Ruipeng who ran over to help. Without thinking of his own safety, Meng jumped into the water to rescue the girls, The People's Daily reported. He managed to throw the youngest girl from the steep-sided quarry lake back onto the bank, plucking her from below the surface where she had started to sink, and then pushed the older girl towards the bank where she was grabbed by her mother and pulled to safety. Meng Ruipeng (pictured), 24, died dragging two young girls to safety from a man-made lake . But the intense cold and exertion had left the 24-year-old student so weakened that he sank below the surface seconds later and vanished from sight. Yet incredibly, instead of raising the alarm, the girls' mother had been terrified that she would end up in trouble and possibly a compensation claim from the boy's family, and had told the girls to say nothing. Instead, she had taken them home, dried them and changed their clothes, and acted as if nothing had happened. However, she did not realise that the drama had been watched by fishermen on the other side, who had raised the alarm with police. After divers investigated, they recovered the young man's body, and then started trying to work out if other people were involved in his death. That eventually led them to the girls and their mother Li Xiaoli, who had initially denied knowing anything about the tragedy but later admitted what she had done. So as the young man was being prepared for the funeral, she and her daughters turned up dressed in black together with all their savings, a total of 10,000RMB (£1,000), and offered it to the parents of the dead student to make amends. She said: 'I forced my girls to say nothing, it was my decision, and all the shame is mine. 'I offer you my apology and my tribute to your son who saved the lives of my two daughters.' After seeing the two children in tears alongside the mother, the parents of the dead boy accepted the apology. They also told them to keep the money, saying it would not bring back their son but their admission of what he had done at least restored honour to his death. Mourners lay wreaths at the funeral of 24-year-old student Meng Ruipeng, whose body was found by police . Mr Ruipeng's parents forgave the mother of the two girls and declined her offer of £1,000, saying her apology was enough to restore honour to their son's name .","Mother begs for forgiveness after failing to report man's death after rescue .

"Melbourne will be the most popular family holiday destination for Australians over the next two years, a new report has revealed. Travelling as a family can bring its own particular problems, but the survey by Roy Morgan Research shows that Melbourne has a little bit of everything to satisfy all needs. Melbourne topped the poll with 25% of families surveyed plumping for it. Its main attractions being culture, museums, sport and shopping for all ages. The Melbourne Cricket Ground has always been a great place for a family day out no matter what sport is played there . Surfer's Paradise comes in at second place as the most popular family place with its beaches being a real favourite . Theme parks, amusement arcades and endless sunshine also made Surfer's Paradise a good family destination . The Great Ocean Road area along with the likes of Torquay and Lorne came in fourth place in the survey . Surfers Paradise comes in second place. It has beaches, theme parks, amusement arcades and endless sunshine, and is another popular potential holiday destination among Australian families, 15% of whom say they’d like to visit.

Queensland won out with 46% of families saying they’d like to holiday there in the next two years, closely followed by Victoria on 45% and New South Wales on 43%. Thredbo/Perisher is the ski-spot with the most appeal for families as a potential holiday destination, with 54%. ‘Our latest findings reveal that the domestic destinations with particular appeal for families are those with plenty of scope for outdoor activity,' Angela Smith, Group Account Director, Roy Morgan Research, said. 'Whether it’s on the beach or a coastal drive, in a big city or at the snow. “Knowing what Australian families look for in a holiday spot and how their needs and expectations differ from those of other travellers allows destination marketers, tourism operators and travel agents keen to reach this lucrative market.' Smith also said that among overseas destinations Australian families are more likely to name as potential holiday spots tropical paradises such as Fiji, Bali and Hawaii. Sydney, and the likes of Circular Quay, put the city in third spot with holidaying families .","A report by Roy Morgan Research has shown that Melbourne is where families want to go over the next two years .

"Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz will release a book this summer designed to boost his political bona fides in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. 'A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Miracle of America' will go on sale June 30, joining a raft of other political books penned by other Republicans for the same reason. Cruz inked a deal with Broadside Books, a division of Harper Collins, last year for a reported $1.5 million advance. That would pale in comparison to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's $14 million contract, but signals the publishing industry's eagerness to cash in as political books become more like campaign commercials than memoirs. NOW AN AUTHOR: Sen. Ted Cruz, shown on March 2, will likely rail against executive overreach, open borders and the threat of a nuclear Iran in his book due out in June . DISAPPOINTING: Hillary Clinton's memoir made a giant splash in 2014 but sales were well below what her publisher expected for a $14 million advance . Cruz, a first-term lawmaker, told the Associated Press in a recent interview that in a time of 'extraordinary challenges' he wants to tell his story and share his message of free markets and constitutional liberties. 'Men and women are frustrated with career politicians in both parties who are not listening to them,' Cruz told the AP, adding that the themes of a possible White House candidacy are 'certainly reflected in this book.' Cruz, a favorite among tea party activists who has battled with Democrats and members of his own party, also said he wants to counter the 'caricatures' of the right as 'stupid,' 'evil' or 'crazy.' 'The image created in the mainstream media does not comply with the facts,' he said. He said that 'A Time for Truth' will include vignettes about Anwar Sadat, Elie Wiesel and others who 'had the courage'  to speak out even at risk to themselves, a theme he acknowledged can be found in a famous work by a future president, then-Sen. John F. Kennedy's 'Profiles In Courage.' The vignettes draw upon 'an aspect of what Kennedy did' in his book, Cruz said of 'Profiles in Courage,' a tribute to U.S. senators who took stands unpopular within their own party. A bipartisan field of possible 2016 candidates will have books on store shelves by the time any primary debates happen. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will unveil 'Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey' on May 5. Three weeks later Rand Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, will release 'Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America.' Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is waiting until October 6 to introduce 'A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.' A few GOP hopefuls have already put their political books out this year, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 'God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy' and Marco Rubio's 'American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone.' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker released 'Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge' in August 2014, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum published 'Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works' four months earlier. Carson, who made headlines this week for saying homosexuality is a 'choice' and pointing to prison life for evidence, is the most prolific writer among the likely Republican candidates with eight books to his name already, including four released by the Christian publisher Zondervan. COTTAGE INDUSTRY: By the time presidential primary debates begin, at least 10 likely candidates – including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee – will have their names on book jackets . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the fundraising standout among Republicans in the early going, published his most recent book, 'Immigration Wars,' in 2013. On the Democratic side, Clinton's 'Hard Choices' came out in the summer of 2014 to great fanfare but disappointing sales. At one point The Washington Post declared that it was 'bombing.' Her publisher, Simon & Schuster, printed 1 million copies but sold just 161,000 in the first three weeks, a critical marketing period, according to Neilsen BookScan. That number was still under a quarter-million by August. Elizabeth Warren, seen as a far-left alternative to Clinton if her star should fade, released her own book 'A Fighting Chance' in April 2014. Cruz's book is scheduled for a June 30 release . That book sold fewer than 72,000 copies in its first four months. It remains to be seen how Cruz's book will perform, but sales aren't the only motivation for politicians to become authors. The free publicity is one. Book-signing appearances can take on the flavor of campaign stump speeches, with publishers – not campaign coffers – often footing the bill. Cruz's campaign referred Daily Mail Online to Harper Collins for comment. A publicist at the company wouldn't comment on the content of the book, describing it as 'under embargo' and saying there would be no advance copies sent to reviewers before the book is finalized and printed. But the book's pre-order page on Amazon, which still describes it as 'unti' – for 'untitled' – includes a preview from the publisher. 'Liberals love to hate Ted Cruz,' it reads in part. 'The outspoken Texas Senator has a knack for getting under their skin.' 'Since his election to the Senate in 2012 he has refused to go along with the established way of doing business in Washington. As a result, he has become a voice for millions of Americans frustrated with governmental corruption and gridlock.'","Cruz says he wants to counter 'caricatures' of conservatives as 'stupid,' 'evil' or 'crazy'

"A £235,000 house collapsed into a pile of rubble after builders started to 'reconfigure' the inside of the property to split it into two homes. The property on Rodney Way, Romford collapsed at 6.20am on Tuesday leading the London Fire Brigade to evacuate surrounding residents because of fears of a potential gas leak. However, the two-storey property, which had been sold for £235,000 in August, had been undergoing major work as part of the redevelopment project. The two-bedroom end of terrace house was reduced to rubble after it collapsed on Tuesday morning . Builders had been stripping the interior of the house as part of the project shortly before the collapse . According to a planning application with the London Borough of Havering, permission had been granted to demolish an existing garage at the end-of-terrace site. Developers were also granted permission to build an extension at the side and to the rear of the site and reconfigure the interior of the existing house to create two, two-bedroom houses. The Health and Safety Executive confirmed it is aware of the situation and are investigating the cause of the collapse. The house was advertised as a 'two bedroom end terrace house with detached house and driveway to the side plot measuring 16ft width from the existing house with great potential to build to the side subject to planning permission.' According to the planning file, Dovetail Architects asked the council for permission for the 'demolition of existing garage and construction of a single, with part two storey rear extension and double storey side extension, reconfigeration of internal arrangement to create 2 x 2 bedroom dwelling both with private amenity and off-street car parking.' Dovetail Architects have not yet responded at the time of publication. Under the plan, builders were going to convert the end-of-terrace property, pictured, into two two-bedroom homes after demolishing the garage, right, and building an extension to the side of the site . London Fire Brigade was forced to evacuate houses within a 50-metre radius after a gas main was ruptured . An 80-year-old neighbour who witnessed the heavy German bombing of East London when she was a child said: 'It looks like something from the war - it could've been the Blitz. 'But unlike the war I didn't go climbing over the rubble like I would've done when I was a kid. 'Somehow I managed to sleep right through it too but it must've been a terrible noise.' Residents were evacuated and a 50 metre exclusion zone was put in place when the collapse fractured a gas supply. Romford firefighter Jason Frisby said: 'The house was under refurbishment and had been completely stripped out. 'Fortunately, it was unoccupied at the time it collapsed and no-one was injured. Had it collapsed when the builders working on the house were inside, they may not have been quite so lucky.' Structural engineers are now working to determine what caused the house to collapse. A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Lady Luck was shining in Romford earlier, a house collapsed and amazingly no-one was injured.'","The two-bedroom end of terrace house collapsed on Tuesday morning .

"Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson, 44, has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against Bill Cosby . A Bill Cosby accuser, 'Jane Doe No.2', has decided to reveal her identity after finding the strength to finally go public about the alleged attack 30 years ago. Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the The Cosby Show star. Ms Thompson, a 44-year-old from Florida, told People: 'It's come to my understanding that there's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image. 'I am so very grateful for the Jane Doe who came before me in the lawsuit 10 years ago... My mother and I were very eager to give our support via testimony at that time – however, not to the general public. I was not quite strong enough then.' In 1988, the then 17-year-old aspiring model met Cosby via her modelling agency in New York. He assured the teen and her parents that he would help her become a star. Ms Thompson told People that Cosby made uncomfortable advances against her which ended in her feeling pressured to perform a sexual act on him. 'I'm like a robot, and that is what I became, and that is what I did for him,' she said. She was reportedly given $700 as she left his home. She told People that she had decided to come forward now because she 'would rather go to bed at night knowing that I've been honest'. She also felt that remaining as 'Jane Doe No.2' made her allegations less credible. Ultimately, Ms Thompson hoped that Cosby will come clean about the mounting allegations against him. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Thursday. When Ms Thompson's story was originally revealed in November 2014, Singer called it 'absurd' to publish an 'unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person'. Scroll down for video . 'Jane Doe No.2' has revealed her identity and claimed that Bill Cosby (pictured in January) sexually assaulted her when she was a teenage model in New York . Thompson was one of the 13 Jane Does in a 2005 civil suit against Cosby from Andrea Constand. Miss Constand eventually settled out of court. Last Friday, Cosby's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz - accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades-old sexual offenses. The accusers, all of whom have stepped forward in recent years, said Cosby's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence. But Cosby's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self-defense as his character was under attack. 'The law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked,' the lawyers argued in their 38-page filing. 'Instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims.' Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the three accusers, said his clients disagree with that position. 'We believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual, it must be truthful,' he said. 'We look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful.' Cosby's legal team has said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct. The former star of The Cosby Show hasn't been charged with any crime. More than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations. Tamara Green, a 56-year-old California lawyer, says Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s. Therese Serignese says Cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in Las Vegas around 1976. And Linda Traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a Southern California beach in about 1970. Tamara Green, a California lawyer, (left) filed a defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby in December 2014 claiming that he and his attorneys said she had lied about a sexual assault from 40 years ago (she is pictured, right, at the time) Green was joined in the lawsuit by Linda Traitz (left), who alleged that Cosby tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970, and nurse Therese Serignese (right), 57, who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old . Cosby's lawyers said his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly-worded rebukes. One November 2014 statement references Traitz's 'extensive' criminal record, which includes larceny, fraud and drug possession charges. 'As the old saying goes, ""consider the source,""' wrote Cosby attorney Martin Singer, who also attached copies of Traitz's Florida criminal and prison records with the statement. Another November 2014 statement cited by Cosby's accusers offers 'general comments' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers, his lawyers say. 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity,' Singer wrote at the time. 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' The three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages. Many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. But the scandal has taken its toll on the 77-year-old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand-up comedy tour. Cosby has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward, and women's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances. Lawyers for the three accusers have until March 20 to file a reply to Cosby's motion to dismiss the suit. Green originally filed the defamation lawsuit in December 2014 and Serignese and Traitz joined later. The suit is filed in US District Court in Springfield, in western Massachusetts. Cosby has a home nearby in Shelburne Falls.","Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the The Cosby Show star .

"Convicted: Sheila Kearns, 58, was convicted in January of four felony counts, for showing students at Columbus' East High School in Ohio, the movie 'The ABCs of Death' A former substitute teacher convicted of showing a high school class a movie featuring graphic scenes of sex and violence has been sentenced  to 90 days in jail. Sheila Kearns, 58, was convicted in January of four felony counts, for showing students at Columbus' East High School in Ohio, the movie 'The ABCs of Death.' During sentencing, Kearns apologized in court, saying she hadn't watched the violent movie before showing it to her Spanish class in April 2013. Common Pleas Judge Charles A. Schneider said: 'This is what happens when you put a teacher in a class that she cannot teach.' The film consisted of 26 chapters, each depicting some form of grisly death and representing a letter of the alphabet, such as 'E is for Exterminate,' 'O is for Orgasm' and 'T is for Toilet.' Kearns, who showed the movie during five periods of the class, was convicted of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles. Scroll down for video . Court: Sheila Kearns, right, listens to testimony in judge Schneider's Common Pleas Courtroom with attorney Geoffrey Oglesby on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2015 . School: The former substitute teacher showed students at Columbus' East High School in Ohio, pictured, a graphic movie featuring sex and violence . The Columbus Dispatch reported that the judge placed her on probation for three years but made the jail time a condition of probation. Kearns said repeatedly that she was unaware of the movie's content and her attorney argued she would never would have knowingly showed it. The teacher had told a detective she had her back to the screen and never turned around to watch the movie as it played for five separate classes throughout the day. Schneider told Kearns 'there's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.' Meanwhile a student testified otherwise saying Kearns had watched the 129-minute movie. The student said the movie was 'disturbing' and said everyone in the class went 'crazy' while watching it. Graphic: The film consisted of 26 chapters, each depicting some form of grisly death and representing a letter of the alphabet, such as 'E is for Exterminate,' 'O is for Orgasm' and 'T is for Toilet' An assistant principal who saw the DVD movie playing in the classroom confiscated it. Prosecutors said the movie's title should have tipped off Kearns that she should check it out before showing it to her students, who ranged in age from 14 to 18. Jurors watched the movie, which rates 4.7 out of 10 stars on the IMDb website, before convicting Kearns. After the conviction, the jury foreman said it wasn't proved at trial that Kearns was aware of the movie's content the first time she showed it but she would have known by the second, third, fourth and fifth showings. Kearns gave out a handwritten statement to reporters that praised God and included a Bible quote from Galatians: 'Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' The school district fired Kearns in June 2013. The Ohio Department of Education permanently revoked her substitute-teaching license after her conviction.","Sheila Kearns, 58, was convicted in January of four felony counts .

"A teenager who suffered amnesia and forgot her entire life regained her memory - after a hug from her little brother. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago after suffering a rare but serious side effect from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine. Doctors had tried everything, but the devastated teenager was still not able to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day at home, her brother Caleb, then six, walked into her room and gave her a cuddle. She claims at this point, her memories came flooding back. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago and was unable to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day, after a cuddle from her brother Caleb, now 7, her memories came flooding back . Miss Inman said: 'I had forgotten my entire life, which was absolutely devastating. I literally lost everything. 'Mum and dad would get very upset as I didn't recognise them and it was hard for them to deal with it. 'We had tried everything. I would look at family photographs and I knew it was me in them but I just couldn't remember anything about why I was there. 'It totally ruined me. I could not go back to school and I lost my family and friends and did not know who I was. It was dreadful. 'My brother and sister, who were six and eight at the time, didn't really understand. 'It sounds weird and is hard to explain but the first thing I remember was my little brother Caleb. 'Our bond is a really powerful thing and he just came in to my room and gave me a big hug. 'We have always had a close bond and a special relationship and somehow that moment just triggered everything coming back to me. 'After that hug all my family memories came back - every last one of them.' Miss Inman claims she developed severe amnesia nearly two years ago after suffering serious side effects from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine - after suffering severe headaches . Miss Inman had always suffered bad headaches but it was not until just before her 15th birthday that medical staff diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This meant she had abnormally high pressure inside her skull, which was causing excruciatingly painful headaches. She suffered the severe memory loss after doctors performed a lumbar puncture and found she had twice as much fluid in her spine than usual. Miss Inman, who lives in Plymouth, Devon with her parents Julie, 41, Daryl, 42, sister Ellie, nine and Caleb, now seven, said she was awake throughout the procedure. She said: 'It was like a switch was flicked and all my memories just disappeared. 'I didn't recognise my mum or my family. It was a weird feeling in my stomach as I felt like I knew them from somewhere but I couldn't think where. 'I immediately thought my mum must have been important as she did not leave my side through the whole ordeal. 'I thought she must be my mum but I didn't remember anything about her or anything that we had done together. 'It is a known side effect to the treatment. I have since heard that some people forget how to do their jobs and forget their families.' Chloe was sent home from hospital to try to re-jog her memories. But it was only the hug from her brother brought all her family memories back. She said: 'I was off school for two months. I didn't really understand what was going on - I just kept thinking ""I don't remember you"". 'But with my best friend it clicked immediately just by the way we started talking to each other. Miss Inman now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life . 'I had to fight the memory loss and now I remember nearly everything that I couldn't remember before and my life is slowly getting back together.' Despite this, her school work has suffered badly from the ordeal. 'I really struggled with school as I had to take so much time off and had to be taken out of all my lessons.' She now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life.' Miss Inman now studies performing arts at City College in Plymouth, Devon, and also volunteers at St John Ambulance. Her dream is to work as an Army medic. She said: 'It's quite scary looking back on it now. It did ruin my year and really my whole entire secondary school life. 'My pain was ignored for so many years. My consultant tested me for quite a lot of things and ran out of what to give me to help.' Chloe is now on a drug called acetazolamide to help reduce the fluid in her back -  and has fortunately not suffered from any headaches now for a year. She explained: 'My condition hasn't been properly diagnosed or treated yet because they don't really know what causes it. 'But they know that if it comes back to perform a lumbar puncture as a quick solution - but I'm terrified I could lose all my memory again.' She added: 'My condition is so powerful that it can kill people, either by it not being treated and too much pressure on the brain or people get fed up of being told it's just a headache that they lose faith and end up committing suicide. 'No-one really understands how painful it is.'","Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago .

"A boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new  trial. Jordan Brown, now 17, was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in February 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room. The court heard Houk, then eight months pregnant, was sleeping when Brown approached her with a blanket-covered 20-gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head. However, Brown's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement. 'Rush judgement': Jordan Brown (pictured left aged 14), was convicted of shooting his father's fiancee Keznie Houk (right) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping. He claims the evidence was insubstantial . Shock: His father Chris Brown (pictured) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11 . Filing for retrial on Thursday, defense attorney Steve Colafella said: 'I think the trial court has, at a minimum, no choice but to give us a new trial. 'We feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal.' The state Supreme Court first raised questions about the case in December. Jordan Brown's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling. State prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in Lawrence County. State police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but Brown, who is now 17. The defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy, fueled in part by Houk's family. They have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who, they contend, was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse in Wampum, about 40 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Tragic: Houk left behind a seven-year-old Jenessa (left) and a four-year-old Adalynn (right) Brown's defense lawyers claim Houk's family fueled animosity towards Brown during the 2012 trial . Brown's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement . Prosecutors contend Brown approached Houk with his youth-model 20-gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed. She was more than 8 months pregnant with a son, who also died. Brown's father had left for work and Houk's two daughters, ages 7 and 4, were the only others in the house when she was shot, prosecutors said. An empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road, where Brown walked before a school bus picked him up that morning, and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for Brown's. But Colafella said pictures from the scene show a 'muddy mess' outside the house that doesn't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in. 'Jealousy': Jordan was allegedly jealous that his father's new son was going to be named Chris after him . The defense also said Brown frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier. Police have said Houk's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation, but the Supreme Court noted defense arguments that Jordan saw a truck resembling the man's near the house that morning. Colafella also said Houk's seven-year-old daughter first told police she didn't hear anything unusual that morning, only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning. Houk's body was found after the four-year-old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead, police said. Jack Houk, the dead woman's father, did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing. The defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse .","Jordan Brown, now 17, claims he was the victim of a rush judgement .

"A woman has told how she went under the knife and had her cup size enhanced after being teased over her padded underwear. Chelsey Dunn, 26, was mortified when her partner compared her underwear to that of cross-dressing nanny Mrs Doubtfire. She had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw. Chelsey Dunn, pictured after her breast enlargement, went under the knife her partner, Ross Stephens, left, jokingly compared her padded underwear to Mrs Doubtfire's . Months after the remark, she was boosted from a 34A to a 34DD at a cost of £5,500 and is now delighted to have been able to throw away her old underwear. Miss Dunn, who is now engaged to marry her partner after he proposed following her surgery said: ‘It was just a joke to make me laugh but I had to admit it was true. 'I wanted to be able to wear nice lingerie and backless clothes but I couldn’t because I felt out of proportion without my padded bra on.' Chelsea, pictured at a 34A, had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw . She underwent the operation in January last year and was boosted to a 34DD . Miss Dunn, from Rhyl, South Wales, had been teased over her lack of curves at school and was unkindly nicknamed the ‘ironing board.’ She says she longed for her bust to grow and hoped she was just a late developer, but by her early twenties she was used to concealing her bust. She said: ‘I would buy the thickest padded bras I could find. My friends all joked that they looked like mattress padding. 'For some reason thick padded bras are always beige. They are the most unattractive garments but without them I felt self-conscious.' Months after her operation, her boyfriend proposed in the Disney Princess Castle while the couple were holidaying in Florida and Miss Dunn accepted . It meant she was limited to clothing that she could wear to conceal the bras. She said: ‘Holidays were tricky because I couldn’t wear my padded bra under bikinis and longed to wear strapless and backless dresses like my friends but it was impossible. It was when she was undressing in front of her boyfriend that he teasingly asked her if Mrs Doubtfire wanted her bra back soon that she decided it was time to do something about it. She said: 'It was really funny because I was the first to admit my padded bras were not sexy in the slightest. But it did also make me think enough was enough. My chest had always bothered me why not do something about it?’ She booked a consultation with Transform and her surgeon agreed to boost her from an A to a DD cup.

"Taking her place on the witness stand, a Florida court bailiff described being sexually assaulted at gunpoint the day she asked her husband for a divorce after his gambling had led them into debt. The 55-year-old woman tried to hold back tears as she spoke Tuesday of being held against her will by her ex-husband, Garrett Cunningham, 64, also a Broward court deputy, though he is currently suspended. The Sun Sentinel reports that the couple met in 1983 while working as corrections officers in New York City's Riker's Island. Alleged assault: Garrett Cunningham, 64, who worked as a court bailiff was accused by his ex-wife of handcuffing and shackling her before sexually assaulting her in 2013 . They married in 1990, but the woman described how Cunningham's gambling habits drove them into debt, costing them their house and his car. The woman said she tried to keep the couple afloat - even covering a $2,000 debt Cunningham owed - and stated that even after they separated, she would drive him to work. In September 2013, she drove him to the Plantation motel on State Road 7 where he had been living and asked her to help carry groceries to his room, she said. She testified that once inside the room, Cunningham handcuffed her and shackled her legs, before pulling out a Glock pistol from under the mattress and pointing it at her. On the wall was a note listing everything Cunningham had done wrong in his life, while a second note on the bed had a list of questions about her personal and dating life, according to an arrest affidavit. What followed was an hours-long interrogation, where Cunningham berated his wife over who she was dating, she testified. County court: Cunningham and his ex-wife met as corrections officers at Riker's Island in New York City and began working as bailiffs in 1999 . Cunningham demanded her phone and the password to unlock it. After reading texts sent between her and a man she had met online, he threw the phone to the floor and shot its screen, she said. 'He had this crazed look in his eye,' she claimed on the stand. 'I just knew in that moment that I was not coming out of that hotel room alive.' She said that after several hours Cunningham concluded she had to be punished, and used a vegetable to sodomize her. When she cried out, he pointed the gun at her head and told her that he would shoot her if she couldn't stop screaming, she said. She testified that she cried as she held back screams as he continued his alleged assault. Cunningham was arrested days later. In December, he was suspended without pay by the Broward Sheriff's Office. He is currently being tried on two counts of sexual battery, one count of false and one count of . His wife left the motel after allegedly being attacked, then showered and fell asleep, according to Cunningham's attorney, who seized on her delay in reporting the assault. Defense attorney Gabriel Ermine said the woman fabricated the story of assault in hopes of keeping an inheritance she had recently received from her late parents. 'She wanted it all to herself,' Ermine said in an opening statement. 'Now she's using you to convict him so he doesn't get any money.' The woman called police after the assault and attempted to get Cunningham committed under Florida's Baker Act, which allows for the involuntary examination of a person that poses threat of harm to self or others. She reported the alleged assault two days later,  explaining to the jury that she had a difficult time coming to terms with what had happened at the hands of her husband. 'You did that to me!' she yelled at Cunningham in court. 'I didn't do that to you. I cared for you.'","The 55-year-old woman who worked for the Broward Sheriff's Office with her ex-husband described being held against her will in the motel where he lived .

"The family of a snowboarder who went missing in the Alps have spoken of their heartache after his body was finally found three weeks later. Steven Rollett, 35, had been snowboarding with friends when he became stuck in a 'basin' of deep snow. Before his friends had a chance to return with help, he had disappeared without a trace. The much-loved father, whose wife Nicola is 30 weeks pregnant, was found dead three weeks after going missing in Meribel, in France. 'He's left a hole in my heart that will never be filled': Steven Rollett pictured with his wife Nicola on their wedding day. Mr Rollett died after going missing while snowboarding  in the French Alps last month . Now Stephen's wife has spoken of the 'most wonderful and amazing person' who will 'live forever' through their unborn daughter. Nicola said: 'He was my whole world and my life will never be the same without him. 'He was the most wonderful and amazing person I have ever known and he will live on forever in his daughter I carry. 'He's left a hole in my heart that will never be filled. RIP my beautiful husband, I will love you always.' Steven, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, arrived at the ski resort on Saturday, January 31, with friends. They enjoyed an afternoon of snowboarding before three of them including Steven began using a popular off-piste slope. His heartbroken parents David, 59, and Barbara Rollett, 57, told how Steven veered into an area which was like a basin of snow and became stuck. The family had to endure an horrendous wait before Steven's body was discovered on February 23. Steven and Nicola Rollett pictured with his son Bradley Annetts from a previous relationship at their wedding . Barbara Rollett said: 'We're devastated. Nicola has lost her soul-mate. She is absolutely gutted. She's trying to be strong because she's got to look after their baby. 'While they were still looking for Steve she was harbouring hopes of him still being found alive. Now we will have to do what we can for Steve and Nicola and our grandchildren. 'Our focus is on looking after Nicola, with her parents who have been very good. 'Steve and Nicola's new baby girl will be the light at the end of the tunnel. Steve was so excited about haying a baby daughter and in a way he can live on through her and we take comfort from that.' Steven, who also has a 14-year-old son from a previous relationship, disappeared after friends tried to get help. Mr Rollett said: 'There were others using the slope and there was nothing to indicate it was dangerous. 'Steve veered off to an area which was like a basin and it was full of a lot of snow and he became stuck and couldn't get out. Mr Rollett was found dead three weeks after going missing in the resort of Meribel (above) in France . 'His friends could see him and were talking to him but he was on an uphill slope and he was struggling to get out. 'They went to get help and by this time the resort was coming to a standstill but they kept the ski slopes open to allow the boys to go back to pinpoint where he was to rescuers but by this time he had disappeared.' Despite a three-hour search, the resort's security team, a mountain rescue team and a helicopter could not find Steven as snow came in over Saturday, January 31, and Sunday, February 1. One of Steven's friends alerted his family while his parents were in Spain and David and his brother Ray got flights to France by Monday, February 2. Mr Rollett added: 'We were beside ourselves. By 5pm the same day, mountain rescue people came and told us there was no sign Steve would be found alive after he had been missing two days and it was a case of waiting to see if his body turned up.' Mr Rollett added: 'We received the peace of knowing he had been found and I believe he died from hypothermia. 'The chalet managers had been very supportive and the rescuers had done all they could and didn't leave a stone unturned. So we're very grateful for everything they did.' A funeral is expected this month on a date to be fixed. Those awaiting details can contact Wetton Funeral Service on 01246 232966. Steven also leaves a son Bradley Annetts, sister Louise Biggs, brother-in-law Gavin Biggs, two nieces and a nephew.","Steven Rollett, 35, disappeared while snowboarding off-piste in Meribel .

"For three long years Claire O’Meara put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing. Long hours spent at her computer, plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice. ‘I was 30 when the migraines began, randomly at first, but then they came every month,’ says Claire, 35, who lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband Brendan, 42, a fitness centre owner. ‘I blamed my career and lifestyle. At work, I’d have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all-consuming. Sometimes, the migraines would wipe me out for a week. Claire O’Meara (pictured) used to put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing . ‘Despite being a virtual workaholic, there were times I was unable to function and would have to phone in sick, which left me feeling terribly guilty.’ Things got so bad that last year Claire gave up her job to work part-time for her husband, helping to market his firm. But then Claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches — her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle. ‘I noticed they always came the day before my period, and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was. ‘It altered the way I tried to deal with them. I took advice, mapped out my cycles, and upped my dosage of magnesium (said to regulate hormones) and took over-the-counter drug Migraleve to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before I knew my period was due. This has staved off a full-blown migraine for the last few months.’ Claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side-effect of the menstrual cycle. Claire (pictured after a migraine) gave up her job to work part-time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad . According to charity the National Migraine Centre, a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before, during or just after their period. But, like Claire, very many don’t make the connection between the two for years — and neither do their GPs. Online forums are awash with women discussing the ‘lightbulb moment’ they finally realised their cycle was to blame. Although migraines are an age-old problem, the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon, following extensive research over the past 25 years. Professor Anne MacGregor, a leading specialist in headaches and women’s health, says: ‘The most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle. This hormone is released at the start of it, and levels rise, eventually triggering ovulation and an egg’s release. Claire (pictured) has seen various GPs and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely . ‘Progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, both levels drop and cause a period. ‘It’s this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal.’ She says hormones used in contraceptives, such as the Pill, coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk — but those in their 30s and 40s more so. ‘This is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause, mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater,’ she reveals. ‘Traditional headache remedies don’t work. This is why we’d like to see greater diagnosis, so women can get the right treatment.’ Claire’s work was not the only thing that suffered. She often found herself saying to Brendan: ‘Not tonight, darling, I’ve a headache’ — and meaning it. ‘Thank goodness he’s very understanding,’ she says. Her social life was often wrecked, too: ‘I’ve had to regularly cancel social engagements, including a close friend’s baby shower.’ Claire saw various doctors: her GP, another for a second opinion, plus a consultant — but none came up with a treatment that worked completely. ‘All they suggested was that I take Migraleve, but until I started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me.’ Dr Jud Pearson, at the National Migraine Centre, advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation-related to start keeping a diary like Claire. ‘I think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now. ‘Now, however, there is a growing awareness of the condition, which means more women are finally being diagnosed.’ Marie Brown 47, a dental company sales consultant living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has had migraines for more than a decade, but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle, thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping. Marie Brown, 47, (pictured) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods . She reveals: ‘The first migraine I suffered was in my late 30s, and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head. There were times I wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister, such as a brain tumour.’ Only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence, at age 44, did Marie made the connection. She now has a supply of the migraine drug Sumatriptan on hand to take on her ‘danger’ days to prevent attacks. ‘It was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me. But if I don’t take a tablet in time, the ensuing migraine is hell.’ Even with the medication, she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods. ‘I deliberately don’t book anything for the week of my period, as on so many occasions I’ve had to bolt when a migraine has started. Marie (seen here age 27) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods . ‘Last New Year’s Eve I had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm, when one came on. ‘Unlike most women, I’m actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop, so too will the migraines.’ For Sarah Rose, 31, a special educational needs support assistant who lives in Croydon, Surrey, with partner Paul, 33, a sales manager, and their son Jack, two, the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last Easter that her GP sent her to A&E fearing she had a bleed on the brain. ‘I spent five days in hospital on morphine. A CT scan ruled out anything sinister, but I had felt as though my head would literally explode. It was so frightening, all I could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me?’ Marie (pictured) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s, but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44, at which point Marie connected the pain to her menstrual cycle . However, unlike many other women, Sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life. ‘I first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them. They worsened at university and my GP sent me to a neurologist. ‘He diagnosed migraines, but didn’t link them to my cycle. ‘It wasn’t until I was talking to my great aunt, now in her 80s five years ago, that I realised the cause. She said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem, too. ‘After that, I used the Period Tracker Deluxe mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and, sure enough, a pattern soon emerged. ‘Subsequently I also tried homeopathy, specifically a herbal remedy called sepia, which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems.’ Sarah is an extreme case. But, for many women, the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure.","Claire O’Meara, 35, put her headaches down to the stress of her career .

"A woman died and 43 children were taken to hospital after a truck driver 'fell asleep at the wheel' and plowed into oncoming vehicles including a packed school bus. The incident occurred around 8.10am on Highway 97 just north of Orondo, Washington yesterday. It is the second time truck driver Kenneth Hahn has caused a collision by crossing the central line, police said. Carmela Cuellar Morales, the 22-year-old car driver, was declared dead at the scene. Scroll down for video . A woman died and 43 children were taken to hospital after a truck driver 'fell asleep at the wheel' and plowed into vehicles including an oncoming school bus . Photos show significant damage to the right front side of the yellow bus (right), with part of its roof caved in and all the windows smashed. The front half of the box truck (left) was destroyed . A number of students had minor injuries and two people traveling in the truck sustained serious wounds. The Orondo School District bus, driven by Pamela Robertson, 53, was taking children to the elementary-middle school when the collision occurred. Photos show significant damage to the right front side of the bus, with part of its roof caved in and all the windows smashed. The front half of the box truck was also destroyed. Jasmine Gaona, a six-year-old pupil, told KOMO that when the bus crashed all of the children fell off their seats. She had to have her knee bandaged. The injured people were taken to Central Washington Hospital in Wenatchee, about 20 miles south of the accident. Tracey Kasnic, a chief nursing officer at the hospital, said most people were suffering from bruises and lacerations. Only a few had fractures, KOMO reported. The cause of the crash was not initially known. Temperatures in the area were above freezing and there was no sign of snow or ice on the road. But last night trooper Darren Wright said: 'We do suspect the driver fell asleep.' Investigators will now test blood samples from Hahn for alcohol or drugs. A spokesman for the school described the situation as 'upsetting'. The injured people were taken to Central Washington Hospital in Wenatchee (pictured), about 20 miles south of the accident . Douglas County Sheriff Harvey Gjesdal said it was the worst accident he had seen in his 30-year law enforcement career. 'Anything involving a school bus causes great concern - sad, sad,' he said. Washington State Patrol reminded residents on Facebook yesterday to get enough sleep. It said: 'In honor of national ‪#‎SleepAwarenessweek‬, March 2-8, we would like to remind drivers to stay awake and alert behind the wheel. 'According to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, people who sleep six to seven hours a night are twice as likely to be involved in a crash as those sleeping eight hours or more, while people sleeping less than five hours increased their risk four to five times.'","The incident occurred around 8.10am on Highway 97 yesterday .

"A top policeman told his officers to ‘go away and gather evidence’ so they could blame drunken fans for the Hillsborough disaster, a court has heard. Former inspector Clive Davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway and talk to locals, off licence owners and pub landlords about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters at a ‘call to arms’ meeting of top brass just two days after the tragedy. He said Chief Superintendent Terry Wain, who lead the briefing at the headquarters of South Yorkshire police, told his officers: ‘We are going to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs: on the drunken, ticketless Liverpool fans.’ Ninety-six Liverpool fans died from the crush at the Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way . Mr Davis, who was giving evidence at the new inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool supporters, later took part in a Panorama programme for the BBC in which he likened the culture of the force in April 1989 to a ‘Tudor Court.’ The hearing was told that Chief Constable Peter Wright was a strict disciplinarian, an all-powerful Henry VIII figure, running his own ‘Wolf Hall’ where mistakes were never admitted or allowed to enter the public domain. Mr Davis said Mr Wright could make or break careers – helping further the prospects of those who did his bidding and stifling the development of those he didn’t approve of. He said there was no doubt Chief Superintendent Wain, whose briefing he described as the start of the police ‘fight-back,’ was acting on the orders of Chief Constable Wright and had been simply ‘given a job to do.’ Former inspector Clive Davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway in the days after the tragedy . Mr Davis said he was told by his boss to attend the meeting, on the Monday morning after the abandoned FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, because it would be a good way to get noticed ‘career-wise.’ He said Chief Inspector Norman Bettison, who was his superior, told him the disaster was ‘the biggest thing to happen in South Yorkshire Police’ and it would benefit them ‘to be a part of what was going to happen in the wake of it.’ The inquest heard that then Chief Inspector Norman Bettison, pictured said the disaster was ‘the biggest thing to happen in South Yorkshire Police’ But the jury were told that senior officers disputed that the meeting, on April 17 1989, ever took place. No documents or minutes of the ‘jaw-dropping’ briefing, supposedly held on the fifth floor of South Yorkshire police headquarters, in Sheffield, have ever been found. Mr Davis, who retired from the force in 2006, admitted he kept quiet about the meeting because he would have ""become the problem’ and forced to leave his job. But after hearing senior officers continue to blame fans, following the publication of Hillsborough Independent Panel report in September 2012, he finally decided to act. Mr Davis said he contacted relatives of those who died via the Hillsborough Family Support Group and also agreed to talk about the meeting for a BBC Panorama programme the following year. Referring to what he heard at the briefing, on April 17 1989, Mr Davis said he was left ‘more perplexed’ than ‘outraged’ because it seemed very early to come to a ‘decisive, definitive conclusion’ about what had happened. Cross-examined by Chris Daw QC, representing retired Chief Superintendents Terry Wain and Donald Denton, Mr Davis was accused of telling ‘bare-faced lies.’ But he remained adamant the meeting happened and that he had no problem saying so on oath. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Former officer tells inquest police chief said they were to 'blame the fans'

"Chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs in a new race hate storm - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train. After the club’s victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, a man was heard to say on the London to Manchester service: ‘Paris, Paris, Paris, that’s the way I like it, a n***** on the door’. This was a reference to the shocking incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game. On the train: Chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs . Video still: The incident on the service prompted three Asian women and a black man to leave the train . A video of the latest incident - obtained by The Sun and broadcast by ITV London News tonight - was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly. The clip - in which only the seats can be seen - also features someone saying ‘Tottenham are a load of Y**s’, referring to the club’s Jewish fan base, and ‘John Terry is a racist, a racist, a racist’. Club captain Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing then QPR player Anton Ferdinand. The passenger who shot the latest footage - with whom police have been in contact - described his journey as '90 minutes of hell', saying nobody dared to confront the supporters. The video ends when as a man is heard warning his friend ‘somebody might be filming us’. British Transport Police said officers had received complaints from passengers on the train. Shocking previous incident: A group of Chelsea’s supporters prevented a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro before a Champions League game last month . Win: The incident happened after the club’s 2-0 victory in the League Cup over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday . Racist words: A video taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London to Manchester (file picture) Detective Sergeant Michael Maher said: ‘I want to hear from anyone who was on the train, particularly in coach E, around the time it reached Stoke, 10.40pm. ‘By the accounts we have received, the group were chanting insults at other passengers, and some of these insults may have been racist. We are in the process of checking CCTV. ‘But I would like to hear from any passengers who may have captured the behaviour of the group on mobile phones. Such footage could be crucial to our investigation.’ Four men were ejected by police who boarded the train, with their names and addresses taken, while another four left by choice. And Rory Jennings, from the Chelsea Fans Channel, told ITV London: 'It's northern Chelsea fans. There's obviously some, but they should be quite easily pinpointed. Three years ago: Club captain John Terry (right) was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing then QPR player Anton Ferdinand (left) Stamford Bridge: Chelsea is helping police with their probe - 'and their efforts to identify the individuals' Journey: The fans were travelling north towards Manchester from London Euston station (file picture) 'The club have done wonderful work with regard to stamping out racism - but it just shows you that there's further to go. These people need to be identified, banned and arrested. It's shocking.' A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘We are assisting the British Transport Police with their enquiries, and their efforts to identify the individuals involved.’ Police are also investigating racist chanting at London St Pancras station after Chelsea’s match at Paris St-Germain on February 17. They have identified all those believe to have been involved - the day after the Paris Metro incident – and they will be interviewed. It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game last month.

"The parents of murdered black teenager Michael . Brown have announced their plan to file a civil suit against the city of Ferguson. It comes a day after the U.S. Justice Department refused to prosecute Wilson despite compiling a 350,000-page report on racial profiling in the Missouri city that 'led to' Brown's fatal shooting at the hands of a white police officer on August 9, 2014. 'He did not have to kill Michael Brown,' attorney Daryl . Parks said of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Taking action: Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, far right, leaves the FBI offices in St. Louis after meeting with federal officials on Wednesday before announcing plans to file a civil suit against Ferguson . Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., attended the news conference at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church, but they did not speak nor take questions. Parks said the DOJ report makes it clear there are 'rampant, wholesale, systemic' problems in the Ferguson police department that need to 'change soon for the safety of the citizens.' He did not say specifically when the suit would be filed. He said only that, 'soon means soon.' The announcement is a reaction to the news on Wednesday that federal investigators found a pattern of discriminatory and . illegal actions against African-Americans by the Ferguson Police . Department. The report said police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson . overwhelmingly arrested and issued citations to blacks to boost . city revenues through fines and court fees, creating a culture . of distrust that exploded on August 9 when Wilson killed Brown. Attorney General Eric Holder said the report showed police created a 'highly toxic environment' in Ferguson. Catalyst: The Justice Department began the civil rights investigation following the August shooting of Michael Brown (left), an unarmed black 18-year-old, by white police officer Darren Wilson (right) Justice Department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six-month probe, concluding that a large portion of Ferguson's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate . Report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-American . 'Let me be clear, this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson Police Department or in any department in the city of Ferguson,' the city's mayor James Knowles said at the conference. Seven emails included in the report showed police and court officials making racist jokes, including one that said Obama wouldn't remain president long, remarking 'what black man holds a steady job for four years.' The mayor did not take any questions at the presser, and though Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson had been expected to attend, no explanation was given for his absence. The Justice Department investigation into Ferguson police began immediately after Brown's killing in August. Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, an unnamed department official said. The Department of Justice report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black. Not tolerated: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles announced the firing of one police department employee identified among those who sent racist emails . According to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014, blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops, though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers. Holder also said that charges for minor violations such as 'manner of walking in roadway' disproportionately affected black residents and were used 'not as a public service, but as a tool for raising revenue.' Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities. Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts. The Justice Department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change.

"Drivers are to get ten minutes extra time after a parking ticket runs out before they can be hit with a fine. Under a change in the law to take effect within weeks, they will have the right to a ‘grace period’ in all on-street or off-street council parking places. For decades, drivers have complained of returning to their cars moments after a ticket expires to find a prowling warden has already hit them with a penalty. Scroll down for video . In a change in the law to take effect within weeks, traffic wardens will be forced to give drivers ten minutes' extra time after a parking ticket runs out before hitting them with fines (file picture) The measure will be viewed by many as a sweetener for Britain’s estimated 30 million drivers ahead of May’s general election. The new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay-and-display bays or other spaces with time limits. Other new measures include a right for residents and local firms to demand that their council reviews parking in their area, including charges and use of yellow lines. CCTV camera cars that automatically issue parking fines are to be made illegal, except near schools, in bus lanes and on red routes. Broader guidance will also be issued, saying that councils cannot use parking to make a profit. Writing for MailOnline, Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said ‘war on the motorist must end’. The ministers said in a joint statement: ‘Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. ‘We are bringing back common sense. ‘Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from ten minute “grace periods” for council-controlled parking, whether it’s on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won’t get fined for being a few minutes late. We’re also ending the industrial use of CCTV spy cars to enforce on-street parking.’ Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach . A new Deregulation Bill, due to pass through the House of Lords next week and come into force next month, will enforce the ban on CCTV being used to issue automated fines, except in high-risk areas. The Department for Communities and Local Government is tabling a separate Parliamentary motion introducing ten-minute grace periods, which will come into effect later this month. The new rules are aimed at curbing draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists. Without reform, the amount of money collected in parking charges and fines will soon hit £650million a year. Critics say concerns about parking fines are prompting many motorists to shun high streets for out-of-town complexes. The Government is also promising new restrictions against heavy-handed action by bailiffs chasing fines, and clearer rules to prevent penalties being issued at out-of-order parking meters when there is no alternative way to pay. Councils have also been to volunteer to trial a scheme that allows motorists challenging a parking ticket to benefit from a 25 per cent discount on the fine if they lose the appeal. Currently, drivers are only offered a discount on early payment before challenging a ticket. Mr Pickles added: ‘We are ending the war on drivers who simply want to go about their daily business. For too long parking rules have made law-abiding motorists feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to shops and businesses. The new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay-and-display bays or free spaces with time limits (file picture) 'Over-zealous parking enforcement undermines our town centres and costs councils more in the long term. Our measures not only bring big benefits for high streets, motorists and local authorities - they put common sense back into parking.' Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Helping local businesses thrive is a key part of our long term economic plan. These measures will deliver a fairer deal for motorists and help boost the high street by ensuring that parking enforcement is proportionate.’ Local residents or firms will also be allowed to raise a petition that will require a council review of the use of yellow lines and unfair parking charges. A minimum of 50 council taxpayers’ signatures or at least ten per cent of the residents or businesses in the affected local areas will be required. Mr Pickles and Mr McLoughlin claimed the last Labour government had made life ‘unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring’. ‘We’re ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don’t feel like a criminal just for parking your car,’ they added. By Eric Pickles and Patrick McLoughlin . Controversial CCTV camera cars that automatically issue fines are to be made illegal too, the minister have said . In the history of human invention, there’s nothing that matches the car. We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience. But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story. You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee. In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels. This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence. These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute “grace periods” for council-controlled parking, whether it’s on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won’t get fined for being a few minutes late. We’re also ending the industrial use of CCTV ‘spy cars’ to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes. Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we’re cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs. And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they’ve done nothing wrong. We’ll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you’ll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost. These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce. Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring. We’re ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don’t feel like a criminal just for parking your car.","Drivers complain about being hit with a penalty just as their ticket expires .

Antonio de Jesus Lopez Monje was attacked by a group of older boys from his school as he walked home in Amozoc, central Mexico . After surgery, he came out of the coma but was left with severe brain damage which had paralysed half of his body and left him with memory loss. Nine operations later, surgeons found that he was partially brain dead and had lost 60% of his sight in the vicious attack. Antonio's devastated father Roberto Castro Barranco said: 'For so long we had been clinging onto the faintest hope that he would come through and come back to us. 'But when we heard that his condition was worsening we were worried even more, and started to believe that all the medical help was not doing much for him.' Despite nine operations, surgeons found that he was partially brain dead and had lost 60% of his sight . When his condition began to worsen, his family discharged him against medical advice so he could see the sea . He added: 'He wanted one thing and that was to be by the sea. 'He longed to feel the waves, touch the sand and smell the sea breeze. 'So eventually we decided to take him out of hospital to give him that.' Against medical advice, Antonio was discharged and went to stay with his grandmother in Ensenada, a coastal city in north-western Mexico. He died three months later.

"The porn star who ended Anthony Weiner's political career by exposing their sexual online relationship is embroiled in another 'sexting' scandal. Sydney Leathers has now exposed the kinky fetishes of a Democratic statesman in the American Midwest. The politician allegedly replied as 'B***h Boy' to an advert the adult actress put out looking for a submissive client who she could 'financially dominate'. Leathers - who lives in Evansville, Indiana - said B***h Boy was careful never to reveal his name and sent his money through a prepaid PayPal card. Scandal: Leathers says her new 'sexting' companion goes by the name 'B***h Boy' and sends her lingerie and shoes through the post . Disgraced: Former congressman Anthony Weiner was on the verge of a comeback in 2012 when his online relationship with Leathers emerged in 2012 - as he launched his New York mayoral bid . But the politician who cannot be named for legal reasons did not realise his name was on the parcels containing lingerie and shoes he sent her through Amazon. She told Page6.com: 'I'm a little speechless. I Googled him and found out he's a lawmaker. Apparently only politicians can pick up on my pheromones.' Leathers has never met B***h Boy or even talked on the phone. Their entire relationship exists over salacious text messaging. In one of texts, he said: 'I am your property to do with as you wish, Mistress.' To which Sydney replied: 'Yes, because you are weak and pathetic and useless.' She added in the interview with Page6.com: 'This guy is into some really freaky stuff. He wanted to be forced to wear a French maid outfit and clean my house while I degraded him. 'He wanted to be tied up and left in a closet to watch me have sex with my boyfriend.' Sexting: Leathers (pictured) effectively ended the career of former congressman Anthony Weiner by exposing their sexual online relationship . Family man: Weiner (left) - who fathered Zain with wife Huma Abedin (right) - admitted to having sexual online relationships with up to 10 women in late 2012 . Leathers describes her political ideology as 'about as liberal as you can get' and admitted she was 'really sad' that he was a Democrat, adding: 'I was really hoping it was a Republican.' Disgraced politician Anthony Weiner was also a Democrat who served as a US representative in New York's 9th congressional district. He resigned from congress in 2011 after it was revealed the married man sent explicit pictures of himself to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account. In late 2012, he was on the verge of a potential comeback when he found himself at the centre of another sexting storm with adult actress Sydney Leathers. The scandal destroyed his bid to become the Democrats' candidate for New York mayor and in October last year he admitted that his political career was 'probably over'. But unlike Weiner, the adult actress who effectively finished off his life in politics hopes her latest sexting companion does not lose his job. 'Is he displaying poor judgment by sexting me of all people? Obviously,' she said. 'But should sexual situations define politicians? They are human, after all. Some apparently are more human than others.'","Sydney Leathers gets kinky texts from another politician from Democrats .

"It is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce. Now scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause and it could provide clues as to why it evolved in the first place. There is just one other species in the wild known to undergo the menopause - short-finned pilot whales - although it has been observed in a handful of captive primates and animals. Older female killer whales tend to take the lead (like the one above) when families are foraging for food . The evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans. Now a team of researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of York may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least. It happens to every woman who reaches a certain age, but in the animal kingdom, the menopause is a relatively uncommon trait. Humans can live long after they stop being able to reproduce, but most animals tend to remain fertile up until they die. A few species of primate, like rhesus monkeys, orangutans and chimpanzees are also known to experience menopause while it has also been reported in elephants and short-finned pilot whales. Laboratory rats, captive opossums and budgerigars have also been observed to under go the menopause. However, the short-finned pilot whale and the killer whale are the only animals that been been seen to live long past the age that they lose the ability to reproduce. They have found that it frees up the older, more experienced females to lead their families in the search for food and so boost the ability of the entire group to survive. The findings may now also help to explain why the menopause emerged in human populations - it allowed older women to impart their knowledge and help care for the younger members. Professor Darren Croft, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Exeter, said: 'In humans, it has been suggested that menopause is simply an artifact of modern medicine and improved living conditions. 'However, mounting evidence suggests that menopause in humans is adaptive. 'In hunter-gatherers, one way that menopausal women help their relatives, and thus increase the transmission of their own genes, is by sharing food. 'Menopausal women may also have shared another key commodity - information.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Current Biology, studied groups of killer whales in the wild off the coast of British Columbia and Washington during nine summer salmon migrations. Female killer whales can continue having calves, like above, until around the age of 35 years old say scientists . In total they observed 102 whales - 58 of which were female - and studied which of the whales occupied the lead position as the whales hunted for the salmon. They also used 35 years worth of data on the whale population in the area to identify those that had gone through the menopause. On average female killer whales older than 35 years old were found to have gone through the menopause. The researchers found that the older post-reproductive females tended to lead groups of the whales when they were foraging for salmon. Orca are one of just two species that are known to undergo the menopause in the wild other than humans . They were also more likely to take the lead in years when the salmon abundance was low - meaning the killer whales were struggling to find food. This is because the older females are using their greater experience to help the group find food, say the researchers. Dr Lauren Brent, a behavioural biologist at the University of Exeter who was the lead author of the research, said: Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. 'The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing. The researchers also found that post-menopausal killer whales were also more likely to lead their sons than their daughters. Dr Daniel Franks, from the University of York, said: 'Killer whale mothers direct more help toward sons than daughters because sons offer greater potential benefits for her to pass on her genes. 'Sons have a higher reproductive potential and they mate outside the group, thus their offspring are born into another gruop and do not compete for resources within the mother's matriline.'","Killer whales are one of a handful of animals that undergo the menopause .

"Nick Gordon, the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, has gone into rehab following a dramatic intervention conducted by eminent psychologist, Dr Phil McGraw Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. The highly-charged intervention will air on Dr. Phil's show next Wednesday, March 11. Amid scenes of high emotion, Gordon repeatedly broke down and ranted incoherently and threatened to kill himself if anything happened to Bobbi Kristina. Left to his own devices, Dr Phil asserted, Gordon would be dead ‘within the week.’ Dr Phil flew to Atlanta yesterday, on Bobbi Kristina’s birthday, after friends and family of Gordon begged him to intervene as the 25-year-old’s mental state spiraled out of control. Nick Gordon believed he was meeting Dr Phil to conduct an interview after feeling that he has been publicly ‘vilified.’ Instead he found his mother, Michelle, and Dr Phil united in their mission to save his life . Gordon believed he was meeting Dr Phil to conduct an interview after feeling that he has been publicly ‘vilified.’ Instead he found his mother, Michelle, and Dr Phil united in their mission to save his life. Earlier Michelle, who speaks with her son daily, told Dr Phil: ‘Nicholas is at breaking point. He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Krissi. He blames himself.' 'As we sit here right now, my son’s life hangs in the balance. When Whitney was found, he administered CPR to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying, ‘Mom, why couldn’t I do it? I couldn’t get air into her lungs.’ During a highly emotional process Gordon repeatedly walked out, refused to co-operate, acceded to Dr Phil’s request then reneged just as quickly. In recent days Gordon’s presence on social media has been increasingly erratic. In what was the only insight into his spiraling mind. On Tuesday, the eve of Krissi’s 22nd birthday he tweeted ‘I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic]’ Earlier he tweeted: ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry.’ Earlier still he tweeted the simple plea: ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’ Gordon has been out-of control since the  desperate as Bobbi Kristina's 22nd birthday approached as he tweeted 'I'm so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].' Nick and Bobbi Kristina looked so happy together at the premier of Whitney Houston's last film Sparke. Bobbi Kristina is now in a medically induced coma and Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted 'You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn't good enough sorry. ' Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, 'I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.' Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. A helping hand: Dr. Phil was concerned about Nick Gordon. He is determined to save his life . The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother's death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta's Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. In additio to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client's privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina's union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as 'husband' and 'wife' in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a 'sister.' In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his 'wife' refers to her as his 'fiancée.' What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: 'Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. 'It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. 'And Nick like space, that's where a lot of the tension between them came from.' He revealed that Gordon was 'getting a little wild.' He said: 'He was getting into car accidents. He's been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He's got a need for speed. He's getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney's estate] and crashing them life and right. 'He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn't slowing down.' Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter's money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina's aunt Marion 'Pat' Houston is the executor Whitney's estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read 'Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,' were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney's managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon's 'sibling' relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.","Dr. Phil McGraw flew to Atlanta yesterday to stage an intervention with Bobbi Kristina's troubled boyfriend Nick Gordon .

If you are looking to try a new edgy look, going platinum is a great way to stop people in their tracks- especially an all over platinum blonde and I think this is exactly what Kim and Kanye are looking to do at the moment. Usually as Technicians, we look to give our clients the most suitable, beautiful hair colour, working with their skin tone, eye colour etc. to give them a look tailored perfectly to them. This colour on Kim is none of the above but is very editorial, high fashion and certainly creates a statement. At some point in her life every woman needs to make the jump from brunette to blonde, although there are many variations it is important to remember when going for such an extreme blonde to consider the effects on your hairs condition, you will need to do regular treatments to keep it feeling healthy. Best product to use? For any woman looking to achieve this look, I would advise it be only done professionally to avoid serious damage and brassy tones. At HOB Salons, we use Wella Professional products and would obtain this look by using the Blondor Lightening System. How to maintain the colour blonde? To maintain your blonde hue, I would recommend Wellas ‘hero product’ SP Silver Blond Shampoo (£16.50 @ HOB Salons) to keep the blonde fresh and clean and prevent it from going brassy.","Kim, 34, unveiled new 'do in Paris today .

"A 21-year-old snowboarder was killed Wednesday morning after accidentally triggering an avalanche in Utah. Blake Ford, 21, and a friend ventured out into Hell's Canyon, a steep and narrow out-of-bounds area just outside the Snowbasin Ski Resort in Ogden, at around 10.40am. After making only a few turns, the pair of snowboarders set off a slide, which carried Ford about 1,500 vertical feet to the bottom of a shallow and rocky gully, according to the Utah Avalanche Center. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Blake Ford (left and right), 21, died Wednesday morning after getting caught in an avalanche he had accidentally triggered in the Utah mountains . Daredevil: The slide carried Ford about 1,500 vertical feet to the bottom of a steep, shallow and rocky gully . It took a team of rescuers accompanied by a dog more than an hour to find Ford's body buried in the snow . The 21-year-old native of Morgan, Utah, was buried under about 3 feet of snow, reported Fox 13. Lt. Brandon Toll, of the Weber County sheriff’s office, said Ford's friend tried to come to his aid, but could not locate him. Ford was not wearing an avalanche beacon at the time of the incident . ‘He started to find articles of clothing, gloves and such,’ Toll told KUTV. [He] still couldn’t find his friend.’ It took rescuers accompanied by a dog more than an hour to track down and dig out the snowboarder's body. Ford was not wearing an avalanche beacon at the time of the incident. His companion, who was descending behind him, escaped the avalanche unharmed. According to his Facebook page, Ford, a 2012 graduate of Morgan High School, lived in Ontario, California, and worked as area manager for a solar energy company. He is survived by his parents, a stepfather and three siblings. His grieving mother described the 21-year-old as a hard-working, fun-loving person who died doing what he loved most. At least seven human-triggered avalanches took place on Utah mountains Wednesday, two of them caused by snowboarders.","Blake Ford, 21, was found buried under three feet of snow at the bottom of a rocky gully .

"A deadly Al Qaeda-linked terror attack on a Syrian regime intelligence headquarters yesterday was so massive it measured 2.3 on the Richter scale and registered as an earthquake. At least 20 regime security force members and 14 rebels were killed in the west of Aleppo - the largest city in Syria and the frontline in battles between the Assad regime, the Islamic State, Western-backed rebel groups and the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. The latter group are believed to have carried out yesterday's attack targeting air force intelligence offices, in which they used a tunnel to detonate bombs, creating an explosion so huge that the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre mistook it for an earthquake. Scroll down for video . Attack: The citadel (background) in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo was where 34 people were killed yesterday when Al Qaeda-backed rebels set off a powerful tunnel explosion targeting an intelligence HQ . Huge: Yesterday's terror attack created an explosion so massive that the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre mistook it for an 2.3 magnitude earthquake . Watching the destruction: Members of Syrian opposition forces are seen hiding behind rubble after they blow up the tunnel beneath the Syrian Air Intelligence Directorate's Aleppo branch . Yesterday's attack came just days after the opposition rejected a UN ceasefire plan for the city and as President Bashar al-Assad insisted he continues to enjoy the support of the Syrian people despite nearly four years of war and international pressure on his regime. 'The goal was to storm the building and to control it, but they failed,' Rami Abdel Rahman, the director of UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group . Six civilians were also killed in separate rebel shelling of regime-controlled areas, he said. The attack began with a huge blast from explosives in a tunnel near the intelligence building, the Observatory and a Syrian military source said. 'Gunmen blew up a tunnel that they dug (into the regime-controlled sector) and then attacked the area surrounding the air force intelligence headquarters,' the military source said. Journalists in eastern Aleppo said the blast was heard across the city. It later emerged that the explosion was so huge that it measured 2.3 on the Richter scale and was registered as an earthquake by the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre.

Carnage: The Syrian Air Intelligence Directorate's Aleppo branch is seen going up in smoke after the attack . Rebels from several factions then launched on assault on the building, part of which had collapsed from the explosion, said the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria. The rebels faced heavy resistance from government troops supported by fighters from Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, a key backer of Assad, it said. The assault was repelled with the help of regime air strikes on rebel positions and the clashes eventually subsided. 'Dozens of (rebel) gunmen were killed in artillery and air strikes. The situation is quiet now in the area. There are minor sporadic clashes,' the Syrian military source said. Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front, said on Twitter that its forces, along with other rebel factions, had 'stormed the air force intelligence offices and surrounding buildings'. The attack was the worst reported violence in Aleppo since the rebels  rejected a UN plan to freeze fighting in the northern city on Sunday. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura has made the plan for a temporary ceasefire in Aleppo the centrepiece of his efforts to bring any kind of halt to the conflict in Syria, where more than 220,000 people have been killed since it erupted in March 2011. Militants: Yesterday's attack targeting air force intelligence offices is understood to have been carried out by members of the Al Qaeda-affiliated terror group Nusra Front (pictured) On the run: Members of the rebel First Army try to hide from Assad regime forces' snipers in Aleppo . Warzone: Once Syria's commercial hub, Aleppo has been devastated by fighting that began in mid-2012, and the city is now split between loyalist forces and rebels . De Mistura in October unveiled the proposal to suspend fighting in Aleppo to allow humanitarian aid deliveries and make a first step towards a broader political deal. He held talks in Damascus on Saturday to try to finalise a deal, with a delegation member saying he hoped to set in motion as soon as possible a plan to halt fighting in Aleppo for six weeks. But rebel representatives refused to consider the proposal unless it forms the basis for a 'comprehensive solution' to the conflict through the departure of Assad. De Mistura has angered the opposition by describing Assad as 'part of the solution' to the Syrian conflict. Some Western powers have also cast doubt on the plan, with the French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, saying Tuesday that 'France remains sceptical about the regime's willingness' to follow through on it.

Crunch talks: Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Moqdad (left) meets with United Nations special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura (right) in Damascus last month to discuss the ongoing civil war in the country . Assad yesterday told Portuguese broadcaster RTP that the image of him presented in the West was deeply skewed. 'The people are against him, the regional countries are against him and the West is against him, and (still) he succeeded,' Assad said, speaking in English. 'You're either lying to us or you're talking about Superman because if you don't have Superman, (if) he's a regular president, it means he could withstand four years only because he has the public support.' Wednesday's attack featured a favoured tactic of Syria's rebels -- especially in Aleppo -- of digging tunnels near government buildings and setting off explosives. Fighting in Aleppo erupted in mid-2012, and control of the city -- once Syria's commercial hub -- has since been divided between rebels on the eastern side and the regime in the west. The air force intelligence headquarters in Aleppo is a key strategic site for regime forces and the surrounding area has come under repeated attack from rebel forces.","Al Qaeda-backed Nusra Front group carried out the attack west of Aleppo .

"Whatever efforts Virgin Australia Airlines are making to provide flyers with cheaper fares, one of their passengers would prefer that they spent a little more on the up keep of their planes. One irate passenger was so angry at the lack of cleanliness of his Virgin Australia plane during a flight from Sydney to Melbourne that he took a video of it and uploaded it to YouTube. The man known only as Stuart Mc called the video: ‘Virgin Australia – A Disgrace.’ What looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum . 'And they want us to believe Tiger is the discount carrier.... this is the seat I was allocated this afternoon on VA 868 SYD to MEL. Obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for Virgin Australia,' Stuart Mc commented on the YouTube segment. However it was definitely a warts and all video with dirty seats the first thing that you see. Dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat . As the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum, dust, grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat. It's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while. Even the arm rests were dirty. It was a gross rather than great experience. Not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes. After splashing out up to £9,000 on first class flights on British Airways from Gatwick to the Caribbean, on what was supposed to be a 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat. Dust, detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot . The arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while . Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the service 'Filth Class'. Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off. 'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins . There is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest . 'This is first class. This is British Airways First Class. It's disgusting.' The former BBC anchorman and reporter flew off to St Lucia with a companion on Saturday in First Class seats that retail on BA's website for nearly £9,000 each in peak-season January. In 2000, the Virgin brand entered the Australian aviation market for the first time.

"Military security experts have successfully managed to stop a truck in its tracks by destroying its engine with a laser. The 30-kilowatt fibre laser called Athena burnt through the manifold in seconds, despite being fired by a team from Lockheed Martin positioned more than a mile away. The security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks. Scroll down for video . The laser, known as Athena, was built by Maryland-based security firm Lockheed Martin. During the test, the 30-kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck’s engine (pictured) and disabled it from more a mile away . The demonstration was the first field testing of Lockheed’s integrated 30-kilowatt, single-mode fibre laser weapon system prototype. ‘Fiber-optic lasers are revolutionising directed energy systems,’ said Keoki Jackson, Lockheed Martin chief technology officer. ‘We are investing in every component of the system - from the optics and beam control to the laser itself - to drive size, weight and power efficiencies. Athena is based on the firm’s Area Defense Anti-Munitions (ADAM) laser weapon system. In tests off the California coast in May, Adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile (1.6km). The high-energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military-grade small boats in less than 30 seconds. Lockheed Martin previously demonstrated the system’s capabilities on airborne targets in flight, including small-calibre rocket targets and an unmanned aerial system target. The system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles (5km). ‘This test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks.’ By using a technique known as spectral beam combining, the system blends multiple laser modules to create a single, powerful, high-quality beam. This is said to provide greater ‘efficiency and lethality’ than multiple individual 10-kilowatt lasers used in other systems. Athena is based on the firm’s Area Defense Anti-Munitions (Adam) laser weapon system. In tests off the California coast in May, Adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile (1.6km).

"Finnish authorities take a very dim view of speeding, as they showed when they fined one driver a staggering £40,000 for going just 14mph over the limit. The colossal sum was demanded because in Finland, fines for speeding are scaled up according to the wealth of the law-breaker – and this one, businessman Reima Kuisla, is a multi-millionaire. After he was caught travelling at 64mph in a 50mph zone, the authorities took a peek at his tax return. Reima Kuisla posted a picture of his speeding ticket on his Facebook page, complaining that the Finnish authorities were making life for the rich difficult . It showed that he earned 6.5m euros (£4.72m) a year, so they dished out a 54,000 euro fine, the Iltalehti newspaper reported. The fine has a logic to it, but Mr Kuisla complained bitterly on his Facebook page about the sum he was asked to hand over. He posted a picture of the ticket and said: ‘Finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth. I’m considering leaving the country.’ However, sympathy levels in Finland for his plight have been fairly low. One user wrote on the Iltalehti website: ‘He should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead.’ Earlier this week a British tourist who teaches UK police driving skills was fined for speeding in New Zealand after telling a court his father had been 'caught short' and he was taking him urgently to a toilet. Peter Lee, 46, from Kent, had been clocked at 110mph in a 60mph zone near Hokitika, south of Greymouth, on the South Island - and when he appeared before a Queenstown Court today Judge Michael Crosbie appeared surprised to learn the driver instructed UK police. 'I'm a driving instructor whose work includes teaching driving skills to serving and retiring police officers,' Lee told the court after being asked to explain his work back in England.

"HELL AND HIGH WATER . by Sean Conway . (Ebury Press £10.99) As usual with books about crazed adventures and daft derring-do, this one, about the author’s attempt to swim the length of the British coastline, begins with an account of the preparation involved. However, very unusually for such books and adventures, Sean Conway’s account is mainly about what he hasn’t thought of doing. Charity swimmer Sean Conway, 32 (pictured), arriving at John O'Groats, in the north of Scotland, after being the first person to swim from Lands End to John O'Groats . Just weeks before he’s due to dive into the sea off Land’s End, he hasn’t done any training or sought any funding and has no ‘plan’ to speak of. Nor is this some long-held ambition of his. Indeed, it seems that he only thought of this ultra-long-distance swim up the British coast because his attempt to cycle around the world didn’t happen as he’d have wished — all was going well until he had a crash and, although he completed the pan-global bike ride, it couldn’t get him into the Guinness World Records. So, the swim is meant to fill that crucial gap in his CV. Somehow, he manages to acquire three people to act as his support crew and a cut-price yacht, leaving £110 in his budget for everything else — supplies, equipment, the lot. Not surprisingly, there are those who tell him he’s crazy and that he’d be best off spending his last £110 on the medication his GP would surely be only too happy to prescribe. But on our hero ploughs, somehow gaining a bit of sponsorship (partly from Speedo, the trunks people) and eventually managing to get his support crew to Land’s End to start his Big Swim. Only to discover two problems. First, there’s the temperature: ‘I slowly walked into the water,’ Conway recalls, ‘and was surprised at how cold it was.’ Right . . .Turns out the sea is not only cold, it apparently also has these things called tides. As he’s settling down to his first crawl, it begins to dawn on Conway that he’ll have to time his swims so that he’s going with the tide rather than against it — because even Michael Phelps at full tilt wouldn’t be a match for the current and would start to go backwards. Which is exactly what happens to Conway. Soon after, there’s another problem — seasickness, for Conway, as well as two of his support crew. There are lots and lots of other dangers ahead, almost all of them coming as a shock to our intrepid swimmer. Between Cornwall and the north coast of Scotland, there will be whirlpools, riptides, the mountainous seas off Cape Wrath, busy shipping lanes, a tornado warning and toxic jellyfish. Plus his scabby toe gets worse daily, his wetsuit doesn’t fit properly, he has to eat about 8,000 calories a day, often in mid-swim, and the protein shakes are giving him wind something dreadful. Conway’s original ‘plan’ was that he’d be swimming for two months. A thousand miles of coastline, call it 900 miles for luck, 15 miles a day, 60 days’ swimming. Simples! Well, not quite. His daily distance is initially so low that, by his new calculations, it will take him two years to reach John o’Groats. Then, amazingly, he starts to grind out the miles. More calamities lie in store — running out of money, losing members of his support crew — but Conway copes with them all. And, astonishingly, remarkably and record-breakingly, 135 days after he walked into the surprisingly cold sea off Land’s End, he swims into John o’Groat’s harbour. Wow!","Just weeks before the swim Sean Conway hadn't done any training .

"A KIM JONG-IL PRODUCTION . by Paul Fischer . (Penguin/Viking £14.99) Were it not for the fact that North Korea is despicably tragic, it would be comical in the extreme. As a nation, it is so hermetically sealed — the regime lets ‘few foreigners in and virtually no information out’ — that the population has never heard of Jesus, Santa or Elvis. They fully believe their Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il, who died in 2011, was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun and that when he went into battle, he rode on a unicorn. At the grand age of eight weeks, Kim was walking, talking and dispensing sage military advice. He could control the weather and catch rainbows with his bare hands. The North Koreans believe that their Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il, who died in 2011, was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun . Such was (and is) the potency of North Korea’s messianic cult, however, that dare to laugh at such claims and a prison camp — or ‘custody management centre’ or ‘enlightenment centre’ — awaits. Paul Fischer, in this gripping tale, tells us that a typical penal colony near Pyongyang, the capital city, is bigger than the entire surface area of Los Angeles, with 220,000 inmates. Criminals include painters or poets whose work is ‘too Western’. The Ministry for the Protection of State Security rounds up people who have used more than the allocated quota of electricity, or have been accused of wearing blue jeans, growing their hair too long, reading a foreign newspaper or cracking jokes about Kim’s appearance (Kim Jong-Il’s son, the latest dictator, Kim Jong-Un, is another squat little monster, ‘prone to bursts of anger and bad temper’). There are no trials — simply the whim of the current Kim. One person’s guilt implicates an entire family. ‘Children are executed in front of their mothers, wives in front of their husbands.’ Children who informed on their parents were commended for their patriotism. Husbands suspected of a political crime would beg to be able to shoot their own wives as a sign of loyalty. In this evil hell-hole in Kim Jong-Il’s time, ‘chatter, laughter and singing were forbidden’. If Kim Jong-Il himself had one weakness, however, it was for the movies. Though he had personal control over huge armies and a nuclear arsenal, Kim’s mind was filled less with totalitarian ideology than with ‘James Bond and Rambo . . . His favourite stars were Sean Connery and Elizabeth Taylor’. It must be a mightily strange person who can confuse Elizabeth Taylor with Sylvester Stallone. Nevertheless, Kim set up the Central Film Distribution Centre, which obtained prints from abroad and secretly dubbed them into Korean using professional actors. Fischer says Kramer Vs. Kramer and Mary Poppins were in the Pyongyang vaults — though only Kim was permitted to screen such incendiary foreign fare. It was Kim’s dream to establish ‘a world-class film industry’ but, unfortunately, local productions were boring in the extreme — ‘tedious stories of selfless factory workers and exemplary farm girls’. The North Korean leader (left) had a weakness for films despite the strict regulations he imposed on his country, he wished to establish a 'world-class film industry' The studios had access only to a limited stock of ‘ill-fitting uniforms, wigs and detachable facial hair’. The sets consisted of a Tyrolean chalet and a fake vineyard. Not only that, but actors and actresses often disappeared mid-scene. If they were ‘declared guilty of some obscure offence’, their performances would literally be chopped from the celluloid, ‘rendering the film unintelligible’ when shown. Nor was kissing or a love scene ever depicted — emotion had to be reserved for the Dear Leader. It was a rule that North Korea was always to be shown in rich sunshine. Scenes set abroad had to be uninvitingly dark and rain-swept. In the wider world, Spielberg, Scorsese and George Lucas were emerging so, in 1978, Kim had the idea to abduct a director and star from South Korea, whose ‘knowledge and manpower’ would stimulate his own cinematic ambitions. Shin Sang-Ok and his wife, Choi Eun-Hee, who’d produced ‘melodramas, thrillers, historical epics and martial arts films full of frantic zooms and moving cameras’, were snatched from Hong Kong harbour, drugged and bundled into a speedboat by the North Korean ‘covert operations department.’ They were kept apart and for five years were held in solitary confinement or put under strict house arrest. Kim Jong-Il abducted a South Korean filmmaker Shin Sang-Ok and his wife, Choi Eun-Hee in 9178 in a bid to bring a thriving film industry to North Korea . Choi was made to memorise passages from hagiographies of Kim Jong-Il and his equally demented father Kim Il-Sung. ‘You must bear some pain for the good of the revolution,’ she was told. At gunpoint, she underwent ‘daily compulsory ideology training sessions’. No debate or voicing of doubt was allowed. Shin, having made a feeble attempt to escape, was flung into a prison cell, where he had to sit immobile in the same cross-legged position, staring straight ahead, for 16 hours a day. If he swayed or blinked, he had to thrust his hands through the bars, so that his fingers could be ‘smashed violently with the guard’s baton’. But Shin was lucky. Other prisoners had their fingers and ears melted away by the sheer intensity and duration of electric shocks. No prisoner could sit or lie down, in any event, because the cramped cells were covered with spikes. Sanitation was non-existent. Eventually, in 1983, when it was believed that Shin and Choi had been thoroughly indoctrinated, they were introduced to Kim in person — all 5 ft 2 in of him, in platform shoes and bouffant hair. The Dear Leader invited his ‘guests’ to attend regular feasts and drunken orgies thrown for elite members of the Workers’ Party Central Committee and the Propaganda and Agitation Department. Though the remainder of the country was starving and poverty stricken — subsisting on frogs and mice — Kim indulged himself with imported exotic foodstuffs. Kim Jong-Il (left) is seen her with his son, Kim Jong-Un (right) who is now the North Korean leader since his father's death . He collected motorcycles and Mercedes limousines, built luxurious villas, travelled on private trains and drank expensive Cognac — the annual budget for Hennessy VSOP was $700,000. He paid for all of this with the loans given to the country by Moscow and Beijing, the proceeds of organised crime and bogus insurance claims made against Allianz Global and Lloyd’s of London. Yet if ever a whisper of this excess or embezzlement got out, executions followed. Assuring Kim that ‘I will take part in the revolution’, Shin agreed to make a propaganda film. Here, he believed, was a way of escape. He encouraged Kim to permit a location shoot abroad in Budapest and Vienna. They had built up sufficient trust to be allowed to travel. Though surrounded by armed guards, Shin and Choi made a dash for it in Austria and hid in the American Embassy. They were flown to Virginia. In time, Shin made Ninja films for the Disney Channel and was a juror at Cannes with Clint Eastwood. He died of liver disease in 2006. Choi moved back to Seoul, South Korea, where she continues to live in obscurity, her history disbelieved by her neighbours who regard her as a defector, not a former abductee. It does all sound almost too far-fetched and, well, cinematic to be true, but Fischer assures us he has checked and double-checked the available facts. The book is a nightmarish, clammy adventure story, an absolutely brilliant page-turner.","North Korea lets ‘few foreigners in and virtually no information out'

"News that Uber is acquiring a mapping service has heightened speculation the cab firm is developing its own driverless cars, including the components and software inside. Uber is set to close the deal for San Jose-based firm deCarta 'later this week,' and it would lessen Uber's reliance on Google Maps. The cab service said the acquisition is designed to ‘fine tune’ Uber’s services that rely on maps - but it could also help with the development of an autonomous vehicle. Uber is set to close the deal for San Jose-based firm deCarta 'later this week,' and it would lessen Uber's reliance on Google Maps. The cab service said the acquisition is designed to ‘fine tune’ Uber’s services that rely on maps - but it could also help with the development of an autonomous vehicle . The accurate navigation technology, for example, could be used to train and test autonomous taxis. Uber lets consumers use an app to locate a driver and instantly book a ride. Google Maps software is already integrated into Uber to let users check progress of drivers on their way to pick them up. DeCarta was founded in 1996 and provides services including in-map searching, turn-by-turn navigation, location APIs and more. While it may not be as well-known as Google Maps, its technology is extensively used by consumers. The OnStar system built into cars made by General Motors, for example, relies on deCarta, as do smartphone makers Samsung and BlackBerry. In its early years, Google Maps even tapped into deCarta's technology according to the company. Rumours of the acquisition have been circulating for the past week and Uber has now confirmed its move, although it is not sharing purchase price or financial terms. The acquisition bolsters rumours that Uber is planning to build a rival driverless car to Google's vehicle (pictured).  Uber said it will be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University to create a centre devoted to research and development of mapping, car safety, and 'autonomous technology' 'A lot of the functionality that makes the Uber app so reliable, affordable and seamless is based on mapping technologies,' the company said in a statement. 'With the acquisition of deCarta, we will continue to fine-tune our products and services that rely on maps - for example UberPOOL, the way we compute ETAs, and others - and make the Uber experience even better for our users.' Uber is said to have opened a robotics research facility in Pittsburgh with the intention of creating a self-driving car, going head-to-head with Google's efforts. Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, then joined the Uber board of directors. Last month Bloomberg Business tweeted that Google and Uber are 'going to war over taxis', to which Google's official handle replied: 'We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.' This fuelled speculation because the reply is neither a confirmation, or a denial of the reports . In blog post Uber recently said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University. It is said to have opened a research facility in Pittsburgh with the intention of creating a self-driving car, going head-to-head with Google's efforts. Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, then joined the Uber board of directors. In blog post, Uber recently said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University to create a centre devoted to research and development of mapping, car safety, and 'autonomous technology'. Investors involved in that financing have valued the 6-year-old company at about $40 billion (£26 billion). All told, Uber has raised nearly $6 billion (£4 billion) since its inception, including a $258 million (£170 million) infusion from Google's venture capital arm in 2013. San Francisco-based Uber has grown into one of the world's largest start-ups, and now operates in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world. But the app's growth has also cause friction with existing taxi operations, and posed challenges for regulators. Uber does not employ drivers or own its vehicles, but instead uses independent contractors with their own cars. Since launching in 2010, Uber has also been dubbed a prime example of a 'disruptive' economic force, and taxi drivers in dozens of cities have staged protests against the firm.","Uber told MailOnline it expects to close the deCarta deal 'later this week'

"Julianna Naylor has been jailed after she drove on the wrong side of a dual carriageway, while drunk and upset following a family wedding . An accountant who got drunk at her father's wedding because she was upset that she was not sat with her newly discovered biological family then caused a head on crash when she got behind the wheel. Julianna Naylor, 30, was more than three times over the legal drink drive limit when she drove the wrong way on the A90 dual carriageway near Kinfauns, Scotland. Naylor, who was so drunk she could not remember how she ended up on the wrong side of the trunk road linking Perth and Dundee, caused a head-on crash with a car which was overtaking a heavy goods lorry. She had been at her father's wedding earlier that day and was upset after she was put at a table a distance away from the rest of her family. Naylor had only recently been reunited with her biological father. She was jailed for six months and banned from driving for five years after she admitted the offence and accepted that she 'could have killed someone.' Sheriff Lindsay Foulis told her: 'At the relevant time you were driving when the level of alcohol was more than three times over the legal limit. 'You managed to find yourself on the wrong side of the dual carriageway. Thinking it was a two way road you were driving in the outside lane of the dual carriageway.' He added:  'You very frankly note that you could have killed someone and that you dread to think what could have happened. It is to your credit that you have that insight. 'There are a number of aggravating factors. You were considerably over the legal limit to drive. The element of dangerousness was not momentary. You have a previous conviction for an analogous matter.' Naylor was jailed despite a number 'glowing testimonials' about her job and her overcoming a difficult background. She had a previous conviction for careless drunken driving in 2004. Naylor of Errol, admitted driving while she was more than three times over the limit on 20 September last year. She also admitted driving dangerously and on the wrong side of the dual carriageway before crashing into another car and causing extensive damage to both vehicles. She crashed her Nissan Juke into the Ford Fiesta being driven by Stuart Paterson. Naylor was so drunk she drove the wrong way on the A90 dual carriageway, causing a head-on crash . Fiscal depute Stuart Richardson said it was not clear how Naylor came to be going the wrong way and she was unable to offer any explanation to the court. 'Unfortunately, because of the alcohol taken she found herself on the wrong side of the road,' Mr Richardson said. He said Mr Paterson was overtaking a lorry when he was suddenly confronted by Naylor's car in the outside lane coming towards him at speed. He managed to take partial evasive action and nobody was injured, although both cars were badly damaged. Solicitor David McKie, defending, said: 'To al intents and purposes she is an upstanding member of the community. She voluntarily runs salsa dancing classes in Dundee. 'What happened was a direct result of her family history, and circumstances relating to the emotional impact of attending her biological father's wedding. It was the emotional impact of that day of the wedding and the exclusion she felt.'","Julianna Naylor, 30, had recently been reunited with her biological father .

"A baby girl was born to save her six-year-old big brother suffering from terminal leukaemia... and doctors have found her to be a perfect donor match. Wang Cansen was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of four and he initially responded well to treatment. But when the cancer later returned, doctors informed his parents that without a transplant, he would die, according to The People's Daily. Wang Cansen, six, who has terminal leukaemia, pictured with his baby sister, who was born to save his life . After failing to find a suitable donor to save Cansen's life, his parents decided to have a second baby . Cansen's parents tested themselves and other relatives, but the search for a suitable donor proved fruitless. After learning that a brother or sister would be a possible donor, Cansen's parents decided to have a second baby. But with China's tough one child policy in place, his father Wang Jiyong and mother Liu Chunping had to apply for special permission to have a second baby - which was granted. And they were delighted when doctors told them that their new baby daughter Wang Fanyin, born on January 13, is a suitable match. Cansen (pictured with a volunteer from the blood bank) says he'll protect the sister who saved his life forever . Despite his age, Cansen is well aware that his illness is life-threatening and that his baby sister was born to save him. When his mother was still pregnant with his sister, the little boy touched his mum’s belly and said he would protect his sister forever. After being told she could save him, he said: 'I am happy that I will now live longer, and plan to dedicate all my life to making sure my sister who has saved mine is happy.' He has two dreams: to grow up to become a solider and to go back home to spend some time with his mother and new sister. The six-year-old, pictured in hospital playing his favourite game, called Lian Lian Kan, on his mobile phone . Doctors have been able to save samples from the baby girl's placenta and umbilical cord which will be used to give life-saving treatment to her brother. Wu Chang, a hospital spokesman, said doctors had supported the parents in their desire to have a second child. He said: 'Extracting stem cells was relatively risk-free and painless for both mother and newborn, and offered life to the existing son as the operation has an extremely high success rate.' The operation is now scheduled to take place later this month. Stem cells taken from blood and tissue  in the umbilical cord can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including various forms of cancer. Cord blood and cord tissue stem cells are considered to be one of the most promising sources of future medical treatments. The first successful cord blood stem cell transplant to treat Fanconi's Anemia took place in 1988. Since then, the list of conditions where stem cells are standard therapy has grown to include various forms of Leukaemia and Neuroblastoma, as well as conditions of the blood and the immune system. More than 30,000 cord blood transplants have been performed worldwide and there are more than 300 clinical trials underway.

"As one of the youngest and most successful entrepreneurs in the world, any career advice from Mark Zuckerberg should probably taken fairly serious, or at the very least written down. Speaking at the Mobile World Congress this week - the world's biggest wireless phone fair in Barcelona - the 30-year-old Facebook founder was asked the main thing he looks for in a potential employee. And his answer was as simple as it was significant. 'I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person,' Zuckerberg told the gathering at a town hall meeting. 'It's a pretty good test.' Scroll down for video . 'I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person': Mark Zuckerberg - appearing at the the 2015 Mobile World Congress  in Barcelona on March 2 - gave away some his key career advice . CEO speak: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gives his keynote conference during the first day of the Mobile World Congress 2015 at the Fira Gran Via complex on March 2, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain . Earlier this week, Zuckerberg was forced to fend off complaints that his hugely popular social network was getting a free ride out of telecom operators who host its service on smartphones. He was confronted with tensions between Internet giants such as Facebook and Google and telecom firms present at the Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest wireless phone fair, in Barcelona. Executives have complained that some Internet services' smartphone applications generate revenue while it is the telephone companies that are forced to invest in the networks that host them. The Wall Street Journal on Sunday quoted Denis O'Brien, chairman of international wireless firm Digicel Group, as saying: 'Mark Zuckerberg is like the guy who comes to your party and drinks your champagne, and kisses your girls, and doesn't bring anything.' Zuckerberg later defended himself in an appearance at the congress alongside the heads of several telecom companies with which he is working to launch smartphone Internet access in developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. 'We have these services that people love and that are drivers of data usage... and we want to work this out so that way it's a profitable model for our partners,' Zuckerberg said. Keynote: The annual Mobile World Congress hosts some of the wold's largest communication companies, with many unveiling their latest phones and wearables gadgets . The head of Norwegian company Telenor, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, said it was a 'point of tension' that Facebook and the Whatsapp service that it owns offer free messaging which bypasses the phone companies' own paid services. Telenor is one of the companies working to launch free access to Facebook's phone application in developing countries. In those deals, Facebook is serving as an incentive to draw new customers since it is one of the most in-demand services for smartphone users in emerging markets. 'We need to find a balance because we are the ones that deploy resources locally, we work locally, we create a lot of employment locally, we pay government taxes locally,' Baksaas said. 'There is a financial formula that needs to be balanced in the long run.'","Zuckerberg, 30, essentially looks for people who would make a good boss .

"It has been illegal to drink alcohol on the Tube in London for seven years, but there is now a new way to enjoy cocktails on your commute. A new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from World War Two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage Underground station. Based in Carnaby Street, Cahoots, will transport guests back to the 1940s, in a bid to bring Soho’s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life. Scroll down for video . Enjoy being able to drink on the tube! Cahoot is a 1940s themed bar opening in Soho, and transports guests back to the period, with an old tube carriage for seating, sandbags and classic cocktails . Club owners Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s, complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators . From quirky cocktails served in clocks, to the authentic vintage signs, the centrally-located bar is the brainchild of Charlie Gilkes, 30, and Duncan Stirling, 33. The pair are owners of the Bunga Bunga bar and Maggie’s nightclub, which is inspired by Margaret Thatcher and thought that as the Soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter, it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar. Charlie Gilkes of Inception Group said: 'We decided to open Cahoots, after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war Britain, and the venue's own extraordinary heritage. 'The site was formerly Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. 'It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II and the wartime membership book contains names such as Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Buster Crabbe. With Cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors.' First timers are greeted by the station master, in character, at the entry kiosk and issued a ‘day ticket’ to enter the underground station . During the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick-nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids. To bring Cahoots to life, the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real London Underground fabrics, and leather from the period. They also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations. If the decor is not enough to inspire a visit, the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced £7-£9. Chose to indulge in Dig for Victory-style cocktails, drinks served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, as well as new variations of old favourites. Alternatively the impressive Cahoots signature cocktail is the Tanqueray No.TEN Station Clock, which has a working face, and serves eight for £150. Bottoms up! You are spoilt for choice at Cahoots with eight pages of cocktails including the Give Peas a Chance (£10).  Inspired by gimlets, it is made from  Goose Original vodka, garden peas, lime juice, basil, agave syrup, and a Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial NV champagne foam . When you arrive at the Soho location, you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage . Even the staff are dressed in character, with 1946 outfits, accents, nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar. Another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly-lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth, which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity. The surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s- style singer and musicians, with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future. Cahoots is opening today in Kingly Court, W1, opens on Thursday 5 March, with free entry, and opportunities to reserve tables via the website. As well as serving classic cocktails, black market liquor and post-war favourites are also available, in particular rum and gin based drinks are furtively knocked back from old mugs, hip flasks, vintage milk bottles and tins . Those in groups are able to pass time with the Cahoots signature sharer cocktail, ‘The Tanqueray No. TEN Station Clock’, served in an actual clock with a working clock face . The cocktail list features Dig-for-victory drinks, which fit perfectly in with 1940s theme of the bar, which includes bunting, sandbags and fabric used for old underground tubes . Cahoots is located on the former site of Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. It was used as a bomb shelter during World War II . During the war, several disused underground stations were turned into air raid shelters and Londoners would transform the spaces into a ‘home away from home’, with their own nick-nacks and furnishings . The 1940s-style drinks are served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, and to do a modern twist on classic favourites .","Soho-based Cahoots aims to transport guests back to the war period, with themed cocktails and authentic decor .

"A woman who uploaded a brutally honest 'Marriage CV' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site has become a feminist hero. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well-meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband. Indhuja, who works at the internet company Tripigator, decided to build her own description, with a no-holds-barred description of her likes, dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, created a marriage CV online after her parents tried to find her a husband through a dating site . Speaking on her blog about the profile her parents created, Indhuja said: '[The] details were, name: Indhuja, profession: Software Engineer. 'I went like, ""WTF is happening here,"" because, I am no g***amn software engineer and I'm only 23! 'I am [not a] woman desperate to get married, and that matrimony profile made me look like one.' Indhuja took the profile down and told her parents that she was going to build her own dating profile, telling them to, 'Send this to anyone who has the nerve to ask my hand in marriage.' The so-called 'Marriage CV' is nothing like any dating profile you would find on a wannabe bride's page and even states that she is interested in men who hate children. The profile reads: 'I wear glasses and look dorky in them. Not a spendthrift or a shopaholic. 'Detest masala & drama, not a TV fan. I don't read. Indhuja's marriage CV . 'NOT a womanly woman. Definitely not marriage material. Won't grow long hair, ever.' Indhuja then went on to describe the sort of man she would be interested in hearing from. She said: 'Looking for: A man, preferably bearded, who is passionate about seeing the world. 'Someone who earns for himself and does NOT hate his job. Extra points to the one who hates kids. 'Points for a great voice and an impressive personality. Should be able to hold a conversation for at least 30 minutes.' She added: 'If you think you qualify, I recommend you re-think. If you are sure, I suggest you show this website to your parents. 'If you're still sure, try imagining a life with someone like me.' After just 48 hours, the CV went viral, with people from as far away as Australia and Canada picking it up. Indhuja says that the response to her piece has been overwhelming . Indhuja is now being hailed as the face of modern India - a woman who's not afraid to challenge traditional perceptions of femininity and womanhood. And her blog post has touched a nerve in the same week the BBC plan to air India's Daughter, a documentary exploring the attitudes to women that formed the background for the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus in 2012. Filmmaker Leslee Udwin, who made the programme which will show on BBC4 on Sunday, March 8, was disturbed that the men who perpetrated the crime barely seemed to realise they'd done anything wrong. The bus driver Mukesh Singh said: 'A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy.' While one of the laywers for the men, told  Udwin: 'We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman.' Yet despite this, Indhuja's gutsy marriage profile was met with widespread support. In a follow-up post she revealed the impact of her marriage CV. 'For starters, people like genuine guts. They respect confident and free women, in the right way,' she wrote. 'Many women could relate to the plight of their parents pestering them to get married. And men, without a choice, could only dream of marrying someone like the woman in the profile, me.' And it's clear from comments on the site that Indhuja articulated the frustrations held by modern women in India trying to juggle their hopes and ambitions with  the expectations of their traditional parents. One commenter writes: 'I am just 20 and is already being pressurized to start ""looking"" (from orthodox muslim family here) and I am holding out on my own. 'But IF I ever consider going the marriage route, I think I'll just get inspired by you and create something like yours to sieve out the ones I'd want to ever get married to and to scare off the kind I'd rather avoid! :D' Another says: 'I'm too 24, and seriously, all this ""do-you-have-a-boyfriend/are-you-marriage-material etc etc etc"",the list goes till infinity,haunts me at nights!! 'Why can't the society accepts us,THE TOMBOYS,as the way we are!!'","Indhuja Pillai's parents created a dating profile to find her a husband .

"Suad Awad, 41 (pictured outside court), lunged at extended relative Amina Essa at Shepherd's Bush Mosque in west London. She bit a chunk out of her face before spitting the skin on the floor . A mother-of-two who bit a chunk out of a fellow worshipper's face at a mosque before spitting the skin out on the floor has been spared jail. Suad Awad, 41, lunged at extended relative Amina Essa at Shepherd's Bush Mosque in west London on May 4, 2013. Ms Essa, who said she could 'think of no reason why there could be bad blood between them', was left needing plastic surgery for the wound above her left eye. Awad, a Somali-born unemployed part-time student who lives in Shepherd's Bush, has now pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm at Isleworth Crown Court. The court heard that there appeared to be no motive for the incident, although the prosecution hinted at a dispute after Ms Essa apparently made comments about Awad's husband. Nadeem Holland, prosecuting, said: 'The victim was leaving the mosque after completing her prayers and came across the defendant, who appeared to be entering. 'They are known to each other as members of the same extended family, their grandmothers are sisters. 'Ms Essa could think of no reason there could be bad blood between them, but there was a phone call several months earlier when she was supposed to have made comments about the defendant's husband. 'Ms Essa says the defendant jumped at her and could immediately feel the defendant biting her and heard a crunching noise and heard her spit. 'She says: ""The blood came down like rain down my face."" 'The defendant attempted to bite her a second time on the nose and Ms Essa moved her head and tried to push the defendant away and as she did the defendant bit down on the middle finger of her right hand. The incident occurred at Shepherd's Bush Mosque in west London (pictured above) on May 4, 2013 . 'As Ms Essa tried to pull her finger away the defendant bit again, holding it in her mouth. 'She was shouting: ""Let go, help, help"" and two women intervened and assisted in getting the defendant off Ms Essa.' Ms Essa has been receiving ongoing treatment for her wounds, including plastic surgery in which doctors have taken fat from another part of her body to use as a skin graft. Andrew Sheriff, Awad's lawyer, agreed that there appeared to be no motive for the attack and said it was a 'one-off incident'. He said: 'The parties can't assist with the motivation for the attack and the probation report suggests cultural or religious differences. 'There was no pre-meditation, she was not following the victim and it seems to be an accidental meeting and resulted in what she describes as an absolute moment of madness. 'This is a one-off incident in her life and there is remorse shown and no suggestion of on-going animosity. She is the sole carer of children aged seven and five.' Judge Andrew McDowall handed Awad a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years. He also gave her a two-year probation order and made her the subject of a three-year order prohibiting her from contacting the victim. Sentencing her, he said: 'There's no explanation for what you did. It has been called a moment of madness, but for your unfortunate victim it is going to be a permanent problem. Awad was handed a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) 'You are saved from an immediate prison sentence by the fact you pleaded guilty, that you have family responsibilities, you are of good character and it would be undue punishment on your children.' Speaking to the victim, Judge McDowall said: 'I can only express sympathy towards you and if there were means to give you compensation from the defendant I would. 'I can only give advice that you may be eligible for compensation from public monies, but I cannot make any orders.'","Suad Awad bit extended relative Amina Essa at Shepherd's Bush Mosque .

"Chelsea Clinton went by the pseudonym Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding, a new report has revealed. At the center of the controversy is Hillary Clinton's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com, which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a Senate committee to join newly elected President Barack Obama's cabinet. The New York Times reports that Clinton used the address for everything from official government business to matters relating to the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department confirmed on Wednesday that was Clinton's only email alias during her tenure in the Obama administration. News articles detailing the former secretary of state's arrangement to have her government correspondence run through a private domain name and self-run server have set off alarms about the possibility of her sensitive communications being hacked or destroyed. Scroll down for video . Marc Mezvinsky, Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, Chelsea Clinton and former President Bill Clinton pose during the wedding of Chelsea  and Marc at the Astor Courts Estate on July 31, 2010 in Rhinebeck, New York. A news report reveled that Chelsea used to go  by the pseudonym of Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding . At least one of Hillary Clinton's longtime aides, Huma Abedin, who is still on Clinton's payroll, had one of the coveted Clintonemail.com addresses, as well, the Times reports. In the beginning, Chelsea Clinton used the same domain name for her email address, under the name Diane Reynolds, which the Times says she also gave to hotels when she checked in, but switched over to chelseaoffice.com at the urging of the family's advisers. Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Bill Clinton ran his email through presidentclinton.com. The Clintons' server was run out of their Chappaqua, New York, home. According to Bloomberg, they transferred it to a commercial provider, MX Logic, after Hillary departed the State Department. The Clintonemail.com domain name was originally registered to Bill Clinton confidante Eric Hothem, the Times discovered. Hothem is the same aide who was charged with packing up and carting off furniture from the White House at the end of Bill Clinton's presidency that he said was 'Clinton’s personal property.' The furnishings were later determined to be government property, however, and the Clintons were required to pay  $86,000 in restitution for the items they kept. Others, they had to return. Hothem now works in finance in Washington, D.C., and another former Clinton staffer's name is on the server registration - Justin Cooper. It is set to expire in 2017, when Hillary Clinton would theoretically take office if she were to compete for and win the presidency next year. Cooper has also since left the employment of the Clintons for Teneo Holdings, a firm managed by a former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Band. In a tweet late on Wednesday, the likely Democratic presidential candidate said she asked the State Department to release the 55,000 pages emails she turned over. A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set' The Clintons are pictured here at a conference for their family foundation in September. Hillary Clinton became a name partner in the endeavor after she left the State Department in 2013. Chelsea Clinton at one time used the same domain name for her emails as her mother. Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation while at State if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Chelsea migrated to chelseaoffice.com and Bill ran his email through presidentclinton.com . While the email addresses of all secretaries of state before John Kerry doubled as both their personal and professional points of contact, Clinton's deliberate decision to keep her exchanges out of the reach of the federal government has come under intense scrutiny. The White House and the State Department have been careful to state that to their knowledge, all of Clinton's emails have been secured, and additional questions should be directed at Clinton and her team. A spokesman for Clinton has said that the top-ranking diplomat transmitted all of government-related communications to the State Department, but no proof positive of that assertion exists. A security expert who spoke to Bloomberg News warned that in maintaining her own server, Clinton retains the power to wipe all of her data without a trace. 'You erase it and everything’s gone,' Matt Devost, the president & CEO of global cybersecurity firm FusionX, said. Another expert, threat intelligence analyst Alex McGeorge told Bloomberg that Clinton's encryption system was misconfigured and could be hacked. House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday of the debacle that, 'It does beg the question: Were there any sort of classified pieces of information that were flowing through her personal email account?' Comparing the disclosure to that of former CIA chief David Petraeus, who plead guilty this week to mishandling classified information, Chaffetz pointed out that sharing classified information over email ''with somebody who didn't have a classification' is a crime. A State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday there's 'no indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes,' however. Instead, Clinton had her staff print out classified documents for her or discussed that information over secure phone and video conference calls. At the center of the controversy is Hillary Clinton's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com, which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a Senate committee to join newly elected President Barack Obama's cabinet. The two are seen here at an October 2008 rally . On Wednesday evening Clinton made her first public comments on the fracas. She wrote on Twitter: 'I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.' Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed on Thursday while in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  that the department 'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way.' A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set.' Clinton's team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. Republicans aren't convinced that her entire body of work was disclosed, however, and they're calling for investigations into the matter. A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account. And the Republican National Committee asked the State Department's inspector general on Thursday insisting it launch an examination of its own to ensure that Clinton followed the law. Cause of Action, a conservative watchdog group, accused Clinton on Thursday of 'selectively' turning over her correspondence to State, which it said is 'disingenuous and entirely inadequate.' Clinton's request that State make public her emails 'does nothing to address the key questions of whether official communications were deleted or whether sensitive classified information was put at risk,' the group's executive director, Dan Epstein, said in a statement. 'Americans deserve a full investigation into whether evidence exists that official communications weren't being reported for public records, but there may be no way to know for sure,' Epstein said. 'This is exactly why this kind of behavior is against the law. It belies the spirit of openness and transparency in government.

"Former F1 world champion Fernando Alonso was so badly concussed in his pre-season crash last month that when he regained consciousness he had forgotten the past 20 years of his life, it has been reported. Alonso, who races for McLaren-Honda, crashed at 150mph on February 22 during pre-season testing and was rushed to hospital where he spent three days under observation. Asked by doctors who he was, what sort of work he was in and what he wanted to be in the future, he replied: 'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver,' it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Formula 1 ace Fernando Alonso waves to supporters as he leaves hospital on February 25 . McLaren-Honda claimed doctors found Alonso to be 'asymptomatic' with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury'. Here he is pictured in hospital following the accident . Two days ago McLaren-Honda stated doctors had found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. However, worrying reports in Spain's El Pais newspaper suggest his concussion was so severe when doctors asked him questions he thought it was 1995 and aged 13. The paper also claimed he could not remember his F1 debut in 2001, the victories of his beloved Real Madrid or his two world championship titles and it took him a week to recover these memories. Meanwhile, McLaren-Honda confirmed two days ago that he would be sitting out the start of the F1 season on doctors' advice. A spokesperson said: 'His doctors have advised that he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting, which will take place on March 13th, 14th and 15th. 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice, and the two McLaren-Honda cars will therefore be driven in Australia by Fernando’s team-mate Jenson Button and the team’s test and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen.' McLaren did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya. At the time, McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'. After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four on the track. Alonso was airlifted to hospital immediately following the crash (pictured) at the Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya last month . Medical staff arrived on the scene to give Alonso treatment at the side of the road after the accident . McLaren driver Alonso was taken by helicopter to hospital following the accident in Catalonia . Teenage years: Fernando Alonso, pictured here in 2001 at the age of 16, had forgotten 20 years of his life after being concussed in a pre-season crash last month . Although he was technically given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in the heavy crash, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' forced him out of the start of the racing season. The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, he said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' #countdownMalaysia.' Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . For the Albert Park event his seat will be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.

"A mother-of-two  received an emotional trip down memory lane when a time capsule hidden by her late father 28 years ago was discovered by the new owners of her childhood home. Claire Brissenden remembers helping her father Ivan refurbish the family home in Heaton, Newcastle in the late 1980s but she had no idea he had used the renovation to hide a time capsule in her bedroom. So the 43-year-old was amazed when she picked up a Facebook message from the new owners of the house, informing her of the  find. Scroll down for video . Claire Brissenden (centre) visits her childhood home in Heaton, Newcastle with daughter Zoe Brissenden-Lang, seven (pictured) after current owners, Beth Barnes (left) and Chris Pearson (right) discovered a time capsule . This week Ms Brissenden took her family back to the house she had not set foot in for quarter of a century to see for the first time the contents of the 1987 package, including a letter written by her late father Ivan when she was just 15. 'It's weird,' she said as she arrived with husband Anton Lang and excited children Zoe, seven, and five-year-old Dexter. 'I feel quite emotional,' said Claire, who was the youngest child and very close to her father, who died five years ago at the age of 85. 'But I'm disappointed there's not more personal stuff in there like a photo. The time capsule was put together in 1987 and includes a handwritten letter from Ms Brissenden's father and a copy of the Mail on Sunday . Ivan Brissenden (pictured), Claire's late father, had hidden the time capsule while he was revamping the Newcastle home they shared in the 1980s - but she had no idea that he'd hidden a time capsule in her bedroom . The package had been wrapped in plastic on which was written 'Documents from the year 1987. Please open'. Inside, among tin foil wrapping, was a copy of the Mail on Sunday- then just 40p- the Independent and You Magazine alongside Ms Brissenden's father's letter noting historic details from the time. In it he wrote: 'My name is Ivan Brissenden. I have been converting this room for my daughter Claire, aged 15. This note was written in June 1987 . The current homeowners, Beth Barnes (left) and Chris Pearson (right) tracked down Ms Brissenden on Facebook after coming across her name in her father's letter .

In 1987, Glenn Edwards, 27, and another person were arrested at the Trooping the Colour ceremony- an annual event at Horse Guards Parade to celebrate the Queen's birthday- armed with a CS gas canister and a cosh.

But what did surprise her was the fact this one was not presented in quite the way she would expect from someone so creative. 'It's a manky plastic bag - I wanted a time capsule!' she said. Chris and Beth now plan to rebury the time capsule in another location in the house.

"A charity volunteer who set up a tripwire in a dark hallway to make her neighbour fall down two flights of stairs has walked free from court. Janet Pearson, 58, tied  wire across the top of a staircase at the luxury apartments she shared with former model Kari Anderson in Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire, in the early hours of the morning. A court heard she knew the 42-year-old wouldn't see the trap due to the hallway light being out and she was left with serious injuries to her face, neck and back. Janet Pearson, 58, (left) was handed a suspended sentence today after she deliberately set up a tripwire and caused her neighbour, Kari Anderson, (right) to fall down a set of stairs, injuring her face, neck and back . Judge Rajeer Shetty at Chester Crown Court described the incident as 'malicious and pre-meditated' and today handed Pearson a 12-month jail term, suspended for two years. The jury was told the neighbours had repeatedly argued over various matters and there had been 'a number of issues' dating back to summer 2013. Prosecutor Kimberley Obrusik explained that in one instance Pearson put her belongings in a storage cupboard which Miss Anderson paid to have installed. The former model and law graduate also claims Pearson moved in a homeless man, who hurled abuse at her and put cigarette butts in her flowerpots. She has previously accused her neighbour of being jealous of her and described seeing Pearson sitting in an upstairs window - overlooking the driveway - and watching her go about her business. Miss Anderson also noticed she changed her appearance and dress style to seemingly look like her - comparing the situation to the film 'Single White Female'. Kari Anderson, a former model, was left with serious bruising to her face and chest (pictured) She also noticed that large amounts of her mail were going missing, including bank statements and business letters, from the shared letterbox in the apartment complex. Meanwhile Pearson accused the ex-model of cutting the wire of some fairy lights outside her flat. The court heard how things came to a head on the morning of January 21, 2013, when Miss Anderson tripped over the wire laid by Pearson, who requires a stick to walk. Miss Anderson, who has lived in a penthouse flat with her 25-year-old son directly above Pearson for 15 years, told the court: 'I was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. 'The lights hadn't worked since November the year before so I was being careful. I felt something sharp on my shin and that was the last thing I remember. 'I fell down two flights of stairs. I was lying at the bottom crying because I'd hurt my wrist really badly. I have a fused wrist and it bent backwards. It can't do that and I still remember the pain. 'I could taste blood. It was on my face and in my hair. 'As I walked back up the stairs, I used my phone to see what had caused me to fall. I shone the light at the top of the stairs and then I saw the wire. 'Her door was closed on the wire to keep it in place.' The mother-of-two, who owns a property business and a separate beauty company, was so severely injured that she needed surgery following the incident. She added: 'I damaged my neck as well as my nose, left check bone, jaw, several teeth and left eye socket. 'I'm unable to open my mouth wide enough for the dentists to deal with these problems. After the fall Miss Anderson grabbed her phone light to see what she had tripped over and spotted the wire . 'I now have to have corrective surgery to my right wrist. It's impossible for me to walk long distances or stand for long periods. 'Because of all my injuries, I've been off work since the incident.' Miss Anderson told the court she had also been prescribed medication for anxiety and had been left £12,000 out of pocket as a result of having to hire extra staff to help her manage her businesses. Following a two-day trial at Preston Crown Court, a jury dismissed Pearson's claims that she had no reason to set a tripwire. They took just three hours and 25 minutes to find her guilty of causing actual bodily harm. Judge Shetty, sentencing, said: 'You knew that Miss Anderson often left in the early hours of the morning and you knew that because the hallway light wasn't working, it would be dark when she left. 'You put a wire across the top of the stairs to act as an improvised tripwire. Miss Anderson lived in a penthouse flat with her 25-year-old son directly above Pearson for 15 years at the exclusive Clifton Drive in Lytham - where a three-bedroom flat can sell for £450,000 (pictured) 'When the emergency services were called you wasted no time in trying to dismantle the scene to cover up your actions.' He also made Pearson the subject of a two-year supervision order, issued her with a six-month curfew and told her she must pay £4,000 in compensation to Miss Anderson. 'Her injuries could have been much more severe,' Judge Shetty added. 'You wanted Miss Anderson to suffer to any extent to try and teach her some kind of lesson. 'I watched you throughout the trial and observed you give lie after lie. You showed no remorse then and you show no remorse now.' Properties on the exclusive Clifton Drive in Lytham, where the defendant and her victim lived, have sold for as much as £450,000 for a three-bedroom flat and £1.65million for a detached house.","Janet Pearson, 58, tied wire across the top of a staircase at the luxury flats .

"Minister Jo Swinson said the recordings would provide evidence under new Consumer Rights Bill . People should make smartphone recordings of dealings with tradesmen, builders, decorators and even hairdressers to ensure they stick to their word, a minister said yesterday. Jo Swinson said the recordings would provide evidence under a new Consumer Rights Bill that will ensure verbal agreements are enforceable. The Bill will go through its final stages in the Commons on Monday and come into force in October, giving the public stronger powers to challenge firms that treat them badly. The Consumer Affairs Minister said the system will make the rules on complaints and refunds much clearer for the public and businesses. The Bill also includes new rights for people who buy and download content from the web, whether it is a Hollywood film, a computer game or a song. The minister said the recordings of conversations with traders should be made openly and would form part of any legally-binding agreement, along with documents, emails and text messages. She said they could be used in many circumstances, including a hairdresser promising to cut hair in a particular style. Her comments follow the controversy triggered by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who suggested families should demand receipts from small traders to help ensure tax is paid. Miss Swinson, a Liberal Democrat, stressed that verbal agreements will have the force of a written contract from the autumn, particularly if they are backed up with a recording. ‘If you make a verbal agreement with a trader, then that forms part of the contract,’ she said. ‘If you say I want you to paint my bathroom a particular shade of mint green, but they then use a different one, then they have not delivered what was agreed. ‘It is important for people to have agreements and to have a note of those. Email will be one way that a lot of people do that, sometimes it might be a text message. People could also use their phone to record the conversation, if both parties found that was an easier way of doing it.’ The minister stressed she was not suggesting any kind of secret recording. When asked if they could include consultations with hairdressers, the minister said: ‘Absolutely, yes.’ The Minister said people should use their smartphones to record dealings with tradesmen, builders, decorators and hairdressers.  Miss Swinson said the recordings with traders should be made openly . Miss Swinson said in some circumstances customers would use the recordings to encourage the trader to put a job right, in others they would support a demand for a refund. She gave the example of a children’s balloon entertainer who missed a birthday party by turning up two hours later than agreed as someone who would be expected to give the customer their money back. The minister said the best option is to get a written contract, but she said traders should understand that verbal agreements are also legally binding. However, Hilary Hall, chief executive of the National Hairdressers’ Federation, said her members might find the idea of being recorded ‘unnerving’. ‘I can see why consumers might want to do it, but I imagine anyone would feel uneasy about being recorded on a smartphone,’ she said. ‘It can be hard for someone to describe what they want, and very hard for a hairdresser to exactly describe what they are going to do. Even a recording won’t resolve this, because two people can come away from the conversation with different ideas.’ The Sales of Goods Act already gives shoppers some rights to repairs and refunds. The Government says the new regime simplifies existing laws.","Minister Jo Swinson says people should record dealings with tradesmen .

"A new report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shows inmates released from the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are still returning to the battlefield and fighting against the United States and other Western nations. Since releases began under President George W. Bush, 116 men held in the facility famous for interrogations and orange jumpsuits have been 'confirmed of reengaging' in hostilities, according to ODNI. Of those, 23 are back in custody and 25 are dead – including some killed by American drone strikes and other military operations. But 68 are at large, including 5 released by President Barack Obama since his 2008 campaign pledge to close 'Gitmo' forever. Another 69 are 'suspected of reengageing,' and 55 of them are on the loose. James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, testified in a Feb. 26 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that 2014 will go down as the deadliest year for terrorism since records were first kept . Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is a political flashpoint with Republicans wanting to keep terrorists outof harm's way and Democrats believing the facility's continued operation inflames hostilities against America . Obama's batting average looks far better than Bush's on paper. More than 20 per cent of the Guantanamo detainees released by order of the former president are once again considered enemy combatants in the war on terror. Among Obama's releases, that number barely hits 5 per cent. But a retired U.S. military intelligence officer told Daily Mail Online that the numbers are misleading. 'No one gets out of Guantanamo, goes right back to the front lines, and winds up in a CIA report in the same week,' he said Thursday. 'It can take months or years for them to feel confident enough to start waging jihad again, out in the open, with the U.S. and their host government keeping tabs on them.' 'And ODNI can only put in a public report what it can confirm. That sometimes takes even more years. So it's deceptive.' The source spoke on condition of anonymity. 'Are there more Bush transfers back at it than Obama transfers? Probably not,' he said. 'But the intelligence community has had more than six years to track Bush's. So they know more. Six years from now Obama's numbers will look pretty much the same.' 'These guys don't rejoin al-Qaeda overnight.' 203 Afghanistan . 123 Saudi Arabia . 63 Pakistan . 22 Yemen . 17 Algeria . 14 Great Britain . 12 Morocco . 12 Sudan . 11 Kuwait . 11 Tajikistan . 11 Albania . 9 France . 9 Kazakhstan . 9 Slovakia . 8 Russia . 7 Iraq . 6 Palau . 6 Georgia . 6 Qatar . 6 Uruguay . 5 Jordan . 5 Bahrain . 5 Spain . 4 Oman . 4 Bosnia and Herzegovina . – Source: New York Times / NPR . Speaking to the fact-checking website Politifact in January, a spokesman for Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain echoed that sentiment. 'It can take some time for us to identify (former detainees) on the field of battle,' said the spokesman, Brian Rogers, 'and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged.' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper concludes his report by predicting that the problem of Guantanamo recidivism isn't going away. 'Based on trends identified during the past eleven years, we assess that some detainees currently at GTMO will seek to reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities after they are transferred,' his report reads. Spokespersons for the National Security Council in the White House directed questions back to ODNI. The White House typically negotiates terms of release with foreign governments that will accept prisoners, often their home countries. To date at least 55 nations have taken them in, with the U.S. enforcing varying conditions on their release. Afghanistan leads the list, folllowed by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen. Thosase four countries alone are now home to more than 400 former Guantanamo prisoners. Yemen has destabilized in recent weeks with the ouster of its U.S.-backed government, raising concerns about the status of the 22 men repatriated there. Obama sent six of them in 2009, according to data compiled by The New York Times and NPR. But even in a more stable country like France, the destination for nine former Guanatanamo inmates – and even when the U.S. places residency and other restrictions on prisoner releases – Clapper admits some will pick up where they once left off. 'While enforcement of transfer conditions may deter reengagement by many former detainees and delay reengagement by others,' his report reads, 'some detainees who are determined to reengage will do so regardless of any transfer conditions.' The Obama administration has clear guidelines about what qualifies as terrorist recidivism. 'Planning terrorist operations, conducting a terrorist or insurgent attack against Coalition or host-nation forces or civilians, conducting a suicide bombing, financing terrorist operations, recruiting others for terrorist operations, and arranging for movement of individuals involved in terrorist operations' are all activities that qualify. Communicating with other former Guanatanamo prisoners or propagandizing against the U.S., by themselves, don't count. LOCKUP, EXTENDED STAY: President Barack Obama pledged to close the prison by early 2010 but has struggled to transfer, try or release the remaining detainees from the facility . New concerns about stocking Islamist terror armies with new recruits via Guantanamo releases come as terrorism incidences and casualties are on the rise. 'In 2013, just over 11,500 terrorist attacks world-wide killed approximately 22,000 people,' Clapper told a Senate panel on Feb. 26. 'Preliminary data for the first nine months of 2014 reflect nearly 13,000 attacks, which killed 31,000 people.' 'When the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled,' he said. The sprawling Guantanamo Bay prison complex on the island of Cuba is still home to 122 detainees, a number that the White House wants to see dip below 100 in order to make the facility's eventual closure seem inevitable. Fully 55 of them have already been cleared to go. The U.S. secretary of defense, by statute, makes the final determination about which Guantanamo prisoners must stay and which can be resettled in less restrictive settings. Former Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel's departure was reportedly brought about, in part, because of his reluctance to agree with all the White House's recommendations. New Defense Secretary Ash Carter has not yet demonstrated his thinking with a raft of new release announcements. TIME OUT: Republicans want to pass a 2-year moratorium on new Guantanamo Bay prisoner releases but the . Last month a quartet of Republican senators led by Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire introduced a bill that would make it harder to send anyone home from Guantanamo. It has already been approved by the Armed Services Committe. The legislation would temporarily prohibit the White House from releasing any of the remaining inmates if they were determined to be 'high' or 'medium' risk hen they were first captured, regardless of the current assessment of military brass. The congressional time-out would last for two years, essentially tying Obama's hands unti lthe end of his term in office. The White House looks dimly on the idea. Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters on Feb. 12 aboard Air Force One that 'our position is that the continued operation of Guantanamo Bay, the facility there, weakens our national security, and (it) must be closed.' 'We believe this bill puts more constraints on a process that should be actually working faster. And so we oppose this legislation, and the President would veto it.'
