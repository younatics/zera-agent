"A second man has appeared in court accused of killing his great-uncle outside a gipsy family wedding. William McGinley, 26, is charged the murder of Bernard McGinley close to a church in rural County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, last month moments before the traveller wedding was due to start. Last month's ceremony for the marriage of Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, was delayed for a short period after the shooting but still went ahead. William McGinley from County Longford, Ireland, appears at Omagh Court charged with the murder of great-uncle Bernard McGinley . The accused's father, Patrick McGinley, 46, has already appeared in court charged with the murder of the 63-year-old grandfather from County Longford in the Irish Republic who was shot in the chest in front of his wife, Brigid. William McGinley, who has been remanded in custody, is also charged with the attempted murder of the dead man's son. Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot dead outside a church in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland . Bernard McGinley Jnr was injured in the same incident which took place  outside St Mary's Catholic Church in the village of Newtownbutler- just before the bride was due to walk down the isle. The defendant, who is a cousin of the bride, appeared at Omagh Magistrates' Court wearing a grey fleece over a white T-shirt. William McGinley, who, like his father, is from Lisfarrell, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood the charges he faces during the short hearing. McGinley's lawyer, Seamus Leonard, said his client denied involvement. 'This man has consistently denied any criminality,' he said, stressing that he had provided police with a 'full account' of what happened. Mr Leonard said it was not alleged that William McGinley fired the shot that killed Bernard McGinley. 'But it is alleged he fired the shot which attempted to murder Bernard McGinley Jnr,' he added. McGinley was remanded in custody to appear in court in Enniskillen, via video-link, alongside his father on March 16. Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned. Just married: Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, are pictured in the hours after their wedding . He explained: 'They said 'father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding', so I proceeded with the wedding. They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.' The victim was flown to hospital from Lisnaskea in a police helicopter but died later. Tributes were later paid to him. Cousin Willie McGinley said on Facebook: 'R.I.P. Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' And Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.' Dramatic: The bride and members of the wedding party leave the church after the service earlier this month .

"A couple in Nevada are fighting for a change in the law after being denied the chance to become foster parents because they have permits to carry guns. Brian and Valerie Wilson of Las Vegas say they had always planned to become foster parents and adopt, but were shocked to discovered that they couldn't because of their guns. On Wednesday they testified before the state Assembly Judiciary Committee to ask lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow residents to carry loaded weapons on their person or in a car and still serve as foster parents. Their request was denied. Brian and Valerie Wilson of Las Vegas say they had always planned to become foster parents and adopt, but were shocked to discovered that they couldn't because of their guns . 'I am really heartbroken that the Department of Child and Family Services gave us this denial letter,' Valerie Wilson told Las Vegas Review Journal. 'I really want a family.' The Wilsons said they got the gun permits years ago after they were victims of an attempted home invasion. The Wilson's bill would have allowed Nevadans with concealed-weapons permits, and law enforcement officers, to carry loaded weapons on their person in a home or car and still be eligible to be foster parents. If not carried on their person, the weapons would be required to be kept in a secure safe, but they could remain loaded. Current rules reportedly require guns and ammunition to be stored separately in secure containers in homes with foster children. 'It just doesn't make sense,' Brian Wilson told Fox News. 'We're talking about law-abiding people, people who have had background checks. On Wednesday the Wilson's testified before the Nevada State Assembly Judiciary Committee to ask lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow residents to carry loaded weapons on their person or in a car and still serve as foster parents - it was rejected . 'We're not talking about leaving a firearm around the house,' he said. The bill was sponsored by Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, R-Las Vegas. 'We have children in need of great foster care, and we have had people that are law-abiding citizens that have gotten their background checks, that have their CCWs, literally denied to foster a child because they have a concealed-weapons permit,' she said. The bill was opposed by Assemblywoman Olivia Diaz, D-North Las Vegas, who said foster children are often traumatized and exposure to weapons would be inappropriate. The committee also heard from Jill Marano, deputy administrator of the state Division of Child and Family Services, who opposed the bill in its current form. While the agency's goal was to work with foster parents, she said she had grave concerns and cited 16 incidents over the past four months in which children were involved in the accidental discharge of a loaded weapon.","Brian and Valerie Wilson of Las Vegas were shocked to discovered that they couldn't adopt children because of their gun permits .

"A teenager who fears she won't be able to have children after being hit between the legs by a water fountain has revealed how the accident has ruined her sex life. Shelby Clarke, from Manchester, fears her boyfriend Danny Lendon will cheat on her as she isn't able to enjoy sex after suffering serious gynaecological injuries in the incident in Blackpool. The 19-year-old, who has now been awarded a five-figure settlement over the incident, was on a family trip when she was hit by a jet at The Pleasure Beach, leaving her needing two hours of surgery and 250 stitches. Shelby Clarke, now 19, had the accident when she was only 14 at Blackpool's Pleasure Beach . The attraction (pictured), called The Spectacular Dancing Water Fountain, caused her injuries which look to doctors like she had been raped . Although Miss Clarke has now agreed compensation with The Pleasure Beach, says her sex life has been almost ruined by the accident - and she does not know whether she will be able to have children without complications in the future. She said: 'Having sex was excruciating at first. Even now, I can't have sex as much as I would like, and so that makes me worry that my boyfriend will lose patience and cheat on me. 'I don't know if I can have a baby naturally in the future - my doctors say we will just have to wait and see.' Miss Clarke had gone to Blackpool as a Halloween treat with her mum, Karen, step-father, James, and her friend, Sarah, in October 2009. Care manager Karen, 45, said: 'We had stayed in the same hotel several times before; it was around the corner from the Pleasure Beach so it was ideal. Shelby first met her boyfriend, Danny Lendon at 17 - three years after the incident - but sexual intercourse left her crippled in pain . Shelby (pictured left) was only 14 when she went on holiday with her family (pictured right - mum and dad) when one of the jets of the Blackpool attraction knocked her off her feet and she suffered gynaelogical injuries . 'When we arrived, the girls went off to The Pleasure Beach and arranged to be back for our evening meal. Sarah was 16 and Shelby was 14 and they were sensible girls.' At The Pleasure Beach, the teenagers noticed a new attraction, The Spectacular Dancing Water Fountain, which was a series of water jets, shooting up through paving stones. The centre-piece jet was the most powerful, shooting up to 200 feet into the air. Miss Clarke said: 'There were loads of kids running through the water jets so Sarah and I joined in. But as were playing, I was hit by a very powerful jet. 'It knocked me off my feet and I felt I needed to go to the toilet immediately. But I noticed there was blood everywhere.' Sarah helped her back to the hotel, where Karen called an ambulance. When Shelby (left) realised there was something wrong she alerted her mother Karen (right) who - in horror - called an ambulance . When Shelby, who was 14 at the time, was injured in the accident, she needed two hours of surgery and 250 stitches . Karen said: 'I didn't know what was wrong. Shelby told me the water jet had knocked her off her feet and she was bleeding really heavily from her bottom. 'Her clothes were soaked and she was pale and very groggy.' Shelby was rushed to hospital where she needed 250 stitches, both internally and externally. Karen said: 'When I saw what had happened, I was sickened. She was badly injured, literally ripped right across from her bottom to her vagina. 'The consultant took me aside and said he thought she might have been raped. I was appalled. By now, Shelby was under anaesthetic so she couldn't speak up. 'Sarah kept telling us that her injuries were from a water jet - but the doctors said that wasn't possible, because her injuries were too severe. I was beside myself with panic.' Miss Clarke underwent two hours of surgery, and subsequent tests showed that she had not been attacked. Shelby has stated she is lucky to have a supportive boyfriend in Danny (right) She spent three days in hospital and was off school for a further six weeks. She said: 'I was terrified of going to the toilet afterwards, because it was so painful. I became terrified of going to the loo. It almost became a phobia. 'My periods became very heavy and so painful. My doctor gave me an implant to stop my periods, but I still suffered with pain and sudden bleeds. 'I was terrified that I might start bleeding, on the bus or in class. I even had to be home-schooled for a few months because I was paranoid about being around other people.' Miss Clarke met her first boyfriend, Danny Lendon, aged 17, but sexual intercourse left her crippled in pain. Shelby does not know whether she will be able to have children in the future and has stated her fear: ''I can't help thinking that if it had been a two year old running through the water, she might have been killed' Tests showed she had a large amount of scar tissue and she is now waiting to have it removed. Miss Clarke said: 'I was terrified of having sex. Danny was very supportive and mum helped me too. 'I can enjoy sex but I can't have it very often - and so then I start to worry that Danny might cheat on me or leave me. I'm very lucky that Danny is patient and understanding, and it has made our relationship much stronger.' Miss Clarke does not know if she will be able to have children in the future and is also facing surgery to remove scar tissue around her cervix. Shelby has said she wanted to 'bring the legal action to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else' The family took legal action against The Pleasure Beach who awarded Shelby a five-figure sum in compensation. Her settlement includes money to cover possible treatment in the future when she wants children. An investigation was carried out by the HSE and was very critical of Blackpool Pleasure Beach for failing to undertake necessary risk assessments. Miss Clarke said: 'I had to relive my ordeal, over and over, and discuss my sex life and my periods with gynaecologists, solicitors and barristers. It was very embarrassing but I was determined to see it through. 'I can't help thinking that if it had been a two-year-old running through the water, she might have been killed. I wanted to bring the legal action to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.' Sabrina McCarron, a specialist serious injury lawyer from Irwin Mitchell, representing the family, said: 'This was a very tragic accident that could have been avoided had the appropriate risk assessments and safety measures been implemented. 'Although a Health and Safety Executive investigation criticised Blackpool Pleasure Beach for failing to undertake a proper risk assessment and safety measures were recommended to provide adequate protection for lawful visitors no formal admission of liability was made on behalf of Blackpool Pleasure Beach. 'An out-of-court five-figure settlement was eventually agreed and compensation has now been secured for Shelby to help her access the treatment and rehabilitation she now requires to help with her recovery.' A spokesperson for Blackpool Pleasure Beach said: 'Since the incident, strict procedures have been out in place to ensure guests do not enter the fountains during a show. 'Clear announcements are made before the start of a show and staff man the fountain at the perimeter of the fountains.'","Shelby Clarke, now 19, was injured by a fountain jet at an attraction .

"While the increasing trend of Internet purchases continues to threaten traditional stores, new research has found that more than five million Australians have experienced an 'online shopping fail'. And the inconvenience of return processes, which are often costly, have resulted in over $460 million in unwanted purchases over the years. In response to these alarming figures, PayPal Australia has launched a new service for customers to refund up to $45 of return shipping costs for their online purchases. Daily Mail Australia has gathered a series of images of incorrect packages, which have been posted on social media by disappointed customers. Recent research has found that more than five million Australians have experienced an online shopping fail.

Difficult and costly returns processes have resulted in over $460 million in unwanted purchases. Another customer was delivered an excessive supply of butter . This shopper was disappointed to see her liquid foundation had leaked all over the packaging when it was delivered to her . PayPal Australia announced the launch of their free shipping return service on Thursday, allowing customers to request a refund on shipping costs of up to $45 on the PayPal website within 14 days. Joint research by Ipsos and PayPal, conducted in the past 12 months on 1001 respondents, found that more than half of those who had considered returning an unwanted item had failed to do so mainly due to shipping costs. Other factors also included unnecessary hassle  or complicated returns processes. The research on Australians aged 18-64 also revealed that nine in 10 respondents said that they would more likely shop online if the retailer had a free returns policy. A shopper poses with her 'floor length door mirror' she bought online . Two wrong sizes of a pair of shoes was packaged and delivered to this customer . The wrong colour dress is delivered to this online shopper. 'This is not the BLACK dress I ordered,' she wrote . This comes as pictures emerged of a Chinese shopper who suffered an online shopping fail with an ill-fitting cut-out dress that wasn't quite the glamorous gown she thought she was buying. The black dress, a copy of one worn by Thor actress Jaime Alexander at the film's premiere in 2013, features top-to-bottom see-through panels on the front and back. However the unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller's page, showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended. And this isn't the first time though that disgruntled online shoppers have been let down. Earlier this year, many women took to the Internet to lament the fact that the dresses they had ordered looked nothing like the pictures they had been shown. Most of those duped were brides looking for an alternative to buying their wedding dress from an expensive bridal store.

"European Council president Donald Tusk said David Cameron's plans were 'mission impossible' David Cameron's hopes of winning sweeping changes to Britain's relationship with Brussels are 'mission impossible', the top EU politician who will run the negotiations has said. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council representing EU leaders, said he was 'ready to help Cameron' – but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new European treaty within the next two years before holding an EU referendum. The former Polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 EU leaders that would satisfy Mr Cameron. He said: 'I have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework. We have to help David Cameron because he is obviously pro-European. But Mr Tusk added: 'I am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty.' Mr Cameron wants a new Brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing Britain to limit benefits for EU migrants. The PM has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis-hit Eurozone, giving Britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with Brussels. But Mr Tusk said: 'My intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it's not only about rationality, about good argument. 'We need unanimity between 28 member states, in the European parliament, in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification. To say that it is a Pandora's Box is too little.' Mr Tusk said: 'First of all we need more precise concrete [details] about British demands. 'When we have more information about details, about legal problems, then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary. 'For me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question. It's not only about the arguments of Cameron. I can agree or disagree with some of them. 'But at the end of the day I would like to ask him 'what is your concrete proposal?' and then I can consult with the other member states.' Mr Tusk, the former Polish prime minister likened David Cameron's chances of negotiating a new EU treaty by 2017 to the Tom Cruise blockbusters 'Mission Impossible' But he said: 'We need, also for the United Kingdom, a good solution for Cameron and Great Britain under existing law,' he said. 'We need the United Kingdom in Europe. For me there's no more obvious political thesis than this one. And I feel, but it's not my role to decide about it, but I feel that the United Kingdom needs Europe.' The former Polish prime minister's remarks are the first since he took over as European council president in December. He also admitted, in an interview with the Guardian, that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration – because of the number of Poles living and working abroad. He said: 'It's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems, which means also the huge Polish minority in Great Britain.'","Donald Tusk said it will be hard to win agreement of all 27 EU leaders .

"Jacqueline Crane (pictured outside court) claimed to be a professor of psychology and said she was qualified to train people to become counsellors . A fake psychologist was caught running a bogus counselling course after setting her students a series of increasingly bizarre tasks including climbing a tree and riding a bike in the rain. Jacqueline Crane, 52, of of St Austell, Cornwall, pretended to be a professor of psychology and claimed she was qualified to train people to become counsellors. She set her students bizarre tasks including scaling trees, cycling in bad weather and taking candlelit baths and would then ask for feedback on how the wacky practices made the students feel, a court was told. But her students - who spent thousands of pounds on her courses - became suspicious because of her increasingly strange ideas and bad spelling. The finally caught her out when a group of her students discovered she had used old exam papers to test them. Crane then invented a fake family and forged doctor notes claiming she was too ill to attend court. Despite her best efforts she was jailed for 18 months at Truro Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud by making a false representation, perverting the course of justice and benefit fraud. The court heard Crane set up the course in May 2012 and ran it for 18 months, pretending to be a doctor of psychology to con her seven long-term and numerous other short term students out of nearly £8,000. Speaking after the hearing two of her former students have spoken of the damage caused after being hooked by Crane's lies. They said they were reeled in by fake photos of Crane in a university cap on her graduation day. Mother-of-five Jessica Brewster, 35, was one of those sucked in to Crane's fantasy world and spent hundreds of wasted hours trying to improve her future. She said: 'I was a taxi driver for Jacqui and she told me she was going to set up a counselling course, which was something I had always wanted to do. Jessica Brewster (pictured) who was one of the students to be conned by fraudster Jacqueline Crane . 'But from the start there were hints that things weren't what they seemed. 'One of the girls kept pointing out that there were spelling mistakes on these slides and asking where she had got them from. Jacqui didn't like that.' Another of the victims, known only as Jane, said: 'She would set us these exercises. One of them was to ride around on a bike in the rain, which I did on Jess' patio. 'One was to have a candlelit bath. Another was to climb a tree. She asked us to think about how it made us feel.' Ms Brewster said they went on a group outing in Truro where they were set another bizarre task. She said: 'She asked us to go up to random people and start conversations with them. 'It sounds silly but I feel humiliated thinking about it now.' An incident involving fake exam papers finally revealed the truth. The group had got together to go over some past papers and then realised that Crane had just given them one for real. Jane said: 'That's when it all hit home.' Crane has now been jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud at Truro Crown Court (pictured) Crane was jailed for 12 months for the fraud against her students and three months each for perverting the course of justice and benefits fraud. They will run consecutively. Judge Simon Carr said: 'The money they had saved up to improve their education has been completely wasted.' Jeremy Leaning, defending, said Crane had admitted being a fantasist since childhood and that she accepted responsibility for the offending. Following the sentencing Jessica said: 'For what she has done, it's not long enough.'","Jacqueline Crane, 52, pretended to be a professor of psychology .

"You can never have too much of a good thing. And this certainly rings true for Florida couple Bernard and Janice Caffary who travelled on their 100th cruise - all taken on the same ship.

"Can't stay away: Paul Willard, 36, was arrested on Friday after he was found sleeping in the home of a woman he was accused of kidnapping last October . Authorities say an Upstate New York man was arrested last weekend after he was found sleeping in the home of a woman he's accused of kidnapping last fall. The Watertown Daily Times reports that state police charged 36-year-old Paul Willard of Edwards with criminal contempt for disobeying an order of protection last Friday. Troopers say Willard was found sleeping in 43-year-old Kimberly L Peabody's home in the St. Lawrence County town of Russell just before 11:30am on Friday. St. Lawrence County sheriff's deputies arrested Willard last October after they say he violated a protection order and kidnapped Ms Peabody. Reports at the time stated that Willard woke Peabody up by shoving her with the barrell of a rifle and then forced her to get into his pick-up truck. He then drove off with her to his home, where authoritites later found the two and arrested Willard. Willard was released from jail at the end of November, and at a chearing in December, pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree burglary, second-degree kidnapping and first-degree criminal contempt.

"We've all spent countless hours looking at friends' holiday snaps on Instagram or Facebook with a hint of jealousy, wishing we could be sitting on a beach, eating a fancy meal or spending the night in a luxurious hotel room. It can seem steep forking out for hotel stays night after night, but one couple has discovered the way to do it for free. Laura Cody, 23, and Tanbay Theune, 26, have taken advantage of the home-sitting craze, which allows people stay in strangers' incredible houses while they are away - without having to spend a penny on accommodation. Laura Cody, 23, and Tanbay Theune, 26, (pictured in Berlin) didn't want to pay high rent in the UK and wanted to travel . Laura has written a guide on how to start house-sitting. Her book, their blog, and freelance work help them maintain their travelling life . The couple, who met in Cardiff and have been together for years and Skype with owners to make sure they land a nice place to stay . The couple have been house-sitting since 2013 and haven't paid any rent and bills since they left for their adventures. The house owners kindly took the couple to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the oldest and largest koala sanctuary in the world . The couple enjoyed body boarding in Sydney, Australia on Manly Beach, just one of the many picturesque places they have stayed near . The couple dined on crocodile, emu and kangaroo at Tukka Restaurant in Queensland and also kayaked along the Brisbane river . The couple chose to embark on the adventure together after they became fed up with paying hefty rent bills every month, and discussed their desire to experience the world. The option to travel was actually a cheaper one than staying at home, as they realised they could travel rent and bill free by home-sitting in whatever country they chose. They left Birmingham in July 2013, and currently have no plans to stop their worldwide adventure. Home-sitting is a win-win situation, as home owners want people staying in their house to deter burglars, and most often, to look after their pets, in exchange for free lodging. The couple's Gold Coast house came complete with a pool for them to enjoy for free . Stunning scenery: One of the incredible properties they have stayed at for free was a vineyard in Italy . Many people put their homes up for house-sits because they want someone to look after their pets while they are away . In two years the mathematics graduate and retail supervisor have house-sat all over Australia, the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy and are currently in Finland. They also have stays lined up in Portugal and the Netherlands this year. When asked about the best and worst places they have stayed, they revealed their secret for ensuring they stay in the best properties. 'The best two have been an Italian vineyard and a Gold Coast sit in Australia which had a pool and was very close to the beach,' Laura said. 'We haven't had a worst one because we Skype with the home owners beforehand to check it's nice.' Bouncing along! The couple witnessed kangaroos in Australia on a trip to Kangaroo island . The couple, who love animals, often have to walk dogs in exchange for no bills and free lodging (pictured: Ancona, Italy) Since July 2013 they have spent about £10,000 between the two of them, most of it to travel to and live in Australia . They use the website Trusted Housesitters to organise their stays, paying just £5.99 per month for an annual membership. Laura, originally from Cheltenham, and Tanbay, from Oldenburg, Germany, have only spent £1,000 between them in the last six months on transport and food. Travelling on the road has also given them the opportunity to earn money with the release of Laura's e-book, House Sitting in Australia - A Guide for First Time House Sitters, through their popular blog, Travelling Weasles, and other freelance work. Countries they have stayed at include Australia, UK, Germany, Spain and Italy, trying many exotic foods along the way . They always pick the cheapest way to travel between destinations, and many owners leave their homes stocked with food for the pair . From major cities, to deserted villages, and houses with pools and beach villas, the range of properties is as varied as length of stay. The longest the couple have stayed in a property is six weeks, but they have also done weekend stays too. 'The weirdest thing we have seen in people's houses is a life size cut out of Edward from Twilight,' they told MailOnline Travel in an email. 'The home owners are usually very generous and have given us food, wine and day trips - and one lovely couple gave us a GoPro.' Apart from missing Marmite and their families, the two hope to continue their global adventures, saving money as they go. 'We now have a life that we don't need a vacation from,' Laura said. Laura and Tanbay have visited some of the most beautiful places on earth, just paying for flights, and working on the road . The home owners pay all the bills whilst they are away - including internet - and the couple occasionally looks after pets . The couple would recommend their method of travel for anyone and say they 'now have a life that we don't need a vacation from'","Laura Cody and Tanbay Theune have house-sat since 2013 and travelled the world paying no bills or rent .

"Anjali Damania says leaders should take the initiative to change AAP, not simply blog or complain . The letters by Admiral L. Ramdas and Prashant Bhushan are the ones that matter, and the issues they raised should be addressed. My objection is that instead of merely raising questions, people should contribute to the party by working for it. The problems have to be, and will be, addressed. It won’t take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right. Talking about the funds, I will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office. We have fought three elections in a year, which is too much for any small party. Every single issue raised is important for the party. The only problem is that this should not be done via the media; it needs to be done by holding internal talks. Mayank Gandhi should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended. What is the meaning of simply raising questions? Every leader needs to think about it. If a volunteer is punished when he is wrong, even leaders should be held accountable. The party’s national executive was called only to tackle the problems. The issues raised are important, and people should take the onus to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs. I genuinely feel Prashantji is a very respectful person. When he made those statements, my respect (for him) went down a bit. I would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party. We don’t expect him to make a mistake at all. There is no question of his marginalisation. He should be supported for a larger, better role by everyone. Ankit Lal, Ashutosh and Khetan need to apologise sincerely for what they have done. They need to be pulled up. Every volunteer wants transparency on accounts, candidate selection and other decisions. We had six months after the Lok Sabha polls. Why didn’t those who raise questions help carve out these mechanisms then? The camp system is wrong and if it exists, it should be demolished. I do not want to comment on Yogendra Yadav at all. As a volunteer I beg and plead all leaders to thrash out their differences. We should have more faces, there are many leading lights. And women need to be brought forward.",The writer is an AAP leader from Maharashtra (As told to Jugal R. Purohit)
"The tomb of an Iron Age Celtic prince has been unearthed in a small French town. The 'exceptional' grave, crammed with Greek and possibly Etruscan artefacts, was discovered in a business zone on the outskirts of Lavau in France's Champagne region. The prince is buried with his chariot at the centre of a huge mound, 130 feet (40 metres) across, which has been dated to the 5th Century BC. The biggest find at the site was a huge wine cauldron. Standing on the handles of the cauldron, is the Greek god Acheloos. The river deity is shown with horns, a beard, the ears of a bull and a triple mustache . A team from the National Archaeological Research Institute, Inrap has been excavating the site since October last year. They recently dated it to the end of the First Iron Age - a period characterised by the widespread use of the metal. Its discovery could shed light on Iron Age European trade, researchers say. The 2,500-year-old burial mound has at its heart a 14 square metre burial chamber, not yet opened, of an ancient royal. An Iron Age Celtic prince lay buried with his chariot at the center of this huge mound in the Champagne region of France, according to the country's National Archaeological Research Institute (Inrap) Eight lioness heads decorate the edge of the cauldron (right). Inside the cauldron, the archaeologists found a ceramic wine vessel, called oniochoe (left) A team from the National Archaeological Research Institute, Inrap has been excavating the site since October last year. Pictured is part of the cauldron found . 'It is probably a local Celtic prince,' Inrap president Dominique Garcia told journalists on a field visit. The prince is buried with his chariot at the centre of a huge mound. His chamber has not yet been opened. This biggest find was a large bronze-decorated cauldron that was used to store watered-down wine. The cauldron has four circular handles decorated with bronze heads that depict the Greek god Acheloos. Another interesting discovery was a perforated silver spoon that was part of the banquet utensils, presumably to filter the wine. The mausoleum contained a decorated ceramic wine pitcher made by the Greeks. The most exciting find, he said, was a large bronze-decorated cauldron that was used to store watered-down wine. It appears to have been made by Etruscan craftsmen from an area that is today in Italy. The cauldron  has four circular handles decorated with bronze heads that depict the Greek god Acheloos. The river deity is shown with horns, a beard, the ears of a bull and a triple mustache. Eight lioness heads decorate the edge of the cauldron. The mausoleum contained a decorated ceramic wine pitcher made by the Greeks. Decorations on the vessel reveal the god Dionysus, lying under a vine and facing a woman. The archaeologists also found remains of a iron wheel, from a chariot buried with the prince.

The pieces 'are evidence of the exchanges that happened between the Mediterranean and the Celts,' said Garcia. Inrap said burial chamber is one of the largest recorded for this period. The end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries BC were characterised by the rise of Etruscan and Greek city states like Marseilles in southern France. Mediterranean merchants, seeking slaves, metals and other precious goods, opened trading channels with continental Celts. The Celts gained valuable objects of Greek and Etruscan origin as a result of the trade. Many have been found in other mounds in Heuneburg and Hochdorf in Germany. Researchers say excavation at the site will be complete at the end of this month. The 2,500-year-old burial mound has at its heart a 14 square metre burial chamber, not yet opened, of an ancient royal .

"Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canapé. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign — a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722. Someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them. I confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional. I must be a cruiser. A 16-day Australia and New Zealand cruise on the Seabourn Encore (0843 373 2000, seabourn.com), departing on February 2, 2017, costs from £7,999 per person, based on two people sharing.

"There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England (file image) A major immunisation programme aims to protect teenagers against a potentially lethal new strain of meningitis after a steep rise in cases. There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. This is a rise of 431 per cent. Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency. While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread. Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a ‘highly aggressive strain of the bug’. He said: ‘We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken. ‘We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public’s health.’ Campaigners said the Government’s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B – the last major strain of the disease – may have hindered the fight. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine. ‘However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.’","There were 117 cases of meningitis W in 2014 compared to 22 in 2009 .

"While renovations can be time consuming and expensive, for those looking to sell upscaling a bathroom can offer exponential return when it comes to auction day. Frank Valentic, veteran bidder and buyer's advocate on Channel Nine's The Block, spoke to Daily Mail Australia to offer his top tips for renovating your bathroom  to add extra value to your property. Valentic, who first appeared on the show when he was outbid on three properties before securing an apartment in the series seventh season, joined fellow property experts on this year's season of The Block as a weekly buyer’s jury judge. Frank Valentic, buyer's advocate on The Block, said that most bathroom renovations would cost between $20,000 and $40,000 . 'If you are looking to renovate with the view of adding value, and re-selling, you need to do it smartly,' Valentic told Daily Mail Australia. The founder and managing director of Melbourne firm of Advantage Property Consulting, said that he always approaches renovations from the perspective of a potential buyer. 'You need to have the future buyer in mind, who may want to resell themselves and will want to get the best price and won't want to have to spend wads of cash to get there,' he said. Valentic estimates that a bathroom renovation should cost between $20,000 and $40,000 depending on the property, and emphasized the importance of investing in the 'wet areas' of a property- the bathroom and kitchen. 'One of the key things to keep in mind would be to always try and include a separate bath, as almost all demographics prefer that,' Valentic said. 'Families with young kids will want a bath, and women often say that it's important as they like to relax with a soak,' he said. 'Incorporating a separate bath and shower, especially with good quality and high level finishes, would be something that investors in Melbourne's inner suburbs would expect.' Valentic recommends having a separate bath and shower to add value to your bathroom, as seen above in Josh and Charlotte's winning bathroom . Block contestants Josh and Charlotte won the bathroom reveal this week with their design . Tim and Anastasia also chose to incorporate a separate bath and shower, along with plenty of storage . The buyer's advocate said that he would also recommend investing in a separate toilet if the floorplan allows for it, as it is both practical and convenient. 'If someone is having a shower, having a separate toilet is just practical,' he said. 'I would also recommend thinking about storage. On this week's bathroom reveal [The Block contestants] Josh and Charlotte missed out on storage behind the mirrors and wooden vanity.' Valentic said that areas for storage were crucial in a bathroom, in order to create a space that could be kept clean with minimal effort. 'Buyers will want somewhere to store away their belongings, especially under a benchtop. You need somewhere for the buyer to put their makeup or rest their hairdryer, to have that space to be able to have your items out while you're preparing yourself,' he said. The veteran bidder said that good light, both natural and installed, was extremely important in a bathroom: 'If you can't see what you're doing it's not going to be advantageous'. 'Good natural light, as well as good lighting is really important for doing hair and make-up,' he said. 'The apartments on this season of The Block all have really positive natural light.' For small splashes of luxury, Valentic said that tiling all the way up to the ceiling shows that the renovations haven't been 'skimped on'. 'With Jess and Ayden's bathroom (above), some of the buyers said the geometric tiling was too much, and some said ""what a good feature"", so they have already polarised buyers,' said Valentic . The Block contestants Daz and Dea (above) used a neutral colour palate for their bathroom design . Daz and Dea made the most of the natural light and offered plenty of storage for potential buyers . 'It's an extra thing that you would expect in a high end apartment, and an element I would definitely recommend,' he said. 'Having really good quality tiles on the floor and ceiling is also one really important thing to get right, and the rest should work around that,' 'It's also important that the quality throughout is the same level. All the elements of the bathroom need to blend be consistent, so you don't want to have nice European taps on a cheap vanity.' Valentic also highlighted the importance of finding a balance between classic styling and being edgy with the design and aesthetics of the bathroom. 'You don't want it to be too one sided and only have a few people interested. If you keep the end buyer in mind, if they don't like the bathroom and need to renovate, that's an expensive exercise,' he said. 'Neutral colours like grey, black, and white seem to more popular across the board. You need to ask yourself- will it date? You have to look ahead and consider that what is trendy now may not be in ten years time,' 'If you consider Jess and Ayden's bathroom, some of the buyers said the geometric tiling was too much, and some said ""what a good feature"", so they have already polarised buyers, and so did Daz Dea' Looking beyond the bathroom, Valentic said that investing in renovating the kitchen will always add value to a property and should be the proper starting place for any renovation. Valentic estimates that a bathroom renovation should cost between $20,000 and $40,000 . Valentic said that the quality should be the same level, so that all the elements of the bathroom blend well . Valentic was a veteran bidder on season seven on The Block before becoming a judge on the show . 'The kitchen has evolved into the entertaining hub and engine of most properties, because of open plan meal, dining and living areas,' he said. 'Any spare cash at all should be thrown into the kitchen and bathroom.' Valentic said that figures show that 80% of property decisions are made by women, and he said that a nice kitchen is one of the biggest drawing cards for that reason. 'I would just highlight that it's important not to overinvest in these areas, and property experts say that renovators should only spend up to 10% of the property's value in total on renovations. Having a good outdoor entertaining area is also a bonus, as many buyers will entertain at home and look for outdoors to be an extension of the living area. It is also crucial to research the demographic of the area before planning renovations, in order to ascertain what renovations are being done to other properties in the area. 'You need to give due diligence to your renovations. What are renovated properties selling for in the area? Are you making your property what the end users will want?,' he said. 'If you are putting in a laminex benchtop and the demographic demands stone benchtops it won't be the right result and you'll have to re-do it.' Valentic also said that if renovators are considering re-selling then getting an agent involved is an extremely helpful way to make the process easier.","Frank Valentic, buyer's advocate on The Block, said that bathroom renovations should cost between $20,000 and $40,000 .

"A top Hillary Clinton aide is at the center of a lawsuit filed by a government watchdog group, which claims the U.S. State Department hid emails it was required to hand over as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. On Wednesday Daily Mail Online reported that Huma Abedin, a former Clinton deputy chief of staff and a member of her inner circle, had a private address on the now-infamous email server Clinton kept at her Chappaqua, New York home and used exclusively while she was in office. One day later Judicial Watch, a center-right group known for blanketing Washington with FOIA requests, has demanded that a federal court reopen a case it agreed to drop last year because Abedin's emails were never properly searched. Chris Farrell, the group's research and investigations director, told Daily Mail Online on Thursday that nine more closed cases could be reopened in light of Clinton's email-gate scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE LEGAL PETITION . MOTHER FIGURE: Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) traveled with Hillary Clinton and was seen as one of her closest aides . Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . In all, Judicial Watch has filed 18 FOIA lawsuits against the State Department, 'all of which are being carefully considered in light of Mrs. Clinton’s and the department’s misconduct and misrepresentations,' Farrell said. 'More strong legal action will follow. Stay tuned,' he added . At the time the Abedin lawsuit was wending its way through federal court, the State Department said in writing that it had exhaustively searched its archives and provided everything Judicial Watch asked for. But with the revelation of a separate email address, the group is demanding a second bite at the apple. Judge Emmit Sullivan in Washington, D.C. is expected to grant the request: Judicial Watch writes in its filing that the State Department won't fight it. State 'does not oppose reopening the case in this particular circumstance,' the legal filing says. According to federal court rules, a lawsuit can be reopened due to 'fraud, ... misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.' In its filing, Judicial Watch wrote that the State Department 'represented to Judicial Watch that the records of the Executive Secretariat had been searched.' Tom Fitton, the group's president, said there was misconduct at the State Department and demanded 'immediate court action' 'At no point did the State Department inform Judicial Watch that the Secretary’s emails and the emails of Ms. Abedin and other high level officials could not be searched,' the court petition reads. 'These were misrepresentations.' 'Had Judicial Watch known that the State Department’s search excluded Secretary Clinton’s emails and the emails of Ms. Abedin and other high level officials, Judicial Watch would not have stipulated to the dismissal of this case.' Tom Fitton, the group's president, said Thursday in a statement that 'Hillary Clinton’s misconduct and the resulting fraud by the State Department disrupted and ended our federal FOIA lawsuit about Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest political associates.' 'Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration concealed records and lied to obstruct a federal court and Judicial Watch from finding out about the secret emails,' he claimed. 'Time is of the essence. Immediate court action is imperative to retrieve, recover and secure these public records from Mrs. Clinton.' Clinton said durign a press conference on Tuesday in New York City that she had deleted more than 30,000 'personal' emails from her 'clintonemail.com' server after determining with no outside input that they were unrelated to her government work. She said nothing about other accounts on the server, including Abedin's. The Federal Records Act puts responsibility for archiving public records on the heads of government agencies – a group that included Clinton while she ran the Obama administration's State Department for four years. 'Secretary Clinton plainly violated her own legal obligations,' Judicial Watch said in a press release. 'Doing so was misconduct.' There's no indication that Thursday's legal petition was a response to Daily Mail Online's expose a day earlier. But the State Department's Office of General Counsel could soon have its hands full. The Associated Press said Wednesday that it, too had sued the agency to force the release of emails and other government documents from the years Clinton was at the helm. Some of the AP's requests and demands dated back five years. And the State Department's Office of Inspector General found this week that it had retained just 61,000 emails, out of more than 1 billion sent by the agency's employees, in 2011 – in the middle of Clinton's tenure.

"The Internal Revenue Service's $10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the April 15 filing deadline. John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. 'As a result, the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CRY POVERTY: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a National Press Club audience that $10.9 billion is too small a budget to guarantee that taxpayers who call with questions hear a voice on the other end of the line . 'TIS THE SEASON: Tax returns for 2014 are due on April 15 . 'That means that six out of every 10 people who call can't reach a customer service representative,' said Koskinen. 'This truly is an abysmal level of service.' Koskinen wasn't ceding new ground in Americans' hate-hate relationship with the IRS. He was arguing that Congress should give his agency more money. 'We are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open,' he said. 'You would think, in fact, we must be selling something like the Apple watch when you look at the lines. This is not a new story this year; it’s just gotten worse.' Overall, Koskinen complained, 'the IRS is now the lowest level of funding since 2008,' resulting in 'fewer audits and collection cases' and costing the U.S. Treasury at least $2 billion in revenue. CAN'T BE ABOLISHED: Presidential canididate Sen. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. In 2013, the last year for which reliable numbers are available, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves. Law enforcement crackdowns have taken 'a lot of the amateurs off the street, but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world,' the commissioner said. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.' The IRS has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees, including one featuring am expensively produced Star Trek parody video. Another bone of contention among lawmakers who set Koskinen's budget has been the practice, now discontinued, of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes. THE IRS, the federal government agency Americans most love to hate, has had its wings clipped by Congress following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats . Rhode Island Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw, who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the IRS, warned the commissioner this year that the House of Representatives nas taken note. 'We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,' Crenshaw told him, because you don’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.' Tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks, but six-month extensions are available. Still, most Americans find America's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax-preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters, leading to frustration and now-legendary resentment.

"Keith Fraser, who is standing in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said British teenagers who want to join ISIS should be given free seats on flights . British teenagers who want to join ISIS should be given free seats on flights to Iraq and Syria, a Ukip candidate has said. Keith Fraser, who is standing in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said money should be spent on chartering planes rather than trying to stop them fighting with extremists. Around 600 Britons are believed to have fled to Syria including a group of three schoolgirls from east London. Mr Fraser said: ‘We have many young people wanting to join up with their “brothers” in IS. Let them bloody well go. ‘Why are we concerned in wasting our time and resources in assuring these people don’t go to join? ‘Instead let’s find out who wants to go and we can then spend public money in chartering our own planes to take them there. We don’t need these traitors in our beloved country. ‘They can hand over their British passports on the way out and say don’t ever try and come back.’ The Ukip candidate, who currently works as a chartered surveyor, said that the extremists ‘have one aim to convert or murder all “non-believers”.’ He added: ‘They don’t like our freedom, want to destroy our way of life and will not rest until they fly their flag over our shores.’ Mr Fraser’s comments came as Nigel Farage revealed the party’s pledge card, which includes saying no to the EU, controlling the country's borders, an extra £3 billion for the NHS, cuts in foreign aid spending and no tax on the minimum wage. At the launch in Westminster, the Ukip leader said it is now ‘a party of what modern Britain is’. He said: ‘The thing about Ukip is we have become the most eclectic, diverse political party. ‘We've got all shades of opinion, we've got people from the left, people from the right, people of all ages, all classes, all races.’ Although the posters include a pledge to control the UK's borders, the word ‘immigration’ does not feature. Around 600 Britons are believed to have fled to Syria including a group of three schoolgirls from east London . The leader was joined by Ukip MP Mark Reckless and other senior Ukip figures, but Clacton MP Douglas Carswell did not attend the event as he was campaigning in his constituency. Mr Farage said a strong showing for Ukip at May's election could boost the calls for electoral reform, which in turn could make his eurosceptics a ‘big party in British politics’. He said: ‘I've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days. ‘Yes, this is very hard for us because you find good Ukip support in Labour constituencies and in Conservative constituencies. ‘Yes, that's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this General Election campaign and then you'll see how many seats we've actually come second in, and you'll realise as part of a longer-term strategy this really could become a big party in British politics.’ Mr Fraser’s comments came as Nigel Farage revealed the party’s pledge card, which includes pledges on the EU, immigration, extra spending on the NHS, cuts in foreign aid spending and no tax on the minimum wage . At the launch of the party's pledge card in Westminster, the Ukip leader was joined by Ukip MP Mark Reckless and other senior Ukip figures, but Clacton MP Douglas Carswell did not attend the event . On his quest to become an MP in South Thanet, Mr Farage said he was facing a ‘hell of a fight’. He said: ‘There are easier seats I could have gone for. I am confident but certainly not complacent.’ Asked if his party could get into double figures for seats, he replied: ‘Of course we can.’ When questioned about the significance of the TV debate later this week, Mr Farage replied: ‘It is important for all of us, but yes the stakes are high.’","Keith Fraser is standing for Ukip in Hackney North and Stoke Newington .

"A frantic husband covered in blood called 911 dispatchers and described his wife's horrific wounds after she was shot in the chest during a struggle over a shotgun. Timothy Sparks, 58, begged for an ambulance to be dispatched to his home in Mason, Ohio, early yesterday morning when his wife Susan, 56, was shot after she allegedly implied she would kill herself. Sparks told call handlers his wife suffers from depression, and later said to police he found her in their bedroom pointing a loaded shotgun at her chest around 6:40am. It is unclear exactly what happened in the struggle. Sparks told police he was holding the gun during the struggle, but did not elaborate as to whether his wife was also holding it, and who pulled the trigger. Scroll down to hear the 911 call . Shotgun struggle: Timothy Sparks center called 911 after his wife Susan was hit in the chest by a shotgun blast following a struggle. The two are pictured above with their sons . Emergency: Police and an ambulance were dispatched the the Sparks's home in Mason, Ohio . The panicked man described how his wife was struggling for breath as handlers instructed him to perform CPR. She was declared dead as soon as an ambulance arrived. During the 911 call, Sparks said: 'My wife had a gun, the gun went off, my wife, she's been shot. He continued: 'She had the gun, I was trying to take the gun away from her. I have no idea... I can hear her gulping, gulping, she's gulping.' Sparks later told police that he was getting ready for work when his wife angled the weapon at her chest and told him: 'It will be better this way'. A police report released Tuesday said that he told an officer driving him to the police station that 'he tried to get the shotgun from her but that she had the barrel toward her chest' while sitting on their bed. Sparks, who said he was recovering from shoulder surgery, allegedly tried to wrest the gun away, but was pulled on top of her. Struggle: Sparks told police he tried to wrest the gun away from his wife when it fired into her chest . He said he was holding the weapon, which he did not think was loaded, when it discharged into his wife's chest. He did not explain whether his wife was also still holding on, or how the trigger was pulled. According to local news station WCPO, the pair have been married 33 years and have three sons. Timothy Sparks was a manager at Chevrolet dealership, and Susan Sparks used to work for Ford, the channel said. During the 911 call, Sparks was asked to describe her wounds, and said: ''It looks like right in the chest. I tried to take the gun from her she pulled her towards her. She's bleeding from the chest, she's bleeding a lot.' When asked whether his wife ever seemed suicidal, he said: 'She suffers from depression, she has depression really bad. She would never do this though, she didn't do it on purpose.' He is asked again whether his wife is bleeding part-way through the 7-minute call, and starts crying when he realizes she isn't. The recording ends when police officers arrived. Police sergeant Robert Temple said that officers arriving at the house, in the upscale town outside Cincinnati, were met with the sight of Sparks with 'blood on his hands, arms, face and on his clothing'. Mason Police said they are investigating the fatal shooting 'as a questionable death'. They say a man was questioning at police headquarters, but did not identify him.","Timothy Sparks dialed 911 when wife Susan was shot in Mason, Ohio .

"Tragic: Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds . A drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka. Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, had been partying at the university of Julio de Mesquita in the city of Bauru, in southwest Brazil, when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds. His friend Rodrigo Pancetti, 23, said: 'We were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition. 'I knew I'd already had too much and there was no way I was going to be able to drink five, let alone 25. But Humberto and the others were really up for it. 'On his Facebook there is a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. I never thought that would become reality. 'But once he had finished he said he felt ill and suddenly collapsed. 'We assumed it was because he was drunk but then six others also collapsed, including the winner, so we called an ambulance.' Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way. A hospital spokesman said: 'They all had alcohol poisoning and are in a critical state, with three still in intensive care.' Now police say they are looking to charge the organisers with homicide. Ironic: A quote on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom' Drinking competition: Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way . A police spokesman said: 'Two fourth year students at the university have been arrested for organising the event without a licence and for potentially causing the death of the student.' A spokesman for the university said: 'We very much regret the death of this young man and our condolences go out to his family and friends. 'We would like to remind students that drinking alcohol in the university is banned.'

"They form an unlikely duo - especially for something as physically demanding as planting trees. But a blind man and a double amputee have overcome their disabilities by becoming each other's eyes and hands. Jia Haixa and Jia Wenqi embarked on their heart-warming partnership 10 years ago after finding they were unable to secure jobs due to their respective impairments. Together they have created their own unique way of working that has allowed them to transform a three-hectare stretch of riverbank, according to The People's Daily online. Team work: Blind Jia Haixa and double amputee Jia Wenqi have found a unique way of working together . Helping hand: In the last 10 years the friends have become the eyes and hands for each other in the rural village of Hebei, China . Partnership working: Blind Mr Haixa scales a tree with the help of Mr Wenqi, so that he can find fresh cuttings to plant in the ground . 'I am his hands,' said blind Mr Haixia. 'He is my eyes. We are good partners.' The 53-year-old was born with congenital cataracts which left him blind in his left eye. Then in 2000, due to a work accident, he also lost the sight in his right eye. Mr Wenqi, also 53, lost both arms in an accident when he was just three-years-old. In 2001, unable to secure work elsewhere, the eco-warriors leased a large stretch of the river bank from the local government in a bid to plant trees for future generations. The proud pair also hoped to earn a modest income from their work from government funding and help protect their village from flooding in the process. Each day the dedicated pair leave their home at 7am armed with only a hammer and iron rod. Before they can start their work Mr Wenqi has to carry his blind companion across a fast moving river. Without money to buy saplings, they then have to collect cuttings. This is no easy task and involves Mr Haixa scaling large trees. Without the use of his eyes, he is guided by his armless companion as he hauls himself through the branches. Back on solid ground, he then creates a hole and plants the new shoot. It then becomes Mr Wenqi's job to water the saplings. It hasn't been fast work, but now the three hectare site is covered with trees that attract a large number of birds. In total the duo believe they have planted 10,000 trees in a decade and have no plans to stop. 'Though we did not accomplish much in a dozens years, we recognize our effort,' said Mr Haixia. Mr Wenqi added:  'We stand on our own feet. The fruits of our labor taste sweeter. Even though we are gnawing on steam buns, we find peace in our hearts.' Companions: Mr Wenqi carriers his blind colleagues across the river before they can begin their days work .

"A stray dog who lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who are planning to insert a specially designed implant into his snout. Parys, from Bialystok, Poland, will undergo surgery tomorrow in order to receive his new nose, which was designed by Polish company Ledo. The tube shaped implant - which was specially built for Parys following a CT scan - was invented by Dr Marcin Elgal from the Individual Medical Implants Technopark, after he heard of the dog's plight. Parys (pictured) a stray dog from Bialystok, Poland, lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare - but he could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who will implant a chip in his snout tomorrow . The implant was specially designed for Parys by Dr Marcin Elgal (pixtured) from Individual Medical Implants . Veterinarians will insert the implant during surgery to reconstruct Parys' nose tomorrow. He will then be sent home to recover with his new owner, Magdalena Smosarska, in Bialystok, and his new nose. It is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell, but help reconstruct the shape of his nose which was left disfigured by the accident. Noses are particularly important to dogs as their brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex,  boasting millions of smelling receptors which help them to survive. The implant for the dog's new nose was designed and created (process pictured) by Polish company Ledo . It is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell, but help reconstruct the shape of his nose . Parys with his new owner Magdalena Smosarska, in Bialystok, Poland today - the day before his surgery . While the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, dog's brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex. The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans . The average dog has 125 to 220 million smell-sensitive receptors. The bloodhound exceeds this standard with nearly 300 million receptors. It is estimated that dogs in general have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's. A dog's wet nose, or rhinarium, is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. The mucus on a dog’s nose helps capture scent particles - which is why they lick their dry noses, to recover this scent capturing. By smelling a drop of another dog's urine, a dog can often determine the dog’s sex, diet, health, and emotional state. The implant will be used to reconstruct the former stray's nose after he lost it in a snare . This small implant could change the stray dog's life forever by returning his ability to smell again .","Parys the dog lost his nose after accidentally getting caught in snare .

"Labour and the SNP are 'half way down the aisle' to stitching up a deal to put Ed Miliband in Number 10, the Tories claimed today after Nicola Sturgeon dropped the party's red line over nuclear weapons. Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would still be prepared to put Mr Miliband in Downing Street even if Labour refused to scrap Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent – a key plank of the nationalists' manifesto. The Scottish First Minister said the SNP would never vote to renew Trident but she insisted there were 'many issues we could agree on'. Ms Sturgeon played down the prospects of a formal Coalition, but said the SNP could prop up a Labour government 'on an issue-by-issue' basis. Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP could still do a deal with the Labour Party even if Ed Miliband insists on renewing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons . She said: 'On that basis, there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for Trident.' Ms Sturgeon's remarks, to the Guardian, come amid growing pressure on Mr Miliband to rule out going into Coalition with the SNP in a bid to stem the party's loss of support in Scotland. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Ms Sturgeon's move opened to door for a deal between Labour and the SNP after the election. He said: 'Ed Miliband and the SNP have signed the pre-nup and are now half-way up the aisle. 'Day after day, vote after vote in Parliament, Ed Miliband would be forced to negotiate with Alex Salmond - the man who tried to break up Britain - about how to run Britain. 'Make no mistake: an Ed Miliband government, propped up by the SNP, would mean more debt than our children could ever hope to repay, higher taxes on hardworking people and economic chaos for our country.' A Labour government propped up by the SNP - handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10 - moved a step closer after Nicola Sturgeon dropped a red line over Trident nuclear weapons . Scotland will be able to 'call the tune' at Westminster after the general election, according to Alex Salmond. The former First Minister, who is standing for the Gordon constituency in May, said neither Labour or the Conservative 'are fit to govern' and believes a large group of SNP MPs will lead to 'progress for Scotland'. Working with Plaid Cymru and the Green Party, Mr Salmond hopes to 'shake Westminster to its foundations, to rumble up the House of Commons'. Speaking ahead of a constituency meeting in the village of Insch, Aberdeenshire, he said: 'It is now clear that neither Tory or Labour will win an overall majority. Neither are fit to govern. 'It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament. 'Now thoughts should turn to what that tune should be. Nicola Sturgeon has laid out a clear strategy and key priorities. 'We cannot give any support formal or informal to the Tories because of their track record of hostility to Scottish interests and the total bad faith of David Cameron towards the Scottish people the day after the referendum. 'However, support for any other administration comes with the conditon of progress for Scotland. 'Progress to fully deliver the promises on real powers that were made to the Scottish people during the referendum. Progress to signal an end to austerity economics with all the damage that this is doing to the country and finally common sense progress in stopping the waste of countless billions on new nuclear weapons.' It comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in Scotland revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP could see Labour lose almost 40 seats north of the border. The survey, by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, showed the SNP could win as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats – up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives would end up being tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. But a Labour government could be propped up by the SNP – handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10. However, Labour's Scottish MPs are urging Mr Miliband to rule out a deal with the SNP ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party's dire poll ratings north of the border. Scottish Labour is holding its annual conference in Edinburgh this weekend. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has also warned Labour against doing a deal with the SNP. Sir John claimed 'the SNP would enter into any agreement with Labour with one overriding aim: to break up the United Kingdom'. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'Labour now have to make a choice. 'They must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent. The British people – north and south of the border — do not deserve to be misled. Labour must remove any doubt. 'If the outcome of the general election is inconclusive, will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the United Kingdom?' The SNP said that Labour would 'not be forgiven by the people of Scotland' if they refused to work with the Nationalists. Deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'For a former Tory prime minister to tell Labour what to do on the eve of their conference in Scotland is hugely embarrassing for (Scottish Labour leader) Jim Murphy. 'John Major wants the Tories to be re-elected in May, and therefore he wants Labour to rule out an agreement with the SNP, because that would stop the Tories.' 'There are no circumstances in which the SNP would put the Tories into government - the question is if Labour have the same commitment, with a number of senior Labour figures promoting voting Tory in Scotland, and even the idea of a 'grand alliance' between the Tories and Labour.","Scrapping Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent is a key SNP policy .

"Google Play apps will now be scrutinised by Google reviewers and come with age-based content ratings, the company has revealed. The announcement is a move away from the firm's strategy to differentiate itself from Apple by allowing developers to immediately publish their mobile apps. But Google added that it will not be adopting Apple's practice of only approving apps that meet its stringent quality standards. Google is tightening supervision of its freewheeling Play store, forming a special team to screen new apps for malware and sexually explicit material, and strengthening its age-based rating system . The change underscores the growing importance of apps in the success of the companies' rival mobile gadgets. Google and Apple each manage online hubs with more than one million apps ranging from calendars to video games. Google said in its official blog today that its expert team will screen each app submitted by developers to spot earlier anything that runs afoul of its rules. The developer policies exclude sexually explicit material, 'gratuitous violence,' hate speech, gambling, 'dangerous products,' spam and infringement of intellectual property. The new age-rating system will see Android developers filling in a questionnaire about their app or game instead of simply choosing a rating . Google had only used automated technology for screening at the time of submission. The new process will not create bottlenecks, Google said, promising that approved apps will become available on Google Play within 'a matter of hours' after submission. Apple does not disclose its app review period, but the website appreviewtimes.com puts the average wait time at seven days for Apple's App Store. Developers must answer special questionnaires about their apps to help independent ratings organisations assign age-based ratings, Google said. Millions of Android handsets have been exposed to malware through malicious apps being offered on Google Play. The apps include the Durak card game, along with a history game and IQ test, which combined have been installed more than 15 million times. The apps cause unwanted adverts to display on users' phones and their abnormal behaviour sometimes doesn't appear until a month after installation. The apps were discovered after Prague-based antivirus provider, Avast, received a user complaint. 'This impression remains until you reboot your device and wait for a couple of days,' wrote Filip Chytry, an Avast mobile malware analyst. 'After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device. Some of the apps wait up to 30 days until they show their true colours.' As well as Durak, the other other games included a Russian IQ test with up to five million installs, and a Russian history app game, which has been installed up to 50,000 times by Android users. These apps have now been removed from Google Play. 'We know that people in different countries have different ideas about what content is appropriate for kids, teens and adults,' Google said in the blog post. 'Today's announcement will help developers better label their apps for the right audience.' As of May, apps submitted without the questionnaire will not be published in Google Play, and existing apps that do not seek a rating could be blocked in certain markets or for certain users, Google said. Google has also partnered with the International Age Rating Coalition, the Pan-European Game Information and the Australian Classification Board, to provide relevant ratings in various countries. Until now, Google has let developers rate their own apps using a system created by Google.","Brings Google in line with Apple, which reviews apps by hand .

"Chinese officials have claimed Muslims from the country's western region are travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS - before returning home  to take part in plots against the communist rule. Authorities in  Xinjiang said they were planning to strengthen a crackdown on terrorism and extremism in the area, home to the minority Muslim Uighur, some of whom want their own independent state. But officials failed to provide any further details to back up their claims - although The Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in December about 300 Chinese are fighting alongside the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Recruits: Chinese officials have claimed people from Xinjiang province, home to the minority Muslim Uighur, have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside ISIS . Separatists: Some of the Uighur want their own state, like these delegates from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and the area has been beset by violence in recent years . 'There are Uighurs that have fled overseas and joined the Islamic State,' said Zhang Chunxian, Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, on Tuesday. 'The organisation has a huge international influence and Xinjiang can't keep aloof from it and we have already been affected. 'We have also found that some who fought returned to Xinjiang to participate in terrorist plots.' China has previously expressed concerns about the rise of ISIS, fearing it will fuel unrest and violence in Xinjiang, where some seek to set up an independent state called East Turkestan. Xinjiang has seen repeated violence, as members of the Muslim Uighur have bristled under what they say is repressive Chinese government rule. Beijing has previously blamed the violence on Islamic militants with foreign connections who are seeking an independent state in Xinjiang, but has offered little evidence and ignored calls for independent investigations. Uighur groups say police have used indiscriminate deadly force against people protesting the government's policies in the region. Chinese officials have started cracking down on the use of the veil in public, but tensions between the two groups have been on the increase for years. Pictured: . A Uighur man passes part of the old city of Kashgar . Attacks blamed on Uighurs have also occurred in other parts of the country, including a car which plowed into Beijing's Tiananmen Gate in 2013, killing five people. Many of the group, who have traditionally followed a moderate form of Islam, have also begun adopting practices more commonly seen in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, such as full-face veils for women in the face of the crackdown. Some Xinjiang cities have placed restrictions on Islamic dress, including the capital Urumqi, which banned the wearing of veils in public late last year. Zhang said authorities would take measures to stop people from going abroad to fight with the group, and that he expects 'fewer and fewer cases' of that happening. 'We are confident that we can fix it,' he said. Another official, Shohrat Zakir, said a yearlong crackdown on terrorist activities in the region 'has won wide support from people of all ethnic groups.'","Claims people from minority Muslim group are travelling to fight with ISIS .
Some are then returning to home state of Xinjiang to plot against Chinese .

"Eight dead bodies hang from a metal frame in the Iraq's Kirkuk province in Islamic State's latest public display of barbarity. The gruesome images which emerged on social media  show the men's limp bodies suspended from their feet off a tall structure in the town of Hawija. The notorious black flag used by Islamist groups like ISIS is displayed above them as horrified onlookers inspect the scene. Some of the deceased men appear to be wearing military fatigues but it is not known if they were Iraqi soldiers. An ISIS fighter believed to be Abu Al-Rahman poses triumphantly in one of the pictures - giving the one-fingered salute in front of a bloodied victim's corpse. Scroll down for video . Barbarity: Eight men were found hanging from their feet in the Iraqi city of Hawija in the militants' latest public display of death . Gruesome: The dead men were suspended from a tall structure in the same city that Syrian soldiers were paraded through the streets in cages . Hallmark of terror: The notorious black flag used by extremist Jihadi groups like ISIS hung above the deceased men . Death: It is unknown whether the men were Iraqi soldiers, as ISIS' presence in the northern-Iraqi city grows . The same tyrant has been been pictured before alongside severed heads and masked ISIS fighters. A shocking video released in February showed orange-clad captives being paraded in cages in the same city of Hawija. Frenzied crowds taunted the kidnapped men during the merciless procession which echoed the terrible death suffered by captured Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. He was also caged before a film of him being burned alive, implying the same fate would befall the trapped captives in Hawija. It was seen as revenge against the Kurdish forces who dragged the bodies of ISIS fighters through the streets of northern-Iraq earlier that month. Previous reports suggest he is an Iraqi national from the town of Almere and the heads once belonged to members of the Syrian army whom the militants captured and beheaded. The extremist group has established a firm foothold in what was once an oil-rich Kurdish stronghold of Kirkuk. ISIS has been preparing a new base for its deadly operations in Hawija as the United States train Iraqi troops for an invasion to retake Mosul, the International Business Times reports. Terrorist: The man pictured posing alongside the suspended men is believed to be Abu Al-Rahman . Islamic State: The same man has been previously been pictured alongside armed, masked fighters believed to belong to ISIS . History of terror: Al-Rahman has also been photographed giving the one-fingered ISIS salute in front of several decapitated heads . Hawija is a predominantly Sunni Muslim town which lies off a major highway leading to Mosul and the capital Baghdad. Since ISIS first invaded the city in June 2014, it progressively conquered neighbouring villages until it gained enough support from locals to establish its new headquarters there. Over the last nine months, its main base in Iraq has been in Iraq's second-largest city Mosul which it took over last year. It has offered Islamic State a military advantage due to its proximity to the Syrian border, which allows them to smuggle both weapons and soldiers. But a US-led coalition has attacked the city with airstrikes for many months - targeting ISIS convoys and weapons stores. Trapped: A terrified Kurdish prisoner looks out from his cage at a mob of jeering militants in the horrific scene in Hawija . Captives: Each prisoner was accompanied by a black-clad and flag-waving jihadi - some armed with AK-47s . The Americans are now training over 20,000 Iraqi soldiers to retake the city from Islamic State's deadly grip, US Cnetral Command has revealed. Their presence in Hawija gives the militants access to Anbar province and another road leading to the Baiji oil refinery they lost to the Iraqi military in November 2014. Hawija has been a hotbed of violence April 2013 - two years after the US withdrew its troops from the country. It began when the government's forces raided a camp of rebels in the city on April 24 and killed dozens of civilians in the process. 300 people had died as a result of the army's battle with militant groups in the region in the next three days alone.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A gang has been found guilty of ambushing a pair of rival drug dealers and stabbing them to death in a frenzied attack in order to steal their client list. Aaron Carriere, 21, and Josiah Manful, 20, were lured to a quiet residential road in Leytonstone, east London, where they were 'boxed in' by their killers and stabbed 24 times in less than a minute in 'a swift, frenzied and utterly brutal attack'. Six young men and a youth aged 17 were on trial at the Old Bailey accused of the murders which took place in the early hours of Saturday March 1 last year. Aaron Carriere (pictured left) and Josiah Manful (right) were lured to a quiet residential road  where they were 'boxed in' by their killers and stabbed 24 times in less than a minute in 'a frenzied and utterly brutal attack' The ringleader, Devonte Campbell, 20, and two of his co-defendants Casey Jones, 19, and Alex Bernard, 21, told jurors that they had thought they were going to a party at a club but the youth said that was a lie and they were actually planning a show of force in the rival territory. The jury, which began deliberating last Friday, unanimously found Campbell, Jones and Bernard guilty of two counts of murder. Omar Hassan, 21, was found guilty by a majority of 11-1. They will be sentenced at a later date. Opening the murder trial last year, prosecutor Lisa Wilding QC said the two victims were set upon in their black Ford Fiesta in Montague Road having been trapped by four cars which stopped in front and behind so they had no means of escape. She said: 'The occupants of the four cars that boxed in that lone vehicle got out and ran to the trapped car. Inside it were two young men - Josiah Manful and Aaron Carriere. 'Less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded having been stabbed in a swift, frenzied, utterly brutal attack that left Mr Manful with 13 wounds and Mr Carriere with 11.' Mr Manful managed to get out of the driver's seat to call for help but both men were fatally wounded and were pronounced dead at the scene. Omar Hassan (pictured left) 21, and Alex Bernard, 21, (right) were both found guilty of murder . Jurors were told that the defendants had been 'working as a team' to 'lure' the two young men in to a trap and kill them. Although there were drugs and cash in the car, only one item was stolen - Mr Carriere's mobile phone which contained his drug dealing 'client list'. The prosecutor said: 'The ferocity of the attack, which was inflicted upon men who were helpless and trapped in their car seats, by a pack of men who surrounded the car, the use of at least two knives, the stab wounds to the neck and torso that killed them, were all intended to cause at least very serious harm and we say was intended to kill them.' Each of the defendants played their part in the murders, some wielding knives, some lending support through physical intimidating presence, and others acting as getaway drivers, the court heard. Afterwards, some of the defendants tried to evade capture by dumping cars and fleeing the country in the days after the attack, the court heard. Casey Jones, 19, (pictured left) and Devonte Campbell (right) aged 20 were also found guilty of murder . Mr Carriere and Mr Manful's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims, with one eyewitness likening the attackers to 'a pack of wild animals', the Old Bailey heard. 'Less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded, having been stabbed in a swift, frenzied utterly brutal attack than left Manful with 13 wounds and Carriere with eleven,' said prosecutor Jacob Hallam. During the attack Carriere managed to answer his phone and gasp 'help me' to an associate who heard the sound of repeated blows. Manful managed to stagger out of the car but collapsed on the bonnet while his friend died in the car. Mr Hallam added: 'The extent of the injuries of the victims was such that it initially looked as though they had both been shot.' Mr Carriere was a 'successful drugs dealer' selling crack cocaine, heroin and cannabis on the streets of Leytonstone and, unbeknown to him, was the subject of an undercover police probe. The Old Bailey (pictured) heard Mr Carriere and Mr Manful's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims, with one eyewitness likening the attackers to 'a pack of wild animals' On the night he died, he had been dealing drugs and may have been planning to sell more because he had four packages of crack and eight of heroin rolled together and hidden in his underwear as well as £700 cash in his bag. Mr Manful was apparently worried for his safety because at the time of his death he had a lock knife hidden in his boxer shorts, the jury was told. Campbell, Jones, Bernard, and Hassan, all from east London, denied two counts of murder. Wail Alawi, 23, Abraar Amin, 18, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also from east London, were cleared. It can now be reported that Campbell, a known gang member, was serving a suspended jail sentence at the time of the killings. In January last year, he was handed 16 weeks' jail, suspended for 12 months, and disqualified from driving for 18 months for perverting the course of justice, dangerous driving and driving without due care and attention.","Aaron Carriere, 21, and Josiah Manful, 20, were stabbed to death last March .

"Emily Maitlis’s outfit on Newsnight on Wednesday – complete with spotty tie, waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves - sparked discussion among viewers . It is meant to be BBC television’s flagship current affairs programme. But, for some, Newsnight appeared to be more reminiscent of school-set comedy St Trinian’s. Emily Maitlis’s outfit on Wednesday night – complete with spotty tie, waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves – raised more than a few eyebrows on social networking site Twitter. The BBC2 programme was watched by 830,000 people but it was the 44-year-old’s unusual outfit choice that sparked discussion and drew attention away from what was meant to be the programme’s top story. The leading segment was intended as a serious discussion about the announcement by the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson’s contract would not be renewed following a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon. Miss Maitlis interviewed Alan Yentob, the BBC’s creative director and presenter of arts show Imagine, about the decision. Mr Yentob’s remarks on the programme were also criticised as elitist. One viewer tweeted: ‘Why is Emily Maitlis dressed as if she has escaped from the sets of St Trinian’s, refusing to play the extra.’ Another added: ‘Of course we all adore Emily Maitlis almost as much as she adores herself but isn’t the ravaged St Trinian’s schoolgirl look a tad de trop?’ A third wrote: ‘Emily Maitlis is wearing a strange outfit this eve, part off duty city boy, part pirate.’ This is not the first time the journalist’s wardrobe has drawn comments. In 2012, she was compared to a Sontaran – an alien from Doctor Who – after anchoring BBC News while wearing an unconventional collar.

"Trang-Thuy 'Tina' Nguyen, 37, died in hospital Tuesday after being hit by a falling wooden plank. She was scheduled to get married in July . A 37-year-old woman killed in Manhattan's West Village by a piece of plywood that was blown out of luxury condo development in 40mph winds wore a wedding dress to her funeral. Trang-Thuy 'Tina' Nguyen, who was killed in a freak accident on St Patrick's Day, was scheduled to get married in July. About 200 friends and family members gathered in a Philadelphia church on Saturday to say goodbye to the Manhattan real estate broker. Nguyen's bridesmaids wore the long yellow gowns they planned to wear to the wedding and wore red shoes to honor their friend's Vietnamese heritage, according to the New York Daily News. Groomsmen appeared to be wearing matching formal clothes as well. The Philadelphia native was pushed into a wall at a parking garage and struck her head at about 5.50pm on Tuesday, a source told the New York Daily News. She was taken to the hospital but died of injuries. The plywood came from new construction The Greenwich Lane - a 200-unit development in five buildings and five townhouses that stands on what was once the site of St. Vincent's Hospital. ABC 7 reports the woman was on her cell phone as she passed the entrance to a parking lot entrance, when the four-by-eight-foot sheet of plywood, separated from the security fence across the street. Nguyen's fiance Alex Beitler expressed his love for his fiancee at the funeral service, which took place at St. Thomas Aquinas Church. He had proposed to her at the top of the Eiffel Tower. Alex Beitler (front left) and other men carry his fiance Tina Nguyen's casket out of the Philadelphia church after the funeral service on Saturday . Beitler looks at the hearse as friends comfort him. Friends and family members, including groomsmen and bridesmaids, wore to Nguyen's funeral what they would have worn to the couple's wedding in July . Rev. Hugh Shields said the 'loss is so great' and that he was 'touched by the number of broken hearts' in the church. Nazeela Khan, who was one of Nguyen's bridesmaids said that her friend was the most kind-hearted and giving person she knew. During his eulogy, Shields held up a wooden cross carried by a dozen people, claiming that the loss of Nguyen should be carried 'the way these figures are carrying this cross'. 'It is the thought of death that makes life worth living,' he said. City officials closed West Village construction site after Nguyen's death after the Buildings Department cited 11 serious code violations in the last three years. The unfinished development has apartments starting at $3.65million and is already nearly sold out. Part of the property is now home to the most expensive apartment ever sold in Greenwich Village. According to NY Curbed: 'The south penthouse at 155 West 11th Street, the new construction tower that's part of the Greenwich Lane complex, entered contract for $45 million, a price that will set a new neighborhood price record when it closes.' The four-by-eight-foot sheet of plywood blew out of The Greenwich Lane, a luxury condo development, during 40mph winds . Builder Turner Construction issued a statement to the New York Daily News: 'We are deeply saddened by the death of a pedestrian who was walking near the construction site on W. 12th Street,' the company said. It said that 'safety on and around our jobsites is always our number one priority'. Bill and Eric Rudin, owners of developer West Village Residences, issued their own somber statement. 'What happened is tragic and devastating,' they said. 'We extend our deepest condolences to the family.' Nguyen's family asked for donations to the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia to honor her death. 'We grieve that we will not see her walk down the aisle to marry her perfect mate, Alex,' her family said in a statement. 'The world is a dimmer place without her.'

"The striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across Britain on their way to work this Friday. It will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush-hour in the UK, and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment. Experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter. The path of totality for Friday's eclipse will travel from just beneath the Greenland peninsula to the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March will travel over Europe . On 20 March, the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. The proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near-total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the UK, so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in London, Manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The most ‘complete’ eclipse in the UK will be see from Lerwick in the Shetland Isles. Timeings will vary, so that in London, the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will begin at 8.24am. The  eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. By 10.41am, the moon will leave the sun's edge and the partial eclipse will end. The solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of Europe. On the morning of the 20 March the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over Earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 August 1999 (pictured over Germany) The eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. Driving experts have warned drivers to keep their eyes' on the road to avoid accidents . The last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 August 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029. An eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun’s diameter obscured by the moon. It is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration, which is a measure of the sun’s surface area covered by the moon. The value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum. The maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to Ramnicu Valcea in Romania. It was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in Europe since 22 July 1990, and the first visible in the UK since 29 June 1927. For spectators in Edinburgh, for example, the eclipse will begin, peak and end four minutes later. Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent, which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands, meaning that drivers in these places will have to switch on their headlights. But RAC spokesman Simon Williams told MailOnline: ‘The biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness.' He said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013. ‘It is imperative that rush-hour drivers maintain good focus on the road ahead rather than being tempted to catch a glimpse of the moon obscuring the sun and therefore not fully concentrating on what’s going on around them,' he added. ‘Anyone that does, is not only taking their eyes off the road, but may well end up being temporarily blinded from the sun’s brightness before it is eclipsed. ‘The weather will also play an important role on the day: if it is a bright day, the eclipse will be more dramatic and may therefore pose a greater distraction to motorists. ‘The best advice has to be to either watch the eclipse from a safe place or watch it on the news later as the risk of doing it from the wheel could result in you becoming part of a nasty news story.’ The Highways Agency has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed, just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions. An RAC spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness. Distraction is a major cause of accidents (stock image) on the road and was, in fact, a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013.' Projection: Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. Referring to the rush hour problem, Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society for Popular Astronomy (SPA) told The Independent: ‘It’s not the best time [for an eclipse] from a safety point of view.’ However, he told MailOnline: 'Practically speaking there shouldn't be a problem - even from the north of Scotland there will still be plenty of light and if you didn't know there was an eclipse in progress you might not even notice. 'It will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun. But danger could occur if a driver decides to take a quick look at the sun. He said: 'There are the obvious issues about being distracted while driving, whether it's looking at the sun or anything else that attracts your attention away from the road. 'But if you stare at the bright sun you could be dazzled, which could then affect your ability to spot something in your way if not leading to permanent eye damage.' He said that while drivers often have to cope with driving in a low sun, they typically concentrate on the road, but 'reflex action prevents you from actually staring at it, and moves your centre of attention around.' 'If you want to view the eclipse stop somewhere safe and make sure you have eclipse glasses with you. Sunglasses are no good - not even several pairs on top of each other,' he said. Institutions such as SPA and the Royal Astronomical society have called on people to watch the event safely, using special glasses or pinhole cameras, for example and have published tips and guidelines. The solar eclipse  will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over London and around 94 per cent in the main cities in Scotland (pictured is a full eclipse over Australia in 2012) The Highways Agency has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed, just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions . Tom Kerss, astronomer at The Royal Observatory Greenwich said: 'Since the Moon is smaller than the Earth, and very far away, the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide, and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. 'However, if the weather is clear, observers on Svalbard and the Faroes should experience almost three minutes of extraordinary day-time darkness. 'What’s more, lunar perigee - the time in the Lunar month when the Earth and Moon are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse. This makes our 2015 Spring Equinox eclipse a ‘supermoon’ eclipse - perhaps we should call that a supereclipse. 'Since the shadow of the moon will be ever so slightly larger in this scenario, it might appear slightly darker during totality, but in practise I think this would be difficult to detect, even by an experienced eclipse chaser. 'Nevertheless, it’s nice to have a supermoon, equinox and eclipse all falling on the same day. 'It’ll be well worth taking a look outside to see the two most important astronomical bodies in our lives rising together, and witness the last eclipse to cover so much of the sun from Europe in over a decade.' The eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across Europe, energy experts have warned. The spread of huge solar arrays across the EU means that more than 10 per cent of the continent’s electricity now comes from solar panels. With power supply so reliant on the sun’s rays, the solar eclipse on 20 March might lead to blackouts. Electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses ‘an unprecedented test for Europe’s electricity system’. The European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity, a group of power supply organisations, said: ‘The risk of incident cannot be completely ruled out. ‘Solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation, the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures.’ The organisation said it had been planning so-called ‘countermeasures’ for months, with suppliers across Europe set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off. The eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in Britain because so little of our power comes from solar power. Despite a boom in British solar arrays in recent years, particularly in southern England, solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs. The National Grid said it expected solar power output in Britain to halve from an average March figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts.","Near-total solar eclipse will coincide with morning rush hour on Friday .

"If you want to impress a man, don't try to be funny. Research shows that men aren't hugely attracted to witty women. Given the choice of a female who makes him laugh, or one that laughs at his jokes, he will choose the latter. Luckily, women aren't too worried about their jokes being appreciated. They, it seems, like men who make them smile. Men prefer it if a woman laughs at their jokes, rather than witty women research suggests (stock image) It is thought that women see the ability to make people laugh sign of intelligence – and men have evolved to show off how good they are with words. The University of Miami researchers quizzed more than 80 men and women about how much importance they placed on having a partner who could make them laugh. They were also asked how much it mattered to them whether their partner found them funny. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour. In a second experiment, the volunteers were given hypothetical amounts of money to 'spend' on designing their ideal partner. They were asked how much of the cash they'd be willing to spend on getting someone who made them laugh and how much they'd devote to getting someone who laughed at their jokes. As the amount of 'money' on offer rose, the sexes became less rigid in their choices, with the males starting to splash the cash on funny females the women showing more interest in males who found them witty. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour (stock image) Researcher Liana Hone said this suggests that in an ideal world, we value both traits in a partner. However, in the real world, we tend to place more emphasis on one or the other. She believes that women see the ability to make people laugh as a sign of intelligence – and of the sort of high quality genes that she'd want in her children. Given that women tend to be more choosy, men are under pressure to make them laugh. Miss Hone, who is close to completing her PhD, said: 'Given that humour requires high-level linguistic capacity, women are thought to use humour production as a sign that a man is a mentally-capable suitor.' However, she said that funny women shouldn't despair. There is also hope for bachelors who never remember punch lines. This is because her results were based on averages – and not everyone will have the same taste.","Men prefer a woman to like their jokes rather than make them laugh .

"One Direction fans have already been rocked by the news that Zayn Malik and Perrie Edwards' engagement may be over after a picture was revealed of the singer cosying up to another woman in Thailand. And now it has been reported that there is another bout of love woes in the band, as Louis Tomlinson's long-term relationship with Eleanor Calder is also over. The Sun reports that the young star was pictured kissing an unidentified bikini-clad woman in a pool after an all-night party in Bangkok. And a representative for Louis confirmed to MailOnline that he has indeed parted ways from 22-year-old Eleanor, whom he had been in a relationship with for around four years. Scroll down for video . It's over: Louis Tomlinson's long-term relationship with Eleanor Calder has come to an end . 'Louis and Eleanor split up two weeks ago. They have not announced this as they wanted some privacy during this time,' the spokesperson stated. Meanwhile, a source told The Sun: 'They were kissing on and off for about 15 minutes. Louis was just wearing his boxers, having stripped off to swim. 'They were snogging passionately. I thought it was Eleanor until she turned round. He is going to be in a bit of trouble. It's thought that the 23-year-old pop singer had been enjoying a raucous night at the Sukhothai hotel in Thailand's capital with bandmate Zayn, along with a couple of unknown girls. It was around 6.30 in the morning on March 14 when he was spotted wearing just his underpants with his arms around the mystery woman, where they kissed for quarter of an hour. Long-term loves: The cute couple - pictured at Louis' mum's wedding last year - had been an item for around four years, but he has already been pictured kissing a mystery woman after an all-night pool party in Thailand . The witness also added that the boys appeared to have been drinking all night at the hotel, and were being watched over by a security guard. 'Louis had stripped off and got in the pool before he began kissing his girl,' they said. Apparently, they all spent time together for around 30 minutes before leaving as a group at around 7am, just after dawn. However, it's thought Louis was actually single when the potentially incriminating pictures were taken. Love woes: A spokesperson for the One Direction star confirmed that he and Eleanor ended their relationship two weeks ago, before the pictures of him revealed him kissing a bikini-clad woman . Tangled up in love: The news of Louis' love split comes hot on the heels of Zayn Malik's relationship woes with fiancee Perrie Edwards, after he was seen cosying up to another woman in Thailand . Meanwhile, both Louis and Eleanor have remained quiet on the subject of their split, with the pretty brunette merely posting about her recent trip to Los Angeles on her Instagram page. The couple had been an item for four years after initially being introduced by Harry Styles, and Eleanor last year acted as the Maid of Honour at Louis' mum's wedding. She even shared a sweet snap of herself in her pretty dress alongside her suit-clad man on the day, along with the caption: 'Maid of Honour & Best Man.' It's thought that Eleanor was going to travel with One Direction to Asia, where they are currently performing as part of their world tour, but at the last minute opted to go to the USA instead. The stress of the constant travelling the globe is said to have been the root cause of the love split between Louis and Eleanor, who had often been thought of as the strongest pairing in the boy band. The news of Louis and Eleanor's split comes in the wake of the crisis over Zayn's engagement with Little Mix star Perrie. Perrie was pictured leaving the home she shares with her fiance after a five hour chat in the early hours of Friday morning, while shielding her face. The perfect couple? Friends of the twosome had long considered 22-year-old Eleanor and Louis a dream item . Cosying up: They were never afraid to put on a public display of affection . The singer was seen getting into a taxi with several bulky bags loaded beside her as she attempted to go incognito for the journey, after her partner flew into the country from Thailand in the early hours and went straight to the pair's home, arriving at 5am. The couple's relationship has come under scrutiny after the One Direction star was pictured holding hands with a blonde female in Thailand earlier in the week. Zayn immediately denied the claims but has quit the current 1D tour due to the stress of the situation. It has now been claimed that Zayn is 'struggling' with his fame. After Zayn was spotted cosying up to Essex girl Lauren Richardson, causing speculation he had cheated on Perrie, a source told The Sun newspaper: 'Zayn can't cope with his private life being scrutinised to this level. Boys in trouble? Zayn and Louis have been rocked by the recent allegations of supposed parties while the band have been touring in Thailand . 'He's worried if he'll ever be able to managed the constant attention like the rest of his bandmates.' Zayn pulled out of a commercial recording in Hong Kong on Thursday and flew back to the UK due to the stress of media speculation on his private life. And now fresh reports claim that Zayn had actually 'handpicked' Lauren out of a crowd while partying one night in Thailand. According to 19-year-old Lauren's fellow holiday-goer Sean Dolan, she boasted about the 22-year-old handsome lad and their evening together. The incriminating picture: Zayn publicly apologised after being pictured with his arm around Lauren and told his fans, 'I'm sorry for what it looks like' Making friends: Lauren wasn't the only person Zayn took pictures with but she is the only person he was spotted holding hands with . Speaking to The Sunday Mirror, he said: 'She said Zayn was a lovely guy, and she'd been back to where they were staying – which was apparently incredible. 'She said each of them had a suite to themselves, and she was allowed to take a look around and even messed around in the pool. 'She said she had given Zayn her number but didn't expect to hear from him again and had enjoyed hanging out together – it sounds like she just had a great time.' Crisis talks?

"This is an amazing eye-witness account of how the Duke of Wellington came within inches of death on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. Now 200 years later, the two page missive from the frontline is set to go under the hammer in London. It explains how the British military commander lived up to his nickname of the Iron Duke and did not even flinch when the deadly missile landed in the ground close by him. Instead of cowering, he simply shook off the dirt that had covered him and finished writing out an order on bended knee. When the battle was won the peckish commander sat on the ground and took out a piece of bread from his pocket which he 'seemed to eat with great appetite.' The account written by Colonel Charles Best of the days leading up to the Battle of Waterloo is expected to fetch £4,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams, London . The account by Colonel Charles Best also described witnessing Napoleon on horseback riding through the ranks to rouse his men who responded with cries of 'Vive l'Empereur'. The senior officer went on to write of how the French Emperor 'luckily lost his head' during the Battle of Waterloo, helping the Anglo-Allied army to victory. Col Best then bedded down for the night while the cries of the injured rang out. The next day he and his men spent eight hours carrying the wounded from the battlefield and shooting maimed horses. He came across the blood-soaked body of Major General Sir William Ponsonby, one of the most senior officers killed at Waterloo after he was overtaken and speared by French lancers. Col Best wrote: 'I found M Gnl. Sir Wm. Ponsonby who was struck through the chest and body, he was strip'd except his shirt which was entirely soakd in blood.' His 14 page letter also documented the British entry into Paris two months later where they were met by a relieved King of France who had been living in exile in Prussia during the Napoloenic wars. The original letter was written in two sections to Col Best's cousin called Charlotte dated July 25 and July 28 has now been put up for sale at auction for an estimated £4,000. The Duke of Wellington, pictured left, defeated Napoleon, pictured right, at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 . The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses. A spokesman for auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The detail in this latter is simply fantastic, you do really get the sense of immediacy. Arthur Wesley was born in Dublin in early May 1769. The family changed their name to Wellesley in 1798. He studied at Eton before finding his calling when he joined the army in 1787. He led the British, Portuguese and Spanish forces during the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1814 and eventually forced the French to withdraw from Spain and Portugal. When he returned home he was given the title the Duke of Wellington. He later defeated Napoleaon in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo after becoming  commander of the allied armies. In 1828 Wellington  accepted the postition of prime minister and his government fell two years later. When they regained power Wellington refused the position of PM. Between 1834 and 1835 he held the post of foreign minister, before retiring in 1846. Wellington was given a state funeral after he  died on September 14, 1852 . 'Quite often people give a rather matter-of-fact account of these things but this almost could have been written by a novelist. It is a fascinating vignette of Wellington at Waterloo.' The letter is owned by a private collector who bought it over 30 years ago believing it to be a copy. But it has since been shown to be the original letter. Col Best commanded the Fourth Hanoverian Brigade at Waterloo. His account starts at the Battle of Quatre Bras that was a prelude to Waterloo and took place two days before the main event. It was there he met Wellington and saw him almost killed. He penned: 'Our brave Duke was every where and I had an opportunity of seeing how little he was concerned for his safety. 'He was sitting on the brink of the ditch writing an order with a pencil on his knee, when a cannon ball struck the ground close by him, and covered him with earth, he lookd very cooly to where the ball had struck, shook off the earth, and continued to write his order. 'The Duke came to where I stood, and when we had destroy'd the enemy's cavalry...he sat down on the ground, and took a bit of bread out of his pocket, which he seemed to eat with great appetite.' Describing the Battle of Waterloo two days later he wrote: 'We were placed on the famous hights (sic) the enemy forming before us in front. 'Bonaparte passt (sic) their ranks, and was received with loud cries of 'Vive l'Empereur'. Napoleon Bonaparte was born into a gentry family in Corsica in August 1769. After military school he rapidly moved through the ranks of the French army and was appointed as commander in Italy in 1796. In a coup d'etat  in 1799, Napoleon became first consul. He later became emperor. The Battle of Marengo was one of Napoleon’s greatest military victories. The Frenchman was at the height of his military powers, and drove Austrian forces out of Italy. Heavy defeats during the Peninsular War drained his military resources. The invasion of Russia in 1812 resulted in a disastrous retreat. Napoleon went into exile on the Mediterranean island of Elba after Paris fell to the allide forces in 1814. The Battle of Waterloo ended his reign. Napoleon died on May 5, 1821, on the island of St Helena where he was imprisoned by the British after the battle. 'I never in my life experienced such a heavy firing and such obstinate firing, several times I was afraid of our being obliged to give way, but thanks to the perseverance of our commander, and steadyness of the troops, we kept it up till 5 in the evening. 'I was afraid the enemy would attack our left, as he had done our right, luckily Mr Boney had lost his head, and made another furious attack on our centre, but was again repulsed the Prussians now began to advance we did the same, and the day was ours. 'We were engaged from 11 in the morning till near 9 in the evening and I never sustained such a thirst as that day.' Describing the bloody aftermath of the battle, he wrote: 'The British Dragoons had the humanity to ride about and make an end of the suffering animals by shooting them. 'My men were employed for more than 8 hours in conveying the wounded from the field of battle which they did with blankets.' Two months later Col Best rode into Paris for Wellington's victory parade where he was introduced to King Louis XVIII who told him: 'I am very happy to see you here in Paris - I am much obliged to you for what you have done for me.' The letter is expected to fetch £4,000 when it goes under the hammer tomorrow (Weds) in London.","Colonel Charles Best wrote the account ahead of Battle of Waterloo .

"A pair of impoverished students posed as millionaires in order to be given a tour of a £5million penthouse by an estate agent - and then cheekily offered £800 for a 'quick sale'. Students Ben Foreman and Will Bainbridge, both aged 19, pretended to be millionaires so they could view the luxury 17th storey penthouse flat in Aldgate, London, which features a roof terrace and two kitchens. The University College London students, from Camden, north west London, dressed up in their best suits and said the estate agent did not catch on - even whenl they proposed a 'quick sale' offer of £800 on the multi-million pound flat. Students Ben Foreman (pictured right posing on the penthouse's bed) and Will Bainbridge (pictured right in the kitchen) pretended to be millionaires in order to view the luxury 17th storey penthouse in London . Second year philosophy student Ben wrote about their experience in student newspaper The Tab: 'Living in London we see all these massive places and we saw an advert for this one and thought it looked awesome. 'So we posed as London's latest millionaires in order to view the finest apartment the capital has to offer. Ben told the estate agent that he works in London's exclusive Savile Row and second year economics student Will posed as a high-flying banker. They wrote: 'The estate agent showed us architectural plans for the completed development as we marvelled at the power of human ingenuity. 'Then we maintained a polite silence as we whooshed up in the lift to the 17th floor.' The pair were taken on a tour of the three-bedroom penthouse which boasts a games room, four bathrooms and two living rooms. Ben wrote: 'Looking around, it was clearly a decent gaff, and probably worth its eye-watering rent. 'Despite forcefully voicing our concerns that the view was limited to only 360°, the estate agent assured us that on a good day we’d have a great view of some prime London real estate . 'The bed was comfortable and the bath was more than spacious enough for both of us at once. 'We went in with an offer of £800, which is the sum of our overdrafts combined. It was declined.' The pair wondered if they had the money whether they would buy the penthouse anyway. Will said: 'It was the dream, but we questioned whether our money could be better spent elsewhere.' Student Ben appears to have taken this selfie in the penthouse bath - they also took this picture of the kitchen . Ben told MailOnline: ‘I’ve Just started writing for The Tab. We recently went on a bar crawl in Bishopsgate and thought imagine if you lived here, and that’s where the idea came from really. ‘The man who showed us around was really nice. The developers have a station where the concierge will eventually be and he took us straight up and was very professional the whole way through. ‘He didn’t look like he twigged we were just students – but he may have just had a really good poker face. ‘I told him I worked on Savile Row which isn’t technically a lie as I do have a Saturday job in Abercrombie. ‘We mentioned the £800 in passing but I think he thought we were joking – he didn’t seem to take it seriously. ‘Seeing the penthouse has definitely given us more motivation to do well now. ‘I’ve definitely been working harder this week than I was the week before.’ MailOnline approached the estate agent for a comment.

"Today might be Mother’s Day but when it comes to staying slim women can’t afford to put their feet up, according to a study. For they burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do. Doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day-to-day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used. No time to relax: Women burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do . All six ate a 600-calorie fry-up before each couple was assigned a different activity: an hour in the gym, three hours of cleaning, or lounging about. Their energy use was then assessed. Patrick and Roma Burn were lucky enough to spend the morning on the sofa. But while Patrick burned up 640 calories just by being a couch potato, Roma used only 292. The results are to be shown in a BBC1 programme, The Truth About Calories. Presenter Dr Chris van Tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy-hungry muscle mass. ‘Bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones,’ he said. But Patrick and Roma were extreme examples, he noted, as Mr Burn was ‘100kg of lean muscle’ and his wife ‘probably weighed half that’. A morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, the programme found . The programme also found a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, which left the couple exhausted. Jim Norris got through 834 calories and his wife Elaine 729 during the morning, in which they spent an hour in the gym lifting weights. Meanwhile, Nick and Margaret Shenkin burnt 862 and 629 calories respectively cleaning the house. Dr van Tulleken said: ‘Moderate continuous activity uses more calories, and body size and lifestyle – what you do with your day – also play a much more important part than you might think when it comes to calorie consumption.’","Doctors measured how much energy three couples expended day-to-day .

"Paintings by a British prisoner-of-war which he used to secretly mock his obese and goose-stepping German captors have gone on display for the first time. Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Bond spent his days creating beautiful watercolours and caricatures of guards and officers at his WWI camp. He would draw his enemy looking ridiculous - including grossly fat ones marching across the yard, with huge moustaches and one as half man, half dog.

The paintings (including above, The Old Guard) in which Lt Col Bond mocked his obese and goose-stepping German captors have gone on display for the first time . Lt Col Bond, an officer from Marlborough, Wiltshire, spent six months in a prisoner camp in 1915 and used his time to observe his fellow inmates and guards. Captured and transported to Magdeburg PoW camp in Germany, he found himself with hours of free time because, as an officer, he was not required to undertake manual labour. Many of Bond's paintings show the humdrum side of life as a PoW with fellow soldiers shown reading and eating while they pass the hours. But his artwork also includes unflattering watercolours of overweight and greedy guards. Captured and transported to Magdeburg in 1915,  Bond found himself with hours of free time because, as an officer, he was not required to undertake manual labour. Picture above, entitled Belgians . Lt Col Bond remained at the camp for the duration of the war until Armistice Day on November 11, 1918.      Above, Passage Leading To The Douche Scharnhorstí (left) and Henry The Cuirassieri (right) Bond also drew several images of the Magdeburg skyline, or at least what he could see of it over the walls of the prison. Now, his story and sketches have been made available for the first time, 100 years on. They have been made available for free online as part of the Soldiers' Stories series on the National Army Museum's commemorative portal, First World War in Focus. A spokesperson for the National Army Museum said: 'Bond spent over six months observing both his fellow prisoners and his captors. 'He recorded them in a series of brilliantly preserved watercolours and sketches, providing a unique insight into daily life in captivity. Bond was commissioned into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the age of 22 and was 48 when war broke out in 1914. Above, his pencil sketch, A British Officer In His Hut At Magdeburg Camp . At the outbreak of the First World War, the British Army was, unlike forces fielded by many other nations, composed exclusively of volunteers and was much smaller than its French and German counterparts. As fighting began in Europe, Britain could boast only a relatively small force of 400,000 soldiers - over half of which were posted around the world to garrison the Empire. The first army sent to the Western Front was known as the British Expeditionary Force, which was formed for service in France and became known as the Old Contemptibles. By the end of 1914 — after the battles of Mons, the Le Cateau, the Aisne and Ypres — the old regular British Army had been wiped out, although it managed to help stop the German advance, and more men were needed. That marked the beginning of the famous recruitment drive fronted by General Kitchener which in 1914–1915 assembled the volunteers destined to go into action at the Battle of the Somme. Conscription was only introduced in 1916 and, by the end of 1918, the Army had reached its maximum strength of 4,000,000 men and could field over 70 divisions, many of which were drawn from colonies like India. 'Hundreds of miles away from the action of the trenches, officers - unlike ordinary soldiers - were not required to engage in manual labour for their captors, and often found themselves with endless hours of free time to occupy. 'Such personal accounts are being unveiled each month on the Soldiers' Stories series. 'They piece together the development of the war from the point of view of those directly involved - 100 years from the time that they describe. 'We hope that in sharing these personal stories, the human scale and impact of The Great War can be better felt and understood.' Lt Col Bond was the son of a vicar and was born in Marlborough on April 28, 1866. He was commissioned into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the age of 22 and was 48 when war broke out in 1914. He was in command of the regiment's second battalion at the outbreak of war and led them during the Battle of Mons, before being captured at Le Cateau on August 26, 1914. His family was told that he was dead and held a memorial service in his honour before they found out the truth. He was taken to Magdeburg six months later where he remained for the duration of the war until Armistice Day on November 11, 1918. Bond retired from the Army in 1919 and lived in Clare, Suffolk. He went on to write a book, Prisoners Grave And Gay, and also continued to paint. He died on June 13, 1936.

"Australian kids suffering the effects of autism are getting a helping paw from assistance dogs. Asperger's syndrome and other disorders on the autism spectrum often make it hard for sufferers to recognise mainstream social cues and form friendships. But new research shows dogs can provide love, empathy and companionship that is hard for autism sufferers to recognise, and help kids like Jason Freeman, 11, make connections with the world. 'He is like a therapist, a very furry therapist,' said Jason's mum, Tanya Freeman. Scroll down for video . Best friends: Brock is a Golden Retriever who was specially trained by Assistance Dogs Australia to give kids like Jason the love, empathy and companionship that they wouldn't normally get from their peers. Brock is a Golden Retriever who was specially trained by Assistance Dogs Australia to give kids like Jason the love, empathy and companionship that they wouldn't normally get from their peers. New research has revealed children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can benefit from  animal-assisted activities. This means having a dog like Brock around can help improve the social skills of autistic children.. Assistance dogs have been proven to increase independence, reduce reliance on human caregivers and act as a great ice-breaker helping overcome social isolation. Around 230,000 Australians are estimated to have disorders on the autism spectrum like Asperger's, and as a result will struggle to understand normal social cues and body language, making it far more difficult to form friendships. Assistance Dogs Australia currently support 55 families with autistic children across Australia and while you might instantly think of assistance dogs performing physical tasks, Ms Freeman said Brock's role is far more related to emotional support. 'If Jason comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him, Brock will be right there with him.' 'Jason doesn't have the ability to read others or really have a real grasp on what people are thinking from body language which is something people really take for granted,' she said. Assistance Dogs Australia paired Brock and Jason in 2012 and since then they have formed a special bond . Ms Freeman said Jason's first few years of school were really tough on him.  He didn't have the chance to make many real friends and would sometimes come home in tears. 'Having a connection with others is hard for him but it's harder to see him not having the friendships that a lot of other kids do.' This was until Jason met Brock. She said once Brock came into their lives 'everything changed'. Brock and Jason had an' immediate connection' and it didn't take long for Brock to become 'part of the family'. 'If Jason comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him, Brock will be right there with him. 'He puts his paw up on his legs and just makes him feel like everything is alright,' she added. Ms Freeman said Brock is 'very intuitive' to Jason's needs and that even if he is crying Brock knows exactly how to give him the emotional support that will calm him down. Brock has given Jason the confidence to interact with other people which seemed insurmountable  before his furry therapist came along . Jason has flourished since being given responsibility that comes with being a dog owner. It's his job to keep Brock fed, groomed and walked. Jason's younger brother Dylan has also been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and although their relationship can be strained at times she said it's given Jason a chance to teach his brother about trust and relationships. Brock has given brothers Dylan, left, and Jason, right, an opportunity to bond now they have found some common ground . 'Because they both have Asperger's, they both struggle in the same social situations. The two boys are pretty full on but Brock can bring the whole tone down.' She said Brock has a natural ability to read the anxiety and stress levels in the house and always knows when to come up and say: 'Hey, I'm here and it's going to be okay.' Jason now let's Dylan feed Brock and while they used to rub each other the wrong way she said they've found common ground with the newest member of the family. Ms Freeman said Brock's presence has  'benefited the whole family'. Even when things get too much for Ms Freeman, her 'furry therapist' is always there to comfort her. She said one of the most challenging parts of having a child with autism is watching your child in pain knowing there's nothing you can say to take it away, but now she said she has a lot more 'peace of mind' knowing Brock can fix any problem her kids are faced with. Animal-assisted activities provide a relatively simple and cost-effective means of helping families improve the social functioning of children with autism . Assistance Dogs start their training at eight weeks and won't graduate until they are about two years old . Autism (ASD) is a complex neurological disorder that can cause the sufferer to have difficulty with social and communication skills. People with autism often have unusual ways of learning, paying attention or reacting to sensations. The main areas of difficulty are related to communication, social interaction and restricted or repetitive behaviours. Because the affects can vary from individuals it has been recognised that autism has a ‘spectrum’, hence Autism Spectrum Disorders. Around 230,000 Australians are estimated to be on the Autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder that is charachterised by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour or interests. Children suffering from Aspreger’s will often show less severe symptoms with an absence of language delays, unlike children with autism. The notable symptoms of Asperger’s is a decreased ability to socialise with others, to communicate, and to use imagination. 'I hear him come home upset from school and even when he doesn't want to talk to me he will go into his room and talk to Brock,' she said. 'There are a lot of challenges and stress for us as parents but having Brock in the home has made it so much easier.' Assistance Dogs CEO, Richard Lord said their dogs start training at eight weeks to ensure they have a 'well-rounded' education and that nothing can scare them once they've been placed with families. 'They start training at eight weeks where they will work with puppy trainers for a year. Then they get 6 months of intensive training at puppy school which is where they are socialised to make sure they won't react to children,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Although this process costs about $27,000 per dog Mr Lord said it's worth every cent to see the extent dogs can improve the lives of children who are faced with a life of challenges. 'There have been extensive studies that show if an autistic child has an emotional connection with an animal they will become more independent, their self-esteem can improve, their communication skills advance and they become more self-reliant.' Assitance Dogs Australia spend around $27,000 on each puppy but are happy to give them to deserving families for free . He said kids who've been given assistance dogs find their lives improve drastically because they are finally given the opportunity to participate in society without relying so heavily on carers or parents. 'These dogs give a bit more equality to people who suffer from a range of disabilities. It helps them enjoy their community, allowing them to get as much out of life as they can,' he added. 'These dogs give a bit more equality to people who suffer from a range of disabilities. It helps them enjoy their community, allowing them to get as much out of life as they can' Ms Freeman said having Brock around has given him the confidence to speak in front of the class, something he would have never done before. 'Before he was always quite nervous and kept to himself but having Brock has developed his confidence, you can see it in the way he holds himself.' She said although Jason still doesn't have a lot of friends, he is happy with his one 'special friend'. April 2 is World Autism Day and Assistance Dogs Australia will be celebrating the success of their PAWS program, which is responsible for pairing children suffering from autism with their very own therapy puppy. The PAWS program not only gives out these lifetime friends but also works with parents to  train family dogs to provide the same emotional support that trained Assistance Dogs do. The dogs can learn up to 50 specialised commands that will help them communicate effectively with children on the autism spectrum. Assistance Dogs Australia receives no government funding so they rely heavily on the generosity of individuals and community support to consistently deliver these positive results for children with autism.","Jason Freeman was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome at a young age .

"European Union member states have blocked plans to ban so-called ‘roaming’ charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices. Most mobile companies slap the sky-high fees on people’s bills whenever they use their email, search the web, or use an online map to navigate, whilst they are overseas. Customers can pay a small amount for special roaming packages, but people who fail to do this face eye-watering charges, even if they have used their mobile phone sparingly. Scroll down for video . Change in direction: EU member states have done a U-turn on plans to ban so-called ‘roaming’ charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices . Often, they will find their bills tens or hundreds higher than usual. In some cases, customers have racked up thousands of pounds just by surfing the web on their mobiles whilst on holiday. The European Commission had promised to axe the controversial fees by the end of 2015. However, the EU member states voted against that plan,so they will now remain in place until at least 2018, and could stay far into the future. The move has sparked outrage amongst Brussels. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said he would fight ‘vigourously’ to end roaming charges this year, and that ‘EU member states should hang their heads in shame’. Neelie Kroes, the European Commission's former digital tsar first called for a ban on roaming charges in 2013. The move was hugely unpopular with mobile operator, who rely on roaming charges to fatten the industry’s profits. They argue that the roaming charges are necessary to cover the costs that they are charged by foreign operators for carrying data across their networks. Angered: Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said he would fight ‘vigourously’ to end roaming charges . However, all mobile phone operators charge each other for this service, meaning that the whole industry is effectively taxing customers for using their phones overseas, and passing the money between them. Now Mrs Kroes’ successors have rowed back on her policy, and said that mobile phone companies need more time to deal with the hole that a ban on roaming charges would put in their profits. Instead, they have suggested that people using their mobile phones abroad should be given a discount on a small amount of roaming, and face standard roaming charges on whatever else they use. At a meeting in Brussels, they said they would review the situation in 2018 to see if the market had come up with foreign roaming packages that offer customers better value for money. However, there is no guarantee that they would intervene, even at that point. Mathew Howett, a telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: ‘They were going to be abolished but that has been pushed back more or less indefinitely. Customers are now relying on the market to deliver.’ A few mobile phone companies have taken steps to reduce so-called ‘bill shock’ for customers returning home from overseas. Vodafone invites customers to pay for a ‘passport’ whenever they travel overseas, whilst Three allows users to use the internet, and make as many texts and calls as they like, when they visit certain countries, as part of its ‘Feel at Home’ package.","European Union ministers had promised to axe  fees by the end of 2015 .

"Venezuela has declared the United States to be an 'imminent danger' at the launch of two weeks of Cold War-style military drills and parades featuring weapons made in Russia and China. Chanting 'socialist motherland' and branding the U.S. 'imperialist', 80,000 military staff and 20,000 civilians took the streets of the capital Caracas for anti-American protests on Saturday afternoon. The Venezuelan parliament followed the protests by yesterday approving a law giving embattled President Nicolas Maduro the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what were described as 'American threats' to the South American nation. The launch of two weeks of military drills came just days after Barack Obama declared Venezuela a national security threat, restricted travel to the nation and froze the assets of some citizens of a nation already struggling with a widespread shortage of goods. Anti-American: The Venezuelan parliament followed the protests by yesterday approving a law giving embattled President Nicolas Maduro (pictured) the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what were described as 'America threats' to the South American nation . Show of strength: Venezuela declared the United States to be an 'imminent danger' at the launch of two weeks of Cold War-style military drills and parades featuring weapons made in Russia and China . Yesterday Venezuela's parliament approved a law giving Maduro the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what he described as threats by the U.S. government. The so-called 'anti-imperialist' law will be in effect from the time it is published in Venezuela's Official Gazette until December 31. Maduro requested the expanded powers in response to new U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan officials accused of human rights violations. Critics of Venezuela's government have called the move a power grab. The U.S. is targeting officials in the top echelon of Venezuela's security apparatus responsible for cracking down on last year's anti-government protests and for pursuing charges against opponents. The officials will be denied U.S. visas and have their U.S. assets frozen. The leaders of South America's leftist governments have come out in support of Venezuela, while Washington has denied Maduro's claim that it is seeking to undermine his government and urged him to focus on Venezuela's domestic problems, including food shortages and soaring inflation.

Support: Yesterday Venezuela's parliament approved a law giving Nicolas Maduro (pictured) the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what he described as threats by the U.S. government . The two weeks of military drills are widely seen as Maduro's attempt to stir up patriotic sentiment in the hope of improving his falling approval rating ahead of key parliamentary elections later this year. Speaking to the Financial Times, Carlos Romero, a professor of international relations at the Central University of Venezuela, said Washington's declaration of the nation as a national security threat has 'worked very well for the Venezuelan government'. He said Venezuela had used the announcement to 'trumpet up support' for the government by reacting in 'an exaggerated, almost dramatic' manner. Maduro has previously claimed that the United States, which remains Venezuela's largest cash-generating oil export market, has backed attempts to remove him from power. In 2002 a coup that had the tacit support of America briefly ousted the late Hugo Chávez - Maduro's charismatic mentor and presidential predecessor.","80,000 military staff and 20,000 civilians took part in a weekend parade .

"Members of the Royal Household are poised to take industrial action over pay for the first time in history, it was claimed last night. Wardens at Windsor Castle claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money. Union officials say guides are paid terribly and have suffered years of ‘wage restraint’ despite working for the ‘country’s richest family’. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money . Wardens’ main duties are to meet and greet visitors, tell them about the history of the Castle, and hand out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said many are asked to go above and beyond this for no extra pay, including leading paid-for guided tours at the Castle. Other workers administer first aid or speak to tourists in a foreign language without being paid extra, they said. Now, the PCS says workers could adopt ‘work to rule’ – industrial action where workers do no more than the minimum required by their contract – unless they receive a pay hike. They said wardens were on as little as £7.70 an hour, or £14,400 a year for a 36-hour week. This is below the Living Wage, a voluntary threshold for employers which rose to £7.85 in November, but significantly above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. Windsor Castle said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November. A spokesman for PCS said: ‘Workers are being paid really poor wages despite working for the country’s richest family. Windsor Castle (pictured) said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November . ‘A large proportion of staff have chosen to work at the Castle because they feel they are working the Queen and for the Royal Family. ‘Their employers should not take advantage of that and abuse their goodwill by not properly rewarding them.’ The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world’s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, and workers for the Collection are therefore employees of the Royal Household. Forty wardens out of 200 workers at Windsor Castle have been balloted on whether they want to take industrial action. While the union has ruled out a strike, staff may refuse to work overtime and conduct guided tours and insist on taking their full lunch breaks. If wardens vote for this, it would be the first time staff have ever done so over working conditions specific to a Royal Household, the PCS said. A spokeswoman for the Royal Collection Trust said workers undertook extra roles voluntarily and were under no obligation to do so. She said: ‘Warden staff are offered voluntary opportunities to receive training and develop skills to lead guided tours for visitors as part of their working day and to administer first aid, as well as to use their language skills. ‘These are not compulsory aspects of their role, and it is the choice of the individual whether they wish to take part.’ They said staff received a range of benefits including a 15 per cent non-contributory pension and a free lunch. She added: ‘Royal Collection Trust continues to award wardens an annual performance-related pay increase of up to 2.5 per cent, in addition to the cost of living increase, as well as one-off payments to those who have reached the top of their pay scale.’ The Royal Collection said it did not anticipate any interruption to tours in the event of industrial action. The Royal Collection website says its wardens enhance visitors’ experiences by ‘interpreting the exhibits, buildings and works of art whilst maintaining visitors’ safety and security’. It says: ‘Whether you are greeting visitors at the start of their tour, carrying out security and baggage checks, or answering questions along the visitor route, you will be part of an impressive and unique experience.’","Wardens  reportedly asked to go above and beyond duty for no extra pay .

The building will be part of the Vals resort, which already includes a hotel as well as a world-famous spa building by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. Mayne told Dezeen maagzine that each floor would have just one room offering exclusive panoramic views of the Alps. 'As much as possible, the hotel is a minimalist act that re-iterates the site and offers to the viewer a mirrored, refracted perspective of the landscape,' said Mayne. The tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa or 'Khalifa Tower' in Dubai which stands at 829.8 m (2,722 ft) high. In Europe, currently the tallest structure is The Federation Tower in Moscow, Russia which measures at 373.7m (1,227ft) tall. A new tower designed by Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne (pictured) was announced today which will be the tallest building in Europe . Thom Mayne is responsible for some of the world's most iconic buildings including the Sun Tower in Seoul, Korea and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, Texas. Based in Los Angeles, the principal of architectural firm Morphosis, has won the Rome Prize Fellowship and Pritzker Prize among many. The American architect is known for his bold and unconventional works, in particular the buildings' offset angular forms, layered exterior walls, incorporation of giant letter and number graphics. In recent years, his firm's architecture has created more layered visual effects which has been made possible increasingly through computer design techniques, which simplify the construction of complex forms. Mayne also has a focus emphasis on natural light within all of his designs. In January this year, he was at the centre of controversy after buying and demolishing the house that noted writer Ray Bradbury had lived in for 50 years. Mayne began work under Korean-born architect Ki Suh Park after graduating. In 1972, Mayne, Livio Santini, James Stafford and Michael Brickler founded Morphosis.

The firm's design philosophy arises from an interest in producing work with a meaning that can be understood by absorbing the culture for which it was made, and their goal was to develop an architecture that would eschew the normal bounds of traditional forms . Its first official commission was a school in Pasadena, attended by Mayne's son . Publicity from this project led to a number of residential commissions, including the Lawrence Residence.

"Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, has warned of a 'crisis' in the teaching profession . Almost half of new teachers leave the profession in their first year because of an excessive workload and 'exhausted and stressed colleagues', a union leader has warned. The number has tripled in six years, according to an analysis of figures by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). The most recent statistics show that in 2011, around 10,800 newly-qualified teachers did not take up a teaching post – up from 3,600 in 2005. Around 40 per cent of newly-qualified teachers were not in the classroom after a year in 2011 – compared to 20 per cent in 2005. The latest figures have sparked fears of  a 'crisis' in the profession. Mary Bousted, the ATL’s general secretary, told the union’s annual conference in Liverpool yesterday that an increased workload and bureaucracy had made teaching an unappealing profession. She spoke of a ‘crisis of teacher supply’ because trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads, excessive monitoring and poor pay. She added that would-be teachers are meeting more experienced teachers who tell them 'this is no career to enter'. Miss Bousted described teaching as being ‘incompatible with a normal life’ because it is ‘monitored to within an inch of its life’ due to the demands of heads keen to impress Ofsted inspectors. Dr Bousted told delegates that former education secretary Michael Gove said before he entered office that teachers should be highly valued and he wanted to give the profession more freedom over how to teach. 'If that was Michael Gove's intention, and I am sure that was his honest intention, how is it at the end of the coalition's term in office that not only are record numbers of teachers leaving the profession mid-career, but there is also a crisis of teacher supply?' she said. 'This crisis is happening right at the very start of teachers' careers. Teachers are leaving in their first year, or not starting teaching when they have completed their training.; . She added: 'Why are we losing the next generation of teachers - that new blood for the profession which should be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, full of promise and ambition? 'Is it, I wonder, because trainee and newly-qualified teachers see very early on just what teaching has become and decide that they do not want to be a part of it? She said trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads, excessive monitoring and poor pay (posed by model) 'Is it that they learn as they work with exhausted and stressed colleagues that teaching has become a profession which is incompatible with a normal life? 'Trainee and newly-qualified teachers cannot fail to understand that, despite Michael Gove's intentions, teaching has become a profession monitored to within an inch of its life.' Dr Bousted added: 'Seeing what teaching has become, and what the prospect of a career in teaching holds for them, is it in any way surprising that trainee and newly-qualified teachers make the decision to make use of their talents and abilities in a different profession? 'It is sad - but true - that students and NQTs are being told by the teachers they meet during training that with current workload, inspection and pay, this is no career to enter. It didn't have to be like this.'","In 2011, 10,800 newly-qualified teachers did not take up a teaching post .

Why is it so hard to see black and blue? is the charity's latest advert and highlights the plight of women who are victims of domestic violence. Launched in South Africa today, where one in six women are the victims of abuse at home, it features a model wearing the Roman Originals dress in white and gold. The Salvation Army in South Africa has adopted the dress for its newest campaign against domestic violence . Capitalising on the garment's notoriety, the tag line reads: 'The only illusion is if you think it was her choice. One in 6 women are victims of abuse. Stop abuse against women.' It also carries the logo for Carehaven, a home for abused women and their children. Since being posted this morning the image has been shared thousands of times online. It has been shared thousands of times online, with Twitter users among those to praise the charity's clever adopting of the trend. Twitter users praised the campaign with thousands retweeting the image and sharing their views online . Internet sensation: This picture of the dress sparked debate, with millions disagreeing over the colour . When aspiring singer Caitlin McNeill uploaded a photograph of a dress to her Tumblr blog, the 21-year-old thought it would do little more than serve as a source of light entertainment for friends. But within hours of sharing the image millions of people and the world's rich and famous were discussing its subject. The question on everyone's lips was: is the dress black and blue or white and gold? Celebrities offered their input while memes mocking the debate flurried. Soon #TheDress was the number one hashtag on Twitter and was being poured over by millions. While it was determined once and for all that the dress was indeed black and blue, the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold number. According to scientists the reason so many viewed the dress differently is down to genes, lighting and a person's age. True colours: This photograph of Cecelia Bleasdale in 'the dress', left, with daughter Grace Johnston and son-in-law Keir Johnston, reveals that the frock is royal blue with a black lace trim . 'So clever! Advertising at its best!' was how one user described it while scores of others lauded its 'powerful' message. 'Really like this clever way @SalvationArmySA used #TheDress to send a powerful message' said Hayley Slaughter while Kara Rose described the campaign as 'clever and powerful'. Andrew Blakeley added: 'The best hijacking of the online culture I've seen recently. Bravo to the Salvation Army.' 'The dress debate put to socially good use! I like a lot,' said another. A spokesperson for The Salvation Army said: 'The Salvation Army sees the devastating effects of domestic violence on women, men and children every day. 'We support people who are affected in our human trafficking work, our specialist services, Lifehouses and community centres. 'We know that one in four women are victims of domestic violence in the UK: this innovative and powerful campaign by The Salvation Army in South Africa highlights that domestic violence is often overlooked by society. 'We hope this image helps people to see the true impact of this crime.' 'The dress' sparked global debate last week with millions of people arguing over the colour of its fabric. With celebrities Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber among those to weigh in on what colours they saw, its manufacturer, Roman Originals, suddenly became the world's most talked about brand. The Twitter storm began when a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland posted a photograph of the garment on Tumblr after seeing her friends disagree over its colours. While the original dress is black and blue the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold version to meet demand.","'The dress' took the internet by storm with millions debating its colours .

"A while ago, I visited a Hampshire nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year. It was like a slow-motion factory; tissue-cultured plantlets came in at one end, flowering specimens trundled out of the other, each in a posh ceramic pot. Orchids, particularly Phalaenopsis (moth orchids), have become Britain's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks. That should not happen. Moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and, with care, they can flourish for years. But it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs. Hardy beauty: Moth orchids (pictured) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms . More than 22,000 species of orchids make up Orchidaceae, the world's largest flowering plant family. About 50 are native to Britain, and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow. With such a huge range of habitats, orchids' needs differ widely. But once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids, it's not hard to keep them happy. KNOW THEIR NEEDS . Phalaenopsis, like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes, meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees. They subsist on rain or mist, and nourishment comes from debris lodging in the tree bark, so their sparse roots are as important for clinging on as for absorbing nutrients. In a pot in your house, the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest. That means a minimum 16 degrees Celsius ambience, humidity and good light. To boost humidity in spring and summer spray rainwater on to the leaves from an atomiser (if possible always use rainwater warmed to room temperature). In winter, move your orchid closer to an east or west-facing window and the extra light will encourage flowering. The commonest cause of death is overwatering. To avoid that, imagine the orchid perched up a tree, soaked by rain from time to time but drying out in between. Cram the roots into wet compost and it will die. That is why it is best to grow epiphytes in slatted containers or transparent, perforated orchid pots and to allow the prehensile roots to poke into the air. During the growing season, feed monthly with special orchid feed. But in winter, reduce watering and do not feed. HANDS-ON MANAGEMENT . Phalaenopsis should last for about three months but, when they fade, you can persuade the old stem to sprout again. Feel it carefully for swellings (nodes) near the base. They are dormant buds. If you cut the stem just above the second node from the base, a new flower spike should develop. Repot your orchid only if it has become pot-bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years. Do that when the pale roots develop green tips; a sign the plant is ready to repot. Use special epiphytic orchid compost — it will appear coarse and lumpy and is available at good garden centres. Remove any dead or shrivelled roots, shorten the remaining healthy ones to about 12cm and replant the orchid in the same size pot. Pack the compost in firmly for stability and allow any upward-facing roots to grow out over the container's sides. Water thoroughly, making sure all the compost is moist and that the water drains away easily. Next year, when the repotting has worked and you are flush with success, start looking for different orchids. The number of new varieties introduced each year beggars belief. Happy hunting.","Orchids have become Britain's favourite house plant but die within weeks .

"Keeping up a quick pace to the finish line, Curtis Penix didn't look like someone who had walked nearly 240 miles in the footsteps of frontiersman Daniel Boone, an arduous trip through the Appalachian terrain that was inspired by his own family's pioneering roots in the Kentucky wilderness. The Michigan steel mill worker, toting a 40-pound backpack, completed his 16-day journey on Thursday. It started in Tennessee, wound into Virginia and took him to hallowed ground in Kentucky — the place where Fort Boonesborough was built in 1775 after Boone and his band of axe men had carved out Boone Trace. The path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward. 'I can't wait to sit down,' the 46-year-old Penix said after being greeted by family and other supporters. 'I haven't had a soft chair in a long time. Physically, I feel fine. I feel like any other day I would get up for work. ... I could keep going if I wanted, but I don't want to.' Traveler: Curtis Penix smiles as he arrives at the site of the original Fort Boonesborough, Kentucky on Thursday March 26, 2015 . Sweet reunion: Curtis Penix kisses his wife Kimberly at the finish on Thursday . Amber Penix embraced her father and then teasingly told him: 'You don't smell too bad.' During his adventure, Penix slept outside, crossed rivers on foot, trudged through rain and mud and endured blistered feet. He started his journey on March 10 near Kingsport, Tennessee — the same place where Boone's group left in March 1775. Penix followed the famous frontiersman's route into Virginia and through Cumberland Gap into Kentucky. After five days of traveling alone, Penix was joined by walking companion Givan Fox, 42, near the Virginia-Kentucky border. Fox's father, John Fox, is president of Friends of Boone Trace, a nonprofit group that hopes to preserve the historic route as a hiking trail and a memorial to the pioneers. 'The American dream started on this road,' Penix said. His trip was inspired by his fifth-great grandfather, Joshua Penix, who followed Boone Trace on his way to Fort Boonesborough. 'This is where Grandpa Joshua came in 1779,' Penix said. 'So he would have been right here somewhere in this little area.' His ancestor did quite well for himself in the frontier. He eventually acquired 1,400 acres near Paris in central Kentucky, but later parceled it off and sold it, Penix said. Joshua Penix eventually became a plantation owner in Virginia. Among those welcoming Penix and Givan Fox on their arrival was Donna Jones, who said some of her ancestors were among the settlers at Fort Boonesborough. Their names are among those etched on a monument honoring the pioneers. 'Anybody that would spend this many days to get here certainly has an understanding of what our ancestors did to make all of this available to us now,' Jones said. 'I just think that's a wonderful for someone to do, to raise our level of awareness.' Trek: Penix, left and his walking partner Givan Fox walk Kentucky State Road 388 following the Boone Trace near Fort Boonesborough on Thursday. Curtis' 5th great grandfather, Joshua Penix, was one of Daniel Boone's men who walked to Fort Boonesborough in 1775 and helped blaze a trail from Cumberland Gap to the fort . Explorer: Daniel Boone and his band of axe men had carved out Boone Trace in the 1700s.  The path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward . At the start of his trip, Penix said, he was determined to 'rough it,' just like the pioneers. On his first day, he waded across seven streams and rivers on foot, including one that was knee deep. 'I quickly found out that by getting your feet wet and then continuing to walk, you could get what the pioneers called ""scalded feet,""' he said. The foot blisters were enough to dissuade him from river crossings and take the bridges instead. He endured steady rain during his first four days. At the end of one day, he started shivering uncontrollably, he said. 'Rather than end my trip there, I bit the bullet and I decided to stop in at a motel and dry off and warm up,' he said. 'That was kind of a low point. I had tried to do this . . . just like Grandpa Joshua did. Sleeping under the stars, fording the rivers, carrying all my own food.' His attitude changed after a park ranger told him the pioneers stopped at settlements for food, warm places to sleep and to resupply before reaching the Kentucky wilderness. After that, he said, he accepted the generosity from people offering meals and places to sleep, including carports and garages. With help from groups including Friends of the Boone Trace, Penix charted the most historically accurate route for his journey. Penix said he got lost just once, on a mountainside in Virginia. He estimated about 60 percent of his trip was on roads and the rest through woodlands or fields. While the early pioneers faced dangers from Indians, Penix's biggest threat was vehicles on roads that lacked shoulders for him and Fox to walk on. 'When a large truck would come by, we had this little technique where we would lean (on their walking sticks) into the ditch and away from the road, just long enough for them to go by, and then we'd pop back out on the road,' he said. Penix planned to visit Boone's grave in Kentucky's capital city of Frankfort and then return home to Monroe, Michigan. You did it!

"Charges against a garbage collector outside Atlanta who had been sentenced to 30 days in prison for starting his work too early have been dropped. Kevin McGill, 48, who works for Waste Management Inc, took a guilty plea deal after violating an ordinance in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, that bans collections before 7am - he would reportedly start collecting around 5am. But Sandy Springs Solicitors Office released a statement on Monday announcing that charges had been dropped after realizing that 'there are times when taking a step back provides the opportunity for better perspective'. Scroll down for video . Dropped charges: Kevin McGill, 48, was supposed to serve 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to picking up trash in Sandy Springs, Georgia, before 7am. But Sandy Springs Solicitors Office dropped the charges . The statement read: 'In retrospect, the actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill’s sentence for violating the city’s noise laws, was disproportionate to a first-time offense. 'As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation suspended. 'City ordinances are implemented for the protection of quality of life within a community. The adherence to these laws is important, and the City is obligated to enforce these laws, which includes imposing sanctions against those individuals who break the law. McGill was originally sentenced on February 20th at the local courthouse, the running of which was handed over to private contractors by the city. There were no real negotiations between her client and Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley when he was sentenced, attorney Kimberly Bandoh told Daily Mail Online on Saturday, adding that the solicitor had claimed the offense meant 'automatic jail time'. Daily Mail Online reached out to Bandoh again on Monday but her office was closed. McGill turned 48 on Friday, but reported to a local jail at 6pm for his first night in jail. Sandy Springs solicitor Bill Riley said last week that it was the right decision to punish McGill, rather than his company, Waste Management . Justice served: McGill's attorney Kimberly Bandoh (pictured) said were no real negotiations between her client and Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley when he was sentenced . He was allowed to serve his time on the weekends so he can still work collecting wealthy residents' trash so he can support his wife and two children. Riley has stood by the request for jail and says that 'fines don't seem to work' and 'The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail.' The solicitor said that residents of Sandy Springs, which include professional athletes and executives for Delta Air Lines, begin calling 9-1-1 when they hear early garbage men, according to WSPA. He said it was the right decision to punish McGill, who had only been on the route for three months, rather than his company, which the city has contracted to pick up its residents' trash. The prosecutor said that early garbage collections are a nuisance to residents who want to sleep and that his office had met with Waste Management after previously punishing its employees for violating the ordinance. A representative for the company went to the courthouse with McGill, who expected to be ordered to pay up to a $1,000 fine, Bandoh said. Marla Prince, a spokesperson for for the company, told DailyMail Online that 'The incident with WM employee Kevin McGill is very unfortunate and we are currently working with WM Legal Counsel to resolve the situation'. She said she had not heard of a driver going to jail for a similar incident in the firm's South Atlantic area of Georgia and the Carolinas. Prince added that Waste Management, which operates throughout the United States and reported $14billion in revenue in 2014, would coordinate with its employee about his work schedule and jail time. Sharon Kraun, a spokesman for Sandy Springs, told Daily Mail Online that McGill's citation stemmed from an incident where his truck had been photographed by a resident. The city had seen a previous case where a garbage man was given jail time several years ago and that while no similar cases had happened since, the collectors had 'fair warning', Kraun said. She said that Waste Management, which had amassed thousands of dollars in fines with the municipality in the last year, suspended McGill for violating its policies before he went to court. Waste Management could not answer questions about McGill's employment history with the company as of Saturday morning and said it was 'currently still investigating all the facts in the case'. Wealth: Sandy Springs, a suburb that has seen residents such as business executives, Herman Cain and Akon, has contracted out most of its services, including the court system . His lawyer questioned the practice of going after  trash collectors personally. 'He's the employee. He's not the employer. Sentencing him to jail is doing what?' Bandoh said. 'This is the most excessive punishment for an ordinance of this nature I've ever seen,' she said. McGill had never been to jail or even appeared in the court system, and no other charges factored into the judge's decision to give him jail time. He began serving his sentence last weekend for the February 5th citation and will continue losing his free time into the summer. Bandoh said that the sentence was originally for 30 straight days before someone in the court spoke up and said that McGill should continue working and collecting the suburb's trash. The worker was also sentenced to six months of probation, in which he would have had to pay fees to Sandy Springs, according to Vice. The suburb has privatized almost all of its city services, including its municipal courts, its communications, parks, economic development and call center operations. Its website states that 'this business model fosters a proactive, responsive and efficient approach to providing city services.' Residents of the area include  former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and rapper Akon, according to the New York Times.","Kevin McGill, 48, violated ordinance banning trash collection before 7am .

"She was the barefooted sixties singer who secured Britain’s first ever Eurovision title, so it would be fair to expect her to take centre stage at the contest’s 60th anniversary celebrations. But Sandie Shaw yesterday claimed she had been snubbed. The 68-year-old said she was bemused as to why the BBC had not invited her to take part in the Eurovision’s Greatest Hits concert and urged her fans to email the TV show’s executive producer Guy Freeman to ask why. Scroll down for video . Sandie Shaw yesterday claimed she had not been invited to Eurovision’s Greatest Hits concert and urged her fans to email the TV show’s executive producer Guy Freeman to ask why . Miss Shaw took Europe by storm in 1967 with her song Puppet on a String, which made her Britain’s first ever Eurovision winner with 47 votes. Since then just four other UK entrants have taken first place in the contest. But despite her special place in Eurovision history, the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘did not receive a positive response’. The star took to her Facebook page late on Monday to post: ‘Hi Guy’s I have had a few messages asking why I am not doing the Eurovision 60 years celebration I can’t answer the question so why not ask the man organising it here.’ Miss Shaw’s fans deluged the show’s executive producer with angry emails insisting she be included, until Miss Shaw was forced to remove his contact details from her post. She then subsequently put up a lengthy post on her page in which she described the matter as a ‘ding dong’ and hinted there may have been doubts over her vocal range. However she insisted she had no problems performing the tune that turned her into a household name, in a lower key. Miss Shaw was the barefooted sixties singer who secured Britain’s first ever title at the Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna in April 1967 (pictured) She took Europe by storm with her song Puppet on a String, which won the coveted Eurovision title by 47 votes . Miss Shaw said: ‘I have not offered to sing on it. I have not been asked to sing on it. I have had in the recent past no problem singing Puppet. ‘I recently sang it every night for a year on the Jools Holland tour, in a lower key as my vocal range has changed over the years, as it does with every singer. However after the tour I announced my retirement from live singing. ‘I did offer last month as a gesture of support of the 60th celebration to do some hosting which I believe is more appropriate but did not receive a positive response. ‘I do not know why I have not been asked to be involved.’ Miss Shaw’s clash with the BBC and the decision not to include her comes at a time when the broadcaster has faced repeated criticism for failing to properly represent older women in their programming. But despite her special place in Eurovision history, the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘did not receive a positive response’ In 2012 Mark Thompson, the then Director General of the BBC, admitted there were not enough older women broadcasting on the corporation, especially in ‘iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes.’ Eurovision’s Greatest Hits will be presented by Graham Norton and Swedish comedian and presenter Petra Mede and will be broadcast on BBC One and throughout Europe this Easter. It will kick start celebrations to mark 60 years of the annual music event. Brotherhood of Man, who won in 1976 with Save Your Kisses for Me, are the only British act billed to perform at the concert. All four members: Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens are now aged 65. Other performers will include last year’s winner 26-year-old Conchita Wurst, from Austria, Sweden’s Herreys and France’s Natasha St-Pier. The Eurovision final will take place after the concert on May 23rd and will be hosted in Vienna for the first time since Miss Shaw won there in 1969, making her absence from the concert all the more significant. Some suggested Miss Shaw may have been excluded because she has previously criticised the singing contest, calling it ‘c**p’. Last year she told music magazine MOJO: ‘I thought the Eurovision Song Contest was c**p, it wasn’t even on my or my friends’ radar. I’m a post-war baby and the whole idea of countries fighting again seemed ridiculous.’ She also said she hated her winning song, adding: ‘When I got lumbered with singing Puppet On A String I knew there would be a lot of fans who wouldn’t want me doing it.’ Lulu, 66, became the second British winner in 1969 when she came joint first with Spain, Netherlands and with her hit Boom Bang A Bang. Brotherhood of Man were the first British band to win with Save Your Kisses For Me in 1976, Bucks Fizz, who formed specifically for Eurovision, sang their way to first place with Making Your Mind Up in 1981 and in 1997 Katrina & The Waves became the first British winner in 16 years with Love Shine a Light. A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Eurovision’s Greatest Hits is a special event co-produced by the BBC and EBU kick-starting the 60th anniversary of the world’s favourite song contest. The concert has a star-studded line-up of singers containing original acts performing their iconic songs once again. ‘As a 90-minute show, it would be impossible to include all 1400 acts that have entered the contest over the years, this means that difficult decisions have to be made regarding the line-up on the night but we hope that there is something for everyone to enjoy in this special one-off concert that will be broadcast throughout Europe and beyond.’ She is currently married to her third husband Tony Bedford. She has three children. The singer is now a qualified psychotherapist and runs a clinic in London.","Sandie Shaw says BBC didn't invite to her Eurovision's 60th celebrations .

"A Tumblr user has claimed that every female character used in a Disney or Pixar film in the last decade has the same face. The post by Every-Flavored-Bean on the Something Classy blog was uploaded after they saw stills from the new film Inside Out - and noticed the similarities between the women's faces. They then combined a number of characters from recent productions and traced around their cheeks and noses - apparently proving the similarities. Scroll down for video . Tumblr user Every-Flavored Bean  around the faces of female characters from Disney and Pixar, highlighting their similarities . They suggested that every female character from the last decade is a 'descendant of some primordial creature' with 'huge round cheeks and a disturbingly small nose'. They then go on to say that the reason behind the similarities is 'lazy sexism'. The user wrote: 'So when I saw this picture for the new Pixar movie Inside Out, at first I thought the characters were three women and two aliens, but after seeing the trailer I realized the purple and red things were supposed to be dudes. 'After tracing their faces, I figured out why I was so weirded out: The two male characters have extremely distinctive face shapes, while the three female characters basically have the exact same shape; round with a small nose. The allegations follow on from claims made by Frozen's head of animation, Lindo De Salvo, in 2013 who said creating the female characters was tricky because you have to 'keep them pretty.' They did the same with male faces and noticed that most of them were different . They first spotted the distinctions when looking at stills from the new animated film Inside Out . The green drawings (male) and the red lines (female) show the differences between the two .

'So, having a film with two hero female characters was really tough, and having them both in the scene and look very different if they’re echoing the same expression; that Elsa looking angry looks different from Anna being angry.' A Disney spokeswoman reacted to the controversy by saying: 'Animation is an intricate and complex art form. 'These comments were recklessly taken out of context.

"Jay Williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written . A Brutally honest letter written by Roald Dahl to a teenager who asked him for advice on his A-level project has surfaced. Budding writer Jay Williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written. The 17-year-old did not expect a reply. But Mr Williams, who grew up near Carlisle, was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself. However, in true Dahl style, there was a sting in the tail. However the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with Dahl heavily criticising his use of 'beastly adjectives'. The correspondence read: 'Dear Jay, You are asking too much of me. You must realise I get an awful lot of these letters and you can't expect me to write your thesis for you. 'It should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature. It's a big one. 'Study particularly the American short story writers like O'Henry and Runyon and Hawthorne and Poe, and lots and lots of English ones. 'If you want any dope on me there have been an awful lot of profiles in English magazines over the past year starting with the February 1979 edition of Vogue. 'I have read your story. I don't think it's bad, but you must stop using too many adjectives. Roald Dahl responded saying the teenager was 'asking too much,' but that said that he had read his story . 'Study Hemingway, particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives. 'Surely it is better to say 'She was a tall girl with a bosom' than 'She was a tall girl with a shapely, prominent bosom', or some such rubbish. The first one says it all.' Jay, who now lives in Bristol, recently found the letter while going through old boxes and posted a picture on Twitter. The image was posted alongside the caption: 'In 1980, as a spotty teenager, I wrote to Roald Dahl asking for advice on writing. Here is his priceless response.' Amazingly it has now been re-tweeted more than 1,700 times and has been favourited by almost 2,400 people. Jay, who set up PR company 72point, said: 'As a callow youth, I was expecting him to tell me how marvellous the story was, and offer to introduce me to his publisher. Mr Williams in his teens, left, and the celebrated  author Roald Dahl, right, who replied to his letter . 'Instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism. 'The story was for an A-Level English Literature project, and was probably really self-indulgent, overflowing with flowery adjectives, which Dahl quite rightly bristled at. 'After considering his advice, I have to admit it was probably fair and I've taken heed of it ever since. 'I was a big fan of Dahl's short stories aimed at adults, like Kiss Kiss. I loved their dark elements, the twist in the tale. 'Dahl's advice has informed whatever writing style I have had since, especially in news reporting.'","Jay Williams wrote to Roald Dahl in 1980 asking him to look at story .

"A man accused of throwing acid in the faces of two schoolgirls after his sexual advances were rejected has fainted while being handcuffed and paraded before an angry mob. Pictures taken at a press conference yesterday announcing the arrest of Jiwan BK, 20, show him being dragged by police through a crowd in Kathmandu, Nepal, in a semi-conscious state. His arrest comes a month after schoolgirls Sangita Magar, 16, and Sima Basnet, 15, were studying at a school in the capital when a masked attacker barged into the classroom and splashed acid across their faces. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Nepalese plainclothed police carry Jiwan BK after he fainted when paraded before the public in Kathmandu . BK, 20, is accused of throwing acid in the faces of two schoolgirls after one of them rejected his advances . Police claimed he admitted being 'infatuated' with Sangita Magar and wanted to disfigure her . It is feared the suspected revenge attack has left the teenagers scarred for life after they suffered severe chemical burns to their faces, torsos and legs. Horrific photographs taken of the two while they recovered in hospital caused an outcry across the country as they described an 'intense burning' and pouring water on their faces to try and stop their skin from melting. The Baltic Review reported the area's police chief Pushka Karki has now said: 'The attacker will appear in court on Sunday, he did not resist the arrest. 'He claimed that he was infatuated with Sangita, one of the victims, and wanted to disfigure her as an act of revenge after she rejected his romantic advances.' Chameli Magar, Sangita's mother, added that the 'coward' had ruined her daughter's life and she hoped he would either die in jail or hanged. However, Nepalese law states that such attacks are only punished by anywhere between three months to three years in prison - depending on the severity of the disfigurement. BK was a former tenant at the Magar family home and police claimed to have found cuttings of newspaper reports of his attack in his currently-rented room, according to Ekantipur.com. Sangita Magar takes her School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exam - which she was studying for when attacked - from her hospital bed . Sima Basnet sits her SLC exam from a hospital room in Kathmandu as an administrator watches on . Acid attacks disfigure and often blind their victims, who are usually women and often the target of some form of revenge bid. The disputes, which happen in many parts of South Asia, can be linked to dowry, land disputes or refusal to a man's advances. Although acid attacks are now a criminal offence in neighbouring India, there are no specific laws addressing it in Nepal. Sangita, pictured in the days following the attack had acid thrown on her face by a masked man . Her hand in a cast, 16-year-old Sangita's hand bore only the remains of her scarlet nail polish .

"Packs of wild boar are hunting newborn lambs in Britain, experts say. The Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, has about 800 boar which usually feed only on plants and dead animals. But in recent weeks, groups have reportedly killed four lambs. Clare Harvey, a vet, saw six boar eat a lamb near the village of Lydbrook. Boar blimey: Boar in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire usually feed only on plants and dead animals . She said: ‘It was quite brutal, with the carcass already having been skinned and the piglets tearing it limb from limb. 'We know pigs are omnivores and devour carrion, but this suggested they may have developed a taste for fresh meat. 'There are serious implications for animal health and the spread of disease.’ The Forestry Commission said it had heard three further reports of the animals killing and eating lambs in Bream, Parkend and Yorkley, Gloucestershire. In recent weeks, boar have reportedly killed four lambs. In a fourth incident a boar ate a ewe and its still-born lamb - though it is not known if they were both already dead. A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: 'They are a large free-roaming animal, and they are an omnivore, and they can get rather large. 'I suspect if you spoke to a large mammal expert it would come as no surprise that large animals that eat both meat and vegetation, maybe is doing this. 'It is something we have heard is happening, from second or third hand accounts, but it is not something that any of our guys have seen.' Wild boar became extinct in England 300 years ago, but have been reintroduced through escapes and deliberate releases. The Forest of Dean group is the country’s largest.","Packs of wild boar are hunting newborn lambs in Britain, experts claim .

"Snopp Dogg said he blames President Ronald Reagan for the culture of gang violence that existed in parts of Los Angeles, California during the 1980s and beyond. Snoop, aka Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, brought the issue up after he took the stage in Austin, Texas, on Friday as South by Southwest Music's 2015 keynote speaker.

The 43-year-old said the era of Reaganomics prompted a shift away from football and fun to guns and drugs . Snoop posted a Yakit video that was created of himself speaking to Reagan about the allegation on Instagram . Snoop was talking about an HBO show he is developing that will be about life on the West Coast during the 1980s. The plot will center 'on a family whose seemingly idyllic life is turned upside down by the collision of their community and American politics', Deadline reported. The hip-hop legend said Reaganomics was 'designed' to make things tough in the inner-city, the Daily Beast reported. Snoop said: 'When Reaganomics kicked in, certain things were taken away, after-school programs and things of that nature. 'Guns and drugs were shipped into the neighborhood. 'So it was a shift of having fun and playing football to selling drugs and shooting at each other. 'To me it was a system that was designed, because when the Reaganomics era began, that's when this began.' He began his remarks by speaking about what life was like before the Reaganomics era began. Snoop said: 'Early in the '70s and toward the latter part of the '70s everything was beautiful because we had ways to have fun and communicate, and those who were underprivileged, the low economic side of life, the government would provide for us, which helped us get by.

"A soldier from Fort Meade in Maryland has been charged with criminal homicide after authorities say he stabbed his 14-year-old girlfriend's mother to death early on Sunday in Pennsylvania. Caleb Barnes, 20, is suspected of repeatedly stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck as she tried to fight him off while they were in a car parked in the driveway in front of her Upper Macungie home. It is believed the slaying happened after Silvonek told Barnes and the daughter she disapproved of their relationship. Scroll down for video . Caleb Barnes, 20, is suspected of killing the mother of his 14-year-old girlfriend by stabbing her in the neck . Cheryl Silvonek, 54, tried to fight him off while they were in a car at her home in Upper Macungie, Pennsylvania . When police arrived at the home (pictured) early on Sunday, they found Barnes and the girl in a bedroom . After Silvonek was dead, Barnes and the daughter, who was in the car during the killing, took the other family vehicle to Wamart and purchased alcohol, bleach and other cleaning products, the Allentown Morning Call reported. They attempted to clean up the car, drove it to nearby South Whitehall and buried Silvonek in a shallow grave. Police found the car submerged in a pond and traced it back to the Silvonek residence. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep,CBS 13 reported. Barnes, who has the rank of specialist, was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. She has been charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. It has not been determined if she will be tried as an adult or a juvenile. Defense attorney John Waldron said: 'She's just crying for her mom, saying she misses her mom. 'This is a child, who just turned 14. She's in shock.' The girl's grandparents were in the courtroom during a hearing on Monday. Waldron said: 'Everyone was crying. It was just brutal.' Barnes and the girl started dating in October. He joined the military in February of 2012. He graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. David Silvonek said he was not aware of their relationship. Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said. 'The mother became aware of the relationship and was attempting to have her daughter break it off. 'Obviously we don't know what occurred in the driveway. There are different versions of the event.' The girl is in a juvenile facility that will provide her with psychological counseling. A friend of Barnes said he had personal problems, 69 News reported. The unidentified female friend said: 'Anytime he was around me, he was very sweet and polite, but one day he would be the nicest person you've ever met and the next day he would be dark and gloomy and depressed. 'He wanted to be loved so badly, he was made fun of a lot.'","Police say Caleb Barnes stabbed Cheryl Silvonek, 54, to death on Sunday .

"Beaming with joy, Michael Moloney celebrates his first birthday – a day his mother thought she would never see. But her little boy defied the odds and doctors' warnings that he had no chance of survival. Michelle Moloney was 18 weeks into her pregnancy when she felt his first kick. Hours later, joy turned to alarm as her waters broke. Michael was eventually born at 26 weeks weighing just 1lb 12oz at University Hospital in Coventry . Mrs Moloney, 38, and her 36-year-old husband Scott with Lily, 4, Patrick, 2, and baby Michael . Doctors said she was likely to miscarry within ten days if she did not accept their offer to induce labour as a way to end the pregnancy. But she refused, and managed to stave off labour for eight more weeks. Michael was eventually born at 26 weeks weighing just 1lb 12oz. Despite being premature he is now thriving, and the family held a birthday party for him on Thursday. Mrs Moloney, 38, and her 36-year-old husband Scott, a project manager at a car firm, told the Mail how their 'emotional rollercoaster' began in January last year. 'I felt my baby kick in the early hours,' said Mrs Moloney, from Coventry. 'It was such a definite kick – the reassurance that every expectant mum longs for. Just a few hours later, my waters broke. I felt terrified.' Michael was born in the breech position and medics battled for 20 minutes to revive him - he has now celebrated his first birthday . Baby michael smiling with the toy caterpillar that he has been pictured with since his birth . Doctors said they could either induce labour or let nature take its course in up to ten days . Doctors at University Hospital Coventry said she had too little amniotic fluid, which is vital for the baby's development. The couple, also parents to Lilly, four, and two-year-old Patrick, were given the agonising news they were losing their child. 'It was absolutely devastating', Mrs Moloney said. 'The baby was very scrunched up and very tiny.' Doctors said they could either induce labour or let nature take its course in up to ten days. 'I could feel my baby move,' said Mrs Moloney. 'There was no way I could go through with an induction.' She went home expecting to miscarry but the pregnancy kept progressing. At 24 weeks she was admitted to the hospital, where she stayed until she went into labour. Michael was born in the breech position and medics battled for 20 minutes to revive him. Mrs Moloney said: 'Michael had lung damage. It was touch and go in the early days.' She added: 'He's a miracle. I'm so thankful we have our little boy.' A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We always consider the best interests of the baby.'","Doctors told Michelle Moloney she was likely to miscarry within ten days .

"A New York woman got the surprise of a lifetime when she decided to marry her boyfriend but was told that she was already married to a man from Pakistan. Ebony Walton, 35, had been all set to get hitched to her boyfriend of 18 years when she was turned down for a marriage licence - because of a marriage that she had no clue about. But as she tried to uncover the mystery behind her phantom marriage she realized that her identity was likely stolen by one of her family members who used it to carry out a sham green card marriage. Marriage: Ebony Walton had been all set to get hitched to her boyfriend of 18 years when she was turned down for a marriage licence - because of a marriage to a Pakistani man that she had no clue about . Walton was stunned when officials said they had a record of her marrying a Pakistani immigrant from Gujranwala on December 10, 1997 when she was just 18-years-old. When she thought about the date of the marriage she realized that at that time she had been living with her boyfriend, mother and other family members in a Harlem apartment. Two of her cousins suffered from drug problems and regularly stayed at the apartment and she believed that they stole her identity to get the money, according to The New York Post. In an appeal to a city judge, Walton argued that her cousins had stolen her ID in order to use it, and get paid, for a sham green-card marriage. She recalls leaving her state ID card lying around the house and after showing the judge the similarities between her and pictures of her cousins she built a strong case. Judge John Spooner of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings agreed that her story was probably true and she had been the victim of identity theft. Ruling: Judge John Spooner of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings agreed that her story was probably true and she had been the victim of identity theft .

"They may not be much to look at - but these scraps of land and tumbledown shacks could prove a bargain for buyers in New Orleans. The city government is selling some 1,700 vacant lots and ruined properties which have gone unclaimed for years - many since the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Tens of thousands fled the city, never to return, in the wake of the devastating storm, leaving many homes to crumble into ruin, and patches of land to grow wild. Past its best: This property, 1904 Frenchmen Street, is one of the homes for sale. The vast majority of the lots are empty plots . Typical: More than 1,000 empty spaces like these will be sold - after the city has given up any realistic hope of finding previous owners. Pictured is 838 Bellville Street . And after years of taxes and charges on the land piling up, city authorities have decided to cut their losses by putting them all up for auction. There is no minimum bid, but every property comes with at least $3,000 of fees - meaning nothing will go for less than that. The properties were only put forward after city tax collectors tried to find the rightful owners and failed, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported. Many have so many charges stacked up that paying them off would cost more than the plot is worth. Nonetheless, anybody interested must put down a $650 deposit, to cover the cost of trying again to track down the owners and giving them one last chance to square their debts. Anomaly? Apartment #10 inside this building, 627 Ursuline Avenue in the French Quarter, is also listed for auction, despite its much smarter appearance than most lots for sale. However, there is no word on what it is like inside . Tempting: This patch overgrown weeds - also known as 3050 North Miro Street - is one of the almost 1,800 lots for sale . Some of the lots are empty patches of ground, others are overgrown with weeds or piled with trash. Many are barely a mile from the historic French Quarter, and not far from parks or the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. One property, on the city's Ursuline Avenue, appears to be within a still-standing and well-appointed apartment building - but there was no word on its condition inside. Other complete properties, largely wooden shacks, are so dilapidated they can hardly stay upright. They are being listed online by Civic Source, a company holding the auction on the city's behalf. Buyers are being encouraged to cross-references the addresses with online street view services to get a look at what they are bidding on. Empty: The unused land around this university building is another one of the lots - listed under 131 South Liberty Street . All-natural: 1925 Felician Street is another of the chunks of land which has gone unclaimed and unmaintained . Trash-heap: 3039 Pauger Street was another of the vacant lots up for sale in the huge auction . City authorities have also said that all the sales are conditional on the auctioneers being able to get title insurance for the homes. However, unlike similar schemes in other cities, there is no provision that owners have to develop or repairs the plots - or even live there. This has raised fears that professional investors and would-be landlords will take advantage of the low prices to turn large profits after improving the properties, especially as prices and the reputation of New Orleans as a city recover. However, the prospect seems not to worry the administration of mayor Mitch Landrieu, which could earn millions of dollars from the sale.","New Orleans city authorities are organizing huge auction of vacant homes .

"David Cameron has taken us into yet another of his kitchens to convince the nation he should be the next Prime Minister - and let slip while preparing a salad that he would he would not seek a third term in office . Mr Cameron was interviewed while preparing dinner with his wife Samantha in his £1million constituency home near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds, surrounded by expensive gadgets. Viewers urged the Prime Minister to 'tidy up' the 'cluttered' kitchen, which holds a £240 food processor, £250 speakers, a £650 Range cooker and a £2,000 fridge freezer, all illuminated by  £22 Ikea ceiling lights. A look inside the plush kitchen also revealed that the Prime Minister appears to have a £16.99 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board - a reference to a sexism row after he used the phrase in response to noisy heckles from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle.

Joke: A look inside the plush kitchen also revealed that the Prime Minister appears to have a 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board - a reference to a sexism row after he used the phrase in response to noisy heckles from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle. In a lengthy BBC profile, Mr Cameron prepared dinner with deputy political editor James Landale, who asked him directly whether he would go for a third term if he remained Prime Minister. Mr Cameron replied: ‘No, I think I’m standing for a full second term. ‘I’m not saying all Prime Ministers necessarily, definitely go mad, or even go mad at the same rate, but I feel I’ve got more to bring to this job, the job is half done, the economy’s turned round, the deficit is half down and I want to finish the job.’ Mr Cameron said political leaders should never regard themselves as indispensable. Asked whether his ‘posh’ background was an issue with voters, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘The British public see through all that. The judgment they are making is “Can you do the job or not”.’ He also paid tribute to his wife Samantha for keeping him ‘sane’ in Downing Street and he revealed she will be playing a role in the Conservative election campaign. His wife said: ‘I hope me and the children help him keep things in perspective, keep him grounded, help him pace himself over the next eight weeks.’ Past: David Cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in Oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered . Britons have started calling the 2015 General Election to 'kitchen election', with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both choosing to be interviewed in their homes. News that Ed Miliband had two kitchens in his North London mansion led to him being lampooned and faced accusations that he was out of touch. It began after he and wife Justine were filmed for a BBC interview having tea in a very small, empty room with no seating area. In response to criticism, a family friend tweeted that the main kitchen in the Milibands’ £2million North London home was ‘lovely’ and that this was merely a ‘functional kitchenette for tea and snacks’. David Cameron has also disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home. But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009. Labour leader Ed Miliband previously allowed the cameras into his 'second kitchen' - an area for snack-making in his north London home . Man about the house: Mr Cameron rustles up a quick lunch of sardines and mayonnaise on toast in the modern kitchen of his Downing Street flat last week. The American-style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans . Tidying up: The PM at his Downing Street fridge with some wine on show. There's another bottle on the bench. The larder stores olive oils, condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad . Mr Cameron said: ‘We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him. ‘The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it’s your kitchen. That’s the issue.’ The interview was part of the American website’s BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer. Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London.","Mr Cameron was interviewed while preparing dinner with his wife Samantha in his £1million constituency home .

"A woman has been found guilty of shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, faces at least seven years in prison after being convicted of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident. In court on Wednesday, she was charged with felony use of firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm into an occupied building. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, pictured in the courtroom as she was convicted of opening fire on a McDonald's in February 2014 after they got her order wrong . Torres's mother reacts to the guilty verdict for her daughter on all charges related to the gun-firing at the fast food chain . She looks toward the jury as she hears that she has been found guilty. Torres could face at least seven years in prison . During court, the jury heard the in-car recording taken from the police vehicle located outside of her home while she was being interrogated after the shooting. The recording captured Torres saying 'there was no reason' for why it happened, according to Mlive. She also said 'it was just dumb'. Torres explained that she was not seeking to shoot anyone while at the fast-food restaurant, and that she legally owned the gun, but did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The charge against Torres for felony use a firearm carries at least two years in prison, while shooting at an occupied building and illegally carrying a concealed weapon carries up to five years. Torres, pictured left in her mug shot, miraculously did not injure anyone. She will appear in court on April 21 for her sentencing . A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. During the first day of trial, her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally . The gun used during the incident that could have  injured an employee who was tending to Torres . On the day before the incident, Torres had gone to McDonald's for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said. After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer. Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down. But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger. Nydia Ray, who was driving the car during the incident, is pictured testifying in court during the first day of trial on March 24, 2015 . The server on the night of the incident, Essence Lake, testified in court on March 24, 2015. She said the bullet could have struck her if she had still been by the window . Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said. Her attorney, John Beason, had previously said in court that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger. She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired. The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she had still been by the window. 'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said. Torres' attorney, John Beason, said that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally . She said she was not looking to shoot anyone at McDonald's and that she legally owned the gun . The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later. Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order. She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied. Torres will appear in court on April 21 for sentencing and remains free on a $50,000 bond. Torres was found soon after speeding away from the Grand Rapids McDonald's (pictured) because she had given her number to the restaurant's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting .","Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, could face at least two years in prison after being convicted of felony use of a firearm .

"Caroline Pugh, 33, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, has revealed how she was shocked into losing seven stone after her six-year-old daughter Daisy drew a picture of her looking like a 'fat blob.' Mrs Pugh, who now has three children, Daisy, six, Tizzy, four, and Teddy, two, with husband Andy, 37, a warehouse manager, said she was embarrassed by what her daughter saw when she looked at her 19-stone mother. She said: ‘It was so embarrassing when I saw the picture that Daisy had drawn. I didn’t realise that my children saw me as looking so huge.' Caroline Pugh, 33, used to weigh nearly 19 stone (left) but was shocked into losing seven stone (right) after her daughter drew a picture of her as a 'fat blob' Despite having broken a chair just by sitting on it while pregnant, Caroline says it was the embarrassment of seeing a drawing by daughter Daisy (left drawing in picture), which really gave her the motivation she needed to lose weight . Caroline continued: ‘I got so tired running around after them all the time, my weight meant that I couldn’t keep up with them properly at all, which did upset me. 'When I saw that picture I knew that I really had to do something about losing weight.' Though it wasn't the first sign that her weight was getting out of hand, Caroline admits it was the trigger she needed. She said: ‘I’d tried to push it to the back of my mind. With three young children to look after, my own appearance wasn’t a priority, but my health was suffering too. 'When I was 12 weeks pregnant with Teddy I actually broke a kitchen chair. I’d sat down on it, and it completely gave way beneath my weight.' The mother of three, pictured here with son Teddy, two, and daughters Daisy (left), six, and Tizzy (right), four,  says that she now feels like a completely different person after dropping five dress sizes . Before her weight loss Caroline used to skip breakfast, and snack on bread and crisps all day. Instead of home-cooked dinners, she says she'd eat takeaways several times a week with husband Adam . She continued: ‘This drawing really brought it home to me. I didn’t want my children drawing pictures of their fat mummy anymore.' Before she changed her diet, Caroline ate crisps and up to three sandwiches or sausage rolls for lunch, before gorging on pizza and takeaways for dinner. She said: 'My diet was awful before. 'I’d completely skip breakfast then have lots of bread and crisps or sausage rolls for lunch' Drawing of Caroline before weight loss, left, and drawing of her after the diet, right . She continued: 'We would have takeaways several times a week too and I just snacked on crisps all the time. ‘When I started on the diet I still had takeaways but in moderation and I would snack on low fat crisps, fruit and yoghurt instead.’ After seeking help from her local Weight Watchers group, Caroline says she started to lose the pounds quickly. Swapping her old diet for low fat cereal with skimmed milk at breakfast, and homemade, healthier lunches, Caroline has now dropped five dress sizes and weighs a much lighter 12 stone. She said: ‘Everything has totally changed since I’ve lost all this weight, I feel like a completely different person. 'I feel so much healthier and I’ve got much more energy to run around and look after the children now. 'Andy says its like having a new wife. He’s very proud of me' Left picture: Daisy and Caroline with the two pictures of Caroline as a slim mother (left drawing) and a larger mother (right drawing), right picture: Caroline holds up the pictures . She continued: ‘My children draw pictures of me now looking lovely and slim. 'I’m no longer a fat mummy, instead I’m a yummy mummy.’ Despite all the praise from her husband however, along with being able to fit into slinkier, more fashionable clothes, Caroline says it was the first drawing from Daisy of her as a slimmer woman, which really gave her the reward she was looking for. She said: 'When I saw that new picture that Daisy had drawn, I felt very proud of what I had achieved. 'I can’t believe that I managed to lose so much weight.' 'It was only a child’s drawing but it meant the world to me.' Caroline says it was the first drawing from Daisy (left) of her as a slimmer woman, which really gave her the reward she was looking for.","Caroling Pugh, 33, tipped the scales at nearly 19 stone before taking action .

"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has vowed to protect British soldiers if the Conservatives win the General Election . British soldiers will be protected from ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers if the Conservatives win the General Election, the Defence Secretary pledged last night. Human rights laws will be ‘ripped up’ to ensure those who fight for their country can no longer be hounded in the courts, Michael Fallon said. He promised to end ‘abuse’ of the Human Rights Act by law firms and so-called victims, who he said were lodging claims on an ‘industrial scale’. Such claims were costing the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermining the vital work of the military, Mr Fallon warned. The Tories will confirm their commitment to diminish the UK’s membership of the European Convention on Human Rights in their manifesto. As part of this, the Human Rights Act will be scrapped and soldiers will be subject to a new British Bill of Rights which will reflect the pressures they face in combat. Mr Fallon said: ‘This abuse has got to stop and the next Tory government will limit the reach of human rights cases to the UK so our forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims.’ Figures yesterday showed legal claims over incidents involving British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost the taxpayer nearly £90million over the last ten years – a figure expected to soar even further. Many of the so-called ‘victims’ of these incidents have used the ECHR to demand millions of pounds in compensation. Two public inquiries alone have cost the Ministry of Defence £55.9million. The Al Sweady Inquiry looked into claims lodged by two legal-aid-funded firms – Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day – that British troops murdered, mutilated and tortured Iraqi detainees. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, said yesterday: ‘We can’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws' After an inquiry costing £31million, the allegations were found to be ‘wholly and entirely without merit or justification’. Despite this, the law firms are continuing to pursue cases against the MoD for deaths in Iraq using the Human Rights Act. If the rules are not changed, top brass fear being bombarded by 2,230 more legal claims. There are concerns that troops will in future have to call a lawyer before taking action – even in the heat of a battle. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: ‘We can’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws … I made it clear last year that I want to rip up Labour’s Human Rights Act and that it is only the Conservatives who will make real changes to the human rights framework to restore some common sense.’ Rules governing conflict would fall under the Geneva Convention, which allows lethal force as a first resort against enemy combatants. Last night former military chiefs welcomed the move. Colonel Tim Collins, served in the Iraq War, said: ‘It is about time this happened. To [some] lawyers … the Iraqis are only a vehicle for profit. It is a shameless racket and must be stopped for everyone’s dignity.’ Soldier Kevin Williams, who was repeatedly hounded by lawyers over the death of an Iraqi man, said: ‘To hear the Tories are going to support soldiers is a relief.’ Sergeant Kevin Williams, pictured, ‘put on trial for 12 years’ for killing an Iraqi . The 32-year-old, who shot Hassan Abbas Said in a violent struggle in 2003, was cleared by two military investigations only then to face a murder charge – but was once again cleared. He was served with a letter last year hauling him before a new probe into Iraqi deaths as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations, brought about to comply with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. Seven paratroopers, found not guilty after nine-week trial costing up to £8million but hounded again . The court martial of seven paratroopers accused of murdering an Iraqi teenager collapsed in 2005 after the judge branded some Iraqi witnesses as seekers of ‘blood money’. They were hauled before new investigators as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations and faced fresh scrutiny over their roles last year. The investigations were brought in order to ‘fulfil the investigation duties of the State’, in accordance with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. Sergeant Barry Singleton, cleared of wrongdoing after a two-year investigation but now faces more questions . The 33-year-old Scot, who shot an Iraqi civilian at a checkpoint in Basra 11 years ago, had his case dropped in 2005. Now the Iraq Historic Allegations Team – set up to comply with the Human Rights Act – have told him they are investigating the shooting as part of their investigations into alleged war crimes in Iraq and he was told he could face charges. The family making the case are represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.","Conservatives vow to ensure soldiers are no longer hounded by courts .

"A Wisconsin couple facing multiple animal mistreatment charges was found dead in, what authorities are calling, a murder-suicide after a fire on their farm last week. Paula and David White, of Pleasant Prairie, were found dead in the ruins of their burned farm house after firefighters responded to the call early Thursday, March 19. Police say both died of gunshot wounds with Paula's death ruled a homicide and David's a suicide, NBC reports. That was the day the two were set to appear in court for the conclusion of their trial on animal abuse charges, the Chicago Tribune reports. It was the first court date the couple missed since their arrests in May 2013. Scroll down for video . Couple: The bodies of Paula (left) and David White (right) were found in the ruins of their burned down farm house in, what authorities are calling, a murder-suicide . Wounds: Police say both died of gunshot wounds with Paula's death ruled a homicide and David's a suicide . The couple faced several animal mistreatment charges after authorities found the carcasses of dozens of horses, 12 goats, and two cows in two mass graves on the couple's 'no kill' farm. Authorities discovered that the animals on the farm were living in horrible conditions -- many neglected and starving, Fox reports. Later that March day, a jury -- which didn't know of the situation -- found the couple guilty of 11 felony counts of mistreatment of animals causing death and two misdemeanor counts of providing improper shelter to animals. Horrible Conditions: The couple faced several animal mistreatment charges after authorities found the carcasses of dozens of animals and remaining animals living in on the farm horrible conditions (photographed) Verdict: The day of the fire, a jury -- which didn't know of the situation -- found the couple guilty of 11 felony counts of mistreatment of animals causing death and two misdemeanor counts of providing improper shelter to animals . As the jury deliberated, authorities carried the bodies of the couple and a dog from the farm house -- all suffering gunshot wounds. The cause of the fire is unknown. Medical examiners say Paula suffered two gunshot wounds to the head and David sustained a self-inflicted wound to the head, Fox reports. . Authorities seized several animals from the farm after the couple's arrest, including 23 horses and other animals including sheep, rabbits, chickens, ducks, cats, goats and dogs -- all have been adopted or taken to the Humane Society, the Tribune reports. Officers said the floor of the stalls were lined with feces and urine, CBS reports. Fatally Shot: Authorities say that David also fatally shot the couple's dog before turning the gun on himself . The Whites, both in their sixties, described themselves as 'hippies' running a 'no kill' farm at the property they called 'Hidden Lake Stables.' Justin Jackola, a film producer who founded JJProductions, filmed a documentary about the two and the farm in 2010. He told the Tribune that the Whites were very passionate about being self-sufficient and independent of the system. In the documentary, Paula recalled admiring the farm when she was 18 years old and vowing to one day purchase it. In the early 90s, she and David did. 'I live to take care of my animals...,' Paula said in the documentary. 'It's a no kill farm, no body dies here...unless it's of old age.' As Paula fed chickens, ducks, and a peacock in the film, she said that she has always loved animals and described herself as a 'farm kid.' She also noted that she rarely left the farm because it had everything she needed. 'Hippies:' The Whites (photographed), both in their sixties, described themselves as 'hippies' running a 'no kill' farm at the property they called 'Hidden Lake Stables.' Horses: Authorities reportedly found the carcasses of 55 horses at the couple's farm . Seized: Authorities seized several animals from the farm after the couple's arrest, all have been adopted or taken to the Humane Society . David said in the film that he likes gardening, and Jackola -- who grew up down the road from the farm -- recalled David giving him three bags of vegetables he had grown on the farm, the Tribune reports. Though the two seemed to enjoy their life on the farm, in a prophetic statement, David said their life at the property could end soon. 'It's our expectation to be forced off our property in 10 years,' he said. 'So I spend my whole life trying to preserve the farm and then die?' he continued later, wondering how he will be remembered. 'I look at my accomplishments and try and ask myself 'if someone looked at my life and saw these accomplishments would they consider them to be significant?''","Paula and David White were found in the ruins of their burned down farm house in, what authorities are calling, a murder-suicide .

When Arian Berisha, 21, entered his plea at the Downing Centre Local Court, in Sydney, on Tuesday the more serious charge of reckless wounding was dropped. Redfoo - whose real name is Stefan Gordy - was hit by the glass as he left a VIP section at the popular pub The Golden Sheaf Hotel, in Sydney’s Double Bay, on August 28. The big-haired American singer suffered a cut above his right eye and was treated by paramedics. Berisha, from Waverley in Sydney's eastern suburbs, appeared briefly in court.

Redfoo - whose real name is Stefan Gordy - was hit by the glass as he left a VIP section at the popular pub The Golden Sheaf Hotel, in Sydney’s Double Bay, on August 28 . Lawyers for Mr Berisha told the court in September the only information they had on the case came from Twitter, and that they were 'seeking statements of more than 140 characters.' At the time of the incident, the X Factor judge said he was dancing with some girls in the roped-off VIP section of the pub when a 'dodgy' guy threw a glass, cutting him on the head. 'It was shocking to me, when something like that happens,' Redfoo told Daily Mail Australia following the incident. 'There was quite a bit of blood. 'My hand was all bloody, I looked in the mirror, the whole side of my face had blood on it.' His alleged attacker - who Redfoo labelled a 'real glasshole' in one interview - attempted to flee the scene. The injured star sprinted after him but was restrained by security guards and one of his friends.

The singer was treated for a small, centimetre-wide cut on the right side of his head and delivered a statement to police. Redfoo has never been attacked before. It was the first time he had visited the Sydney hotel and he said if he returns he would wear a Ducati motorcycle helmet.

"A long-time producer for The View has been fired after publicly berating host Rosie O'Donnell. An insider told Page Six that Jennifer Shepard-Brookman was 'profoundly and publicly disrespectful' to the returning host back in February. After an initial suspension, eight-year The View veteran Shepard-Brookman was fired last week. According to the Page Six source, the spat began when Shepard-Brookman was complaining about O'Donnell behind her back. Scroll down for video . Dissed Rosie? An insider told Page Six that Jennifer Shepard-Brookman was 'profoundly and publicly disrespectful' to the returning host back in February . 'During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, ""If you have something to say, say it to my face!"" So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match,' the source said. Staff members, including O'Donnell, were appalled enough by her behavior to complain. Now, ABC top brass have answered in the form of her termination. Not that Rosie O'Donnell cares all that much. The incident occurred right around the time she announced she is leaving The View for a second time. Her publicist, Cindi Berger, said in early February that the outspoken co-host of the ABC daytime chat show would be exiting to focus on her five children after the breakup of her marriage. Booted: Shepard-Brookman, an 8-year veteran of the show, was reportedly suspended in February around the time of O'Donnell's departure and fired last week . Complaints: Staff who say the producer's outburst and Rosie herself reported complained to top ABC brass . Berger says O'Donnell and Michelle Rounds, her wife of three years, split in November. The 52-year-old O'Donnell had returned to The View only last summer. Her initial yearlong stay ended stormily in 2007. Now in its 18th season, the program recently was the target of rumors that a fellow panelist, Rosie Perez, had left for good to appear in a new Broadway play, but she returned. Moderator Whoopi Goldberg and Nicolle Wallace remain with Perez on the show, which was created by Barbara Walters in 1997.

"The knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear. For one mother though, the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother. In 2008, Franky Regan Lamb faced the news that her 21-year-old son Rakeim Regan had fatally stabbed her mother, Pat Regan,  in her own home, in Leeds. Scroll down for video . In a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, Franky Regan Lamb has spoken out about the horrifying incident in 2008 when her son, Rakeim Regan, murdered her mother Pat . Now in a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, which aired yesterday on the CI channel, Franky, her brother Shane and their friends have spoken out about the horrific incident which will haunt the family forever. Rakeim, who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis. His mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny - Pat's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene. Rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that Danny, a notorious drug dealer, might be a bad influence on him. Danny, who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm, was shot to death in 2002, following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs. Following her son's death Pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and, according to Franky, had a close relationship with Rakeim. Murdered Pat Regan (right) was an anti-gun campaigner, pictured here with fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside  Downing Street in 2008 . Slain uncle: Pat's son Danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs . She said: 'If he was in trouble, he'd go to my mum probably more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better. He was her grandson - they were just really close.' Despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about Rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence. His uncle Shane admitted: 'We had worries about him, because it seemed that he was impressed with, kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff. 'You know, there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just, kind of like, saying, ""You don't need to be focused on that kind of stuff. You need to focus more on your education, your music"" - you know, things that are quite playful, things that are positive. 'Don't look at the negative and don't be, you know, tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle.' Sadly, there was nothing the family could do to help him and as Rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs, his paranoia started to increase. Franky said: 'He kind of lost his way a little bit and I, kind of, guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years, in ecstasy, cocaine, and I used to say to Rakeim, ""You haven't got the mind-set to get through stuff like that, you know, take ecstasy and things like that. It's not good for you and it'll bring you down."" 'He would go, ""I know mum, I don't do it any more.""' Rakeim's uncle Shane Regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother. He says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother . Shane said: 'He was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles, aliens, he was having these kinds of thoughts. 'People's eye colours were changing, you know, to these luminous colours. He threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck. 'It was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be. He wanted to be a hard man, he wanted to be tough, he wanted to be fearless. 'He wanted to be this character that wasn't him and my mum was like, ""Well, I let him go out tonight, god knows what's going to happen to him.""' Finally - following an incident in which Rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital. It was to prove too little, too late. The day after his release Pat, who had taken Rakeim in, went missing. She was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by Shane but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up. Shane was horrified when he was called to his mother's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding, only to find out that she had been killed. Shane was eventually called to come down to his mother's house, where he learned the devastating news that Pat had been stabbed to death. Franky said: 'I was hysterical. I would give anything, you know, to have my mum back. You know, to hear that call, I've had that call before about my brother, about my younger brother.' Worse news was to come when the family made the horrifying discovery that it was Rakeim behind the killing. However, Franky has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did. 'The realisation that your son's done what he's done, it's just gut-wrenching. I never felt, ""You horrible, horrible person."" I never felt that. 'Part of me sometimes thinks, ""Would it be easier to dislike, not love Rakeim if he hadn't been a drug addict and he'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something, or he was just a nasty person? 'Because he wasn't, and it was the mental health, and he loved his grandma, and he wasn't a bad person, it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was.' Having pleaded guilty to manslaughter Rakeim is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and Franky goes to visit him on a regular basis. She said the first encounter was difficult: 'First seeing him, where he was, it was heartbreaking. I didn’t know if he’d remember, and he remembered what he’d done but he was still in a psychotic state. 'He was still delusional about what he’d done and how he’d done it, and to go and sit and listen to your son, your baby, saying this about what he’s done to his grandma and your mum is the worst.' However, Shane has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again: 'Personally I’ve not seen Rakeim since the day that he got sentenced. 'I just found it difficult to find a way to look in his eyes and speak to him about it. I dream about looking him in the eye, I have dreams of seeing him, I have this mixed emotion when I see him. 'I want to run up to him and give him a big hug and say, ‘Do you know what, I love you,’ and then I start to doubt that he did do it by accident.'","Franky Regan Lamb's son Rakeim Regan killed her mother in 2008 .

"Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton said an 18-year-old who was raped near a Leeds bus stop was 'left for dead' and found lying in a pool of blood . A teenage girl was 'left for dead' after being raped at a bus stop, police confirmed as they said they are hunting for a man who would likely have been left with blood on his hands or clothing after the violent attack. The rape of an 18-year-old girl at a bus stop in Leeds in West Yorkshire is now being treated as attempted murder after the youngster suffered severe injuries and was left needing surgery. Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We are now treating this as an attempted murder because she has been left there for dead.' The officer has encouraged people to come forward with information about the attack and said this is 'no time for family loyalty.' The Asian teenager was grabbed from behind by a man,  in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. He dragged her into a garden and raped her just before 11pm on Friday night. She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood. DCI Belford added:  'It has been a very nasty attack that has been sustained over some time. 'The nature of her injuries are that she has suffered facial and head injuries and also a suspected broken hip.' The suspect is described as an Asian man in his early 20s with a slim build and dark receding hair. Police said they believe he had been in the area for a while before the attack took place. Scroll down for video . Police found the girl lying on the ground suffering head injuries but it later emerged she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. DCI Belford said: 'I would encourage people to think – was there something out of place – or did someone come home with blood on their shirt? A team of specialist forensic officers spent Saturday recovering evidence from where the girl was found . Police said they are looking for an Asian man in his early 20s of slim build with receding dark coloured hair . 'This is no time for family loyalty – this was an horrific incident and the victim is lucky to be alive.' Officers said they do not believe the attack was racially motivated and wanted to put an end to any speculation. They confirmed the victim was Asian. 'I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene,' said DCI Belford. 'It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing.' The teenager was raped as she waited at a bus stop, pictured, near Leeds City centre late on Friday night . Officers were looking for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect who is in his 20s . The 18-year-old was attacked near Malvern Road and Beeston Road in Leeds at about 22:40pm on Friday. Police are appealing for people to come forward - including a woman who is believed to have been standing at the bus stop shortly before the attack who then got on a number 1 or 47 bus. They also want to speak to a man who was jogging in the area. DCI Belton said the crime had 'shocked the community.'

"As thousands queued up outside Leicester Cathedral yesterday to catch a glimpse of Richard III's coffin, businesses in the city also appeared to be doing their utmost to get into the commemorative spirit. With the city centre swamped by visitors from as far and wide as the U.S and Russia, shopkeepers in Leicester have been selling off a raft of merchandise - including t-shirts, ice creams and even haircuts - in an apparent bid to cash in on the historic five-day event. From fridge magnets emblazoned with the king's signature, to a £14.95 Richard III-embossed silk ties, the souvenir frenzy has been led by the official visitor centre, a former school located next to the spot where the former monarch's remains were found in 2012. Scroll down for videos . Cashing in: A raft of memorabilia connected to Richard III's reburial is on sale at the official visitor centre, including t-shirts (pictured left) and tote bags (right) Souvenirs: Mugs with an image of the medieval king (pictured) are also available to buy from the centre . Among the souvenirs being sold for the reinterment are notepads, keyrings, mugs, t-shirts (pictured) But alongside the usual mugs, pencils and keyrings, visitors can also buy themselves glasses 'fit for a king' from a nearby optician - and can even opt for a £25 Richard III-inspired bowl haircut, being marketed at Ungaro Hair Studios. Gelato Village, an Italian ice-cream shop which has extended opening hours until 11pm for the reinterment, has also made a special Richard III rose blossom and fruits of the forest-flavoured ice cream, a move which yesterday prompted the business's 'busiest day ever'. The apparent commercialism of the event is sure to prompt outcry from those who have already criticised the king's reburial. Louise Hollingsworth, who was part of a campaign group which had argued that he should have been buried in York, has already called the event an 'undignified, money-grabbing pantomime', while one Twitter user wrote: '#richardIII no dignity in death, no dignity in burial, and after being hawked around like the FA cup on a bus, no dignity in reburial either.' Another person used Twitter to mock the hullabaloo, tweeting: 'Is there a #RichardIII Christmas decoration on sale? I can't find it.' But with the increased footfall in Leicester since the discovery in 2012 expected to bring £50m into the city's coffers, it's no surprise that businesses - and indeed residents - have been attempting to make the most of this week's event.

There is also an official King Richard III 'traffic marshal pass badge', which has an asking price of £2.50. Sarah Harrison, the council official in charge of tourism, told The Times that the council were working to ensure no merchandise was being sold on the black market. She said: 'He belongs to everybody, but we want to make sure that the way he is perceived and is treated is actually befitting the last Plantagenet king.' The former chief executive of the local chamber of commerce, Martin Traynor, estimated more than £45m will be brought into the city as a result of the so-called 'Richard III effect'. He is now the chairman of trustees of the visitor centre, which is a charitable trust. Yesterday, more than 5,000 queued outside the cathedral to visit the coffin as it lies in repose head of Thursday's reburial. The sheer volume of guests forced the cathedral - which had previously warned visitors to stay away due to over-demand - to stay open into the evening. Thousands more are expected to line up again today. By 8.30am, the queue was already one-hour long, forcing the cathedral to start admitting people into the viewing area during morning prayer. Gelato Village, an Italian ice-cream shop, has also made a special Richard III rose blossom and fruits of the forest-flavoured ice cream, a move which yesterday prompted the business's 'busiest day ever' The Leicester Mercury's souvenir supplement, produced alongside the newspaper, has already made it onto eBay. Bids on one post have already reached £20, while customers also have the option to 'buy it now' for £15 . Meanwhile, an order of service from Sunday's ceremony is also being sold on the auction site, with a current of £17, alongside an official King Richard III 'traffic marshal pass badge', which has an asking price of £2.50 . Some of those in the queue had flown to Leicester for the occasion from Vancouver, Moscow and other parts of Europe. The king's remains, will stay under the watchful eye of an honour guard of ex-Forces veterans at Leicester Cathedral until Thursday, when the 15th century ruler will finally be lowered into a purpose-built tomb made of Yorkshire Swaledale stone. The ceremony will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. On Friday, more than 8,000 flickering flames will illuminate the streets around Leicester Cathedral in a commemoration of the reinterment. The free event – entitled Leicester Glows – will see a trail of the thousands of small flames being lit in small containers which will be placed on the ground to line routes in the area surrounding the cathedral. The increased footfall in Leicester since the discovery in 2012 expected to bring £50m into the city's coffers . More than 5,000 people queued outside the cathedral yesterday (pictured), while a two-hour long queue has already formed outside the building today . The crook-backed monarch, the last English king to have died in battle, was most famously depicted as the Shakespearean hunchback in Richard III, whose brief reign is marked by the allegation that he murdered his own nephews. But the pivot for the change in public opinion - which sparked a huge debate over the whereabouts of his reinterment - was in 2012, when the monarch's bones were discovered beneath a social services parking bay in central Leicester. When DNA tests, bone analysis and other scientific scrutiny established that the skeleton belonged to the king, archaeologists revealed that he had been given a hasty burial, with a grave so short the king's head was propped up against its side. Visitors will be able to visit the coffin between 9am and 12.30pm today, and then between 2pm and 5pm and 7.15pm and 9pm. Tomorrow, viewing will take place between 9am and 12.30pm.","Thousands have flocked to see Richard III's coffin in Leicester Cathedral .

"An Australian woman has suffered severe frostbite injuries after she got so drunk she fell asleep outside a Canadian bar in the middle of winter. Emma Quirk, who shared photos of her painful injuries onimgur, admits she was 'f***ing stupid' following the drunken incident in December at Prince Albert in Saskatchewan, Canada. Ms Quirk, who lived in NSW's Blue Mountains but moved to Canada four years ago, says she was 'blackout drunk' when she lost her friends and was last seen at a bar about 2.30am. Emma Quirk has revealed her horrific frostbite injuries after she fell asleep outside a bar in Canada for three hours in the middle of winter . She told her friends she was going to have a cigarette before vanishing into the minus 30 degree Celsius temperatures without her jacket and gloves. Ms Quirk was found outside a nursing home curled in a ball trying to sleep  three hours later and her fingers were already notably purple. 'It was 5.45am when I was found. At 6.30 a nurse told me that best case scenario I keep my fingers... worst case I lose my hands,' she said. Emma Quirk (middle), who shared photos of her painful injuries on imgur, was last seen with friends (pictured) inside a bar in December at Prince Albert in Saskatchewan, Canada, before she vanished . She was found outside a nursing home curled in a ball trying to sleep three hours later and her fingers were already notably purple (pictured) Ms Quirk was treated in hospital over several days and said medical staff all wanted to check out her 'sweet blisters' and find out how long an Australian could withstand the cold. Her specialist Dr Randall Friesen - which she claims is a pun for Dr Freezin - told her her fingers would blister and swell before they could be popped a few days later. 'The pain and pressure at this point was verging on unbearable. I was taking opiates the whole time... frostbite recovery is pretty well known for its pain,' she said. 'My next visit with Doc Freezin he was wearing an apron and a face mask with a plastic shield over his head. Emma was treated in hospital over several days and was told her fingers would have to blister and swell before they could be popped . Her specialist Dr Randall Friesen - which she claims is a pun for Dr Freezin - told her her fingers would blister and swell before they could be popped a few days later . 'With my hand over a metal tray, he cut my blisters with a scalpel. Puss went everywhere. I think I even got the hospital curtains.' She said after a few minutes her finger deflated and she was left with raw skin. Her hands are in the process of healing and she can use them again, but her specialist is still concerned about her left pinky and right middle fingertip. 'I won't find out until June. If I lose them I want to make a sweet, custom made prosthetic,' she said. Emma says pus went everywhere when doctors eventually popped the huge blisters leaving her with mounds of extra skin .

"One baby boy's set to be showered in lots of pink after a sonographer guessed his sex wrong. Kyle and Danielle Williams from Belleville, Michigan, had even picked out the name Charlee for their second daughter. But when the infant was delivered via C-section on March 3 they got a big surprise. After coming to terms with the wrong gender prediction, the couple filmed themselves breaking the news to family during hospital visits. They uploaded footage  online this week in a bid to share the mix-up with the wider community.

In one scene, one of the baby's grandmothers walks in to do a diaper change, when she's suddenly left speechless . 'Well child welcome to the world... I can't believe it!' she says as she stares down at the baby's naked body. She is seen opening her mouth wide and doing a double-take. In the next scene, the baby's other grandmother finds out that he is boy and not a girl. 'It's a boy? You guys are not joking?' she exclaims as she stands by Mrs Williams' bedside. Later the new mother tells her sister about the unexpected sex of her baby via Skype.

Caught off-guard: Later the new mother tells her sister about the unexpected sex of her baby via Skype . 'Are you kidding! Oh my God! Oh my goodness! Yey!' the new aunt continually exclaims after putting her hand over her mouth. The Williams' swiftly changed the name of their baby to Bentley Thomas. Other than the gender confusion, he was deemed well and healthy, weighing 7lbs 5oz. 'This is Bentley, your baby brother,' the Williams' later told their other daughter, Peyton, who seemed a little confused about the situation. 'Why?' the two-year-old quipped as she was introduced to her new sibling. Besides having to 'de-pink'  Bentley's baby room and closet, the Williams say life couldn't be better.

"Scientists believe they have got to the bottom of anal evolution. A team of Norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully-functioning anus, while other only have 'transient' ones. The study also reveals how some creatures, such as the Penis worm, have very similar digestive systems to humans, even though they are very different species. Scroll down for video . The latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines, stomach and anus in the Penis worm, pictured . Biologist Dr Andreas Hejnol and Dr Chema Martín-Durán, of the University of Bergen, spent several years studying how genes change the development of creatures. 'While several organ systems have been investigated, such as the nervous system, the anal opening has been largely neglected,' Dr Hejnol told BBC Earth. The study, published in the journal Zoologischer Anzeiger, identified genes known as brachyury and ParaHox, that are crucial to the development of an anus. According to a report by Matt Walker at the BBC, their study reveals how the anus is perhaps one of the most important organs in our body, helping our digestive system work. He notes that, interestingly, not all animals have one. Some animals have simpler versions, in others the organ appears to be transient, while another has multifunctional anuses. Animals that do have an anus, however, often grow to be larger, more sophisticated creatures. A team of Norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully-functioning anus, while other only have 'transient' ones . In 2013, researchers discovered that one of our earliest ancestors was a worm with no anus. The worm, named Xenoturbella bocki, has no brain, no sex organs and no vital organs. The 1m worm is regarded by some scientists as a key biological link between many species. Researchers believe the worm is a distant progenitor of humans and a host of other animals living today. Swedish researchers say the worm might belong to a branch of the animal family tree called deuterostomes, of which humans are also members. Trying to understand when and why the anus evolved is also complicated because it also appears and vanishes again within various groups of animals, such as flatworms. The latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines, stomach and anus in the Penis worm. What surprised the researchers was not just that the development was the same in the worms as in humans, fish and frogs, but that exactly the same genes were involved in the process. Penis worms live in shallow parts of the oceans, including off the Swedish west coast where they propagate during the winter. 'This means that the origin of the human stomach is further back in time than previously thought, probably about 500 million years', says Ralf Janssen, postdoc in professor Graham Budd's research group on paleobiology at Uppsala University. The team are now conducting further research into whether the anus has evolved independently a number of times among animals. 'The pattern of presence and absence of the anus in animals is quite fascinating,' Dr Hejnol told the BBC.","Brachyury and ParaHox genes could shed light on anus evolution .

"It’s one of the most famous scenes from any movie, let alone Jurassic Park: Two raptors enter the kitchen, stalking two children - their human prey. But as the raptors make their screeches and calls, you might be surprised to know these sounds actually come from tortoises having sex. It turns out that many of the dinosaur sounds in the hit 1993 film were made by recording modern animals - including, bizarrely, tortoises mating. Scroll down for video . The sound designer for the 1993 firm has revealed some secrets of Jurassic Park - and it turns out the velociraptor's 'barking' noise (kitchen scene shown) was made by tortoises having sex. Other dinosaur sounds were 'voiced' by a variety of animals. These include horses, donkeys, cattle and a dog for the T-Rex . In an interview for SF Gate, sound designer for the movie Gary Rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect. In August last year, researchers trained four red-footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats. The animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display, and even learnt which side of the screen to press. The animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real-life, offline experiment. Professor Anna Wilkinson from the University of Lincoln led the study, alongside researchers from the University of Vienna. ‘Yes, it’s a mating tortoise,’ when asked about the sounds they make. Specifically, he says the ‘bark’ when one velociraptor first comes in the kitchen was created by recording a tortoise successfully mate with another at Marine World. ‘It’s riding on the back of the female tortoise. So it’s climbing up her shell basically, and then it falls off. It’s a little sexual,’ he said. This confirms what was reported by Vulture back in 2013, that tortoise sounds were behind the noise of the raptors. But this wasn’t the only bizarre animal noise used in the movie; it turns out horses, donkeys and even cattle were used for some of the other dinosaur calls. ‘The brachiosaur’s singing is one of my favourite sounds in the movie because it’s beautiful, but like all good sound design it's made from a non-beautiful source, which is donkeys,’ Mr Rydstrom told Vulture. In an interview for SF Gate, sound designer for the movie Gary Rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect. ‘Yes, it’s a mating tortoise,’ when asked about the sounds they make. Shown is a stock image of Seychelles giant tortoises (Dipsochelys hololissa) mating . And even the T-Rex got the animal treatment, with Mr Rydstrom’s own pet Jack Russell terrier being used to voice the huge dinosaur. The fourth Jurrassic Park film - called Jurassic World and starring Chris Pratt - is scheduled to be released on 12 June 2015. And a trailer confirmed velociraptors would be making a return in the film - but whether they will similarly be voiced by mating tortoises you’ll have to wait and see whether similar sound effects have been used.

"Children whose ears stick out may be self-conscious. But a new study shows that while large ears may catch the eye, the trait doesn’t carry a social stigma. In fact, an experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions. A desirable attribute: An experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions. A stock image is shown . Dr Ralph Litschel, lead author of the study published in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery, told LiveScience: ‘Protruding ears catch the eye, but not necessarily the imagination in a negative way.’ The facial plastic surgeon at Cantonal Hospital St Gallen in Switzerland said that protruding ears may make children seem particularly cute. It’s thought that around five per cent of people have large ears. In an experiment, scientists photographed 20 children between the ages of five and 19 who were considering surgery to stop their ears protruding as much. They made a copy of each photograph and used Photoshop to show how the children would look after surgery and showed the pairs of images to 20 volunteers. The experts used an eye-tracking device to measure which facial features caught the attention of the volunteers and asked them to guess each child’s personality. The study showed that protruding ears don't carry a social stigma and it's unknown why it's been thought that they may lead to a biased perception of personality. Dr Litschel said: Up to today, popular comic cartoons with prominent ears represent the less-intelligent, immature, oddball character, like Shrek.' A stock image is shown . Our ears and nose keep growing as we age, but it's not due to cartilage continuing to grow, as often thought. In fact, it's down to gravity, which enables them to elongate by 0.22 millimetres every year. As we age, the collagen and elastic fibres that make up cartilage, begin to disintegrate, causing them to stretch and sag - and appear longer, The Medicine Journal reported. The same problem occurs in our skin, which compounds noses and ears getting longer. And because faces become less plump with time, this acts to emphasise the sagging of the ears and nose. The results revealed that the observers spent an average of seven seconds looking at each child’s face. They spent an average of 10 per cent of that time looking at protruding ears, compared to six per cent for the ears in the Photoshopped images, demonstrating that the over-sized features did catch their attention. The experts said this is because people tend to focus on what is different and novel in a face, as it helps us to recognise others. Dr Litschel said they were surprised to find that the volunteers did not see the protruding ears as an undesirable feature. Previous studies have shown that beauty influences people’s perception of personality and the volunteers said that the children in the study all looked cute and smart. It’s unknown why it has been thought that protruding ears may lead to a biased perception of a person’s personality, but it could hark back to a 1876 study by an Italian criminologist called Cesare Lombroso, who identified criminals by unusual facial features, such as their ears. This work suggested that unusual ears went hand-in-hand with crime. Dr Litschel added: ‘Up to today, popular comic cartoons with prominent ears represent the less-intelligent, immature, oddball character, like Shrek. He noted that the results of the study may vary depending on the culture of the volunteers, as, for example, big ears are seen as a sign of good fortune in Asia.","Plastic surgeon from Cantonal Hospital St Gallen, Switzerland found adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and cute .

"Top House Republicans are warning Hillary Clinton they won't hesitate to have her charged with criminal wrongdoing if it turns out she didn't provide the State Department with copies of every email she sent in relation to the Benghazi assault. A spokesperson for Clinton has said that the former secretary of state completely complied with the requirement but Republicans have continued to question the veracity of that statement. A House committee tasked with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya issued a new round of subpoenas last week for messages sent through Clinton's personal account, which was recently revealed to be the only email address she used while at the State Department, mixing business correspondence with pleasure, all at a domain outside the immediate scope of the government. The controversy has bled into a separate review of the Clinton Foundation's fundraising practices during Hillary Clinton's tenure in Barack Obama's administration after the Washington Post discovered that her family's charity accepted money from foreign governments that were also lobbying the State Department. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Hillary Clinton, pictured here with daughter Chelsea Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative University in  Miami, Florida, didn't appear to be worried during the Saturday event about investigations into her email . Clinton and her team have kept their heads down as the scandals played out, to the chagrin of some Democrats who say that the likely 2016 presidential candidate needs to head off bad press by confronting the allegations. Collectively, the accusations of impropriety levied at the Clintons have extended into their third week, and appear to be gaining strength rather than dissipating. The email saga was a topic of discussion on multiple agenda-setting talk shows on Sunday morning, and the Clinton Foundation's fundraising again grabbed headlines. 'The emails are a related but secondary scandal,' a so-called Clinton 'loyalist' told the National Journal. 'Follow the foundation money.' The Clinton Foundation admitted last month to accepting a donation from the Algerian government in the amount of $500,000 for disaster relief in Haiti while Hillary was secretary of state and did not disclose it to the federal government. It had, at that time, an agreement with the Obama administration that allowed it to keep taking money from foreign governments it had done business with the past. But Algeria was a new donor, meaning it broke the rules when it cashed the country's check. Of importance is that Algeria was lobbying the State Department at the time and spent roughly the same amount on that effort as it gave to the then-secretary's family foundation. Bill Clinton refused on Sunday to talk about his wife's email woes, saying he had an opinion, and a bias, yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own. In a dueling appearance on CNN with Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, also of California, said on the network's State of the Union program that 'voluntary cooperation' with a House's investigation into the Benghazi attack 'does not guarantee that it's a crime not to deliver all.' 'A subpoena which Trey Gowdy issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena,' Issa, a recent chairman of the House Oversight Committee said. 'He needed to do that because she wasn't forthcoming two-and-a-half years ago. She, in fact, hid the very existence of this until she was caught.' South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy called into question on Sunday a photo of Clinton on her phone that inspired the Texts from Hillary meme. 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip' Gowdy is the chair of the House's Select Committee on Benghazi. Schiff is the ranking Democrat on the temporary task force. Comprised of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, the select committee has been charged by House Speaker John Boehner with investigating the events leading up to the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist strike on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Several House committees have already looked into the assault extensively, but as Issa articulated Sunday, GOP lawmakers believe investigators were not provided with all of Clinton's Benghazi associated emails and an additional review of her actions is warranted. 'And we may never get many of them because we don't know what we don't know when it's on a server where a click of the button can delete records forever,' he said, referring to reports that Clinton housed her email on a home-brewed server that only she and aides had access to. On Sunday, Schiff accused the taxpayer-funded Benghazi panel of using its power 'to become an arm of the Republican National Committee.' 'That's what happened this week,' he said of committee head Gowdy's response to the Clinton email brouhaha. 'And that is deeply disturbing, because, Michael, we have the secretary's e-mails,' Schiff continued, addressing the show's fill-in host Michael Smerconish. Pointing out that Clinton provided 55,000 pages of her correspondence to the State Department, 900 pages of which were on Benghazi, Schiff said relevant emails have already been reviewed by House investigators and 'there is nothing at all corroborative of any of these conspiracy theories.' Gowdy said on CBS' Face the Nation that 'there are gaps of months and months and months' between the email records that the House was provided . Gowdy said Sunday morning on another program, CBS' Face the Nation, that 'there are gaps of months and months and months' between the email records that the House was provided, however. 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip,' the South Carolina congressman asserted. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.' The photo Gowdy referenced inspired viral sensation 'Texts from Hillary.' Until yesterday, after he made mention of it on national TV, it had been Clinton's profile picture on Twitter. It's now her background photo. Her Twit pic is now an empty avatar emblazoned with the words 'NOT-THERE.org' 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide,' she said, drawing attention to a report on women's rights that her organization plans to release today. The tweet is one of just two tweets that she's sent since Wednesday, when she said on the social media platform that she wants the public to see her emails and has asked the State Department to release them. The other tweet commemorated Bloody Sunday and called on her followers to keep fighting for 'voting rights, civil rights, & human rights.' Bill Clinton refused on Sunday to talk about his wife's email woes, saying he had an opinion, and a bias, yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own . A Democratic strategist who spoke to the Washington Post, said most Democrats don't believe the the cloud of suspicion currently following Clinton is 'going to have a lot of legs.' 'But there is a level of angst and annoyance about how badly the thing has been mishandled,' the source added. A former colleague of Clinton's in the Senate, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, implored the former New York lawmaker on Sunday to make additional public remarks on the email drama. 'From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her,' Feinstein said on NBC's Meet the Press. President Barack Obama finally broke his own silence on the matter during an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. 'I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,' he said, and praised her service in his cabinet. Further backing her, he said, 'I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need.' He also claimed to have found out about Clinton's lack of a State Department email address that automatically archives emails from the press at 'the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.' His statement follows a prediction from his spokesman on Friday that he probably 'learned about that by reading the newspaper' but wasn't entirely sure.","A spokesperson for Clinton has said she completely complied; Republicans have continued to question the veracity of that statement .

"The global chemical weapons . watchdog will investigate allegations chlorine gas has been used to carry out fatal attacks in Syrian villages. It is understood that a probe will take place to examine reports that several chlorine 'barrel bombs' in the northwestern Idlib region of Syria have been used in attacks that killed six people and wounded dozens. Ahmet Uzumcu, chief of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said the organisation would continue a current fact-finding mission into the use of 'toxic chemicals for hostile purposes' in Syria. He added: 'The matter is of serious concern.' Scroll down for video . Syrian regime forces have carried out airstrikes in the opposition-controlled district of Jobar in eastern Damascus, as the global weapons watchdog announced it will investigate claims chlorine gas has been used in the conflict . The investigation was announced as airstrikes have continued to be carried out by Syrian regime forces. Activists have accused the Syrian regime of using chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - on civilian areas in the past. 'We have been monitoring the recent reports suggesting that toxic chemicals may have been used as weapons in the Idlib province in Syria,' Uzumcu added. A monitoring group and opposition activists said six people, including three young children, were killed in the alleged regime gas attack in the village of Sarmin, in Idlib province 10 days ago. Amnesty International said the attack was further evidence of 'war crimes.' A report by the chemical weapons watchdog in January concluded 'with a high degree of confidence' that chlorine gas had been used in attacks on three villages in Syria last year. At least 13 people died in the attacks that were carried out from April to August, according to the report. The OPCW's fact-finding mission last year found that the . use of chlorine gas is 'systematic' in the four-year Syrian . civil war, which has killed more than 200,000 people and . displaced millions. Both sides have denied using chlorine gas in the attacks, which are believed to be dropped onto villages using helicopters. The Syrian air . force is the only party in the conflict known to have . helicopters. Smoke is seen rising in the opposition-controlled district of Jobar, in eastern Damascus . Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013, . agreeing to allow foreign weapons inspectors into the country . and averting U.S.-threatened air strikes after sarin attacks in . the outskirts of Damascus killed hundreds. The government of President Bashar al Assad has since handed . over 1,300 tonnes of toxic chemicals and is destroying . production and storage facilities. The process of verifying that . the chemical weapons programme has been eliminated is . continuing. Syria did not have to declare its stockpile of chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - as part of a disarmament deal agreed in 2013 because it is widely used for commercial and domestic purposes. The Assad regime and the rebels have accused each other of using chemical agents, including chlorine, in the nearly four-year war that has killed more than 210,000 . US Secretary of State John Kerry said he was 'deeply . disturbed' by the reports of renewed use of chlorine gas, last . used widely in World War One. The use of industrial chemicals as weapons is banned under . the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.

"A federal judge  shot in the leg outside his Detroit home was trying to protect his family during a robbery attempt. Terrence Berg  was taking out the  trash Thursday night when two people confronted him to try to get inside his home. U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said Berg refused and was 'heroic' in protecting his family. Federal judge Terrence Berg (abogve with his family) was shot in the leg outside his Detroit home Thursday night . Berg was taking out the trash when two men tried to rob him or get into his house, at which point he blocked them to protect his family . 'True to his character, Judge Berg heroically protected his family by refusing to let the robbers inside his home, McQuade told The Detroit News. In this 2009 file photo,  Berg addresses the media in Detroit . 'He took a bullet in the leg, but possibly spared his family from a worse outcome. All of his friends and former colleagues at the U.S. Attorney's Office are rooting and praying for him for a speedy and full recovery.' Berg, 55, was shortly shot after 9pm, and police believe that the men were either trying to rob him or make their way into his home. Berg's wife, Anita Sevier, says he will undergo surgery later Friday and that his injury isn't life-threatening. Nobody has been arrested in the shooting and the case has been turned over to the FBI. If Berg was targeted by the men because he is a judge they will face federal charges. The 55-year-old has been a judge for two years, and his court is in Flint. Berg served as a federal prosecutor for two decades, including briefly as head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. He was nominated to the position in April 2012 by President Barack Obama. 'The lucky thing for whoever did this, is that they didn't kill him. Because then, my goodness. I'm glad he's OK.' Berg has three children.","Federal judge Terrence Berg was shot in the leg outside his Detroit home Thursday night .

"A couple  who racked up thousands of pounds in debts with payday loan firms were evicted from their home and have been sleeping rough in their Ford Focus, it was revealed today. For the past two months Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been bedding down overnight in their old car, with their worldly belongings in its boot, on an industrial estate in Warrington, Cheshire. Times have become so tough they celebrated their wedding anniversary by sharing a Twix chocolate bar. The desperate pair borrowed £830 from lenders to try and cover their rent after Mr Sherlock, a self-employed landscape gardener, was forced to stop working through ill health in October. Tough times: Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been forced to live in their Ford Focus after falling in to debt . Possessions: Everything the married couple own is piled into the car after they were evicted from their home in North Wales . But with interest rates of more than 1,000 per cent the debt soon spiralled out of control. Even though Mrs Sherlock, 32, was working 12 hours a week as a shop assistant, her £6.50 an hour minimum wage salary was not enough to pay their £125-a-week rent. They fell behind and by Christmas owed more than £2,000. In January they couple were evicted from their two bedroomed home, in Wrexham, north Wales, and have been living in the car ever since. Today there was no sign of the pair at the industrial unit, but CCTV footage from a local business appeared to confirm they had been arriving after dark and leaving early in the morning. Mr Sherlock, 41, told the Sun it was humiliating not being able to provide for his wife. ‘We celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary a few days after moving all our belongings into the boot of our car,’ he said. ‘We sat there, shared a Twix chocolate bar and told ourselves we would turn this around. ‘But the days have turned into weeks. As an adult couple who want to work, it’s humiliating how far we have fallen. All I want to do is take care of my wife. But without a job, savings or a home, it’s just impossible.’ Rest: Mr Sherlock grabs some sleep in the car, which is usually based in a Warrington car park . Support: Mrs Sherlocks lays her head down - but the couple sleep in shifts so the other can keep an eye out . The couple’s problems began in October when Mr Sherlock went into hospital for an operation on a twisted intestine. It meant he had to give up his £400-a-week job as a self-employed landscape gardener because it was too physical – a job he had done for the past 24 years. 5.45am: Couple wake up in the car and head to nearby shopping centre to use the toilet . 8am: Pasty each from bakery and then head to nearby pub for coffee and to charge phones . 11am: Victoria heads to work and Philip goes to the Job Centre . 5.30pm: Dinner of baguette and spaghetti hoops in the car . 8.30pm: Head to car park for the night and sleep in shifts . Instead he started claiming £84 a week in tax credits while he looked for other work, but, with Mrs Sherlock’s £78-a-week income, the couple were bringing home just £162 a week. After paying their rent, they were left with just £37 for food and bills and soon fell behind. In desperation they turned to payday loan firms, borrowing £80 from 247Moneybox, at an annual rate of 1,309 per cent and £100 from Bongaloans at 1,272 per cent. They also borrowed £500 from Logbook Loans to cover the cost for their car. But they struggled with the repayments and within two months they were £2,000 in debt. Mrs Sherlock said they sold their fridge, washing machine and even their bed but still couldn’t stave off the bailiffs. ‘We needed quick and easy cash so we didn’t think twice,’ she said. ‘But it all got out of control and we ended up with bailiffs at our door.’ Happier times: Mr and Mrs Sherlock, pictured on their wedding day, have seen their life decline after health and debt problems . Trouble: The pair have had to turn the Focus into their home because they claim they asked the council for help but say they were told they were not considered high risk enough for emergency accommodation . The couple put all their belongings in their car and drove to Warrington, where Mrs Sherlock works, to try to secure emergency accommodation. But officials at the Labour-run Warrington Council said they were not high risk enough to qualify and instead they were advised to put their names on a council house waiting list. Mr Sherlock, who has a 12-year-old son form a previous relationship, said the couple allow themselves just £3 a day for food and use the toilets in supermarkets and showers in a local swimming baths daily. He spends most of his time at the local job centre while his wife is at work, before parking up in the industrial unit, which is close to a main train line, after dark. The couple have been sleeping rough in a five-door Ford Focus similar to the one shown in this file picture . He added: ‘It’s freezing sleeping (in the car.) ‘It stays noisy until about 3am and I watch over my wife, feeling like such a failure. ‘We’ve cut down on the amount we eat. ‘In the morning we share two pasties and drink coffee in Wetherspoons, which gives free refills. For dinner we split a baguette from a local bakery.’ A spokeswoman for Warrington council said they couldn’t comment on individual cases, but insisted they offered a wide range of support for people in need of accommodation in the area. This includes information on social and private housing, loans, bonds and tenancy workshops, she added.","Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been evicted from their two-bed flat .

"As usual, I have high hopes for my Mother’s Day bouquet tomorrow. My three teenage children know how I adore fresh flowers and, as I never buy them for myself, my annual bunch — delivered to my bedside with a trio of shy grins and breakfast on a tray — is always a real treat. This year, I’m holding out for a posy of peonies and blush roses, or perhaps a hand-tied bouquet of wildflowers from the expensive florist down the road. But if my children have cottoned on to the latest floral trend, this year’s bouquet might be a little different. Scroll down for video . Can you tell the difference?: Department store John Lewis said sales of fakes has risen by 71 per cent from last year - so Annael Cole has challenged to top florist to find out if they can look as good as the real thing . For according to John Lewis, sales of artificial flowers are soaring, with customers snapping up plastic and silk blooms instead of real stems. In the run-up to this weekend, the store has seen a 71 per cent increase in sales of fake bunches, compared with the same time last year. As someone who relishes the scent of real flowers, I’m astounded. If my children tiptoed into my bedroom with a bunch of plastic roses — as found in dodgy hotels and cheap Chinese restaurants — I’d be crestfallen. They remind me of my husband’s great-grandmother, who used them to cover damp patches on her tablecloths or of sad seaside B&Bs in the Seventies. All the ones I’ve come across haven’t been a patch on the real thing. However, florists say artificial flowers have greatly improved in recent years, with new, realistic designs. They use them in weddings and high-end events, with displays made to look and feel exactly like freshly-cut stems. So, is it really possible to fake a good bouquet? I challenged leading florist Andrew Devonport, co-owner and creative director of London’s Wildabout Flowers, to make up three identical pairs of Mother’s Day arrangements — one real, one fake — to see if I could tell the real blooms from their silk stand-ins ...","Florists across the country are preparing for a rush on flowers for Sunday .

"The internet's most infamous grandma, 86-year-old Baddie Winkle, has long been shocking  Instagram followers as she poses in swimsuits and risqué costumes - but now the octogenarian is looking to pop culture as her cue. Baddie, who first rose to fame in April last year when she first started up her controversial account, has been transformed into some of the world’s most iconic famous faces, from model Kate Moss to musician Kurt Cobain, as part of a new ad campaign. The latest shots, which see Baddie try on a number of guises, were taken by Danielle Levitt to launch Grit's new website, a Brooklyn-based creative agency. Scroll down for video... Super gran? Proving herself to be just as up-to-date with popular culture as any teen, Baddie Winkle poses as Kate Moss . With one look: Here, Baddie poses as muse and creative visionary Michelle Lamy . Down with the kids: Baddie may well be the only grandmother in the country who is familiar with Kim Kardashian . In a nod to both model Kate  and the Nirvana frontman Kurt's famous poses, the senior citizen dons a leopard print coat and is pictured puffing away on a cigarette. Then she slaps on bangles, heavy black eyeliner and a headscarf to turn into Michelle Lamy, designer Rick Owens' mysterious muse and wife. Baddie, whose real name is Helen Ruth Van Winkle, became an internet sensation last year after posting age-defying photos online. The great grandmother from Williamstown, Kentucky, now has more than 646,000 followers. Her Instagram updates usually include snaps of her smoking or performing other 'bad gal' antics. Purring: Baddie strikes a pose identifying as legendary musician Kurt Cobain . Impression: The octogenarian also posed for another shot as Michele Lamy, the wife, muse and creative mind behind fashion designer Rick Owens . 'On my way to steal your man': Baddie became an internet sensation after she started up her controversial Instagram account in April last year . While no doubt eager to capitalize on Baddie’s impressive online profile, the agency which commissioned the unique shoot also added that it was her no-nonsense attitude and air of confidence that really made the grandmother stand out as an ideal spokesperson and model. 'A true firecracker, Baddie first caught out eye on Instagram where the posts pictures of herself wearing tie-dye bathing suits and streetwear while telling off all the haters,’ a spokesperson explained. With thousands of followers and fans among the likes of Drake, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, Baddie is an inspiration and proof that energy, hustle and general badassed-ness don’t disappear with age.' Baddie, who also shares a great deal of video content via her Instagram account, has even been spotted wearing clothing with the slogan 'Stealing your man since 1928' scrawled across it, demonstrating to the world that she isn’t afraid what they think about her. Peace out! Baddie, who has her own website, says she enjoys her over-the-top persona and helping others . Poolside: The great-grandmother regularly posts shots of her in swimwear . Tie-dye: Some of her clothes have controversial slogans on them although this one's just about Chipotle . Earlier this year, she told DailyMail.com that her goals in 2015 were 'to continue to decide to be happy, eat more chocolate, try more new things and do a cool reality series on how to be a baddie!' The latest set of pictures shows Baddie certainly means business. 'I have something to look forward to each day and it helps to inspire others young and old. I get to make others laugh and not take life so seriously,' she added to DailyMail.com. 'I am absolutely amazed about the amount of publicity I have received from my postings. I am blown away but I love it and each day I look to see how many more followers I have received.

"British scientist David Nutt (above) has claimed the terminally ill should take hallucinogenic drug LSD. He said that the way we currently deal with death is to 'poison people with opiates' A British scientist has claimed the terminally ill should be given hallucinogenic drug LSD. David Nutt, a former government drug tsar, thinks that psychedelic trips might be able to lead to long-term benefits in a person’s thinking. The 63-year-old said that using the drug is the 'great unanswered question in neuroscience'. Professor Nutt was sacked from his job as the Government's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol. But he maintains that psychedelic trips might help terminally ill patients feel at one with the world. 'The way we deal with death is to poison people with opiates so that they can’t think,' The Independent reported him saying. 'But on LSD it’s as if they have died, as if they’ve gone out to another place. They exist beyond their body. 'That experience can give them a sense of perpetuity, of permanence, of being part of the cycle of life.' At a briefing in London this week, he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called 'the worst censorship in the history of science'. But having been turned down by 'classic funders', he raised the more than £32,000 on crowdfunding site Walacea.com. In the controversial study 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD. Early results are said to be 'exciting' but the full findings must wait until more funding can be found to complete the research. He compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the Catholic church's clampdown on pioneering Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in the 17th century. He said: 'The only comparable example is when the Catholic church banned the telescope in 1616. 'We've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years. 'Truly in terms of the amount of wasted opportunity, it's way greater than the banning of the telescope. This is a truly appalling level of censorship.' In the controversial study, 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD . The LSD study involved giving the volunteers injections of a 75 microgram dose of LSD before probing the activity of their brains. Two kinds of scans were used, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (Meg), which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain. None of the participants reported having a bad experience, but three described some anxiety and temporary paranoia. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, also from the Imperial College team, said the dose of LSD given to the volunteers was a 'tiny speck'. But he added: 'The effects are quite profound. It would be described as a moderate dose, but a moderate dose of LSD can still produce a profound state of consciousness. 'I wouldn't say that it's a dangerous experiment, but I would say that LSD has potential negative effects. 'Probably the crucial one is a bad trip. It's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience .. the experience can be nightmarish at times. 'What's especially intriguing.. is that people can have a very challenging experience yet afterwards they seem to be somehow psychologically refreshed by the experience. That's how they describe it.' He said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as LSD triggering psychosis in research studies, although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use. Professor Nutt said LSD was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism. Since it was made illegal in 1967 it had only been the subject of one clinical study in Switzerland and two neuroscience studies. 'That is an absurd amount of censorship,' Professor Nutt added. He stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the Government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and LSD were considerably less harmful than alcohol. 'Interesting drugs that we've been researching like MDNA (ecstasy) and LSD, are relatively low in terms of harms, considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol,' he said. 'But no research is done on them. 'The law is actually wrong. The law is supposed to be based on evidence of harm but isn't.' He maintained that the risks of taking LSD had been 'massively exaggerated' by the CIA and US Drug Enforcement Administration. Initial funding for the LSD study came from Imperial College and the Beckley Foundation, which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances. Professor Nutt said LSD (a molecule of the drug is pictured) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism . Professor Nutt said he approached the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust for the outstanding funding to no avail. 'The issue always comes 'well look, these are recreational drugs', and the recreational label is so powerful I think it scares people off,' he said. 'I personally think the neuroscience that's been uncovered by these drugs is revolutionary. 'This research is so important it should be funded to the tune of millions.' Dr Carhart-Harris said: 'This is the first LSD brain imaging study that's ever been conducted. 'We think it's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain. Once we've done that, we want to look at how these drugs can be put to good use.' A previous brain scanning study was carried out by the same team on volunteers under the influence of the magic mushroom active ingredient psilocybin. It showed that the drug affected the brain's 'hub structure' and led to more connections between regions that are not normally linked. This, it is thought, may have a bearing on creative thinking. In May, the team is planning a study, funded by the Medical Research Council, looking at how psilocybin might be helpful in treating depression.","David Nutt was sacked from his  chief adviser post five years ago .

"A Republican-led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attacks has formally asked Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton to deliver her now-famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination. The same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of 'close to a dozen' people who worked in the State Department for Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, the chairman of the U.S. House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Thursday. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, wrote to Clinton's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the State Department's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain – or at least archived by the government. He gave Clinton an April 3 deadline to make a decision, saying he would urge House Speaker John Boehner to take action if she ignores his request. 'Though Secretary Clinton alone is responsible for causing this issue, she alone does not get to determine its outcome,' Gowdy said in a statement. 'That is why in the interest of transparency for the American people, I am formally requesting she turn the server over.' HAND IT OVER: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy asked Hillary Clinton's lawyer on Friday to hand over her email server to a neutral third party for analysis . NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD: Mrs. Clinton dodged talk of her presidential ambitions on Thursday but a speech organizer gave her a 'Camp David' sweatshirt anyway . 'An independent analysis of the private server Secretary Clinton used for the official conduct of U.S. government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation. Having a neutral, third-party arbiter such as the State Department IG do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public.' Gowdy's committee has authority to subpoena documents and individual witnesses, but not pieces of computer hardware. That would require a criminal search warrant signed by a federal judge, and Clinton is not thought to be under investigation for any crime. The hard-charging former prosecutor had told Reuters earlier on Friday that aides to Clinton and perhaps 'aides to aides' would find themselves subpoenaed. 'We sent a subpoena to the State Department for emails from a number of individuals within the State Department, other than Secretary Clinton,' Gowdy, a Republican, said in a phone interview with the news service. Separately, pressure mounted Friday on the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six- and seven-figure donors – many of whom, it has been revealed, have ties to foreign governments. Former President Bill Clinton had promised the Obama administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state. But a Wall Street Journal investigation has established that it willingly accepted large contributions from more than a dozen foundations and companies and people who might be surrogates for overseas regimes. They included a member of the Saudi royal family, a 'Ukrainian oligarch' who once served in the nation's parliament, and many government-linked businessmen, according to the Journal. Overall, the twelve gave between $34 million and $68 million after Hillary took over the State Department. Exact numbers can't be gleaned from available documents – only ranges. The Ukrainian could be problematid for Mrs. Clinton because it involves millions from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, run by a businessman who has been a strong advocate of his country establishing closer ties with the European Union. Pinchuk also served two terms in Ukraine's parliament. Much of his foundation's donated funds came to the Clinton Foundation while the State Department was pushing for Europe, and against Russia, as a dominant force in Ukraine. It's unclear whether the foundation flap or 'email-gate' will prove the greater irritant to Mrs. Clinton's growing presidential campaign momentum. But a New York Times report this month that she had exclusively used a personal email account for government business while the chief U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the Benghazi committee's investigation into the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton is the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy. She has come under scrutiny from Republicans who accuse her State Department of failing to protect diplomatic personnel. Gowdy said the State Department had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought. Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, insists he's not interested in Clinton's private communications, but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 Benghazi terror attack outside the reach of government document-retention mandates . EMAIL-GATE: Clinton has been dogged by accusations that she hid work-related emails from the State Department by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home . But without their emails, he has argued, no congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attack could claim to have issued a definitive report. On Thursday Mrs. Clinton said Washington politics has become too partisan, appearing at a national meeting of camp counselors. She told the American Camp Association in her final paid speech before an expected presidential announcement that America's political class could use 'camps for adults' to foster cooperation. PRESSURE: Time magazine gave Mrs. Clinton 'devil horns' on this week's cover . Meeting organizers presented her with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with 'Camp David' – the presidential retreat in Maryland –  but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign, pointing to a 'huge fun deficit' in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle. 'We really need camps for adults,' Clinton said. 'Maybe mix it up a little bit' so Americans 'have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?' As she faces partisan criticism over the email mess, Clinton has said that although she should have used a government email account, she violated no rules. Democrats say that Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that Gowdy's committee's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining Clinton's expected presidential candidacy. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters the committee 'has spent millions of dollars; produced nothing. I think we're going to just see an ongoing attempt to investigate Hillary Clinton, whatever the subject, whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be.' Gowdy spoke to Reuters on the same day Senator Charles Grassley sent letters to Secretary of State John Kerry and the State Department's inspector general asking for information on the emails of Huma Abedin, who was a top aide to Clinton. Grassley said he was probing Clinton's use of a program that let some of Clinton's allies, including Abedin, do private sector work while also working for the government. Gowdy said he was not coordinating his probe with Grassley, and rejected any suggestion that the State Department might become overworked with requests for information about Clinton and her aides. The revelations about Clinton's emails have raised questions about the State Department's email practices. ANY DAY NOW: Hillary is expected to annoucne her presidential campaign launch in a matter of weeks . Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, predicted Republicans would keep pressure on, 'whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be' Earlier on Thursday, U.S. officials said the State Department does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state, contradicting the department's prior public statement. Gowdy said no decisions had been made in the House of Representatives about when Clinton would be called to testify, either about her email use or about the Benghazi events. He had said earlier that he hoped to call Clinton to testify in April. On Thursday Gowdy said the slowness of responses to his requests for information from Clinton and the State Department had delayed that timetable. He said he wanted all relevant documents before she appears. The Benghazi Select Committee also subpoenaed all communications of Clinton's related to Libya this month, but neither Clinton nor the State Department have produced documents in response to the subpoenas, Gowdy said. Earlier the State Department gave the committee 300 of Clinton's emails related to Benghazi. Trey Gowdy letter to Hillary Clinton's lawyer about email server uploaded by DailyMail.com .","Rep.

"Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet, just a day after his children's cookbook was delayed amid fears the recipes could stunt the growth of babies. His school visit comes as it was claimed negative comments about his diet are being deleted from his official Facebook page, meaning only positive and supportive feedback is published. Despite the Public Health Association of Australia expressing concerns that 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way' cookbook could cause the death of infants, Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet . 'We had the best time this morning with the grade 5 and 6 kids cooking thai chicken cakes with cucumber, avo, lettuce and corriander,' 'Paleo Pete' posted on his Facebook page. 'We also cooked mighty meaty muffins with loadsa vegies and some chia seed and coconut puddings. Nothing I love more than seeing kids learning new skills!' On Wednesday, it was announced that the release of Evan's paleo cookbook for children had been delayed due to grave concerns about the nutritional value of recipes in the book. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way, is the joint venture of celebrity chef and My Kitchen Rules judge Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. The Public Health Association of Australia said that one of the recipes- a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth- had the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The criticism comes amid claims comments on Evans' Facebook page expressing negative sentiments over the paleo lifestyle are being deleted. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes . Daria, a health professional, posted on 'Blocked by Evans' after she had comments deleted and was blocked from his official Facebook page . After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. An ironic Twitter account mocked Evans visit to the school despite the controversy surrounding the book . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. 'I think banning and blocking people who are questioning, asking questions and discussing comments that are genuine and polite is dangerous because it creates an environment where one person controls what information is visible,' Daria said. 'Pete Evans has blocked many health professionals and professional bodies from his page. These are people who unlike him have extensive training, clinical experience and access to scientific evidence about health,' she said. 'I would think their skills would be respected by someone who wants to improve societies health. Its important to promote trust and dialogue between medical and health professionals and the public.'

Following claims in December last year that comments were being deleted from the page, three social media users launched a response page 'Blocked by Pete Evans' to address what they saw as a dangerous trend of blocking genuine discussion. Gabrielle, one of the moderators of the page, said that many people had been blocked from Pete Evan's official page, most of whom were enquiring for more information about the specifics of the diet. 'I and most of the individuals on this page where blocked for simply asking a question that challenged paleo ideology or posting a scientific journal paper link that disproved claims being made,' Gabrielle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We have been accused of being ""trolls"". However simply asking a question in a civil manner is not trolling. I have only ever commented on his page once and I was blocked,' she said. Gabrielle said that several health professionals even had their accounts 'pre-blocked'. 'A couple of dietitians who have their own blogs wrote open letters asking Pete to stop tarnishing our profession and for this they were pre blocked without even writing on his wall,' she said. 'It is very sad when someone who claims to know all the answers cannot even answer to health professionals.' Gabrielle said that she had even seen instances of 'tribe followers' asking for advice on ailments and being berated by users, or having their comments deleted. 'In the instance where a health professional has suggested they visit a doctor it is also deleted, which as you can imagine is a a great concern for the health of the individual reaching out.'

Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'","Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way was set for release on Friday March 13 .

"A young woman lies in a pool of blood alongside her newborn baby on the dusty floor of an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. The Makeni unit is where West Africans believe they go to die, not 'to be born or to live', said British doctor James Meiring, who found the new mother. But in a place that's notorious for death and suffering, Dr Meiring's quick-thinking paid off and both mother and baby have survived. And the newborn's name? Doctor James, of course. Scroll down for video . Doctor James: This newborn was named after the doctor who helped saved him when he was born in an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone . Ebola worker: Dr James Meiring from Sheffield has been working at the Makeni treatment unit since February . Dr Meiring, 30, from Sheffield, is a married father-of-one who travelled to Sierra Leone last month to help halt the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, which has already claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people. He is  an infectious diseases trainee at Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, but spent five weeks as an International Medical Corps volunteer  at the Makeni treatment unit between February 6 and March 15. The centre was built by the British Army, funded by the UK government, and has so far screened more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus. Tragically, just 32 of those recovered. Dr Meiring has described in detail the morning of little Doctor James' birth after a 'fairly brutal' night shift earlier this month. 'There had been seven deaths in the day and two more overnight,' he said. 'That was my purpose for being in the red zone. 'Confirming death is one of the least enjoyable aspects of a doctor's responsibility. Here, confirming death is increasingly harrowing. 'Patients prefer to lie directly on the concrete floor, maybe it is cooler, which then involves continuously washing off not only layers of dust, but dust caked in their own bloody body fluids.' Mother and baby: Memunatu Kamara and her newborn tested negative for Ebola and were discharged earlier this month . Dr James Meiring dons his personal protective equipment before entering the high risk area of the International Medical Corps' Ebola treatment unit . He added: 'They lie, rigor mortis already setting in, in whatever position they happened to be in prior to passing. 'This particular morning my grim responsibility was thankfully complete. Shortly after this however, an employed Ebola survivor came running out of the suspect ward. 'The eight-month-pregnant lady was no longer pregnant.' Dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE), Dr Meiring re-entered the high-risk zone and found the young woman, Memunatu Kamara, on the ground under a blanket. Concealed under the simple piece of fabric was her newborn baby in an increasing puddle of blood. 'With my own heart rate rapidly increasing I was blessed by the imminent arrival of a far more competent national nurse carrying a birthing pack,' he said. 'With some hastily shouted orders over the fence, I scooped up baby and deposited him on to mum. 'Baby was quiet and a little blue. Now, I had seen on television that if you give them a rather firm rub they start to shriek; which he did right on cue. 'Without any prior experience of what I was about to undertake, I clamped the cord, cut it, delivered the placenta, checked it was all intact, gave her some oxytocin and massaged her tummy.' Lucky: A young woman was found on the ground under a blanket, which concealed this beautiful newborn baby . Medical staff wait to be disinfected after leaving a high-risk zone at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone . Soon the baby was wrapped up, the bleeding stopped and the woman was taken away to be cleaned up. 'The whole experience actually went just as it should have done,' Dr Meiring said. 'Just as it has done for millenia, across the world, thousands upon thousands of times. 'Except this, of course, was not like all those other times because unbeknownst to this little bundle of joy, he had arrived into the world in the middle of an Ebola ward.' International Medical Corps is one of a handful of international non-governmental organisations that is treating Ebola patients in West Africa. It is currently operating four Ebola treatment centres – two in Liberia and two in Sierra Leone – which provide not only isolation and care for Ebola patients, but also psychosocial support. To expand the pool of health workers capable of managing and working in emergency treatment units across the region, International Medical Corps is providing high-quality training for local staff, other partners and organisations in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola management training centres have been opened. To date, International Medical Corps has trained more than 620 local and international  staff who are now helping combat this outbreak in West Africa. In addition, it is working to find ways to strengthen local non-Ebola health care capacity. 'This is where people believe they come to die, not to be born or to live,' he added. 'His cord was cut by the double-gloved hand of a nervous British medic in a suffocating yellow suit. 'The reality is that mum was a suspected Ebola patient and if positive, then he was almost certainly positive too.' After the ordeal, Dr Meiring joked with the mother that she could call the baby James. To his surprise, Memunatu gave her newborn the title of Doctor James Bangura. The centre was built by the British Army, funded by the UK government, and has so far screen more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus. Tragically, just 32 of those recovered and were discharged . Hope: The survivor wall at the Makeni treatment unit. Each hand print represents a life saved by the medical team . Subsequently, both mother and baby tested negative for Ebola and were discharged soon after. 'Having begun his existence in such desperate surroundings you might think that things can only get better,' Mr Meiring added. One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms. The World Health Organization said Ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured. Ebola causes hemorrhagic fever and induces internal and external bleeding, profuse vomiting and diarrhoea. The world's worst Ebola epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people in total in the three most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since March 2014 when it was first confirmed in the forest region of Guinea. Ebola cases in Sierra Leone have dropped sharply from a peak of more than 500 in December to around 50 cases a week, helped by British military assistance. From tomorrow, the entire population will stay at home for three days on the order of president Ernest Koroma in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. It comes as a goal is set for cutting off the spread of the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by April 16. Liberia previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic  but a new case appeared in its capital Monrovia last week. The infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease, it has been reported. Thousands of people still remain at risk of Ebola in Sierra Leone and International Medical Corps is on the ground treating patients.

"A Buddha statue containing a mummified monk was actually stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts have claimed. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after a private owner took the statue to a museum in the Netherlands to be restored. While there Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, discovered the 1,000-year-old mummy and said it was Buddhist master Zhang Liuquan, People's Daily Online reported. Scroll down for video . A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was actually stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts have claimed . The Cultural Relics Bureau in Fujian has now found photos and historical records suggesting the statue was actually stolen from eastern China in 1995. The private owner, who wants to stay anonymous, bought the relic in 1996 at a European market. During the CT scan Mr Bruijn was particularly shocked to discover the monk's organs had been removed. Rolls of paper scraps covered in Chinese writing were also found. If the Cultural Relics Bureau succeed in its investigation it will seek repatriation of the statue. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after a private owner took the statue to Drents Museum at the Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands for restoration. Above, the museum completes a CT scan . The Cultural Relics Bureau in Fujian has now found photos and historical records suggesting the statue was stolen from eastern China in 1995. Above, it is wrapped in white material and examined in February . The remains were due to be put on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015. They have now been pulled after Drents Museum at the Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands, which completed the CT scan and endoscopy, requested they were no longer used. Many practising Buddhists believe that mummies  are not actually dead but are in an advanced state of meditation. To achieve mummification monks drank a special herbal tea believing it could stop their corpse from rotting for thousands of years, experts from Fuzhou Ethnicity and Religion Bureau said. In January mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia. Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, determined the mummy dated back to the 11th or 12th century and was Buddhist master Liuquan. Above, a scientist examines the base of the statue . The human relic is believed to be around 200 years old and was preserved in animal skin. Initial speculation is that it could be Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, a teacher of Lama. Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, born in 1852, was a Buryat Buddhist Lama of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, best known for the lifelike state of his body.","Mummified remains in the statue discovered at the end of February .

"After encouraging fellow TV hosts to all wear the controversial 'penis jacket' during Thursday morning news broadcasts, Today show host Lisa Wilkinson failed to deliver on her promise to wear the clothing item during the  show - while ABC's Virginia Trioli rose to the challenge instead. Wilkinson urged other news and television personalities to wear the phallic shaped Scanlan and Theodore jacket in a bid to reclaim the item of clothing as a legitimate wardrobe choice, following the controversy surrounding a Network 10 presenter wearing it on air. On Wednesday, the Today show co-host laughed off the online frenzy prompted by Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe. Scroll down for video . Today show star Lisa Wilkinson failed to wear the 'penis jacket' like she urged her fellow TV hosts to do . Wilkinson appeared in an outfit distinctly sans-phallic neckline, wearing a navy and beige top for the show . 'The #p***sjacket! REALLY? Calling all TVhosts who have this jacket to wear it on air tomorrow. I will! #geez,' Wilkinson tweeted to her 125,000 followers. However, Wilkinson appeared in an outfit distinctly sans-phallic neckline, wearing a navy and beige top for the Thursday morning show. 'I realized [sic] at 3am this morning that I'd put my #penisjacket in for dry cleaning after wearing it last week. Big #LisaFail,' she tweeted, after a Today show fan pointed out her attire. Wilkinson wasn't the only television personality to dodge the jacket, as neither Sunrise's Natalie Barr and Samantha Armytage wore the infamous jacket. ABC News Breakfast host Virginia Trioli appeared to be the only news anchor willing to answer Wilkinson's call, sporting a lemon jacket with a very similar neckline for the Thursday morning broadcast. The original jacket which caused the social media uproar was designed by Australian label Scanlan Theodore and previously worn by Channel Seven’s Melissa Doyle in a fetching cream shade. And the ‘Crepe Knit Double Peplum Jacket’, costing $550 is still available to buy on Scanlan Theodore’s website, after Doyle wore the design five days ago. ABC News host Virginia Trioli appeared to be the only news anchor willing to answer Wilkinson's call . Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same . 'Once you see it, you cannot unsee it...': This photo of Natarsha Belling's green jacket has been shared thousands of times online (left) after Melissa Doyle wore a similar jacket earlier in the year . However, Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket with the much talked about neckline, clinched at the waist by a belt, back in May. Belling’s green jacket went viral after she wore it to present Network Ten's Eyewitness News and a photo of the outfit was then liked over 110,000 times on Facebook after the website Unilad posted the caption ‘once you see it, you cannot unsee it’. The image has also been shared over 7,000 times as the comments over Belling’s outfit rage on. But phallic looking necklines are nothing new, as a 2010 photo of the ABC's Leigh Sales in a more extreme black number shows, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Sales wore the cut out top while presenting Lateline and an eagle-eyed viewer uploaded a video of the clip to YouTube with the crude caption: 'ABC Lateline newsreader Leigh Sales wears a penis.' The bemusement and fascination with Belling's top appears to stem from the fact when you first look at the photo it’s hard to notice anything – but once the neckline’s shape is pointed out it’s hard to 'unsee' it. Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket  back in May 2014 . The ABC's Leigh Sales was previously accused of 'wearing a penis' when she donned this black top .

And Lourens Odendaal realised: ‘Ooo that’s what it was… now I get it.’ Meanwhile, on Reddit, one commentator mused: ‘I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster about to burst from her chest.’ American anchor Dion Lim showed her support for Belling with the hashtag #anchorproblems . The Channel Ten news presenter wore the green jacket with a pearl necklace at one point (left). Dion Lim (right) said people are reading 'way too much into this' And another added: ‘I thought it was the slight crease in her v neck on the right side, yet the top was the same length… I was sure it wasn’t that so came to the comments. ‘I guess this means I'm growing up, because five years ago I’d see this straight away.’ On Tuesday, Belling received support from a fellow news anchor after the sartorial buzz reached the United States. Reporter Dion Lim, who reports for the Ten News channel in Tampa, Florida, wrote: 'Oh c'mon. People ur reading too much into this! Anchor wears ""phallic"" jacket #anchorproblems.'

"A couple who have spent their life savings on three unsuccessful rounds of IVF have been given hope of starting a family after total strangers donated thousands of dollars to help pay their medical costs. Melanie and Joseph Cassar, from St Clair, Sydney, feared their dream of becoming parents was over after the last IVF cycle failed. Insisting they would never give up hope, they have now started a crowd-funding website to raise $8,500 to undergo a fourth treatment. Scroll down for video . Melissa (picured left) and Joseph Cassa(pictured right) have undergone three unsuccessful IVF treatments but haven't given up on being parents yet . ‘I feel an empty void in my life that I'm destined to be a mum, and Joe a dad, but we need help,’ Ms Cassar explained on the website. Ms Cassar said she knew at age 18 that the road to fertility would be tough after learning that she had polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Doctors explained her ovaries were irregular and covered in cysts, making it difficult to produce eggs capable of fertilisation. ‘I did all the tests and they said your only option is IVF' Ms Cassar told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Cassar has undergone three full IVF treatments and said it costs around $8,500 each time, with Medicare returning $5,000. 12,000 babies were born using IVF in Australia last year but Ms Cassa says doctors can give  no guarantees the treatment will work . Ms Cassa’s passion for children prompted her to start running a day care but she says this only makes her desire to be a mother stronger . Out of pocket expenses for IVF treatment have increased from around $1,500 per cycle to $3,500, with new changes meaning couples must spend at least $2,000 to qualify for the Medicare safety net. Mr Cassar says it’s been ‘heartbreaking’ to watch his wife go through the treatments without getting the child they have coveted for so long. 'There are no guarantees with IVF,’ Ms Cassar explained. ‘It’s an emotional rollercoaster. You always try to look at the positives but sometimes when you get your hopes up, they just crash,’ she added. Try and try again: Seven months on from their last attempt at IVF the couple are ready to give it another shot . After running out of money to spend on the treatments Ms Cassar said her family and friends asked her how they could donate, prompting her to create the gofundme.com appeal. With $1,455 raised in only 8 days the couple remain hopeful that 'this year might be our year' Support is pouring in with anonymous donations of up to $300 from strangers who would like nothing more than to see a healthy baby in the couples arms. The couple say although they have experienced more hardships than they imagined, they won't give up on their dream of having a healthy child of their own. ‘As much as we can afford, we will keep going.’ To donate or read more about their story visit: www.gofundme.com/nbr708 .

"A boat of delighted tourists had their holidays made, when a grey whale and her baby surfaced for a kiss during their vacation. The barnacle-encrusted sea giants were calmly swimming around the boat to the excited shrieks of watching tourists in San Igancio Lagoon in Baja California, Mexico. One lucky woman bravely leaned down to kiss the baby whale who surfaced and seemed happy to nuzzle the passengers on board the boat. The friendly grey whales migrate to the San Ignacio Lagoon to breed and give birth each year. Their trip is one of the longest migrations undertaken by a mammal, covering 12,430 miles (20,000 kilometres). The good-natured seafaring giants are not afraid of humans and commonly swim right up to human visitors, who can bravely plant a kiss on the heads of the huge 40-ton sea mammals.

One brave tourist leans in to kiss the baby who is clearly loving all the attention . Source: National Geographic . The 45-foot creatures have a designated area set aside for them by the Mexican authorities, where boats can't go, allowing them to raise their offspring in peace if they wish. However the whale families are known to enjoy the attention from visiting tourist boats, and will even let people rub their tongues or kiss their heads. Mothers have even been known to raise their calves out of the water on her back to they can be closer to the boats. The footage comes after the recent tragic death of a woman who was thrown over board as a grey whale breached and hit her boat in Mexico. Two other people received 'considerable' injuries but are expected to survive. The tragedy highlights the dangers of the tourist attraction, and serves as a warning for those wanting to get up close and personal to the giant creatures. Previous to the accident, it had been announced by Mexican authorities that the grey whale population is unusually large this breeding season in the area.","The adorable moment of a brave grey whale baby being kissed by tourists .

"Damning figures today expose the extent of the ‘justice deficit’ for victims of rape. Only one in four reported rape cases is passed on to prosecutors, who then decide whether to press charges, data shows. The figures, published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, also reveal worrying differences between forces across England and Wales in how often officers mark down cases as ‘no crime’. Low figures: Some areas saw prosecutions in only one in five reported rape cases (picture posed by model) In some areas, the number of ‘no crime’ cases is as high as one in five, the inspectorate’s Rape Monitoring Group found. Victims’ groups condemned the ‘postcode lottery’ and said that despite police efforts, the experience of victims is not improving. Mark Castle, of Victim Support, said it revealed an ‘unacceptable culture of disbelief’ in some areas. He said: ‘It is extremely concerning that in some parts of England and Wales a rape allegation is four times more likely to be rejected than in others. ‘While there can be legitimate reasons to record a rape allegation as ""no crime"", these figures suggest an unacceptable culture of disbelief continues to exist in some parts of the police.’ Katie Russell, of Rape Crisis, said the data showed ‘no improvement’ in victims’ overall experience of the legal system. Worried: Victim Support chief executive Mark Castle called the low prosecution figures very 'concerning' She added: ‘There’s still a huge justice deficit for those who experience sexual violence offences compared to those who suffer other kinds of crime.’ The figures showed huge discrepancies between forces’ ‘no criming’ rates. This is when an offence is initially recorded as rape but then on further consideration it is decided no crime took place. Victims have complained that 'no criming' has been used by police as a way of improving their statistics. On average, around 9 per cent of adult rape cases were marked down as no crime. But in Leicestershire that figure was nearly one in five. At the other end of the scale it was about 2 per cent for Gloucestershire Constabulary. The 43 forces in England and Wales recorded 20,727 alleged rapes in 2013/14. Of those, 12,952 involved adult victims and 7,775 children, the HMIC data shows. In the same period, 5,850 were referred to prosecutors – around 28 per cent. The slight time delay between a case being reported and sent on to the CPS means the figures will not cover exactly the same cases. Nicole Westmarland, a professor of criminology at Durham University, said: ‘Today’s figures provide stark evidence of the inconsistent policing of rape, and the disservice that is being done to those who decide to report to the police.’ She said there was ‘no good reason why such large numbers are not being referred from the police to the CPS for consideration’. Martin Hewitt, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘There are caveats to this data. 'Comparing the number of rapes reported to the police with the number of convictions oversimplifies a long and complex process, in which a criminal conviction is not always possible or the desired outcome for victims.’","Worrying differences between forces  in recording of 'no crime' cases .

"A care worker accidentally killed herself by overdosing on sickness tablets after drinking fruit liqueurs and Jagerbombs on a date, an inquest heard. Joanne Dowsett had been drinking for hours when she returned to her parents' home in Stockport last October. Having downed ten shots of Sourz and rum and Cokes, the 20-year-old care worker took anti-nausea pills at around 3am, causing her to collapse and suffer a seizure. She was found dead the following afternoon at 4pm having rowed with her parents after being accused of taking drugs, an inquest into her death heard. Joanne Dowsett died after consuming a cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills. The 20-year-old had 'no intention of taking her own life,' an inquest heard . On the night in question, Miss Dowsett had been in several pubs and bars with Joshua Beaumont on a date. The pair drank Jagerbombs, beer, rum and Coke and shots before Mr Beaumont walked her home. Giving evidence, the 22-year-old said Miss Dowsett had been acting normally when he bid her goodnight. 'Jo seemed to be fine, she wasn't slurring her words or falling,' he said. 'She asked me to walk her home and said she would phone me a cab from her house. We stood on the drive chatting together and we were discussing about going out again . 'She didn’t seem to be particularly drunk.' After being collected from her parents' house in a taxi, Mr Beamont said the pair continued to talk over text. Shortly before 3am, Miss Dowsett told him she was going to bed before phoning another friend, Samuel Higginbotham. The 20-year-old care worker returned to her parents' house in Stockport where they rowed over her 'erratic behaviour', it was claimed . Joshua Beaumont said Miss Dowsett did not seem unwell when he left her at her parents' house to get a taxi . During their conversation she told him she had just rowed with her parents. John and Ann Dowsett were worried their daughter had been taking drugs after seeing her behave 'erratically', it was claimed. 'She was at home and couldn't sleep and knew I would be up. I asked about the date and she didn't go in to great detail,' Mr Higginbotham said. 'She said her mum and dad came in after the date and she told them to leave. There was nothing else in the phone call that rang alarm bells or made me feel the need to ring her back.' In text messages to others Miss Dowsett had given mixed accounts of the date, telling some she was eager to see Mr Beaumont again and others that she wasn't interested. 'She said to some the date had been great and to others saying it had been less than great,' said Det Insp Cheryl Hughes of Greater Manchester Police. 'Within texts to a friend by the name of Ben she explains the altercation with her parents where she had been accused of taking drugs but she said she hadn't had any drugs. 'Clearly Joanne had mixed emotions about the date where she is not telling the truth to each person she had contact with. 'Her behaviour in the early hours was erratic and gave rise to concern by her parents. 'We found no evidence she wanted to take her own life, in fact texts indicated she was going out for drinks on the Saturday night and she gave Mr Beaumont the impression they were going on another date.' The 20-year-old had fatal traces of the drug in her system. Police said there was no indication that she intended to take her own life . In text messages sent the night before she died, Miss Dowsett arranged to meet friends for drinks and a second date with Mr Beaumont . At 4pm the following day she was found face down in her bedroom. A toxicology report indicated she was just over the drink drive limit and had fatal amounts of cyclizine in her system. The drug is often prescribed to treat nausea and travel sickness. After searching her bedroom investigators discovered she had taken a substantial number of the pills. 'Whether it was deliberate or an accumulation is more difficult to assess. Fatality is very rare,' said toxicologist Julie Evans. While Miss Dowsett had been drinking, a pathologist concluded she died as a result of the cocktail of drugs and alcohol. Recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner John Pollard said: 'She had taken alcohol for the buzz effect and one does hear of youngsters taking fairly prodigious amounts these days but I don’t think she did anything unusual in the amount she took while she was out. 'Then you link that with the cyclizine. She has taken them to stop her feeling sick and an unintended outcome was they connected with the alcohol and have been more than her body can cope with.'","Joanne Dowsett died after taking cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills .

"Less than 24 hours after he was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, Prince George met his grandparents for the first time. But the first arrivals were not the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the Lindo Wing were Michael and Carole Middleton - better known to George as 'Grandpa Michael' and 'Granny Carole'. Almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away, the Middletons have become a fixture in little George's life - with Prince Charles left to complain that they 'never let me see my grandson'. Scroll down for video . March of the Middletons: Prince Charles is reportedly upset by what he calls 'the March of the Middletons' In this case, the heir to the throne may well have a point. Visits to Highgrove, Charles' Gloucestershire home, have been few and far between. By contrast, William and Kate regularly take their son to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the Middletons live in a £4.5m Georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside. Indeed, it was to Bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the Lindo Wing, with Prince George's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather Michael. The intimate photos, which show George cradled in the arms of his smiling mother, were, with hindsight, a sign of things to come. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, was always determined to be a hands-on grandmother - and so it has proved. First visitors: Carole and Michael Middleton were the first people to meet the newborn Prince George . Sign of things to come: His first official photo was taken on the lawn of the Middletons' Bucklebury home . But the Middleton matriarch's determination to be involved in her grandson's life hasn't always gone down well with the rest of the family. 'Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats,' confided a source to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare. 'All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.' So how much involvement does Carole have in George's life? The answer is plenty. From cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child, there are few areas of George's life in which the Middletons aren't involved. Just a few weeks ago, Carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in Mustique, where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday. Although nanny Maria Theresa Borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare, Carole, who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson, was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand-in-hand with a toddling George. Holiday: George and his parents often holiday with the Middletons, seen here en route to Mustique . 'Queen Carole': Sources say Carole is taking an increasing amount of control over Prince George's life . Involved: Carole, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, is said to be a hands-on grandmother to George . And that is far from the only occasion that Carole has enjoyed one-on-one time with George. Just before the trip to Mustique, the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer's market with the third-in-line, who was, say witnesses, 'trying all the food'. Speaking to People Magazine, another onlooker told of Carole's obvious pride in her grandson's progress. 'It was just really, really sweet. He was just being like a normal toddler is, running around and exploring – he is such a sweetie. He's lovely. A real bundle of fun. 'She [Carole] just keeps telling people ""He's gorgeous, isn't he?"" like any other grandmother would say about their little one.' The Middletons also joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their infant son at Anmer Hall on Christmas Day where, according to sources, Kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get-togethers. Carole's influence could also be seen in the plans for George's first birthday celebrations which, in a break with royal tradition, included a Peter Rabbit themed party. Not amused: Charles is said to dislike what he sees as his 'peripheral' role in Prince George's life . Loving: This framed photograph of Charles and George has pride of place at Clarence House . Contrast that with Prince William's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny Barbara Barnes because his parents were on tour in Canada. Charles' first year was marked in a similar way, with the Prince of Wales spending the day at Clarence House without either of his parents, although the Duke of Edinburgh, then stationed in Malta, did send a model plane. William, who has made no secret of the fact that he wants his son to have a 'normal' upbringing, is happy to spend time with the Middletons, with whom he has long been close. Something similar to his fractured childhood, which despite the best efforts of both his parents, was blighted by their divorce and, later, his mother's death, is not what he wants for George. Instead, having seen the happy home created for Kate and her siblings by Carole and Michael, he is more than happy to allow them into his son's life. 'Kate’s got a very, very close family,' he said happily, at the time of their engagement. 'Mike and Carole have been really loving and caring and fun. 'They have been welcoming towards me so I’ve felt a part of the family.' So is George and so will the new baby become. But what does that mean for Charles? Despite his complaints about the 'March of the Middletons', the Prince of Wales has 'an excellent relationship' with his grandson, albeit one that is partly dictated by the vanishingly small number of gaps in his busy schedule. When he does see the baby prince, Charles is by all accounts a hands-on grandfather - not just to George but to Camilla's grandchildren as well. Different: William is said to want a less formal childhood for his son than the one he enjoyed . Happy: William has a close relationship with the Middletons, in particular with father-in-law Michael . For evidence of that, look no further than the touching photos that emerged of Charles last summer, where the heir to the throne was pictured with one of Camilla's grandchildren clinging to his leg during a visit to the Highland Games. More evidence of Charles' hands-on approach to grandparenting came when photos of a meeting a in Clarence House drawing room showed a picture of George given pride of place on a sideboard. Charles also greeted the news of a second grandchild with delight, excitedly telling journalists that 'It's wonderful to be a grandfather again. He added: 'I'm looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a girl this time.' But whether girl or boy, there's no doubt that Carole and Michael Middleton will once again be heavily involved in their new grandchild's life. Perhaps, with the prospect of two young children to enjoy, Charles and Camilla will be too.","Charles is said to have complained to friends about not seeing George .

"Families will enjoy the biggest boost to their finances for more than a decade as inflation is set to tumble to zero while wages rise. Inflation has already plunged to 0.3 per cent – its lowest level since 1960 – after a big fall in the cost of essentials such as food and fuel. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney told Parliament yesterday that it would ‘likely fall further to around zero in the coming months, and remain near there for much of the year’. Scroll down for video . Mark Carney said prices were likely to remain flat for the rest of the year because of falling prices of oil and food . The Bank also forecasts that real post-tax income is expected to rise by 3.5 per cent this year as the long squeeze on living standards comes to an end. That means British households can expect their biggest boost in spending power since 2001, experts say. Chancellor George Osborne hopes that the easing pressure on family finances and the continuing economic recovery will help the Conservatives at May’s general election. Tory strategists believe the party’s move ahead of Labour in recent opinion polls shows more voters are starting to feel the benefits of the economic turnaround. Labour planned to make a ‘cost of living crisis’ a major election issue, but the news seems to support Conservative claims that their economic plan is working. Last night the Treasury hailed Mr Carney’s inflation forecast as ‘good news’ for households. Mr Carney, giving evidence to the House of Lords economic affairs committee, said: ‘The combination of rising wages and weak headline inflation will strengthen household finances and boost real take-home pay growth this year to the fastest rate in a decade. In turn, this will support continued solid growth in consumer spending.’ Inflation has already hit the lowest level on record - hitting just 0.3 per cent in January - but Mr Carney said it would be 'extremely foolish' to slash interest rates to try to get inflation back to its target rate of 2 per cent . Mr Carney warned that interest rates are likely to rise at some point – but said that when that happens the increases will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’. Rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years. There has been speculation that the Bank could cut rates even further – towards zero – if inflation threatened to fall too far and turn into a dangerous bout of deflation. Such a move would spell misery for savers – who have already missed out on around £130billion in interest payments because of ultra-low rates – but would be welcomed by borrowers. But Mr Carney yesterday insisted that it would be ‘extremely foolish’ to cut rates to counter the uncontrollable fall in global oil prices. He said it would risk adding ‘unnecessary volatility in inflation’ and that he expects inflation to return to its 2 per cent target ‘within two years’. A report by the British Chambers of Commerce, published today, predicts interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent ‘no earlier’ than the first three months of next year. The BCC is also raising its UK growth forecasts from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent in 2016. That follows expansion of 2.6 per cent last year – when the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading nations. Growth is expected to pick up to 0.7 per cent in the first three months of this year following a 0.5 per cent rise in output in the final quarter of last year. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: ‘Businesses up and down the country are doing well despite international and domestic uncertainty. ‘While 2015 has got off to a good start, there is no room for complacency. The UK is still a long way from achieving the great, sustainable, long-term growth we want to see.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The latest economic forecasts from the BCC are yet further proof that our long-term economic plan is working, with the strongest growth of any major advanced economy last year and showing upgrades to UK growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016. But the BCC are right to say the job is not yet done so we must keep working through the plan that is delivering economic security in an uncertain world economy.’ Inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index was last at zero or below between December 1959 and March 1960, according to the Office for National Statistics.","Inflation hit 0.3% in January - already the lowest level on record .

"Babies conceived through IVF may be twice as likely to develop autism, according to new research. Children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body, including IVF, artificial insemination and surrogacy. During IVF - the most popular ART treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised, which can lead to multiple births. Babies conceived through IVF (pictured) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally, a study found. But this could be due to the complications of IVF, such as multiple births . Researchers explained they found an association between IVF and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder, according to HealthDay news. The higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with IVF, not the treatment itself, they said. After taking into account factors such as the mother's education and multiple births, researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old. And they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child. This means IVF using a single-egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism, experts said. The study involved nearly six million children born from 1997 to 2007. The team, led by Peter Bearman, a professor of social sciences at Columbia University in New York City, collected data on 5.9 million California births, including 48,865 infants conceived through assisted reproduction, and 32,922 children with autism. Autism is mainly caused by a child’s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King’s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. They compared the incidence of autism in births that involved advanced infertility treatment such as IVF and those that didn't. Professor Bearman said this was the largest study looking at this relationship that has ever been carried out. The results are not a condemnation of IVF technology, as the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link, he said. He added: 'There is an association between IVF and autism, but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use IVF, for example, age and social status, this association is lessened significantly,' The remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with IVF, he said. He added that there was no significant increased risk of the disorder for children of women who gave birth to one child. He said: 'Knowing that one can largely reduce the risk of autism by restricting the procedure to single-egg transfer is important for women who can then make better informed decisions.' The research was published online in the American Journal of Public Health. The news comes after a major study published this week found genetics are the main cause of a child's autism, not lifestyle. Scientists from King's College London said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution.

"New role? Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured leaving 10 Downing Street last week after attending the final cabinet meeting of this parliament . Theresa May is being lined up to become Foreign Secretary, tasked with clawing back powers from Brussels, it emerged today. David Cameron is said to be considering promoting the Home Secretary to lead the fight to overhaul Britain’s membership of the European Union. The Prime Minister has made clear that if he is returned to Downing Street after the election he wants talks on EU reform to begin immediately. The Tories are going into the election campaign as the only party promising to renegotiate EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has visited almost every European capital in a bid to build support for his call for reform. Now it has emerged that the Prime Minister is considering handing the plumb job to Mrs May, according to the Independent on Sunday. She would be seen as 'Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel', government sources say. Mr Cameron yesterday hailed Mrs May as a 'brilliant' Home Secretary who had cut crime and 'told Abu Hamza to sling his hook'. Foreign Office insiders insist there is growing support for the reforms called for by Mr Cameron. It includes curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending child benefit being exported to families overseas and tighter controls on families coming to Britain. Close ties with Mrs Merkel are seen as vital. 'Five years ago you could get a senior official to go to Paris or Washington but not Berlin,' a senior source told MailOnline. 'But now the relationship with Germany is on a more formal footing, and Merkel had made clear she wants us to stay.' However, securing agreement on a referendum after the election could prove difficult. Colleagues: PM David Cameron (left) hailed Mrs May (right) as a 'brilliant' Home Secretary who had cut crime . Lib Dems leader Nick Clegg accused the Tories of dancing a 'hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave'. Speaking at his campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, he said: 'We are unambiguous as a party that says ""yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law"". Many trips: Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has visited almost every European capital in a bid to build support for his call for EU reform . 'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy.' He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union. 'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services. 'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.'","Prime Minister wants to send one of his toughest negotiators into battle .

"Parents at Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster have claimed they were asked for a payment of £96 when joining year seven . The top state secondary school chosen by David Cameron for his daughter could face an official probe after claims it asked parents to pay a £120 donation when offering places. A form sent to teenagers given a sought-after place at Grey Coat Hospital School's sixth form asks them to say whether they accept the offer and then return the slip, along with a cheque  for the 'School Fund'. Parents at Grey Coat have also claimed they were asked for a payment of £96 when joining year seven. The request may breach school admission rules, which say state schools cannot request any type of financial contribution as part of the admission process. The situation may now be examined by the Office of the Schools Adjudicator. As Grey Coat Hospital School is an academy, the Education Funding Agency could also investigate the issue. The school has refused to comment over the allegations. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister spoke of his relief after learning that his daughter Nancy had secured a place at popular Westminster school. Mr Cameron said it was 'a weight off everybody's mind', adding: 'It's nerve-wracking enough watching your eldest go from junior to secondary school,' he said. 'Nancy has just found out she's got a place at good state secondary school in London. She's happy - because her best friend is going there. Sam and I are happy - because we know she'll be looked after and get a great education there.' The daughter of former education secretary Michael Gove also attends the popular Grey Coat Hospital School. It is understood that Mr Gove was not asked - and did not pay - any donation when his daughter was offered a place at the school. David and Samantha Cameron learned their daughter Nancy had won a place at the sought after Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster last week . The £120 donation to the 'School Fund' allows teachers to run extra-curricular activities for students, according to a leaked document seen by  trade magazine School Week. It is 'an important way' of showing that a student is serious about attending the school, patents are told. The first document seen by Schools Week asks teenagers to complete a form say whether they intend to take up a place in the sixth-form, and includes the line 'I enclose a cheque for £120 for School Fund'. It asks for signatures from both pupils and parent. The Education Secretary Michael Gove also sends his daughter to Grey Coat . The second document says: 'If you confirm your offer of a place at Grey Coat for September 2015, then we ask you to pay School Fund, which for sixth form students is set at £120 per annum. 'School Fund enables to school to provide many of the extra-curricular activities that are run for Year 12 throughout the academic year, in particular the team-building activities/resources which are provided during induction week.' It goes on to say: 'As school budgets are squeezed, school fund contributions will, from now on, also help toward improving the learning environment across the school.' The letter says that if families are able to provide a cheque for the full amount then they should make it payable to the school and return it with the confirmation slip. Anyone with queries should contact a named person at the school. It adds: 'Paying School Fund is an important way of showing us that you are serious about taking up a place with us in Year 12 in September.' The latest admissions code for state schools in England says that admissions authorities must not 'request financial contributions (either in the form of voluntary contributions, donations or deposits (even if refundable)) as any part of the admissions process'. A DfE spokesperson: 'Any claim that the School Admissions Code has been breached will be investigated.'","PM is sending his daughter Nancy to  Grey Coat Hospital School in London .

"Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen knows what it is to be desperate. He's spent the last ten years behind Indonesian bars as one of the Bali Nine, arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin from Bali into Australia. Now, as fellow convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran await word of their looming executions, the 'forgotten' Bali Nine prisoner is desperately trying to raise funds for an appeal against his own life sentence. 'No one wishes death,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have a life sentence, that means life in Indonesia. That's death by a different means.' 'If you believe in mercy': Forgotten Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen asks for help from Indonesia . After ten years of silence behind bars, 31-year-old Nguyen has launched an online My Cause campaign in an attempt to raise money for the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow prisoners Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman. 'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' Nguyen wrote in his online call for help. 'Today, as I sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians, I am terrified,' he said. 'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' Nguyen has penned a letter of thanks to those outside prison walls who have sent him messages of support since he spoke out, saying he is overwhelmed. 'Thanks for having faith in me. It had been a long journey,' he writes. 'The words you wrote to me was really something different. Thanks for your time also in lending a hand. Thanks for giving me a chance to prove myself. A second chance. 'For the first time, not sure how to go about, but this is me asking for help to fight an unknown system,' he writes. 'Thanks again for your time in writing encouraging comments to me. It makes me more determined.' Money raised will be used to cover costs for all three men, and any remaining funds will be donated towards legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has penned this letter of thanks to those outside prison walls who have sent him messages of support . 'Agonisingly certain I will be next': Tan Duc Thanh Nguyan has launched an emotional plea for help with a MyCause campaign to raise funds  for his legal costs, and those of fellow Bali Nine prisoners in Indonesia . Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008. 'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.' 'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.' Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . Nguyen was in Kerobokan prison with Chan and Sukumaran until last year, when he was moved to Malang prison in East Java with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens. He says the pair on death row are 'good guys.' 'They dealt with their sentence in the best possible way they could,' Nguyen says. 'The facts are there, they did help others. No one is making that up; everything said about them is true. They were good guys and have helped endlessly.' Indonesia's hard-line stance on the executions of  Chan and Sukumaran have made Nguyen fearful he and the other Bali Nine members won't be given a fair trial when it comes to the appeal. But while they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' This week, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran are pushing ahead with their last-ditch appeal against the Administrative Court's decision to deny the pair an opportunity to challenge President Joko Widodo. The appeal has been adjourned until next week. The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . Of the mood in prison in Indonesia at the moment, Nguyen says Malang is 'a different place.' 'The people are different. They are really polite and respectful and are giving me the space I need right now,' he says. 'But what's happening affects me more, because I know those two [Chan and Sukumaran] while none of these people do, so life continues as normal for them. Like nothing is happening.' Nguyen told the Daily Mail his family visit when they can, but that it's far now and hard on them financially. Asked what it's like to see his family, he says: 'it is hard to answer this.' 'I'm happy seeing them, truly I am, but it's also a reminder about the pain and problems I caused them.' Nguyen says his family, who migrated to Australia as refugees from Vietnam, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are still paying those debts. Tan Duc Than Nguyen, pictured here with fellow Bali Nine prisoners, says he has spiralled into depression watching events unfold for Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia and is desperate for his own life . The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . If he were ever successful in winning a reduced prison sentence, Nguyen says there are 'so many things' he wants to do. One of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. 'The most important to me is to fix the relationship with my family,' he says. 'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says. 'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Nguyen says there are many things he took for granted growing up in Australia. 'It wasn't until my arrest that I realised the things I took for granted. Basic things as living conditions. Growing up in Australia, we are fortunate. So we truly don't know the meaning of poverty at home.' In prison, Nguyen says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.' 'Also what's important for me is do is everything I can so people would never have to go through what we have by being involved in the drug trade,' he says. 'But I must say, in all honesty, even though that's what I want to do, nothing is certain in life. After more than ten years inside, nothing is the same. The world I knew once isn't the same.' The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members)","Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has made a desperate online plea for help to appeal against his life sentence .
Nguyen, who was jailed for life for his role in the drug smuggling plot, has spent 10 years behind bars in Indonesia .
'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know,' he says .
Nguyen has penned a letter of thanks to supporters for 'having faith' in him and giving him a chance to prove himself .
He is hoping to raise funds to pay the legal costs of his fifth appeal for a reduced sentence .

"The Ohio mother who allegedly beheaded her three-month-old baby has been released from hospital and booked into jail on aggravated murder charges. Deasia Watkins, 20, said nothing as she appeared handcuffed and in a yellow jumpsuit before a Hamilton County judge on Friday morning. Her bond was set at $500,000. A grand jury will hear evidence in the case on March 26 and will decide on an indictment. She is accused of decapitating her daughter Janiyah at her aunt's College Hill home on Monday morning before placing the knife in the child's hand and going to bed. After her family found the grisly scene, Watkins, who had previously been ordered to stay away from the child after being hospitalized with psychiatric problems, was taken to hospital for evaluation. In court: Deasia Watkins, who has been charged with aggravated murder in the beheading death of her baby daughter, said nothing at her first court appearance in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday . On Thursday evening, she was released and taken to Hamilton County Jail. While she was under guard at Deaconess Hospital, Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that she was not talking to authorities. 'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking. 'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' Watkins gave birth to baby Janiyah in December and was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis in January after police responded to a report that she was screaming in her apartment. Watkins, left, allegedly murdered three-month-old Janiyah, right, at her aunt's Ohio home on Monday . She was ultimately ordered to keep away from the child, who was handed over to her aunt, and family services caseworkers said they believe Watkins may not have been taking her medication, which could have caused delusional thinking. Deters said it is believed Watkins moved in with her aunt about a week before the murder. On Monday, the aunt's son dropped his children off at the house so they could catch the bus and a five-year-old boy entered the home and found the murdered baby on a kitchen counter. Janiyah had been stabbed at least 15 times across her body and had a fractured arms, the coroner revealed. The five-year-old boy ran outside to get his father, who then woke up Watkins' aunt, and together they called 911. 'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the chilling 911 call. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!' Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call . Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.' When the dispatcher pushes for more information, he says: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. 'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby and Watkins in bed. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December and the baby's father, James Brown, told WCPO she 'just started acting different' about a month after the birth. He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected . Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . On January 24, police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their home. Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out with her eyes open. Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. 'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.' She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Behind bars: Watkins is now being held at Hamilton County Jail, pictured, on $500,000 bond . Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents were neglectful. Social workers checked on the baby girl once a week - at least 10 times in total - and warned relatives to keep Watkings away from her before the murder, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'. He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.","Deasia Watkins, 20, appeared before a judge in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday morning and her bond was set at $500,000 .

"Karl Crimmins (pictured) has been banned from using online dating sites after he punched a woman he met on the internet in the face . A judge has taken the unusual step of banning a violent misogynist from all online dating sites after he punched a woman he met on the internet in the face. Judge William Gaskell told violent Karl Crimmins, 29, of Bedwas, Caerphilly, that women who replied to his online dating profile 'did not know what they were getting into'. Qualified fitter Crimmins pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding his then-girlfriend Tina Evans in January this year - four months after meeting her through a dating site. The court heard he had been at her home in Llanrumney, Cardiff, complaining about repairs needed to his car when she made a joke and was punched in the eye by Crimmins. She needed hospital treatment and the split above her right eye had to be stitched. But it was his previous appearances before judges and magistrates which shocked the court. John Lloyd, prosecuting, said they included not only violence against women but even against one partner's five-year-old child. Mr Lloyd said in 2008 Crimmins, then in his early 20s, had assaulted a woman in Bedwas by pulling her hair and punching and grabbing her by the throat. Just over a year later, in September 2009, he was at Grays Gardens in Caerphilly when he grabbed a woman around the neck as she was holding a young baby. 'It is not known if it was the same woman but each is listed as domestic violence,' Mr Lloyd told the court. 'And the same address in Grays Gardens is given for the location of three more offences of assault in 2010 when a woman was punched and a five-year-old child had a towel placed around his neck before he was pulled off a chair, causing bruising. 'The boy was also shaken on another occasion.' In 2011 Crimmins was back before another court for what was described as an 'incident' with a partner in Blaengarw, Bridgend. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard Crimmins has a long history of being violent towards his partners . Mr Lloyd said: 'They had a verbal argument over his driving and when they got home he pushed her into a cupboard under the stairs and closed the door. 'That was in October and in December he was in another argument with her when he put his arm around her neck and held her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to vomit.' Judge Gaskell said a point had been made that Crimmins managed to stay out of trouble from that time until this year. But he told him: 'It really shows how utterly contemptible you are if that is thought to be an achievement.' The court heard Crimmins (pictured) has a problem with women and 'needs to change his ways' Crimmins' own solicitor described him as a man who had a problem with women, saying: 'He's a misogynist who needs to change his ways.' Edward Mitchard, defending, said the prospect for future partners had to be considered and the risk to them would be reduced if Crimmins went on a special programme. Judge Gaskell said the programmes had failed in 2008 and 2009 but agreed the court had a public duty to try again. 'You are not fit to be on a dating site or in any relationship,' the senior circuit judge sitting at Cardiff Crown Court told him. 'Women would have nothing to do with you if they knew they were contacting a serial abuser.' 'I am not unduly optimistic but this behaviour has to stop,' he told the defendant as he gave him an eight-month prison sentence suspended for two years with supervision. He also ordered Crimmins to complete 250 hours unpaid work and attend a 'Building better relationships' course. 'What happened to Ms Evans was that she fell into a relationship with you while you are quite unfit to have a relationship with anyone,' the judge said. 'She put her trust in a violent man who likes hitting women.' He also imposed a four-month night-time curfew 'to curtail your social life' and made a restraining order keeping him away from Ms Evans, her home and any dating site. 'It is necessary to protect those who may be at risk of violence from you,' he said.","Serial abuser Karl Crimmins, 29, has been been banned from dating sites .

"T.J. Maxx has been forced to withdraw a T-shirt depicting a hangman's noose, amid accusations that the company is glorifying suicide and racist lynch mobs. The controversy started when a Twitter user, @PsychoGF_, tweeted a picture of the shirt - which also features the slogan, 'hang loose' - along with the message, 'It is absolutely sickening that @TJMaxx thinks it's okay to sell a shirt like this'. The store contacted the user quickly, in an attempt to limit the damage. But the picture quickly went viral, with Twitter users saying that the design 'glorifies suicide' and had 'obvious racial overtones'. Offensive: This T-shirt, produced by surfing clothing company Tavik and stocked by T.J. Maxx, caused controversy as Twitter users said it glorified suicide and lynch mobs. It was eventually withdrawn . Next, the growing Twitter storm directed itself at Tavik, the Californian surf clothing company that designed and produced the shirt. Users told the company that the shirt was 'disgusting' and 'repulsive', with one asking, 'why is this a shirt?' Before long, the shirt was pulled. Tavik's PR manager, Kelly McElroy said in a statement to The Washington Post: . 'We sincerely apologize for any offense caused by this T-shirt. 'This item was released without going through proper protocols and has zero relation to anything other than surfing. 'We will be pulling this item from retailers immediately.' T.J. Maxx declined to comment. Defiant: The controversial T-shirt continued to be sold at other online retailers, one of whom is dubbing it 'pleasingly provocative' Some users, however, complained that the issue was being blown out of proportion. One tweeted, 'you people r so sensitive, it's just a tee shirt'. Last night, another retailer,Backcountry.com, continued to stock the shirt, describing it as 'pleasingly provocative'. The shirt no longer appears on the site.","The shirt also carried the slogan, 'hang loose'

"The father of Becky Watts’ boyfriend has spoken of the ‘horror story’ faced by his son after the discovery of her dismembered body. Ivan Oberhansli, 45, said his son, Luke, 17, was ‘all over the place, devastated,’ adding: ‘It’s like something out of a horror story. You can imagine how he must feel.’ Becky, 16, went missing from her Bristol home on the morning of February 19. But detectives discovered her 'cut up' body at a house in the Barton Hill area earlier this week. Luke Oberhansli, 17, (left) is said to be 'all over the place, devastated' by the death of his girlfriend, Becky Watts, 16, (right) whose dismembered body parts were found earlier this week after she went missing . Her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, has been charged with her murder. Matthews’ girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Three men and a woman have also been accused of helping to hide the dismembered body the teenager. Karl Demetrius, 29 and his girlfriend, Jaydene Parsons, 23, allegedly acted to help Matthews evade detection. They were charged with assisting an offender after the 16-year-old's cut up remains were found in their home. Karl's twin Donovan Demetrius and James Ireland, 23, have also been charged with the same offence of assisting in the 'disposal and concealment' of Becky's body parts. The defendants appeared in court on Friday and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and did not enter pleas during the short hearing. Becky Watts's stepbrother Nathan Matthews (left) has been charged with her murder. His girlfriend Shauna Hoare (right) is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice . Suspects: Jaydene Parsons, 23, (right) has a young son with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Karl Demetrius (left). Both have today been charged with assisting an offender in relation to the Becky Watts murder . In custody:  Donovan Demetrius (left) has also been charged as has Jamie Ireland (right). A fifth suspect was released without charge . They are jointly charged with assisting an offender without lawful authority or reasonable excuse between February 22 and March 3. The charge alleges that they 'did an act, namely assist in the disposal and concealment of the body parts of Rebecca Watts with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of Nathan Watts, who had committed the offence of murder'. Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of killing his stepsister and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of 'consistently lying to police' in an attempt to protect her boyfriend. Matthews, who was unshaven and wearing a grey sweatshirt, appeared via video link from HMP Bristol, and did not enter a plea. Judge Neil Ford QC, Recorder of Bristol, remanded Matthews in custody and set another hearing for March 26 and he expected a trial after September 1. The four defendants were shuttled to Bristol Magistrates Court on Friday after being charged with the crime . Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of his first hearing . Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom  charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice . Nathan Matthews (second from right) and Shauna Hoare (right) are pictured at a fancy dress party with Becky's father Darren (left) and his wife, Matthews's mother Anjie . Police discovered body parts on Monday night after they were called to a property at Barton Court, in the Barton Hill area of Bristol (top right). They also searched a second house, and a blue car parked outside (bottom right). Barton Court is just a street away from a house in Cotton Mill Lane (bottom left) which has been searched extensively, and is opposite Becky's boyfriend Luke's house (bottom centre). Police  also searched Becky's home (top right), and a house in Southmead (top left) where they seized a black Vauxhall Zafira . Prosecutor James Ward told the court: 'Nathan Matthews is charged with the murder of Rebecca Watts. 'The allegations of this case have been well-rehearsed in the press recently and I do not propose to go into the finer details. 'There are still people helping the police with their inquiries. Therefore, it would be wrong to place before the media further details about this case.' Mr Ward said police were assessing 'at least' 1,200 exhibits in connection with the case. 'Much forensic work needs to be done,' he said. Paul Cook, representing Matthews, said his client was not making an application for bail. Matthews' girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, who is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, will also appear before the court charged with perverting the course of justice on that date. They were detained after detectives attended a house in Barton Court, Barton Hill in Bristol, following information that Becky's body had been 'cut up'. A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids . As a white custody van left the court on Thursday, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away . Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges on Thursday after 16-year-old Becky's dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week. Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky's father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews' mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol. Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare's young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather. Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses.

"Eyes fixed strongly on the photographer, light powerfully capturing their natural poses and attire, Pierre Gonnord's subjects are the forgotten groups of society who exist on the 'underbelly' of globalisation. From coal miners and punks, to gypsies and immigrants, French-born, Madrid-based, Gonnord gives a face to insular communities, tribes and clans that might otherwise risk invisibility from the cyber-pages of history. In a technology-saturated era, which places an emphasis on self promotion and social media, his New York exhibition at Hasted Kraeutler, immortalises collective groups, whilst capturing the individual, in a series of hauntingly beautiful photographs. Scroll down for video . French-born, Madrid-based photographer Pierre Gonnord (born 1963) has spent a lot of time among the gypsy communities of Spain, particularly  in Seville and Perpignan . The Dream Goes Over the Time is the product of Gonnord's ten year documentarian of groups which live almost entirely off the grid. His job has developed into more of a lifestyle, investing time and energy establishing relationships with the communities. Gonnord said: 'People from the ghettos, the outskirts of the city, that flee from a globalized world from which they feel rejected...set out with nothing more than what they have on their back and a dog as their own only travel companion, embarking on a Grand Tour as nomads, with no return ticket, turning their backs on a (certain) world that no longer interests them.' The protagonists are captured in the style of Old Master paintings, with simple, dark sets focusing entirely on the subjects from the waist up. Old Masters were highly recognised and renown artists who would portrait their subjects, among other work, before the 1800s. Framed as almost royal subjects, the photographs shown an intense strength and resilience, with direct eye contact to the camera and in natural poses. Featured are an elderly lady wrapped in a shawl, a mother cradling her baby, and a boy leaning on a sack. Hauntingly beautiful: Gonnord seeks to photograph his subjects in the style of Old Masters paintings, with shots from the focusing on their expressions and how the light catches their faces . Gonnord lived among the groups he has featured in his exhibition, gaining their trust before immortalising them on camera . Even sleek equines are represented, signifying dwindling biodiversity in our contemporary world. The photos are not romanticised or glamorised, but instead seek to portray the raw reality of their characters. Gonnord's work creatively focuses on the individual, whilst representing the collective, resulting in a powerful exhibition of both individual portraiture and cultural documentation. The Dream Over The Time is running until April 25, 2015 at contemporary art gallery, Hasted Kraeutler, is located in Chelsea, New York City. Coal miners, punks, gypsies and immigrants are immortalised in his harrowing portraits, which seek to establish the social groups firmly in our cyber-history .

"Professor Stephen Hawking's revealed how he has always tried to 'lead as full a life as possible,' in response to a plea for inspiring message. The physicist, who was portrayed by Eddie Redmayne in The Theory Of Everything, was one of a host of celebrities to provide a motivational messages. Other A-list stars, including actor Sir Ian McKellen, athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill, actor Sir David Jason and sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur also shared some words of wisdom. In his message Professor Hawking told how he has always tried to lead as 'full a life as possible' Jessica Ennis-Hill revealed that just like everyone else she has days when she does not want to get out of bed . The famous faces put pen to paper for Simon Rhodes after he asked them for encouraging quotes to spur on staff at his legal firm. The first to arrive was from the 73-year-old scientists and author, who suffers from motor neuron disease. Professor Hawking wrote: 'I have always tried to overcome the limitations of my condition and lead as full a life as possible. I have travelled the world, from the Antarctic to zero gravity.' He accompanied his message with a thumb print. Sir Ian McKellen said: 'All we do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us' Actor Sir Ian McKellen said: 'All we have to do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us.' Olympic medal winning athlete and mother-of-one Jessica Ennis-Hill revealed that she struggles to get out of bed on Monday mornings. Sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur and rugby star Mark Regan used their quotes to give an insight into their achievements. Mr Rhodes, 46, from Southampton, Hampshire, fired off 25 letters to some of the most famous names in the country and in total 18 replied. In return, he made a £100 donation to a charity of the celebrity respondents choosing. Mr Rhodes, who is the managing partner at law firm Trethowans, said: 'I was pleasantly surprised that so many came back and it's the little bits where they have gone over and above. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: 'Nobody has enough talent to live on talent alone. Even when you have talent, a life without work goes nowhere.' Ellen MacArthur revealed that when she was 'out there' she was 'never alone' Rugby player Mark Regan explained how he couldn't have won the Heineken Cup without his 14 team mates . Former footballer Matt Le Tissier encouraged people to 'meet things head on, even the tough things' 'But the one where I sat down and held it because I didn't expect to get it was Stephen Hawking. It made me smile the most. 'It had another edge and it was the icing on the cake.' Mr Rhodes came up with the idea last year to motivate the 150-strong staff but wanted to use words that were not 'corporate speak'. He said: 'We all look at these motivational messages like 'sell more' and 'buy more' but they can have the opposite effect. 'I wanted something that would motivate and the only way I thought I could do that was not by having our words. Actor David Jason explained that he had done his fair share of jobs before his fortunes changed . Lawyer Simon Rhodes received 18 inspirational messages from a host of famous faces . 'So I dug out the quotes and wrote to them all saying I was trying to motivate the next generation of our staff. 'I told them I have read what they have said and how I thought it was motivational and said that if they were able to send a signed photograph with a message to our staff at Trethowans I will give £100 to their favourite charity.' The quotes and photographs of each of the celebrities have now been split between their new office in Southampton and a second office in Salisbury, where they have been hung on the walls of the staff seating area. Mr Rhodes added: 'The people I chose have all made a big impact on the world and come out on top, often against great adversity. 'Their achievements have inspired me and I hope they will continue to inspire others too. 'Professor Hawking was actually one of the first to reply and naturally wants his donation to go to the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 'The feedback from Trethowans staff and visitors to the new office has been very positive.' Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho: 'Pressure? What pressure? Pressure is millions of parents around the world with no money to feed their children. There is no pressure in football.'

"Shocking new images released today have shown ISIS terrorists toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Iraq. The latest photos show the militants vandalising churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. Pictured in civilian clothing, the ISIS thugs are seen overturning statues, destroying religious icons and replacing Christian crosses with the chilling ISIS banner. This chilling image shows an ISIS thug destroying a cross on a church and replacing it with the ISIS banner . Dressed in civilian clothing, a militant takes a claw hammer to a priceless relief at a Nineveh church . ISIS have killed Christians who have refused to convert to Islam and want to cleanse its caliphate of its Christian heritage . The disturbing images - provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) - are the latest evidence of ISIS trying to cleanse its caliphate of its Christian heritage. ISIS claim ancient relics promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. MEMRI director Steven Stalinsky said: 'They don't care what it's called; they are just following their ideology and that means getting rid of churches and minorities. It is the Islamic State, and there's no room for anyone else. 'This has been going on for some time, a systematic campaign to rid the region of any vestiges of Christianity.' In February, the terrorist organisation decapitated 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on the shores of Libya and then kidnapped more than 220 Assyrian Christians when militants swept into about 12 villages. Thousands of other Iraqi Christians have fled their homes in fear and are having to find temporary accommodation in the surrounding region. Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's top diplomat at the UN in Geneva, said yesterday the jihadists were committing 'genocide' and must be stopped. The Vatican traditionally opposes military intervention in the region. ISIS claim ancient relics promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . Two ISIS militants overturn a cross on a Christian site in Nineveh in the organisation's latest shocking act . ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts. Earlier this month, ISIS went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. They also bulldozed 2,000-year-old Hatra - another UNESCO World Heritage site. In recent weeks, ISIS have also set off bombs around Mosul Central Library, destroying as many as 10,000 priceless and irreplaceable books and manuscripts. Nineveh, in northern Iraq, was once the largest city in the world with a population of as many as 150,000 people in 700BC - it lies close to Mosul, the largest city under ISIS control .","ISIS militants pictured toppling crosses and smashing relics in Nineveh .

"A juror who helped to convict Amanda Knox has revealed she has 'grave doubts' over the American's involvement in the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox is pictured above in Seattle last month . A juror who helped to convict Amanda Knox has revealed she has 'grave doubts' over the American's involvement in the murder of Meredith Kercher. Job centre worker Genny Ballerini, who served on a panel of citizen judges that reinstated Knox's murder conviction last year, has slammed the prosecution's case citing 'questionable proof, flimsy evidence and bizarre testimony'. The motive put forward by prosecutors that Knox killed Miss Kercher after she complained about the American leaving the bathroom dirty seemed like 'nonsense', she said. Miss Ballerini, 48, suggested that the pair did not get a fair trial because there was 'an atmosphere of guilt' in the deliberation room before it even began. Miss Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, south London, was found half-naked with her throat slit in 2007 in the Perugia cottage she shared with Knox, 19. Knox and former boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito served four years for the brutal killing but were freed on appeal in 2011. Knox immediately returned to the US and has rebuilt her life, finding love with old school friend Colin Sutherland and working on her local newspaper in Seattle. But last year an appeal court reinstated the original convictions ordering the pair to serve 28 and 25 years respectively. A third suspect Rudy Guede was convicted in a fast track trial and is serving 16 years for the murder. Italy's highest court will hear Knox and Sollecito's final appeal next week. If convicted Italy can request Knox's extradition. But while the Supreme Court could rubber stamp the conviction later this month, Miss Ballerini's claims could derail the case. The court can send the case back back to an earlier appeal stage if the decision taken by the lower court was found to be illogical or inconsistent. The juror told Oggi magazine: 'I certainly had many doubts about the guilt of the two young people. I was not convinced of their innocence but I thought and I said to the others as well: ""The evidence that we have is not sufficient to inflict all these years in prison"". Meredith Kercher (left), 21, was found half-naked with her throat slit in 2007 in the Perugia cottage she shared with Knox, 19. Knox and former boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito (right) served four years for the brutal killing but were freed on appeal in 2011 . Miss Ballerini was part of the panel that reinstated Knox's conviction last year. She said: 'I said immediately that I did not agree and they took note.' Above, Knox sits alone before being interviewed in January 2014 . She added: 'There was not enough, in my opinion, to justify such a heavy sentence: questionable proof, bizarre testimony and flimsy evidence.' She dismissed the alleged motive as 'nonsense' and said: 'You do not massacre a girl because she complained about a bit of a stink in the bathroom.' And she was equally doubtful about Sollecito's motivation. 'What could possibly have been the motive that Raffaelle had to participate in the killing of that poor girl.' When she heard the verdict and sentence she immediately protested. Miss Ballerini said: 'I said immediately that I did not agree and they took note. Other members of the jury were also against an increase in the sentence, she said, but they were told there was no alternative.' The jurors constructed a timeline with mobile phone records and statements from the witnesses that showed how the pair could have been at the murder scene at the time of death, but she questioned whether it was sufficient proof to condemn them. She was equally unconvinced by attempts to portray the pair as bad characters. Prosecutors had painted Amanda as troublesome because she once received a fine from police for being disorderly. 'This seemed to me, excuse me, more nonsense,' she told the weekly magazine. Knox (above with police) reacts after hearing the verdict during her appeal trial in Perugia on October 3, 2011 . Miss Ballerini added that 'there was not enough [evidence], in my opinion, to justify such a heavy sentence'. The couple are pictured above kissing after Miss Kercher's body was discovered . Sollecito was described in the initial trial as 'depraved', because he read violent Manga comics, but Miss Ballerini said reading comics or watching cartoons did not amount to being a killer. 'If someone is a murderer you have to prove it,' she said. Crucially the only person definitively convicted of the murder had not implicated the pair. He has given three different accounts of the murder and never said that Knox and Sollecito were with him, she pointed out. Continuing to pick apart the case she said it was strange that Knox and Sollecito had barely left a trace of DNA in the room where Meredith's body was found whereas Rudy Guede left 'a good number' of marks. 'They claimed that Knox had removed her traces by cleaning. Pah! Today when I think about it again I have even more doubts,' she said. But she insisted that the two professional judges on the panel had not tried to sway the jury. She claimed that she herself had not had an opinion because she had not read about the case in the news but had developed her convictions studying the files on the previous trials and keeping a diary where she recorded what happened at every hearing.","Genny Ballerini served on panel that reinstated Knox's conviction last year .

"A jealous son reversed his Mazda over his own father because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard. Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned: 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'. Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator. Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard. Dean Wilson (left), 37, was jailed after running over his father Norman (right) with his Mazda because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard . Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail. He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.' 'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me. 'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs. 'It was excruciating.' He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'. Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street. 'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added. The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him. 'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back. 'I've got to get away and move on with my life.' The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father. Norman Wilson was treated for broken ribs, bruising (pictured) and grazes after he was run over by his son . He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court. He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech. 'He turned and saw his son saying he didn't want his kids or his ex-partner at his dad's house or he would kill him. 'Norman Wilson said the defendant indicated he had smashed the windscreen. 'The defendant said he had been told Norman had been going to bed with his ex and Dean Wilson said he was going to kill him and added, 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.' Ms Pritchard added: 'The defendant then jumped in his car and came at speed and hit Norman Wilson so he was thrown in the air and as he landed a few yards from his own vehicle the defendant drove at him again and ran over his leg.' Witnesses said they saw the defendant drive the Mazda at his father before reversing over him. The 60-year-old (pictured today), who is now left using a mobility scooter, is terrified and planning to move . Norman Wilson initially laughed at his son's threat but now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is terrified after being run over outside his home (pictured) Natalie Mosley, who witnessed the incident, told the court that she put herself in the path of Dean Wilson's vehicle during another attempt to drive over him. Ms Pritchard explained how Norman Wilson remembers someone holding his head and saying he was dying when things became blurred. He was treated for broken ribs, bruising and grazes at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and is now left using a mobility scooter. In a victim impact statement, Mr Wilson said he feels threatened and that he has to leave the area. Matthew Donkin, defending, said: 'Dean Wilson behaved out of character and gave leave to all of his good senses. 'He has been the principle carer for his children aged seven and eight and his 14-year-old stepson. 'There was a lack of premeditation until he got in his vehicle. He immediately admitted what he had done and made full admissions.' Sentencing, Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Your relationship with your father broke down badly by your suspicions that rightly or wrongly he was involved sexually with your former partner. 'Travelling at a speed estimated at 20mph you drove at him and knocked him into the road and you then quite deliberately reversed over him. 'He was extremely lucky not to have sustained more serious injuries.' Dean Wilson was also handed a four year driving ban and told his car would be confiscated. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, which was later dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured)","Dean Wilson, 37, drove over father Norman twice because he was angry .

"Labour leader Ed Miliband today launched another desperate bid to counter the rise of the SNP . Ed Miliband left the door open to a post-election deal with the SNP yesterday as a new poll suggested Labour could be reduced to just two MPs in Scotland. The Labour leader insisted his party could still win outright, pleading with people not to 'blow the whistle on the match before the game is over'. However he has not ruled out a vote-by-vote arrangement with the Nationalists. On a visit to Scotland he claimed there was an 'unholy alliance' between the Conservatives and the SNP to keep David Cameron in Number Ten. He added that every seat Labour lost to the SNP would increase the chances of a second term for the Tories. Labour's panic was increased yesterday by an ICM poll for the Guardian. It showed Nicola Sturgeon's party way ahead, with 43 per cent of the vote, with Labour languishing on 27 per cent, the Conservatives on 14 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on six per cent. On a uniform swing, the figures would see the SNP jump from just six of Scotland's 59 seats in 2010 to 43 in May. Labour would lose 29 of the 41 seats won in 2010, making it all but impossible for the party to win a majority. But a detailed analysis of the poll numbers suggests Labour's position could be even worse. A new poll puts Labour down to just 27 per cent, which Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories . Leading psephologist Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the SNP have advanced by a staggering 31 per cent in Labour seats. He concluded Labour could be wiped out in all but two seats. If so, the SNP would be certain of holding the balance of power at Westminster. 'There is nothing ... to suggest that the rise of the SNP is not extending to supposedly safe Labour heartlands – if anything, the opposite is the case,' said Professor Curtice. Mr Miliband appeared angered by Alex Salmond positioning himself as kingmaker in Westminster. 'It's a combination of bluster and bluff,' he said. 'I'll tell you who's going to be writing a Labour budget, me and Ed Balls. It's not going to be Alex Salmond – not in a million years.' Former first minister Alex Salmond has vowed to hold Labour to ransom in the event of a hung parliament . He had previously ruled out a coalition with the SNP, but stopped short of ruling out the vote-by-vote arrangement proposed by the SNP. 'How other parties decide to vote on the basis of a Labour Queen's Speech is up to them,' he said. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said Mr Miliband would be 'very, very foolish' to rule out a post-election agreement, which would prevent the Conservatives from gaining power. On the claim of an unholy alliance between the Tories and the SNP, he said: 'I think Ed Miliband has lost the plot entirely.'","New poll puts SNP on 43%, Labour 27%,Tories 14% and Lib Dems 6% .

"The editor of film industry website Deadline has apologized for an article about casting minorities on television that sparked fury last week. Deadline Editor Mike Fleming Jr said in an interview on Sunday that the article by  co-editor Nellie Andreeva titled 'The Year Of Ethnic Castings – About Time Or Too Much Of Good Thing?' was not an accurate reflection of the site's opinion and that they will strive not to make a similar mistake again. The article posted Tuesday night deals with a surge this season in television shows depicting actors of a diverse background, but stipulates that it could be a 'trend' that's not sustainable. Scroll down for video . Deadline Hollywood's Editor Mike Felming Jr issued an apology Sunday night for a regrettable argue about 'too many' minorities on TV. Pictured above at an event in Los Angeles in November . Deadline: In the article, by Nellie Andreeva, published Tuesday, she wrote that though ethnic diversity in television is long overdue, 'the pendulum might have swung a bit too far in the opposite direction.' 'The only appropriate way to view racial diversity in casting is to see it as a wonderful thing, and to hope that Hollywood continues to make room for people of color,' Fleming said Sunday, adding that the mistake has been dealt with 'internally' and that the website will 'do our best to make sure that kind of insensitivity doesn't surface again'. Shonda Rhimes, creator of 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Scandal,' and 'How to Get Away With Murder,' was one of the many in Hollywood to lash out about the article on Twitter . 'Nellie and I apologize deeply and sincerely to those who’ve been hurt by this. There is no excuse. It is important to us that Deadline readers know we understand why you felt betrayed, and that our hearts are heavy with regret. We will move forward determined to do better,' Fleming said. The article caused controversy not only from the greater public at large, but by high-ranking members in the film industry - including African-American television writer and producer Shonda Rhimes. The 45-year-old creator of hit shows Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder tweeted: '1st Reaction:: HELL NO. Lemme take off my earrings, somebody hold my purse! 2nd Reaction: Article is so ignorant I can't even be bothered.' Retweeters of Rhimes' post include actress Garcelle Beauvais, Helena Andrews, author and Washington Post journalist, Ava Duvernay, the director of 'Selma,' and more than 1,000 others. New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, New York Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff, and the Huffington Post's Mo Ryan also voiced concerned about the article. In the article, Andreeva noted that though African-Americans are the most 'loyal' television viewers, the group only accounts for 13 per cent of the U.S. population. 'So ignorant': Above, Rhimes' tweet following the Deadline article's publishing last week . She went on to say that 'grossly underserved' African-American actors are being compensated, but said the growth in ethnic roles may have 'reached its peak.' Additionally, she noted that other 'hot commodities' are contributing to the trend, including 'occasional foreigners with that 'sparkle.'' On Sunday, co-editor in chief Fleming said that Andreeva  was looking at the uptick in diverse castings through a purely scientific lens and didn't realize how the work ethnic could come across as cold in her headline. 'Our writers, and editors, can be so focused on the trees they sometimes forget to look at the forest, or in this case, the readers who are much more than statistics. 'A perfect storm of events left us vulnerable, including me choosing the worst time to be zonked from a 22-hour return flight from New Zealand, and normally smart editors on duty failing to respond decisively even after a torrent of hostile comments rolled in,' Fleming said. Fleming said he decided to come forward and accept responsibility for the regrettable story after seeing how Sony executive Amy Pascal fell from grace following the leak of embarrassing emails from her company late last year. 'I don’t believe you can can make an unwise story disappear and pretend it didn’t happen. I observed how Amy Pascal raced around with knee-jerk apologies to anyone who’d listen, after those stolen Sony e-mails surfaced. Her actions felt like panicked damage control to me; we decided to face the consequences and take our lumps. We did that in the comment tail following that story, where over 700 readers teed off on us,' Fleming explained. Scroll down for some of the reactions to the article published last week . 'REALLY?' Eric Goldman, executive editor at IGN, tweeted 'Deadline, did you seriously post an article exhibiting concern that perhaps too many non-white actors are getting cast in TV series? REALLY? Cray: Here, 'Scandal's' Joshua Malina (who plays David Rosen) tweeted 'Deadline be cray.' Nervous: The Huffington Post's Mo Ryan tweeted 'Shorter version of that awful Deadline story: Hey, people of color, you got a few shows! Now step off, you're making some agents nervous.' Dear Deadline: Journalist and immigrant activist Jose Vargas called the premise of the article 'misleading' and 'irresponsible' HEADLINE: Actress Jerrika Hinton tweeted 'HEADLINE: White People No Longer Automatically Considered Default Casting Choice, Makes Me Nervous' Facepalm: Mo Ryan tweeted a photo of multiple 'Facepalms' tweeting 'Horrible Deadline article, you've left me no choice.

"Bravo hit Southern Charm has introduced a new cast member this season, after quietly firing original cast member Jenna King at the end of Season One. Landon Clements is introduced in Season Two, which began airing last week, as an old friend of Shep’s who has moved back to Charleston in the wake of her divorce from an unnamed British man who she lived with  in Los Angeles. And Dailymail.com can reveal that not only is her ex-husband James Maby also the ex-husband of Clueless actress Stacey Dash, he was also once the star of a reality show. Landon, 33, was born Ansley Landon Clements in Georgia. After going to the College of Charleston (during which time she met Southern Charm castmate Shep Rose) she moved to Telluride, Colorado to ski and met James Maby when she was 24. Scroll down for video . The Southern Charm cast photo for Season Two includes one new face, Landon, seen here in the white dress . Landon claims she was swept off her feet by a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ After they met, they got married in Charleston and then she moved with him to Los Angeles. She never names him on the show or on the Bravo website, but she shared a few photos on the series' second episode . The pair were together for seven years, she told Southern Charm cameras, while photos showed snippets of their glamorous time together. But she said it was also terribly lonely, so lonely that she left him and California behind. ‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the [Hollywood] Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels. When I moved out of the house I pretty much just walked away from all of it…. 'On the inside I was so alone, so I packed up and left. Sometimes you just have to save yourself,' she told the camera as she choked back tears. No more bling: ‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the  Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels,' Landon said on Southern Charm. She shared this photo of an impressive looking engagement ring, right . Maby's first wife Stacey Dash, seen left in 1995's Clueless, had a sizable looking diamond ring herself in 2005, at right, which was around the time she married to Maby after giving birth to their daughter . Maby, 43, is an Etonian who claims to speak five languages and was married to Stacey Dash from 2005 to 2006. The pair share a daughter Lola, 11, together. He is the CEO of Sports Logistics, an international firm which does sport branding and billboards and travels a lot for his job. From Landon’s bio on the Bravo website it would seem there isn't a lot of love lost between the pair, as she branded him in part an 'international man of not much mystery.' An excerpt reads: . ‘During this time she met a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ The international man of not much mystery swept her off her feet and they married in Charleston. The demands of their careers compounded with the duties for his actress ex-wife and young daughter became too much for the pair and they separated.’ The bio never names him or Dash. But then she choked up while telling the cameras about her live with James Maby. Despite the sunny Los Angeles weather, Landon says her life was incredibly lonely . Maby's life in Los Angeles also includes daughter Lola, 11, whom he had with ex-wife Stacey Dash. One time Clueless star Dash, who has been married three times, also has son Austin, 23, pictured at right with his mom and sister . After Landon and James pair split in 2013, Landon spent the winter in Aspen and arrived back in Charleston to ‘reclaim her life’ in 2014 – coincidentally just in time to join the Bravo show which filmed last summer. But Landon doesn't just have friends on reality shows already. Lke Shep, she has an ex-husband with plenty of experience himself, and she no doubt knew more than most what she would be getting into by joining the Bravo hit. Her ex-husband James Maby was a repeat winner on the largely forgotten British reality show Lost, which aired for just one season the fall of 2001. On Lost two strangers were paired together, given almost no money and just three days' rations, and were parachuted while blind folded into an unknown destination - including Azerbaijan and Mali. All they knew was their final destination, and they had to find there way to it. Landon's ex James Maby as seen on the opening credits, in 2001, from the British reality show Lost . On the show Maby and his teammate, an until-the-show stranger named Harriet Bulwer-Long, were dropped alongside two other teams in an unknown destination with little food or money. Here they take their blindfolds off upon being left in Newfoundland . He worked his posh accent and knowledge of languages to his advantage. His team also had the benefit of his family apartment on Fifth Avenue, where they stayed one night while passing through New York with no money, seen right. That apartment was sold in 2004, before he met Landon . One episode saw James negotiating the price of his camel ride to Timbuktu, seen here, before complaining that the saddle hurt his privates . Maby was also rampant flirt and a charmer during his time on the show, smiling when the women here answered that he was . He won multiple times, and celebrated each time with the classic champagne pop and crowd spray upon reaching Trafalgar Square . Each race contained three teams, and each team had a cameraman in tow. On all but the season finale the teams were competing to be first back to London's Trafalgar Square. They had to beg and borrow and talk their way into freebies - including plane tickets - to survive. Maby, who skis and claims to speak five languages, thrived. The first team back to Trafalgar Square won, and got to go on the adventure again. Maby won multiple rounds and featured prominently throughout the season. Cameras followed as he and show partner Harriet Bulwer-Long traversed on camel back to Timbuktu, found his way out of Newfoundland, and borrowed money off old school friends in New York where his father conveniently had an apartment on Fifth Avenue. As a repeat winner he had a large amount of screen time, but he receded from the spotlight when the show went off the air. No doubt he would have good advice for his ex on how to win over viewers on reality television if the pair still speak. But it's unclear if they are on speaking terms, and Maby appears to have bounced right back from his second divorce and into a new relationship. As of August 2013 his Facebook status has been ‘in a relationship’ with Kam Heskin, 41, a sometime actress and publicist for jewelry companies. Maby seems to have moved on from Landon with no problem. In August 2013 Kam Heskin proclaimed them 'in a relationship' when she posted these two photos .","Landon Clements is a new cast member on Southern Charm .

"It's a mother's job to make sure her children learn how to fend for themselves. And it's no different on the African plains as incredible new images have captured the moment a lioness teaches her cubs how to kill a wildebeest. At first the young cats seem nervous and reluctant to take down the animal in order to eat. The images show a reluctant and nervous looking lion cub being taught to hunt wildebeest by his mother on the African plain in Kenya . Even though her cubs look nervous, the mother is insistent that they must learn to hunt and tries to grab the attention of the wildebeest . After grabbing the animal's attention, it is then down to the two young cubs to take over as they begin to chase the defenceless animal . But the devoted mother is insistent that her cubs must learn how to hunt and approaches the prey to grab its attention. As she walks away, her two cubs then attack the defenceless wildebeest from behind. Initially, the horned animal manages to keep the three predators at bay, but after a couple of minutes the wildebeest is overpowered and the cubs catch their first prey. The amazing images were captured by photographer Mark Dumbleton in Kenya's Masai Mara National Park. At first the wildebeest appears to be holding its own and looks as though he might escape from the clutches of the lioness and her young . But he eventually becomes overpowered by the three big cats who jump on his back and attempted to drag the wildebeest to the ground . The stunning pictures taken in Kenya were snapped by photographer Mark Dumbleton, who said the whole experience just lasted minutes . Mr Dumbleton from Johannesburg, South Africa said: 'It was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride. 'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had. 'The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal. 'The whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes. 'As soon as the wildebeest was separated from the herd, it was easy for the lions to take it down.' Mr Dumbleton has only been taking pictures since 2007, but now travels around Africa snapping the landscape and wildlife. Mr Dumbleton said: 'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had. The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal. The lions finally get their prey and the wildebeest is dragged to the floor after being given a lesson in hunting by the lioness . He added: 'The awe-inspiring wilderness of Africa is motivating, it's captured my attention. 'It's really inspiring and as the saying goes, Africa truly runs through my blood. 'I photograph nature in its purest form because I love it, and I love to share my work with people who appreciate it.'","The lioness was out on the African plain in Kenya with her two cubs teaching them how to fend for themselves .

"A 39-year-old female driver set herself on fire, crashed her car on a bridge and then jumped 40 feet to a park below in an apparent suicide attempt, but managed to survive, Oregon police said Thursday. The Eugene woman was being treated for critical injuries at a Portland-area hospital. The woman's family had recently reported her missing, police spokesman John Hankemeier said. A 911 caller reported Thursday afternoon that a car appeared to be on fire from the inside, with the woman at the wheel driving recklessly, The Register-Guard newspaper reported. Scene: A 39-year-old woman apparently set herself on fire intentionally while behind the wheel of this Hyundai, crashed her car on a bridge and then jumped 40 feet to a park below. She is now in a critical condition . After the car crashed into a bridge guardrail, witnesses told police the woman jumped out — while on fire — and began taking her clothes off as she ran to the edge of the span. Truck drivers tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and a female driver who stopped at the scene tried to grab the woman from the edge, but she was still able to jump, police said. 'I am thankful for the witness who helped us piece together what happened and was trying to keep this woman from jumping off a bridge,' traffic Lt. Doug Mozan said. Mozan praised the female passer-by who attempted to save the woman. 'Her efforts were nothing less than heroic,' he said. When the car crashed, a piece of its bumper sailed over the bridge, injuring a 40-year-old woman below. Investigation: Police say they were able to piece together the events that lead to the woman being found in a park below this bridge thanks to accounts from witnesses . The pedestrian was treated for minor injuries, police said. The car was still engulfed in flames when police arrived, Mozan said. It appeared an accelerant had been used inside the vehicle. The accident damaged the bridge and traffic was backed up for almost two hours. The fire and crash remain under investigation. 'I believe it was intentionally set on fire but at this point we're still investigating,' Mozan told KVAL-TV. 'I think according to witnesses she was spreading some sort of propellant but it's hard to say what exactly that was.'","Woman, 39, from Eugene, had been reported missing by her family .

"A former Disney executive accused of being part of a Hollywood sex ring that abused a minor has filed a lawsuit against his accuser, claiming that it was part an extortion plot to extort money for prominent gay men in the entertainment industry. David Neuman was named last April by aspiring actor and model Michael Egan, 31, as one of a number of men who he alleged sexually abused him when he was 15 at various L.A. pool parties and during two Hawaiian vacations in 1999 when he was 17. Egan and his lawyer Jeff Herman held a news conference to make their graphic claims, but the case quickly fell apart and by June they had been forced to withdraw their allegations against Neuman. David Neuman, right, was named last April by Michael Egan, left, as one of a number of men who he claimed sexually abused him when he was a teenager . Now Neuman is suing both Egan and Herman for smearing his reputation, reports The Wrap. In a complaint filed on Monday, he accused them of hatching 'a despicable scheme to enrich themselves by inventing and then litigating totally false claims which they would then use to extort settlement payments.' The complaint goes on to allege that Egan and Herman 'expected that rather than fight these vicious and provably false clams, Mr. Neuman would simply choose to pay defendants a sum of money to settle the claims and end the litigation.' Neuman says that the pair planned to target other gay men in the entertainment industry to 'intimidate and extort fraudulent settlements' from them 'by threatening to ruin their lives forever' with false accusations of sexual abuse. Egan had also sued X-Men director Bryan Singer, theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard and former television executive Garth Ancier. All of the defendants denied the claims and the charges were all eventually dropped. Neuman is now suing both Egan and her lawyer Jeff Herman, above, for smearing his reputation . Egan had also attempted to sue X-Men director Bryan Singer, right, and former television executive Garth Ancier, left, but the charges were all eventually dropped . The case against Neuman collapsed after it was revealed that Egan had said in an statement under oath in 2003 that Neuman was not in Hawaii with him and didn't sexually assault him or engage in any kind of sexual behavior with him. 'Now, more than 10 years after signing the declaration, plaintiff inexplicably has chosen to suddenly claim that Mr. Neuman had engaged in the very conduct which 10 years earlier he swore Mr. Neuman had no part of,' said lawyers for Neuman last June. Neuman has worked for Disney and CNN as a TV executive.","David Neuman was named last April by Michael Egan as one of a number of men who he claimed sexually abused him when he wasa teenager .

"Kim Kardashian does it. Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to 'sculpt' facial features . Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture . Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist . Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring . 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn’t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo – it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim’s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia . Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones . 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal . 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go . 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend . 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation . Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used . 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are ‘framing’ the face. Blend the contouring ‘in’ (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the ‘frame’ by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips . 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid . 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines . Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones . So, what is contouring exactly? 'It’s not just drawing lines on your face. It’s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don’t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer – it’s an illusion. You’re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don’t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I’d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it’s just about contour. They don’t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring . 'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.' Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday. 'A woman shouldn’t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don’t need to highlight and contour every day. 'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it’s easier, on the go, and you don’t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base – tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don’t look pale, blush, and you’re good to go. In demand: Professional make up artist Lilit Caradanian has over 840,000 Instagram followers and celebrity clients . There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.' And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You’re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.' Celebrity makeup artist, Lilit Caradanian is currently in Australia running an exclusive series of masterclasses for Wedded Wonderland, the country’s leading online wedding magazine.","LA make up artist Lilit Caradanian is in Australia to teach master class .

"An American study of 78,000 women found that those whose fathers, brothers or sons had prostate cancer were 14 per cent more at risk of breast cancer . Women whose father or brother has prostate cancer are more likely to develop breast cancer, research shows. Scientists believe the illnesses are caused by the same faulty gene passed down through families. An American study of 78,000 women found that those whose fathers, brothers or sons had prostate cancer were 14 per cent more at risk of breast cancer. But women were 80 per cent more likely to get the illness if their father, brother or son had prostate cancer and their mother or sister had breast cancer. The findings – published in the journal Cancer – are further evidence that some types of breast and prostate cancer are caused by the same inherited, faulty gene. Although doctors have been aware the illnesses run in families for several years, this research shows the faulty gene may be more important than they previously thought. Its lead author says doctors should routinely ask women whether prostate cancer runs in her family when establishing her risk of breast cancer. Women considered high-risk are offered more frequent x-rays, genetic tests and in some cases, preventative drugs such as Tamoxifen. Breast and prostate cancers are the most common forms of the illness in women and men respectively. There are 50,500 new cases of breast cancer in the UK each year and just under 42,000 of prostate cancer. Dr Jennifer Beebe-Dimmer, of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, studied the records of 78,171 women over a 16-year-period. Those with a first degree male relative – brother, father or son – were 14 per cent more likely to have developed the illness. But women with a first degree male relative with prostate cancer and mother or sister with breast cancer were 78 per cent more at risk. Those with a first degree male relative – brother, father or son – were 14 per cent more likely to have developed the illness . Dr Beebe-Dimmer said: 'The increase in breast cancer risk associated with having a positive family history of prostate cancer is modest; however, women with a family history of both breast and prostate cancer among first-degree relatives have an almost two-fold increase in risk of breast cancer. 'These findings are important in that they can be used to support an approach by clinicians to collect a complete family history of all cancers - particularly among first degree relatives - in order to assess patient risk for developing cancer . 'Families with clustering of different tumors may be particularly important to study in order to discover new genetic mutations to explain this clustering.' Dr Caitlin Barrand, Senior Policy Manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'Although we've known for some time that there are links between prostate cancer and breast cancer, this study suggests the link might be more important than we previously thought. 'If further research confirms the findings of this study this may further improve our ability to estimate an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, and offer personalised plans to help prevent the disease, or diagnose it early, when it can be more successfully treated. 'We'd recommend that women speak to their GP if they have any concerns about their family history of cancer, and advise that they should be prepared to talk about cancers on both the mother and father's side - the GP should ask about both.'","Scientists believe illnesses caused by same gene passed down families .

"Lost: Maddie McCann disappeared in Portugal eight years ago . Police chiefs have been urged to wind up the hunt for Madeleine McCann as detectives battle the terror threat and a spate of murders. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl, who vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal eight years ago. The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Yet despite costing the taxpayer £10million and dozens of trips by officers to the Algarve, the inquiry – codenamed Operation Grange – has not led to a single arrest. Now a senior police union leader has called for the probe to be axed and the detectives reassigned to other investigations in the UK. He says officers in London are bemused why they are working round-the-clock fighting the threat from Islamic State-inspired jihadists and solve at least 14 murders since Christmas while the Operation Grange detectives are barred from helping. Metropolitan Police Federation chairman John Tully said: ‘It is time to re-focus on what we need to do to keep London safe. We no longer have the resources to conduct specialist inquiries all over the world which have nothing to do with London. ’The Met has long been seen as the last resort for investigations others have struggled with elsewhere. ‘It is surprising to see an inquiry like the McCann investigation ring-fenced. I have heard a few rumblings of discontent about it from lots of sources. ‘When the force is facing a spike in murder investigations it is not surprising there is resentment of significant resources diverted to a case that has no apparent connection with London.’ Even though Madeleine’s parents Kate, 47, and Gerry, 46, live in Rothley, Leicestershire, Scotland Yard was handed the investigation because of its expertise in investigating complex murder case. Police chiefs ‘ring-fenced’ the inquiry to prevent officers working on other case, even though the force has been forced to make £600million in cuts over four years. Operation Grange was set up to review the original Portuguese police probe into the disappearance of Madeleine, then three, from the family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Maddie's disappearance after her parents, pictured above, made a personal plea to PM David Cameron in 2011 . After the Portuguese inquiry was shelved as ‘unsolved’, the McCanns, who remain convinced their daughter is alive, appealed to Mr Cameron for assistance. Since the girl, who would now be 11, vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile, killed during a botched burglary and her body dumped, snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team ravelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘There are 31 officers working on Operation Grange. Their sole investigation is the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.’","A team of 31 British detectives working to find Madeleine McCann .

"The new head of the Secret Service has admitted he has agents with a drinking problem after two were accused of crashing their car while drunk at the White House. Joseph Clancy, newly-installed director of the agency, made the admission in a stormy session in front of Congress as he tried to get their approval to build a replica White House for agents to practice protecting the president. He was told his answers were 'hogwash', berated for the string of failures by the Secret Service, and when he said he had to build the 'trust' of his employees, told bluntly by Republican Chris Stewart: 'Dude, you don't have to earn their trust. You're their boss!' Clancy also admitted he did not know about the crash for five days, and said the two staff were still being fully paid and had not yet been disciplined, although they were on administrative rather than active duty. The hearing itself was to be an exploration of Clancy's budget request for the 2016 fiscal year - including the $8 million he is asking for to build a scale replica White House. But 'the 800-pound gorilla in the room,' as Homeland Security subcommittee chairman Rep. John Carter said, was 'what happened the other night at the White House.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . A frustrated Joseph Clancy, the new Secret Service director, told Congress on Tuesday that his hands are tied and he can't fire suspected drunk-driving agents until a lengthy process plays out . A SECOND WHITE HOUSE? The Secret Service wants to build a scale model of the presidential mansion in Maryland so agents can be trained in a facility that's just like the real thing – but it probably won't include today's St. Patrick's Day fountain . Clancy had few answers to questions about an early March incident in which two agents were accused of drunk-driving a government car through a White House barricade after an after-hours party. On-duty officers at the scene, according to The Washington Post, wanted to arrest the agents and administer sobriety tests, but a supervisor overruled them and allowed the suspects to go home. Worse, they appeared to have driven over a 'suspicious package' that their fellow agents were in the process of investigating. Clancy, it emerged on Tuesday, was only told of the incident five days later. He said 'there will be accountability'. He promised new 'ethics training' and said he had moved the accused officers to 'non-supervisory' desk duty, but with 'no financial penalties' such as a salary reduction or a suspension without pay. 'It's going to take time, perhaps, to change this culture,' he said, referring to a fast-and-loose attitude inside the agency he inherited after former director Julia Pierson resigned last year. He said the Secret Service has a rule prohibiting the consumption of alcohol '10 hours before your duty assignment.' But 'we don't have protocols for off-hours' activities,' he added. 'There's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses... by using alcohol,' Clancy said, noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress. 'We've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism.' POROUS BORDER? An early March off-duty party led to an incident where the agents drove through an active crime-scene investigation and crashed through a White House barrier . Panel members were impatient when Clancy insisted he had to wait to impose discipline until his agency's Inspector General competed its own investigation. Carter, a Texas Republican, insisted that he 'terminate' them 'as punishment. ... We'll be watching. And waiting.' 'I don't care about the Office of Inspector General,' he barked. 'God love them and good luck to them. You're in charge.' 'I'm disappointed that you have not waged your own vigorous, tough investigation,' Carter lectured him. 'To say you're not investigating because you want the IG of the department to investigate is hogwash. What do you think?' Clancy suggested he had to earn agents' trust as the new director of the agency, earning a scathing response from Carter. 'Dude, you don't have to earn their trust. You're their boss!' he said. Clancy, visibly agitated and stammering, was easy pickings. 'I'm very frustrated that we didn't know about this, that I didn't know about this. I'm frustrated that we can't act until we know all the facts,' he said. 'I just don't want to act improperly too soon. Let me say this: The president, the first lady, they're safe. We've moved these individuals to administrative positions.' SECURE? The US Secret Service has come under fire after a series of embarrassing incidents that call into question its performance protecting the White House and the first famil . GRILLED: Clancy insisted that the allegedly drunk-driving officers have been moved to desk duty, but congressmen want them fired . Clancy's budget request included $8 million to build a scale model of the White House in a Maryland suburb for training purposes, in the hope that other institutional face-palm moments might not repeat themselves. In the last year a series of fence jumpers have made it onto White House grounds, including one who breached the building itself while carrying a knife in his pocket. And it took the Secret Service four days to determine that a rifleman had struck the presidential residence. 'The Secret Service currently uses a rudimentary, not-to-scale simulation of the north grounds of the White House, using bike barricades to act as the fencing,' Clancy said. 'There are no structures, vehicle gates, lighting or other aids to enhance the training simulations.' The carbon copy of America's presidential mansion, if Congress approves, would be built in Beltsville, Maryland, about 20 miles from the real White House, on 500 acres that already serve as a Secret Service training site. Kentucky Republican Rep. Hal Rogers suggested Congress will take a trust-but-verify approach to giving Clancy what he's asking for. 'We're going to provide adequate funding for your agency,' he said. 'But it's going to be on a short string. We expect results.'","Joseph Clancy was quizzed by Congress after two allegedly drunk agents crashed through White House barricades during 'suspicious package' crisis .

"A teething baby can be hard work. So spare a thought for London Zoo’s gorilla troop, whose latest addition is already showing off her first gnashers. Three-month-old Alika smiled for just long enough to let onlookers – including her mother Mjukuu, 15 – catch a glimpse of two bottom teeth poking through. Zookeeper Daniel Simmonds said: ‘Until the last few days, Mjukuu has been cradling Alika in her arms and carrying her everywhere, but we’ve now spotted her carefully placing Alika on her back, so that she can move around more freely. Scroll down for video . Baring it all: Alike the baby gorilla at London Zoo shows off her gnashers. The animal was born in December . Say cheese: Alika reclines in her mother's arm as she smiles for the camera. She is the only baby in the enclosure . ‘This, along with Alika getting her first teeth, is an exciting milestone for us, as it signals that she will soon be crawling and taking her first steps.’ Alika was born in December after spending eight and a half months in mother Mjukuu's womb. The female gorilla mated with Kumbuka’s upon his arrival in 2013. Their baby - whose name means 'most beautiful' - is Kumbuka's first offspring and a special addition to the zoo's gorilla enclosure. Baby gorillas typically spend around two months on their mother's body before they begin to move around on their own and eat solid food. Alika will be reliant on her mother for around three years before feeling confident enough to act on her own. Feeding time: Mother Mjukuu cradles the baby in the gorilla enclosure at London Zoo. Alika will spend a few months breastfeeding before being able to eat solid food . Snoozing: The new mother and her baby take a nap together with the rest of the gorillas out of sight . Keeping baby close by: Mjukuu roams around the enclosure with baby Alika tucked under her arm . Look at me: In a picture taken last month baby Alika, with her hair still growing, looks lovingly at her mother . First-time father Kumbuka has, according to keepers, taken a back-seat approach to parenting, leaving most of the hard work to Mjukuu. 'Mjukuu is a very attentive mother. Throughout the day she'll be looking at her hands, her feet, she'll be cleaning them, she'll be licking them. So she's incredibly attentive,' said Glynn Hennessy, gorilla keeper. 'She'll move her around depending on where she is on her body to be more comfortable. 'Whenever mum has something to eat you can see Alika looking at it, she does the classic baby thing where she puts her fingers in her mouth and she'll even try to go out and grab it. 'The next steps will probably be where Mum actually moves away, she's able to grab some food if mum lets her and she's able to eat some solid foods so maybe she'll just come off of mum and starts moving around on her own.'","Alika the baby silverback gorilla was born at London Zoo in December .

"A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the South Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea on Monday, generating a 'small tsunami' and frightening locals near its epicenter. The quake struck at a depth of 65 kilometers (40 miles), about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the town of Kokopo, near Rabaul, at around 10am local time, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It was followed by a 5.7-magnitude aftershock and a 1.5-foot-high tsunami, which was measured in Rabaul's harbor, near the quake's epicenter, said Martin Mose, from the National Disaster Center. But despite the quake - which was likely  felt by people up to a staggering 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away - and the subsequent tsunami, no damage nor injuries have been reported, officials said. Quake: This photo, released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shows a shakemap of the region (white cross) in Papua New Guinea where a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Monday . The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had warned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 10 feet in parts of Papua New Guinea, and waves of less than one foot in other Pacific countries. It said 'hazardous tsunami waves were possible for coasts located within 1,000 km of the earthquake epicentre along the coasts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands'. But the center lifted the warning a few hours later, after reporting a one-inch tsunami wave was measured at a wharf in the Solomon Islands, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the epicenter. A Geoscience Australia spokesman told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that while a tsunami warning had been issued for Papua New Guinea, there was no threat to Australia at the time. Target: The quake struck at a depth of 65 kilometers (40 miles), about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the town of Kokopo, near Rabaul (pictured), at around 10am local time, the U.S. Geological Survey reported . Frightening incident: The quake was followed by a 5.7-magnitude aftershock and a 1.5-foot-high tsunami, which was measured in Rabaul's harbor, near the quake's epicenter. Above, another shakemap of the region . 'We've had no reports of a tsunami being generated for local region at this stage,' he said. In Rabaul, residents noticed the sea level rose slightly, prompting ocean water to flood the parking lot of a shopping center near the beach, said Mika Tuvi, an employee at the Rabaul Hotel. 'But nothing beyond that - no damage caused,' she said. When the quake struck, guests and workers at the hotel fled outside, fearing the building would collapse, Ms Tuvi said. The tremors, which lasted for about 5 minutes, were frightening in their intensity, but the hotel withstood the shaking, she said. Location: The quake hit about 10am local time Monday and a tsunami warning has been issued in the region . No threat: On Monday, Geoscience Australia said there was no immediate threat to Australia . Officials in the capital, Port Moresby, were working to contact their counterparts in the outer provinces, but hours after the quake, there still had been no reports of damage or injuries. Mr Mose said he was confident the nation had averted a major catastrophe. The quake caused strong shaking and knocked items off shelves in Kokopo, and was felt 500 miles away in Port Moresby, said Chris McKee, assistant director of the Geophysical Observatory. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea. The country lies on the 'Ring of Fire' - an arc of earthquake and volcanic activity that stretches around the Pacific Rim.","Strong 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked Papua New Guinea on Monday .

"Former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $879,000 per year in pensions, personnel, benefits, travel and office expenses, and Bill Clinton's cumulative near-$16 million total is bringing him new scrutiny as his wife makes the case for a White House run of her own. Daily Mail Online reported Clinton's take in 2014, amounting to slightly less than $1.14 million per year, based on a paper from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS). That amount is still less than George W. Bush's $1.18 million annual haul. But since Clinton has had an eight-year head start, his overall benefits are the highest by far, totalling $15,938,000 since he left the White House in January 2001. His disbursement each year from the General Services Administration includes $96,000 for salaries; insiders told Politico that some of that money has been passed through to staffers at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE CRS REPORT . KA-CHING: Bill Clinton costs taxpayers more than $1 million every year even though he and Hillary are worth more than $100 million . ART SUBSIDY: George W. Bush has taken up painting in his post-presidency, and taxpayers are buying the brushes and canvases . 'GSA does not dictate the number of staff for whom the allocation is used,' a foundation spokesperson told the inside-the-beltway newspaper. The foundation also insisted the Bill Clinton's personal funds, not taxpayer dollars, paid for the now-infamous private email server that his wife Hillary used exclusively while secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday during a contentious press conference in New York City that the former president set up the server for his own staff's use, and she began using it later. As she ramps up for a presidential campaign, critics have piled on with accusations that she intentionally avoided using a government-issued email address while she was the nation's top diplomat in order to hide electronic communications from State Department archivists. But she insisted on Tuesday that decision was made purely for 'convenience.' The larger question raised by Politico is whether it's appropriate for tax dollars to subsidize the salaries of nonprofit employees while their work is leveraged to support a potential presidential candidate. While Bill Clinton has received more post-White House cash overall than any other living former president, George W. Bush’s annual numbers are the highest . The Clinton Foundation is now Hillary's principal political messenger in the public sphere. Although its work doesn't include overt politicking or political campaigning, there's no mistaking that the public sees what Washington wags call 'Clinton, Inc.' – the amalgamation of the family's political, commercial and philanthropic arms – as a single entity. Sources also told Politico that staffers whose compensation straddles Bill Clinton's foundation purse and his government benefits include former White House aide Doug Band and senior Clinton Foundation staffer Laura Graham. The paper also speculated that Tina Flournoy, a former union official who is now Bill Clinton's chief of staff and advised Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, has followed suit. New York Magazine observed Flournoy's arrival at the foundation in 2012 'as Hillary's planting a sentinel' there. Annual payments to former U.S. chief executives are guaranteed by the Former Presdients Act of 1958, a law passed in response to the predicament of former president Harry S. Truman, who fell on hard times after he moved from Washington back to Missouri. At the time, Truman had to take out a personal loan from a Missouri bank to pay his bills. Today the law provides payments to Clinton, Bush, his father George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter. WHICH WAY TO THE GRAVY TRAIN? Barack Obama is set to reap an annual windfall beginning in 2017 that will dwarf his current $400,000 salary . Former US presidents receive millions of dollars over the course of their post-office years, including living examples Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush and his father George  H.W. Bush . The Clintons' burgeoning personal wealth, including a mammoth $15 million advance for Hillary's memoir 'Hard Choices' and a string of six-figure speaking fees for her and Bill, have raised questions about whether 21st-century former presidents still need to be on the government dole. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, now chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, introduced a bill in 2012 called the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act to reform the practice. The legislation, which never received a positive committee vote, would have capped the government's total annual spending on former presidents to $400,000 each. And that amount would have been reduced dollar-for-dollar by any money they earned. Under those guidelines, Clinton would have received nothing during most of his post-presidency. His earnings for individual speeches have reportedly topped $500,000. Tax returns the Clintons released in 2010 showed a total of $111 million in earnings from 2000 through 2007. 'Nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute,"" Chaffetz said when he floated his bill three years ago, 'but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor.' 'Reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees, these men are making millions of dollars a year. There's little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they're doing fine on their own.' His spokespersons did not respond to a request for comment about whether he has plans to use his influential platform to reintroduce the bill in the current Congress. Jimmy Carter, who left office in 1981, spends the least among the four living former presidents. The GSA budgeted $466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014. Former Presidents' Pensions, Office Allowances, And Other Federal Benefits uploaded by DailyMail.com .","The Former Presdients Act provides pensions and office expenses for Clinton, both Bushes and Jimmy Carter .

"Most toddlers are very good at belly aching for sweets and dragging their feet on a supermarket trip. Michael McBride, however, is more of a help than a hindrance to his mother – making sure she gets the right change at the checkout. The three-year-old spends his time calculating the cost of groceries as he marches around the aisles adding up the weekly food basket. Scroll down for video . Michael McBride is just three years old and can already count to 10 in four languages, including Russian and Japanese and do his 14 times table. He has an IQ of 145 - just a few points off the level required for Mensa . Michael's mother Emma Greenwood (right) said they started to realise his intellectual skills when he began learning words and numbers from her iPad when he was just 18 months old, now he calculates her bills . Not that his talents stop there. While most children of his age can only count to five, he has taught himself how to count to ten in four languages – English, Spanish, Russian and Japanese – and learnt his 14 times table. In fact he has an IQ of 145 and is already close to qualifying for Mensa. Tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight and one expert was amazed at how he could converse like an adult. Michael has never had any formal tutoring and instead started to teach himself numbers and words on his mother’s iPad. He quickly learnt how to read eight-letter words and now corrects mother Emma, 39, if she misreads his bedtime story book. Yet his family say he also loves riding his bike and splashing in puddles like any other young boy. Mother-of-two Emma, a postal worker from Yate, Bristol, said: ‘We don’t push him because we are content to let him be himself – but he just teaches himself. Michael can read to himself and experts said his scores for logical thinking 'hit the ceiling' when tested . ‘He is quite fascinated by numbers, and also loves big words. ‘His English is very good, but he is like a sponge and his retention is brilliant.’ Emma and husband Anthony, 33, a chef, first noticed Michael’s talent when he was 18 months old and started to learn from educational games on the iPad. But soon he was asking questions his family couldn’t answer. Michael’s grandmother Jenny Greenwood took him to a specialist in Birmingham and tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight – and an IQ of 145. The UK average is 104. She said: ‘In the last few weeks he has been obsessed with the planets, learning all the names and where they are.’ Michael’s parents have not submitted him for Mensa membership because they feel he is too young, although the youngest-ever member was just two years and four months-old. Membership of the society is reserved for those with an IQ in the top 2 per cent of the population, around 148. IQ can change over time but most will not change by more than a few points. The score will usually stay the same as it is a measure of ability rather than knowledge. Dr Peter Congdon, who performed intelligence tests on Michael, said he was ‘in the very superior range’ and should jump a year at school so he is not held back. He said: ‘He is outstanding, there is no doubt about it.’ The three-year-old can spell eight word letters on his own, spelling words he has never seen come across . As well as doing his times tables and learning several languages, Michael likes doing 'normal' things for his age like splashing in puddles. The youngster (pictured) has taught himself by using his mother's iPad . Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. The society welcomes people from all backgrounds who have an IQ is in the top two per cent of the population. Albert Einstein apparently had an IQ of 160, while former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton also racked up very high IQs - mustering 128, 160 and 137 respectively. Napoleon Bonaparte scored 145 and Sigmund Freud had a score of 156. There are currently more than 1,000 members of Mensa aged under 18. Children under the age of 10-and-a-half can join Mensa by submitting prior evidence of their IQ score being in the top two per cent. Adults and children over the age of 10-and-a-half, take the Mensa Supervised IQ Test. The youngest person to ever join British Mensa was Elise Tan Roberts in 2009 aged 2 years and four months.","Michael McBride is three-years-old and can already count to 10 in Russian .

"A 20-year-old mother who had allegedly decapitated her three-month-old baby girl was suffering from post-partum depression and 'speaking of demons', family members said on Tuesday. Deasia Watkins, from College Hill, Ohio, was charged with aggravated murder after she was found inside a home with her dead baby lying on a counter early on Monday. Police said baby Janiyah was killed by 'homicidal violence', but sources told Fox19 that the child's head had been severed. The coroner reportedly said on Tuesday that the baby suffered multiple stab wounds to the face and a fractured right arm. This is the poor three-month-old baby girl Janiyah who was decapitated, allegedly by her mother Deasia Watkins on Monday . Family members found the baby dead on Watkins' counter. Authorities say the child died from 'homicidal violence' Deasia Watkins, 20, allegedly severed her three-month-old baby girl's head on Monday . The young woman's aunt Caretha White told Fox that  Hamilton County family services had failed the child by allowing Deasia, who suffered from depression following the baby's birth in December, to care for her. Hamilton County Job and Family Services (HCJFS) declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Ms White also said that another relative had been given temporary custody of the child and Miss Watkins was told to keep away. A cousin told Cincinnati.com that he had spoken to the child's father, who claimed the new mom had been 'acting crazy... speaking of demons'. A juvenile court judge ordered HCJFS to take custody of the baby on March 6 after the young mom was hospitalized for psychiatric problems. On January 25, police reportedly went to her apartment to find the baby crying and the 20-year-old screaming. Officers allegedly that Watkins smelled of marijuana and refused to hand over the baby. When they took her daughter she 'passed out with her eyes open', according to Cincinnati.com. A group of children raised the alarm around 6am on Monday after finding Watkins with the baby's body inside the home, WKRC reported. Her relationship to the children is not known. Police had cordoned off the home with crime scene tape on Monday. 'She must have been out of her mind. I heard she cut the baby's head off,' neighbor Jimmie Graham said on Monday. Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities say . The murdered baby was found inside this College Hill, Ohio home around 6am on Monday and Watkins was taken to hospital for mental evaluation. She was charged with aggravated murder on Tuesday . Watkins was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for a mental evaluation. According to court records, the 20-year-old was diagnosed with post-partum psychosis. Hamilton County Juvenile Court records revealed that Janiyah had been placed in the custody of Job & Family Services on March 6 after a complaint filed by the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office last month, WCPO reported. That complaint claimed that the baby girl was neglected. It was unclear how the mother regained custody of the child, but WKRC reported that she had been placed with a family member. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs. Relatives were seen visiting the home where the child's body was found on Monday. It was not known if Watkins lived at the address. Property records last place her living at an apartment 10 miles away from the murder scene. WCPO reported that the young mother's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct. The Cincinnati Police Department Homicide Unit and the coroner's office were investigating.","Deasia Watkins was found with her daughter's murdered body inside a home in College Hill, Ohio on Monday .

"From huddling together to watch a beautiful sunset to enjoying a burger at McDonald's to celebrate their birthdays, these are the inseparable sheepdog sisters whose owner documents every aspect of their lives together. Amateur photographer Cees Bol, from Sibculo, the Netherlands, takes pictures of his dogs Sophie, six, and four-year-old Sarah every day, posting them on social media for the pets' online followers. But instead of capturing the animals going for walks or fetching sticks, the 46-year-old and his partner Hannake snap their beloved English Sheepdogs in an adorable series of human scenarios. Scroll down for video . Old English sheepdogs Sophie and Sarah huddle together to watch the sun go down in a picture taking by their Dutch owner Cees Bol . Mr Bol takes adorable pictures of his pets every single day and posts them to social media, where the dogs now have an online following . Mr Bol says the main reason why he continues to snap pictures of his beloved pets is because he likes putting a smile on people's faces .

"Dozens of soldiers from a battalion famous for using the emblem of a vicious comic book avenger to strike fear into the enemy in Afghanistan are heading to Iraq with ISIS in their sights. The Telemark Battalion is an elite mechanised infantry unit of the Norwegian Army which has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003. Around 50 soldiers from Telemark will be heading to the city of Irbil in northern Iraq to train Kurdish forces to help them in their fight against Islamic State, the Norwegian ministry of defence has confirmed. It is thought the mission will begin in early April. Scroll down for video . The patch worn by Telemark Battalion soldiers (left), recalls the Punisher symbol of Marvel's comic book vigilante (right), with the words 'Jokke - we will never forget' honoring fallen comrade Claes Joachim Olsson . A Telemark soldier in action in Afghanistan. The battalion has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003 and lost two soldiers in the conflict, including Olsson . ISIS fighters in Aleppo, Syria. Telemark troops are travelling to northern Iraq to train Kurdish Peshmerga forces in their fight against the extremists . Some instructors will also be sent to the Iraqi capital Baghdad in the hopes of stemming an insurgency which now controls large tracts of northern Iraq and Syria. The Telemark Battalion attracted headlines in 2010 when reports emerged some of its soldiers were spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban. The Punisher is a Marvel Comics antihero and vigilante who slaughters criminals and mobsters and has a striking skull-shaped emblem. Since the death of Claes Joachim Olsson - known by his nickname 'Jokke' - in January 2010, some members of the unit took to wearing patches featuring the Punisher logo and the words 'Jokke - we will never forget'. The 22-year-old was killed when the storm tank he was travelling in was hit by a Taliban roadside bomb southeast of the village of Ghowrmach in northwest Afghanistan.

The insignia of the Telemark Battalion (left), which was lead by the fierce Major Rune Wenneberg (right) Telemark soldiers in Afghanistan, where they became famous for spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban . The wearing of Punisher patches was subsequently banned by the Norwegian military leadership, though some soldiers reportedly continued to do so. Following Olsson's death a video emerged of company commander Major Rune Wenneberg firing up his troops with a rousing battle cry name-checking Valahalla, the mystical hall of Norse mythology where specially chosen warriors go after they've been killed in combat. During the footage Wenneberg reportedly cries: 'You are the predator. Taliban is the prey. To Valhalla!', as his troops punch their weapons in the air in support. One former soldier knows who firsthand how ferocious Telemark fighters can be is American Charles Stanley, who helped provide logistics for units from the Norwegian battalion when they underwent two weeks of cold weather training in preparation for deployment to Bosnia in the late 1990s. The 51-year-old, who is a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, told MailOnline they would be a fierce asset to Kurdish Peshmerga troops in their efforts to combat murderous extremists. He said: 'ISIS should fear them for sure. They didn't hold back in work or play and when they went to the task of battle that was all of the business they cared for until the mission was completed. An Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighter is pictured in September 2014 firing at Islamic State positions from the top of Mount Zardak, 25  kilometres east of Mosul in northern Iraq. Fighters like him are soon to benefit from the expertise of the Telemark Battalion - some of the fiercest soldiers in the world . ISIS fighters on the march. Charles Stanley, a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, says the jihadists should fear the Norwegian forces being sent to aid their Kurdish enemies . ISIS has now expanded its reach across much of northern Iraq and holds the city of Mosul, around 90 kilometres from the Kurdistan capital Irbil, to where the 50 Telemark soldiers are being sent . 'ISIS is a force of uncontrolled chaos and they have no discipline or defined battlefield strategy other than overcome by force. 'This well-trained and disciplined unit of Norwegian soldiers would be able to make very short work of any ISIS soldiers they encountered.' Now a director of technology at a Catholic high school in Modesto, California, Mr Stanley added: 'My take on them is that they were a very aggressive and rugged team of warriors. 'They had the attitude of whatever comes our way we will demolish it, be that from eating chow to driving their mechanised vehicles. 'There was no half way with them - it was all or nothing in everything they did. I have a long history with airborne paratroopers and they are some of the toughest soldiers in the army, on and off duty - they train hard and play even harder. 'The Telemark Battalion guys were every bit if not more rough and tumble. 'I would say compared to other country's soldiers they were among some of the most competitive and competent warriors that I have ever worked with. 'When we were in [Operation] Desert Storm [against Saddam Hussein in 1990] their equivalent would have possibly been the French Foreign Legion soldiers as far as ferocity and competence goes.' American Sniper Chris Kyle, who had his own take on the Punisher symbol, which can be seen here on his cap . Kyle's logo, with the Punisher skull and cross hairs . The 11-year veteran of the 82nd Airborne and father-of-one, whose son is currently serving in the US Army, says the Punisher symbol was not being used when he worked with the soldiers. He said: 'That incident didn't happen until later in Afghanistan and I was aware of it and heard the stories. 'That type of scare tactic has been employed for many years by many armies - the Vietnam War had its death card ace of spades, and now they have moved to spray-painted skulls and comic book reference symbols. 'Chris Kyle the American Sniper had his also.' Kyle is known for using a variation of the Punisher symbol himself, featuring the words 'Despite what your momma told you...violence does solve problems'. The Telemark saboteurs back in Britain after the incredible raid. Six Norwegian soldiers destroyed Hitler's nuclear dream in February 1943 at the Norsk Hydro plant near the town of Rjukan, Norway . The Telemark Battalion share a name with a group of legendary Second World War saboteurs. The Heroes of Telemark (pictured), carried out a famous raid which helped thwart Hitler's plans to build a Nazi nuclear bomb. The team successfully destroyed a heavy water production facility at the Norsk Hydoelectric plant in Telemark, a region of southern Norway, in 1943. The raid, which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in the whole war, was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross-country skiing 250 miles into Sweden. The heavy water or deuterium oxide which the Norsk plant produced, was essential to the German scientists working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to destroy it. It was no soft target. Perched on an icy ravine, surrounded by machine gun-toting guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable. But the six-man all Norwegian squad from the Special Operations Executive, trained at Brickendonbury in Hertfordshire, managed to parachute in and get the job done. In what was known as Operation Gunnerside, the raiders broke into the plant and set charges, the explosion of which caused 1000lbs of heavy water to wash away. They then made their remarkable escape, imortalised in the 1964 Hollywood film The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas.","Telemark Battalion is an elite mechanised Norwegian Army infantry unit .

He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice and was released early this morning - he has not yet entered a plea to the charges. On Wednesday night,  a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for Johnson. Johnson, who had 10 stitches across his forehead, joined the protests last night, although he did not refer directly to the incident on advice of his lawyer. 'Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects to please respect everyone up here, we're all part of one community,' he told the crowd. People take to the streets to protest - it is thought they were separate to the students . The hashtag #JusticeForMartese was posted some 70,000 times on Twitter .

'And we deserve to respect each other especially in times like this, thank you.' He kept touching his face where he received stitches from the early Wednesday morning scuffle with police and there are reports that he began to cry and wipe away tears as crowd cheers in support. School President Theresa Sullivan made a brief appearance on the grassy field, but only spoke to several reporters and did not make any formal remarks to the crowd. The hashtag #JusticeForMartese was posted some 70,000 times on Twitter and a crowd later marched through Charlottesville, some bearing signs with 'Black Lives Matter' and made their way to police headquarters, according to  WVIR. A video tweeted from the protest shows a female demonstrator, chanting in a crowd. When she appears to ignore a police officer and pushes him away from her, she is grabbed by the throat and pulled to the ground by the cop as she cried out. Knocked down: A video shows at least three officers kneeling over Johnson while he's pinned to the ground, and bleeding from a gash on his head . Martese Johnson is an honor student at the prestigious university. He was left with 10 stitches following the altercation with police .

How did this happen? UVA student Bryan Beaubrun said he was with Johnson and photographed the arrest. Beaubrun said Johnson was trying to get into the Trinity Irish Pub when he was stopped by a bouncer. Then, an ABC officer grabbed Johnson by the arm and pulled him away from the bar to speak with a group of police officers, Beaubrun said. After about a minute, Beaubrun said, Johnson asked the ABC officer to let go of his arm and tried pulling away from the officer. At that point, another ABC officer grabbed Johnson from behind and the two ABC officers wrestled Johnson to the ground, Beaubrun said. Busted up: Johnson is shown in his booking photo with blood coming from his forehead, which required 10 stitches to close, according to a statement from Concerned Black Students .

Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year . The University of Virginia fraternity was hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article. A police investigation  turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault. Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year. All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports. However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident. D'Agostino heir commits suicide . Peter D'Agostino, 20, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound . Tragedy struck the already reeling University of Virginia campus in November when a 20-year-old student and heir to New York City supermarket fortune committed suicide. Peter D'Agostino, 20, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was the great-grandson of New York City supermarket chain founder Nicholas D'Agostino Sr. He said Johnson hit his head on the ground when he was tackled and that police acted with unnecessary force. 'He didn't need to be tackled. He wasn't being aggressive at all,' Beaubrun said. Governor Terry McAuliffe's office released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. McAuliffe said he is 'concerned by the reports of this incident' at UVA - which is one of the most prestigious public universities in the country. Daniel Watkins, an attorney for Johnson, said in a statement that Charlottesville Police charged Johnson with two misdemeanors: obstruction of justice without force and profane swearing and/or intoxication in public. The student was released early this morning and has not yet entered a plea to the charges. 'Contrary to early police reports, Mr. Johnson has not been accused of possessing false identification. 'Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head,' Watkins said. 'This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese's physical wounds are beginning to heal.' He added: 'He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record. 'As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,' Watkins said. 'I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. 'Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time.' Though he's a college junior, Johnson is under the legal drinking age. According to Charlottesville General District Court records, Johnson was charged with obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication. He was treated at the hospital before being released. University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as 'appalling' and said the student's head was 'slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.' 'This was wrong and should not have occurred,' Martin and Apprey said in a written statement. 'We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.' The ABC issued a statement saying that 'uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached' an unidentified individual 'after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment' about 12:45 a.m. at an area of bars and restaurants near campus known as 'the Corner.' The ABC said the unidentified individual received injuries while being arrested and was treated at a local hospital before being released. The ABC said the agents involved with the arrest are being restricted to administrative duties while a state police investigation is underway. ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past. The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer. Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for beer. According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers. Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped.","Martese Johnson, a junior,  was arrested after being denied entry a bar .

"New pictures of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz as a smiling schoolboy have emerged - on the day Lufthansa Airlines admitted they knew six years ago that he suffered from a 'serious depressive episode'. The airline said that as part of its internal research it found emails Lubitz sent to the Lufthansa flight school in Bremen when he resumed his training there after an interruption of several months. In them he informed the school that he had suffered a 'serious depressive episode' which had since subsided. Scroll down for videos . Andreas Lubitz (pictured front row, seated left) in a class picture in 2002 with fellow pupils at the Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School, in Montabaur, Germany - the picture is from a 2002 year book . Andreas Lubitz with class mates in 1999 at the Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany. (He is pictured with curtain style haircut and squared patterned top) The airline said Lubitz subsequently passed all medical checks and that it has provided the documents to prosecutors. It declined to make any further comment today. Questions have been raised about what the airline knew about Lubitz's condition before last week's fatal crash. Authorities say the 27-year-old, who in the past had been treated for suicidal tendencies, locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing the Airbus 320 into a mountain in the French Alps. Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany, which Andreas Lubitz attended as a child . All 150 people aboard Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf were killed that day. Earlier today Lufthansa said it had set aside £203million to deal with possible costs from the March 24 crash. Meanwhile pictures of Lubitz at various ages while a pupil at Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany, were released today - the same day it emerged Lubitz's girlfriend knew he had psychological issues.. Kathrin Goldbach reportedly told investigators she 'did not know the extent of the problems' despite her boyfriend seeing doctors a number of times in the months leading up to the disaster. Prosecutors said he had been treated for suicidal tendencies as a younger man and had been seen by doctors for depression on at least three occasions since February. He had also been to see an eye specialist over fears he was going blind, a condition that could have seen him stripped of his licence. The girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) knew he had psychological issues but the couple 'were optimistic' they could work through them, according to a source close to the investigation . Investigators are now increasingly certain this was the prime motive for his act of suicide and mass murder. But Miss Goldbach is said to be as shocked as anyone that his mental health problems would lead to him deliberately crashing his jet, killing all 150 people on board. A European government official close to the probe told CNN that Miss Goldbach knew he had seen two doctors - an eye consultant and a neuropsychologist - who both deemed him unfit for work. The eye doctor had diagnosed his failing eyesight as merely psychosomatic, the source added, confirming previous reports that the condition was not physical at all. He was given sick notes - found torn up at his home in Dusseldorf - and ordered by doctors to take time off work. But he feared this would increase his chances of being grounded, so he hid his sickness from his employers. Military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the Germanwings plane crash in Seyne-les-Alpes . Calling for change: Anneli Tiirik with her boyfriend Paul Bramley, who died in the Alps plane disaster . The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots. At present, airlines carry out regular checks on their pilots, but this often just involves a brief chat with a doctor to assess their wellbeing. Anneli Tiirik, who is from Estonia, told MailOnline: 'Besides general physical, psychological and behavioural evaluation, another test should be added, I believe, to help avoid more deaths in the future. '(This should be) a neurological PET scan to discover and attentively observe psychopathic tendencies, so as to find out whether the subject is prone to violence and therefore not be given the extensive power that would most likely lead to harming other people. 'It is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive, but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand.' Ms Tiirik also called for laws to be relaxed to allow doctors greater freedoms to flag up patients with mental health problems if they are responsible for the live of others. German law meant it was left entirely up to Andreas Lubitz to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. She said: 'I personally think that the problem doesn't lie in the management of the airline as much as in the general tendency of the society to be overly protective about people's medical data. 'It is visible to everyone if somebody has a serious physical illness, but when it comes to major mental problems, these are hidden away at any cost for fear of embarrassment or judgement. 'However, those are illnesses as well and should be treated and inspected accordingly, especially when it comes to job positions regarding huge responsibilities.' Her boyfriend, Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with her. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days' holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family. By Richard Spillett . Passengers watch candles and flowers for the victims of the Germanwings plane crash at Dusseldorf airport . In a separate development, officials say it looks more and more likely that his primary motive for crashing the jet was due to his false fears about his failing eyesight. Bild newspaper, quoting a source close to the investigation, reported the official as saying: 'A main motive seems to be the fear that Lubitz had of losing his ability to fly because of medical problems.' Prosecutors hinted at this on Monday, but said trawls of his paperwork and computer files could not pin down a precise cause. However, there is speculation in Germany that the Germanwings marque may not survive the tsunami of lawsuits which are expected to be unleashed upon it. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent. With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege.","New pictures of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz as a schoolboy have emerged .

"The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth grader with Asperger's syndrome has been sentenced to taken into the state's juvenile jail system for treatment. The eighth grader, whose name has not been released, admitted to savagely beating Blake Kitchen, 12, in their school's lunchroom. He was was told by the judge to get his anger under control and to change his behavior during a hearing on Thursday at Clay Count family court. The teen will be assessed by Missouri youth workers to determine what kind of treatment he will receive while in the custody of the state-run agency, which is for youths placed by juvenile courts, according to the Kansas City Star. Scroll down for video . The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome will be taken into custody by the state's youth services division for treatment. The teen, whose name has not been released, admitted to striking Blake Kitchen (above), 12, in their school's lunchroom last month . In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School . 'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County. 'Their goal is to get these kids turned around so they can make better choices before they hit adulthood.' In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School. Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him. 'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.' Blake (pictured left and right) has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning . Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said. 'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. His injuries have left him facing a second surgery and he is still unable to return to school but is trying to keep up online. Prior to the incident, Blake's parents  sent a certified letter to the school's principal  complaining about the same boy bullying Blake's older brother. Programs have been put in place following the incident to address bullies and other serious issues, Liberty superintendent Jeremy Tucker (above) announced on Thursday . The Liberty School District is still evaluating the attack and bullying present in its schools (above Liberty Middle School) 'It could have been avoided,' said Destiny. She said that she hopes the teen gets the help that he needs so that he does not harm anyone else. The eighth grader was arrested and referred to juvenile court following the incident, said Liberty police Capt. Andy Hedrick. At the time of the hearing on Thursday, he was still in juvenile custody. During the proceeding, the teen's lawyer, Gregory Culotta, said the boy and his family are very sorry for what happened, according to KMBC. He also mentioned that his client suffered at the hands of some bullying himself for nearly a year at school and on the bus.

"U.S. real estate investor Blackstone Group said Monday that it is buying the iconic 110-story Willis Tower in Chicago, the second-tallest building in the United States. Blackstone gave no price for the purchase from the current owners, 233 South Wacker LLC, but various U.S. media reports put the deal at $1.3billion. Known for most of its existence as the Sears Tower, the 1,451ft building was the tallest building in the world for a quarter-century after its completion in 1973. Blackstone Group announced on Monday that it is buying Chicago's Sears Tower (center), reportedly for $1.3billion . The building's Skydeck on the 103rd floor is a tourist attraction that allows people to look out into Chicago from all directions . Today it ranks tenth, according to The Skyscraper Center. The title of the tallest building in the United States went to One World Trade Center in New York, completed two years ago. The glass cubes on the Skydeck extend out over the building. More than 1.5million people visit the tourist attraction each year . The Willis Tower's Skydeck, located on the 103rd floor, is a popular tourist attraction. It provides 1.6 million visitors a year with views of Chicago and the surrounding area including from the 'Ledge,' glass cubes which extend from the building. Jacob Werner, a managing director in Blackstone's real estate group, said in a statement on Monday that Blackstone sees 'great potential in further improving both the building's retail operations and the tourist experience for one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Chicago'. 'We are delighted to be acquiring this iconic building on behalf of our limited partners,' Werner added. 'We are bullish on Chicago as companies expand within and move into the city and look for first-class office space.' Construction efforts for the tower started in 1970 and it was completed in 1973, according to the tower's website. The Skydeck officially opened to the public in 1974 and underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 2000. The tower was officially renamed the Willis Tower in 2009 after Willis North America, an insurance brokerage that is a tenant in the tower, bought the naming rights. The purchase adds 3.8million square feet of space  to New York-based Blackstone's huge investment portfolio of real estate and related businesses around the world, including Hilton Worldwide, Invitation Homes, and Chinese shopping malls owner SCP. Blackstone says in all it has $81billion in investor capital under management.","Blackstone Group said Monday it is buying the 110-story building .

"Varifocal lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair . A price war has been triggered by Asda as it claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year. Varifocal lenses are worn by those who need help both with long distances, for example when driving, and reading, due to eye deteroriation which generally occurs with age. The lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair. However, Asda is challenging the High Street by offering varifocal lenses for the same price as single prescription versions, starting at just £40. The chain will also sell a designer frame option at £70, with two pairs for £99, and a premium range for £100, with two pairs for £159. Asda found that designer frames with varifocal lenses cost up to £398 at Optical Express, £240 at Boots, £211 at Vision Express with UV protection, £188 at Specsavers and £175 at Tesco Opticians. Asda calculated the figure of £144 million by working out the difference in price between its varifocal lenses and competitiors’, judged against the fact that three million pensioners bought varifocal lenses in the last 12 months, according to the Mintel Optical Goods Retailing report. Asda’s director for optical healthcare, Linsey Taylor, said: ‘We have been shocked at how much the optical industry is currently charging its customers for varifocal prescriptions.’ Asda claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year and is now offering them from from £40 . Last night a spokesman for Optical Express said that none of the 20 Asda Opticians it called yesterday sold the same brand of products that it sells. Vision Express chief executive Jonathan Lawson said it sells varifocal glasses ‘from as little as £79’. Boots said it gives all customers who qualify for NHS vouchers free varifocal lenses. Specsavers accused Asda of ‘confusing the issue’ and said it sells varifocal lenses for £69. Tesco did not respond to requests for comment.","Asda claims the elderly are ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144m a year .

"Despite the fact it's illegal in the UK, at least 65,000 British girls are at risk of having Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) as they are taken out of the country during so called 'cutting season' aka the school holidays. The procedure - which involves having parts of their vagina cut out and then then sewn back together again - is usually performed before a girl turns 12 and is carried out without anesthetic or sterilised equipment. Many of the girls are too scared to admit they have suffered FGM and can be stigmatised by their community for speaking out. Scroll down for video . Leyla Hussein is an FGM survivor who wants to prevent other girls suffering like she has . But a number of British victims have come forward to talk about their experience - and call for it to be stopped once and for all - in a new documentary for Comic Relief. Recalling the moment she was cut, one of the women Leyla Hussein, 32, from London, said: 'Your whole body is in pain, the scream that you scream meant I lost my voice for a couple of days. 'The moment your genitals are cut, a part of your soul dies.' Another British survivor interviewed for the documentary said: 'I don't think there's any word I can use to describe that moment. They grab you with a woman holding each leg and another holding your head and chest so you can't move.' The practice first began in ancient Egypt and remains a rite of passage in many African and Middle Eastern countries and some parts of Asia. Parents cut their daughters because they believe that this will allow her to be accepted into society and improve her marriage prospects. A girl who is uncut is often seen unclean and sexually promiscuous. The idea that FGM is necessary and makes a woman more virtuous and attractive is so ingrained in some communities that mothers who have endured it themselves - and continue to live with the physical and mental consequences - will still happily arrange for their daughters to suffer the same fate. Nimco Ali was subjected to FGM as a child and said many British girls are at risk . Leyla explains: 'The cutting season in the UK means holidays. If you don't get this done, you won't be married to the right family so your status is questioned.' The anonymous victim added: 'It's a business for the person doing the cutting and the family as once the child has been through FGM, whoever they will marry will pay a higher dowry, it's all about money.' Actress Zawe Ashton, who presents the BBC documentary, flew to Kenya to meet one of the women making money as a result of cutting thousands of girls who are taken to her from around the world. Despite suffering the pain of FGM herself as a child, the elderly cutter said she's happy to cut others - using a pair of sharp scissors she carries around in her handbag. She said families from across the UK, Europe and America travel to Kenya for her services. The cutter said: 'When I had FGM I was cut with thorns, I can still feel it now. Then they used thorns to stitch me back up.' Justifying why she now inflicts this on other girls, she said: 'The girls father gives permission, the mother as well, her whole community gives permission and I get paid.' She added why her community believe FGM to be so important: 'If the girls aren't cut, they will start to love and start to chase men, they should be cut before they are 12 otherwise they will start to get horny. 'Our tradition is to cut them and make them bleed to calm them down. If you don't cut them, they will think about pleasure all the time, they can't help themselves.' Pleasure has been far from the mind of Hoda, 23, a British resident Zawe meets who had type 3 FGM when she was a child. After she was cut, she was sewn back up with and left with a hole no bigger than matchstick that has left her with a host of health problems - and infertile. She said: 'I was seven when I was cut. I remember everything. It happened, I was cut and I got this pain every night, abdominal pain.' Actress Zawe Ashton, right, travelled to Kenya for a BBC documentary to meet Agnes Pareyio, left, the founder of Comic Relief funded project which helps girls escape FGM . Hoda's stomach pains where due to the fact she couldn't have a normal period because of the tiny hole she had been left with. Blood that was supposed to leave her body remained trapped inside causing internal damage. She has had a number of operations to try and restore her health and wellbeing but will never be able to have children. Now married to a man she met in the UK, Hoda said she feels guilty she will never be able to have a family with the man she loves. Leyla also has to live with the mental as well as physical consequences of her FGM. She said: 'I live at home with a panic alarm, I have to carry a personal alarm with me wherever I go, it's difficult.' She added that many people may be surprised to learn she's a victim of FGM because of her western appearance but she said many British girls like her are at risk. She said: 'There's this code of silence, I associate it with the Mafia. We describe ourselves as the ""Topshop FGM"" survivors. We are High Street girls so don't narrow it to one particular image.' The documentary reveals how many are duped into travelling out of Britain when they are young as they are told they are going on holiday or to a party. Nimco Ali, 31, who lives in London, campaigns against FGM after having it done to herself as a child, agreed that the practice is more rife in the UK than people realise. She said: 'Many are afraid to speak out as there is that fear of being judged. Everyone thinks it's not the girl in Manchester, in Cardiff or London being taken away and having FGM but it's exactly these girls, they are not girls who are immigrants or here on holiday. Zawe with some of the children who are being helped by the Comic Relief supported project in Kenya . 'They are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on Oxford Street but you don't know they have just been through FGM.' The documentary reveals the steps that are being taken to try and stop the practice continuing. In an East London school, FGM workshops are held to educate  young men and women on why it's wrong, while border police operate at airports to try and stop girls they deem to be at risk leaving the country. Nine new Red Nose characters, pictured, are available for shoppers to collect in the run up to Red Nose Day on Friday 13th March. At least 60p from each £1 Nose goes to help transform the lives of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in the UK and across Africa. Sainsbury’s is the official retailer of Red Noses and Red Nose Day merchandise . Zawe sees that change is also happening in Kenya where it has also been made illegal and where education is helping to empower girls and break the cycle of FGM. In Narok, Kenya, where up to 95 per cent of girls have undergone FGM in traditional Maasai tribes, one of the world's leading anti-FGM campaigners, Agnes Pareyio, runs a rescue centre for girls who rebel against FGM. The centre gives the girls a safe home, food, clothes and an education. Comic Relief is supporting their fight against FGM as well as those working to end it in the UK. More than 30 grassroots projects have been aided by from Comic Relief - who will push to raise more much needed money this Red Nose Day on Friday.

"The real-life Wolf of Wall Street has defended his upcoming Masters of Wealth speaking tour where he will teach Australians how to 'ethically' make money - while he is still paying back more than $98 million he owes to investors. Jordan Belfort, whose debaucherous rise to riches at the helm of stockbroking firm Stratton Oakmont was portrayed in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film, is preparing to run a series of workshops in Sydney and Melbourne in March. These include one day talks and a $2497 three-day boot camp teaching wealth-seekers the secrets of persuasion and success. The real-life Wolf of Wall Street has defended his upcoming Masters of Wealth speaking tour where he will teach Australians how to 'ethically' make money . Jordan Belfort's debaucherous rise to riches at the helm of stockbroking firm Stratton Oakmont was portrayed by Leonardo di Caprio (pictured) in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film . Stratton Oakmont investors – who lost about $200 million through the firm's stock price manipulation in the late 1980s and 1990s – are still waiting on Belfort to repay in full the $110 million in restitution that he was ordered to pay when convicted of fraud and money laundering in 2004. A CNBC profile on Belfort, which aired on Thursday night in the U.S., said Belfort had still paid less than $12 million. But Belfort defended his suitability to give the workshops he says will help Australian business owners and investors 'take their wealth to the next level'. 'I don't see what I did 25 years ago has to do with what I do today,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have an ability to help and motivate and train and power entrepreneurs and sales people.' Belfort defended his suitability to give the workshops he says will help Australian business owners and investors 'take their wealth to the next level' Stratton Oakmont investors lost about $200 million through the firm's stock price manipulation in the late 1980s and 1990s . He said it was a 'fallacy' that he had not paid back the U.S. government-ordered restitution. 'The answer is I paid back a lot of money, there's whole controversy that I was underpaying but in fact the judge ruled in my favour. 'The government was wrong I overpaid what I was supposed to pay. 'I still continue to pay all the time, all the book money goes back to investors and the movie money and I pay extra money towards it myself.' The CNBC American Greed program reported that Belfort says he doesn't have to pay any more of the money now his probation is over but that he 'wants to'. But the U.S. Attorney says Belfort has to give half of his income towards his judgement.

"Two men are being questioned by police after a retired corrections officer fatally shot a 32-year-old man at a Brooklyn subway station following an argument during rush hour, authorities said. Gilbert Drogheo, from Harlem, was rushed to hospital after being shot on the mezzanine section of the Borough Hall station at 6.30pm on Tuesday but later passed away in hospital. Two other men, Drogheo's 29-year-old friend and the retired corrections officer, who is 69, were taken into custody on Tuesday night and were being questioned on Wednesday, police said. A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard . Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening . Police told the New York Times that the argument began when the ex-officer, who was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun, stepped between the two friends as they had a conversation on the train. The clash turned physical and one of the younger men spit on the ex-officer, police told the Times. Another witness told the New York Daily News he overheard one of the assailants use a racial slur in addressing the older man, telling him: 'I got you now, my n*****.' '[The older man] said, ""I'm not your n*****, I'm not your boy,”' the witness told the paper. The station PIX11 also reported that two young men were acting ‘belligerent’ on their Brooklyn bound 5 train. When the train reached the platform at Borough Station in Downtown Brooklyn, the three men separated. Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man; Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury . Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting . But in footage captured by a witness and shared with CBS2, the older man can be seen walking up stairs from the platform to the mezzanine level before encountering one of the younger men. The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard. Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground. He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. The former corrections officer, who has not been named, remained at the scene and was taken by police to Long Island College Hospital for treatment. Neither man has been named and no charges have been filed but both are being questioned. Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men . Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl . Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged . Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first. 'Like a ""pow, pow"" sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: ""No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot"".'. Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it’s Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.' Police say the circumstances of the shooting were still being investigated. Trains bypassed the station after the incident but all entrances at the station had re-opened by 4am on Wednesday. Service disruption: No 4 and 5 trains initially bypassed the Brooklyn station but are now running normally .","The ex-officer got into an argument with two young men aboard a southbound train on Tuesday afternoon after he stepped between them .

"Parents in Sydney and Melbourne have become fearful after out-of-pocket childcare costs could jump if the federal government adopts proposal to set a general benchmark figure. The Productivity Commission has proposed a figure of $7.20 per hour for children aged three to five. There is concern as if a chosen childcare costs most than $7.20 an hour, or $79 per day, parents are expected to cover the extra cost. Parents are worried after childcare out-of-pockets costs are set to skyrocket with a new benchmark figure . The benchmark figure is set to be $7.20 an hour with parents expected to cover the extra costs . Parental advocates 'The Parenthood' believe that this could leave families worse off, depending on where they live and how expensive their local childcare is. The average price of childcare in Sydney CBD is $138 per day and in Melbourne CBD it is $107. The childcare package will sees parents out-of-pocket after covering the excess as most childcare centres in Sydney and Melbourne cost more than the benchmark price. There were previously two basic forms of subsidised payments the Sydney Morning Herald Reported. The childcare benefit saw parents who were working or studying 15 hours a week with an annual income under $43,000, have up to 100 hours of childcare covered. The average childcare price in Sydney CBD is $138 per day and in Melbourne CBD it is $107 . This scheme will take place of both the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit . The childcare rebate covered 50 percent of out-of-pocket expenses up to $7500 a year without means testing. The Productivity Commission wants to rolls both of these benefits into one that is paid straight to the childcare provider. This new scheme is reported to be means tested with most parents needing to work at least 24 hours a fortnight to qualify. The government is expected to release its childcare package in the coming weeks.","Parents in Sydney and Melbourne are worried after out-of-pocket childcare costs may skyrocket if new benchmark figure is adopted .

However, the suspect claimed he had been trying to hit someone else with whom he was having a dispute - and accidentally hit the officers instead, St Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch said. 'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' the prosecutor said at a press conference, adding there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of shooting from. The Ferguson attack sent a fresh jolt of tension through a city that became a symbol of racial conflict after black teenager Michael Brown was killed by white officer Darren Wilson last summer. It is unknown whether any  suspects were hit in Sunday's gunfire.

"The happy ending of one Detroit man who used to walk eight hours to work every day is being tainted by the greed of his ex-girlfriend. James Robertson was recently able to move out of his Detroit neighborhood to a suburb with the more than $360,000 in donations he received in a crowdfunding campaign that started out as a means to purchase the 56-year-old a car. But apparently his ex-girlfriend and former landlady wants a cut of his new wealth. Scroll down for video . James Robertson used to walk eight hours to work every day, but now has a car, new home, and some money for retirement thanks to a kind crowd-funding campaign. Pictured above on March 4, cleaning his car . Robertson's ex-girlfriend and former landlady reportedly has been harassing Robertson for a cut of his money. Robertson pictured above cleaning at his new home in Troy, Michigan on March 3 . In this Tuesday March 3, 2015 photo, James Robertson, left, shows Charlie Purtan Levenson, 13, how to properly swing a baseball bat while he was visiting Robertson with his mother and others at Robertson's new apartmen . The Detroit Free-Press reports that Robertson has had to take out a restraining order against ex Tanya Fox, 60, who claims he owes her money. 'He said he was going to give me $50,000 to fix up the house,' Fox told the Free-Press, adding: 'James was not a neat person; he got grease all over the wall' in the apartment he rented from her for 15 years. Fox is just one of many in Robertson's old neighborhood who he has completely cut ties with. 'I may have been born there, but God knows I don't belong there anymore,' Robertson said about his old neighborhood near Detroit's New Center area. The plastic-molding operator also said he didn't tell people in his old neighborhood where he was moving. The 56-year-old gained celebrity after the newspaper reported earlier this year that he began walking to a job at an auto parts factory when his car stopped working in 2005 and bus service was cut back. Robertson pictured above hitting the pavement on his old 21-mile walk to work . A local college student launched a modest crowdfunding campaign to a buy a new car. It led to $360,000 eventually being raised and Robertson receiving a new, $35,000 Ford Taurus from an auto dealership. He still works at the same factory in Rochester Hills which pays him $10.55 an hour, but the hours-long walking trip now is done in a 20-minute drive. 'I'm going to keep working — that's for sure,' he told the newspaper. Financial experts are donating their service to help Robertson manage his money. The 1-bedroom apartment in Troy costs him $800 a month in rent. He had been paying $880 per month for less space in his ex-girlfriend's home in Detroit. Most of his money now is in a trust that has a principal amount of $351,000. The earnings from the trust should be enough to keep Robertson's nest egg untouched until he retires, said Rebecca Sorensen, a UBS Financial Services senior vice president for wealth management. She is part of the financial team helping him. People have stepped up because Robertson is unselfish and deserving, Sorensen said. 'He wants the majority of the funds he received to be invested in a way that will someday provide an income stream when he retires,' she added.","James Robertson, 56, used to walk eight hours to get to his $10.55/hour job .

"Convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. It has been revealed by the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo that the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. Scroll down for video . The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously' Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . This means Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad. Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death. 'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row. Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy. Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island' President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response. Ms Bishop has offered to cover the costs of life imprisonment for the condemned men, if their lives are spared . The families of the convicted drug offenders have been allowed to visit twice since their transfer to Nusakambangan island last Wednesday, with their next visit scheduled for Monday. This news comes as a prisoner art exhibition and auction featuring Mr Sukumaran’s work was dramatically cancelled after Kerobokan prison authorities said they didn’t want to associate with the prisoners pending execution. The Kerobokan Jail governor Sudjonggo ordered all 92 prisoner paintings to be removed before the exhibition commenced. A chilling self portrait of Mr Sukumaran that would have been displayed alongside other prisoner art at the Kuta exhibition . He claims that authorities we unaware the event was advertised as a tribute to Mr Sukumaran, a former art teacher at the prison. “It is cancelled because we do not want to be involved in any matters relating to Myuran. I have conveyed to the organisers about that and they promised that none of Myuran’s paintings will be at the exhibition,’ Sydjonggo said. The exhibition featuring Mr Sukumaran's most recent work was cancelled as prison officials say they didn't want to get caught up in the politicised executions . “It doesn’t mean that we are forgetting Myuran. No. But we just don’t want to be involved in the discourse about the execution which is now already politicised,” he added. The money raised by auctioning off the prisoners artwork was to be used to continue funding the art program at the Kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by Mr Sukumaran. Mr Sukumaran has been unable to paint since his transfer to 'Death Island' however prison authorities say Mr Sukumaran will eventually be allowed to have his art materials. Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison .","Condemned Bali nine duo to be executed with other death row inmates .

"At this rate the politicians will be sticking their children down as election expenses. Ed Miliband yesterday took the 'Hello-isation' of general election coverage to a whole new level. He invited ITV's breakfast telly to accompany him on the school run with his little sons. Folks, it was a heart-melter. Gooey as hot marshmallow. Well, that was the intention, anyway. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband walks his boys to school in yesterday's breakfast television ITV broadcast . Viewers heard the Leader of the Opposition engage dear little Daniel, five, and Samuel, four, in Daddy talk and tell them a story about Boo-Boo and Hee-Hee. Were these nicknames for certain members of the shadow cabinet by any chance? Oddly enough, they were not, though there might be no shortage of candidates for Boo-Boo. Boo-Boo and Hee-Hee were in fact fictional beings of Mr Miliband's creation and they lived on a place called Faraway Planet. 'Nobody visits them because they are far away,' explained Mr Miliband with a logic so faultless you could almost call it Marxist. He and his wide-eyed sons were walking down a London street, accompanied by no one – except, that is, an ITV film crew. Presenter Ben Shephard was holding Daniel's hand. Can anyone remind me of Mr Miliband's position about Press intrusion into private lives? Any idea that it was normal for Mr Miliband to take the little ones to school was soon dashed. He admitted it was 'a rare treat' for him. Oh, so you mean he only did it to give us a false impression that he is a new man? Mr Shephard put on a pair of spaniel eyes and asked if Ed ever felt guilty about missing his boys' childhood. 'I do, I do,' came the eager reply. Many working blokes make similar sacrifices, mind you. It's called life. Ed Miliband's 'functional kitchenette' was slammed as dingy and unhomely when it featured on the BBC . The rest of ITV's interview was conducted at the Milibands' house, the children by now having been parked. Ed was asked about his brother David – the one he stiffed for the Labour crown. Cain and Abel minefield. 'We had a bruising leadership contest four years ago. He's moved on from that. I've moved on from that,' insisted Cain. It is certainly true to say David has moved on from it. He moved to New York! 'He's got his own thing that he's doing,' said Ed. 'He wants to focus on that.' Got that, David? If all this was toe-curling, wait till you hear what Shepard asked next. He mentioned Mr Miliband's lovely wife Justine, noted how busy their lives were, and asked our would-be prime minister: 'How do you keep the romance going?' Strewth. How much detail were we after here? Even Mr Miliband looked a bit staggered at this descent into bedroom territory. Pinkening, he said 'that's a good question'. He added that 'there's nothing more we like than a night in, just spending some time together'. Enough, enough! The interview was the last in ITV's breakfast TV one-to-ones with the party leaders. Alleluia. Much more of that and I'd have emigrated to Faraway Planet.","Ed Miliband featured on ITV walking his children to school in north London .

Guzman had lost her father, Valentin Guzman, 41; mother, 40-year-old Elvira Guzman Santoy; sisters Ani and Patricia, 12 and 11; and 3-year-old brother, Valentin Jr. Yet when speaking about Carmona later with KHOU, Guzman made it clear she was dealing with the tragedy, and doing her best to move on in the aftermath. 'I forgive him because I'm really not God. The one that he needs to say sorry to is God, not to me,' she said. As for her family, Guzman stated; 'I know that they are happy for me, why? Because they were there for me and I really thank God and I'm really thankful because I had great parents no matter what. They were still there for me.'

Her husband meanwhile said the news was difficult for him as well, especially seeing his wife suffer. Said Dan Gasby; 'If anybody didn’t deserve this it was this woman because she is the sweetest human being, bar none. And then, after you curse God, you apologize.'

"Americans bought less soda for the 10th straight year in 2014, with diet sodas shrinking more than their sugary counterparts, according to a report released Thursday. An annual report by the industry tracker Beverage Digest found that overall soda volume slipped 0.9 percent last year, moderating from the decline of 3 percent the previous year. And the poor performance of diet sodas in particular led to a shake-up in the top 10 U.S. soda rankings; even though people bought less Pepsi, it managed to regain the No. 2 spot from Diet Coke, which suffered an even steeper decline. Diet Coke had knocked Pepsi off the No. 2 spot in 2010. Not flying off the shelves: . U.S. soda volume declined for the tenth straight year in 2014, with diet sodas faring worse than their regular counterparts . Coke remained by far the most popular soda in the U.S., selling about twice as much as No. 2 Pepsi. John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, attributed the moderation in soda's decline in 2014 to the continued growth of energy drinks. He also noted that Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple Group have improved marketing for their soda brands. Soda volume has been declining in the U.S. since 2004 amid concerns that sugary drinks fuel weight gain, and a proliferation of alternatives in the beverage aisle. More recently, industry executives have attributed an accelerating decline of diet sodas to concerns over artificial sweeteners like aspartame. The American Beverage Association, which represents Coke, Pepsi and others, is trying to address the shift away from diet sodas in part by funding studies showing the benefits of the drinks. Despite the ongoing decline of soda volume, the broader U.S. beverage industry performed better than in the previous year with growth of 1.7 percent, according to Beverage Digest. That increase was driven by an increase in bottled water sales. Back in second place: Even though Pepsi's volume dipped, it managed to regain the No. 2 spot .","Americans bought less soda for the 10th straight year in 2014, with diet sodas shrinking more than their sugary counterparts .

"The Tunisian ministry released a picture on its Facebook page which reportedly shows the leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade Lokmane Abou Sakhr . A gunman who is suspected of being involved in the terror attack on foreign tourists at a Tunisian museum is believed to have been killed in an armed raid. Prime Minister Habib Essid has told state news agency TAP that Khaled Chaieb, also known as Abou Sakhr Lokman, was killed overnight in an operation in the Gafsa region near the Algerian border. Chaieb is believed to be a prominent militant in al-Qaida's North African arm and is described as one of Tunisia's 'most dangerous terrorists.' He was one of nine armed militants killed in an operation on Saturday evening. Chaieb is suspected of leading or helping lead the March 18 attack on the National Bardo Museum which saw 21 people, mostly foreign tourists gunned down. Police killed two of the gunmen who are said to be Tunisians in their 20s, who had trained in Libya. Security officials have claimed the militants were members of the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, a jihadist group. Authorities have arrested several people in connection with the attack - dubbed the worst in Tunisia in 13 years. CCTV footage of the shooting shows the gunmen roaming free around the museum. The lack of security at the country's largest museum has since been called into question. The news comes as tens of thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital Tunis in a solidarity protest today. French President Francois Hollande confirmed yesterday that Huguette Dupeu had died from her injuries following the attack. Mr Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and several foreign ministers and officials from other countries are joining an anti-terrorism ceremony in Tunis after the march. The Tunisian government called on all major political parties to join the march from the seat of government at Bab Es-Saadoun to the museum. News of Sakhr's death was announced as tens of thousands of people marched through Tunisia . People from the World Social Forum gathered today to denounce terror attacks in the capital Tunis . The international visitors are showing solidarity with Tunisia, whose fragile new democracy was deeply shaken by the museum attack, for which ISIS claimed responsibility. Fighters from Tunisia make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. CCTV images shows the terrorist attack on the National Bardo Museum in Tunisia earlier this month . Tunisian protesters took to the streets across the region following the attack. Authorities are struggling with scattered extremist violence linked to various radical Islamic groups, largely linked to neighboring countries Algeria or Libya. Interior Ministry spokesman Ali Aroui said Sunday that nine suspected ""terrorists"" were killed when security forces clashed with the suspects in the southwest region of Sidi Aich, near the Algerian border. He said several extremists were wounded in another clash in the northwest region of Kef, as part of security operations around the country ahead of the march.","Gunmen killed 21 people in attack on National Bardo Museum in Tunisia .

"REASONS TO STAY ALIVE . by Matt Haig . (Canongate £9.99) Matt Haig was working in Ibiza with his girlfriend Andrea when his life suddenly changed. At 24, he was a self- confessed party animal who drank too much, while eating and sleeping too little. One day he felt his brain flickering and tingling inside his head and he became overwhelmed by a feeling of intense panic as well as the desire to end his life. Matt Haig's first-hand account of the brutal sickness is a scintillating read . ‘To escape a mind on fire, where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson.’ He walked to a cliff edge, looked at the Mediterranean and thought: ‘A single step — versus the pain of being alive.’ From time to time most people will moan that they feel ‘depressed’. The word is easy to reach for when feeling vaguely down or perhaps when we’ve become sad for a very good reason — such as a recent bereavement or the loss of a job. Or when the stress of work or moving house is so great that you can’t sleep — or get up in the morning. Yet real clinical depression should not be confused with such other faces of gloom. In this short, scintillating, first-hand account of depression and how he combated it, novelist Haig leaves us in no doubt as to the true, terrifying nature of the beast. Writing 13 years after suddenly being struck down by ‘a new claustrophobic and suffering reality’, Haig provides enough detail about the symptoms of depression to deter anyone from taking the name of this cruel condition in vain. Sadness is not a sickness — but depression most certainly is. Suicide kills more people than stomach cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, colon cancer, breast cancer or Alzheimer’s, according to World Health Organisation figures. Haig takes this a step further: ‘As people who kill themselves are, more often than not, depressives, depression is one of the deadliest diseases on the planet. ‘It kills more people than most other forms of violence — warfare, terrorism, domestic abuse, assault, gun crime — put together.’ Again and again he finds fresh ways of letting the reader know exactly how bad depression is: ‘At its worst you find yourself wishing, desperately, for any other affliction, and physical pain, because the mind is infinite, and its torments — when they happen — can be equally infinite.’ One of his most valuable points he makes is that depression can strike down any sort of person. Haig is highly educated, comes from a very happy background, has devoted parents and was already lucky enough to be in a stable relationship with the wonderful Andrea that has proved a lifesaver. He wants us to understand that (a) depression is widespread and (b) anyone can be struck down. ‘Millionaires, people with good hair, happily married people . . . people who exude happiness in their status updates, who seem, from the outside, to have no reason to be miserable.’ Haig gives plenty of ‘reasons to stay alive’. He comes up with two brilliantly creative sections, which take the form of a dialogue across time between the depressed Matt ‘then’ and the recovered (or perhaps I should say, recovering) Matt ‘now.’ So when the old self asks for a reason to go on living, the new self replies: ‘On the other side of this there is life. L-I-F-E. You understand? And there will be stuff you enjoy.’ The point is that someone like me can say things like that, but someone suffering from depression can easily retort: ‘You don’t know because you haven’t been there!’ When Haig focuses on his Reasons To Stay Alive on page 117, his ten clear points are all the more moving because you know this knowledge is hard won. In case depressives think they are alone, he tells them robustly there are millions like them, and even gives a list of 39 famous ones, including Winston Churchill. Haig’s story of recovery will encourage anyone who feels miserable, whether they are clinically depressed or not, and offers valuable insights to family and friends, too. I love the essential wisdom of this: ‘You know, before the age of 24 I hadn’t known how bad things could feel, but I hadn’t realised how good they could feel either . . . it is quite therapeutic to know that pleasure doesn’t just help compensate for pain, it can actually grow out of it.’ Now there is nothing at all original in the suggestion that pain does pass and that you can learn from it. But it certainly needs repeating — again and again and again.","At 24 Matt Haig's life changed when he developed clinical depression .

"'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' will be returned to the descendants of art dealer Paul Rosenberg, from whom it was taken by the Nazis . Germany has signed an agreement to return to its rightful owner an Henri Matisse painting that was seized under Nazi rule. Matisse's 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was part of a trove of artworks found in the apartment of late collector Cornelius Gurlitt. Experts say the painting was taken from art dealer Paul Rosenberg and rightfully belongs to his descendants. Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed a report in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today that she signed the agreement. A similar agreement was signed last week for a painting by Max Liebermann. Both agreements must be approved by a Munich court handling Gurlitt's inheritance. A Swiss museum that accepted Gurlitt's bequest of his collection has promised to ensure any Nazi-looted pieces are returned to their Jewish owners' heirs. Around 250 artworks were found in Gurlitt's Salzburg property. Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern inherited the collection . Some 1,280 others found in Gurlitt's apartment in Munich. While some of the Munich works were already known, it was the first look for many at the art Gurlitt kept in the house he owned in Austria. It includes works by Breughel, Monet, Renoir and Picasso. Gurlitt inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered 'degenerate' to buyers outside of Germany for cash. Some of the works — including Impressionist and modern masterpieces — had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell. Gurlitt died in May last year at age 81, designating the Swiss museum as his sole heir.","'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was held by the now famous late collector .

"My mum Lesley, 69 — who is retired and a fine example of someone who likes to splurge her pensioner pounds — last week flounced out of Argos, where she’d intended to spend upwards of £200 on her grandchildren. She was just too daunted by their new space-age shops to buy anything. Gone are the catalogues, little jotter pads and blue pens that used to fill the stores. Instead, the desks, revamped in clinical white and looking more like a scientist’s lab than a shop, are fitted with white touch-screen iPads. Claudia Connell says her mother, Lesley, 63, was so daunted by the space-age technology in Argos last week that she went to an independent toy seller in another town . Customers search on the iPad for their items, place an order and pay at a self-service kiosk. Then their goods are placed on a counter for them to collect. The transaction can be carried out without so much as a please or thank you to a member of staff. My mum told me afterwards: ‘I’ve never used a tablet. I should learn but I don’t want my first lesson to be in Argos with other shoppers breathing down my neck and making me anxious. ‘I couldn’t find a sales assistant, so I just walked out and bought the grandchildren’s toys from an independent toy seller in another town. They cost more and I had a 12-mile round trip, but it was worth it not to feel like a silly old fool holding everyone up.’ We know the baby boomer generation have the most leisure, money and time to spend on the High Street, so why are retailers doing all they can to make them feel like outcasts? Our High Street stores have changed beyond recognition in recent years — and for many older customers it’s certainly not for the better. The convenience of online shopping is the only way to go for some, but for those who still prefer to shop in person, the experience is becoming an increasingly stressful and confusing one. Given that retail sales have been declining steadily for the past two years, businesses are doing all they can to get customers through their doors. Argos stores used to be known for their weighty catalogues (pictured), little jotter pads and blue pens but instead they now have iPads, self-service counters and barely any customer-employee contact . The trouble is, they all seem to be looking for trendy high-tech solutions — gizmos and gimmicks designed to lure in the under-30s, intimidating the rest of us in the process. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle says: ‘It’s all about retailers panicking over what their competitors are doing and not wanting to be left behind. ‘A lot of them were stung by coming too late to the online market and they don’t want the same to happen again by being too late to take on board in- store technology. ‘But they are getting carried away and aren’t stopping to see the long-term damage they could be doing to customer relations. Older people generally have more money to spend but also want some human interaction while shopping (picture posed by model) ‘Older people have money to spend, but what our research tells us is that, more than anything, they want human interaction. They want a trained, friendly person in the shop who acknowledges them and knows their stock. ‘They don’t want to wander into a shop and feel as if they’re on the set of Tomorrow’s World. ‘When I give advice to clients I always tell them to get staff out on the floor, get them to make eye contact when they talk and to be friendly. ‘For some older women a trip to the shops can be the only human contact they have that day. They don’t want to be directed to some touch screen computer on a wall when they ask a question.’ Kate also believes that some of our best known High Street brands are getting it horribly wrong. ‘Even Marks & Spencer, which relies heavily on the pensioner pound, is focusing too heavily on in-store technology in the form of touch- screen ordering stations and self-service checkouts.’ Also, the rise of super malls, such as Westfield in London and the Trafford Centre in Manchester, have only served to isolate older people even more. Speaking as a 48-year-old shopper, I find London’s two Westfield centres to be stressful. ‘Who wants to spend their day wandering around a maze of shops, getting lost, walking miles and not being able to find your car at the end?’ says Kate. ‘Shopping malls are geared towards young people. They’re exhausting for older people and are another clear example of how the retail world is putting up keep out barriers for senior shoppers. ‘It’s why we’re seeing a rise in the independent, with shops offering old-fashioned customer service.’ It isn’t just department stores that have become a mind-boggling minefield as anyone who has ever attempted to go into a High Street coffee chain and order a plain, white coffee or tea will know. First, you have to select the type of bean, then the type of milk, then how you want that milk to be heated, what topping or flavours you want and finally — after lengthy negotiation — you might get your drink. Oh, but not before having your name (spelt incorrectly) scribbled on your cup. The new CEO of the supermarket chain Morrisons has decided to stop relying on technology and instead will get more staff manning tills and assisting in the shops (stock image) Now Greggs, once a go-to place for no-nonsense, simple food, is undergoing an image makeover, with Cajun soups and Mediterranean flatbread wraps alongside the sausage rolls and iced buns. A hankering for some fries recently led me into my local McDonald’s — and then immediately back out again — when I realised they have introduced a complicated touch-screen ordering system and that the tables have imbedded tablets preloaded with games. I only wanted a carton of chips, not an ‘interactive experience’. Self-service tills in supermarkets are fine — unless you are buying alcohol, single items of fruit or veg, want to use your own bags, require cash back or intend to pay with anything other than the world’s smoothest, crispest banknotes — in which case you’ll need to call on the hovering assistant, who is busy helping half a dozen other confused people. There is some good news, though. Earlier this month, David Potts, the new CEO of supermarket Morrisons, took the decision to stop relying on technology and, instead, get more staff manning tills and assisting in the shop. The reason for this decision was that customer feedback revealed that — surprise! surprise! — shoppers like to interact with humans and not machines when we visit stores. So, forget ‘unexpected item in bagging area,’ isn’t it time that other retailers followed the example set by Morrisons and gave us a few more ‘unexpected humans on the shop floor’?

"They are extraordinary treasure troves, stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that Britain has ever produced. But the National Trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits – because they are too demanding on visitors. The charity, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens, is worried that rooms often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes. The National Trust, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, is worried that exhibitions often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes . In an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of Britain’s grand properties, bosses yesterday launched a ten-year strategy that includes plans to ‘simplify’ some exhibits. Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary. ‘We are making visitors work too hard in some places,’ she said . ‘It’s not surprising given that where we have come from, that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable, that it forms more of their cultural background. ‘Our analysis is that it isn’t the entrance fee that is putting people off, it is that they think this isn’t “the place for them” So how do we get them in?’ The Trust's director general Dame Helen Ghosh, said places like the Carrick-a-Rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes . Dame Helen, who was Permanent Secretary of the Home Office until she was appointed to the Trust in 2012, said that some properties have a broader appeal. ‘When you go to somewhere like Carrick-a-Rede in Northern Ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge, they are from every socio-economic background, wearing shorts, flip flops, all of that,’ she said. But many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base. The Trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties. Dame Helen said: ‘When it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits. There is so much stuff in there. ‘Let’s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let’ s pick one lovely thing, put it in the middle of the room and light it really well. ‘Let’s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it’s not difficult. ‘We make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard.’ But she denied that the Trust is ‘dumbing down’ its approach in order to boost visitor numbers. ‘In many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding,’ Dame Helen insisted. ‘People will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail, than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression.’ Tim Parker, chairman of the Trust, added: ‘Every museum and gallery has the middle class problem. ‘We have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive.’ The National Trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder Octavia Hill, who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor. As part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry, to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks. The Trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces. Although the Trust is not putting in any money to the schemes, other charities such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Nesta are also involved. Mr Parker, a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist Sir Simon Jenkins, said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the Trust’s appeal. ‘The fantastic opportunity for the Trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people don’t have to go inside,’ he said. ‘We can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well. It is an age thing, not just a class thing.’","National Trust launches ten-year strategy for Britain's stately homes .

"Chelsea Manning, the US soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for a massive document leak, should be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court documents. Judges made the ruling as Manning continues her transition into a woman. Chelsea, 27, formerly known as Bradley Manning, is incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. She had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley'. Chelsea Manning, pictured here (center) in 2013 before she began her transition, was known as Bradley when she went on trial for the massive document leak  to the WikiLeaks website . Chelsea, 27, pictured here in a wig and lipstick in an undated photograph, is allowed to wear women's underwear, undergo psychotherapy, and has had hormone therapy for gender reassignment approved . The former intelligence analyst had also been allowed to wear women's underwear following a decision last year, and to undergo psychotherapy. The latest move comes a month after the U.S. Army approved hormone therapy for Manning's gender reassignment - a first for the American military. 'All future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g. Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun' said a court order on Wednesday. Manning, pictured on stickers worn by a  demonstrator, has now won the right to be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court . However 'in respect to historic fact,' the court will retain masculine wordage used in previous decisions, including Manning's conviction. The news has been welcomed by Manning's defense team. 'The court rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea's womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as,' said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in Manning's defense. Manning was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents to the WikiLeaks website while stationed in Iraq.","Chelsea Manning, formerly Bradley, will be referred to in female or gender neutral terms as she transitions in a woman as per a court order .

"A woman at the centre of a vote-rigging row is being parachuted into a key marginal seat by Labour’s biggest union donor. Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite leader Len McCluskey, was suspended by Labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in Falkirk in her favour. She was later cleared and had her membership re-instated, but she quit as Labour candidate in the Scottish seat for the sake of ‘reconciliation and unity’. Karie Murphy, pictured, was involved in the Falkirk vote rigging scandal in 2013 which led to her suspension . Unite now wants Miss Murphy to be selected in key marginal Halifax where the current Labour MP, Linda Riordan, has announced she is stepping down. Her possible inclusion on an all-women shortlist, to be announced on Tuesday, risks re-opening the wounds of the bitter Falkirk row just weeks before the election and is proving a headache for Ed Miliband. The Labour leader has been warned that his party risks losing the seat if Miss Murphy is selected, but the union could stop bankrolling the party’s election campaign if she is not chosen. Unite has already mounted a strong campaign to ensure Miss Murphy is the candidate. Mrs Riordan, also a Unite member, has taken her on a tour of the seat to introduce her to local members. The pair have also been pictured campaigning with Labour councillors. Unite is also organising a campaign day in the seat on Sunday, two days before the candidates on the all-women shortlist are revealed. It is hoping to flood the constituency with members from all over Yorkshire and Humber in what is seen as a ‘peacock exercise’ to show off the resources it could deploy if Miss Murphy is chosen. Unite members in the region have been told their support ‘is vitally important’. Len McCluskey, pictured, wants Miss Murphy included on the all-woman shortlist in Halifax . A spokesman for the union last night confirmed that it ‘hopes’ Miss Murphy is put on the shortlist of candidates. He dismissed suggestions that Mr McCluskey had threatened to halt funding Labour’s General Election campaign if she is not chosen as ‘complete and utter rubbish’. Labour yesterday confirmed that an all-women shortlist would be decided for the Halifax seat on Tuesday, with the local party voting on its chosen candidate next Saturday. The shortlist is picked by the ‘special selection panel’, which Mr Miliband sits on. The announcement came hours after Mrs Riordan claimed the party had been ‘dragging its feet’ over the selection since she made her decision more than a month ago that she would step down on health grounds. In a letter to the party’s general secretary Iain McNicol, which was leaked to the local paper, she claimed that there were suspicions the selection was being delayed so the party could impose its own candidate. The seat, where Mrs Riordan has a majority of 1,472, is number 18 on the Tories’ target list. Unite has given Labour more than £14million since Mr Miliband became leader. Nearly 130 candidates standing for the party in May have links to the union. Labour’s internal report into the Falkirk row, which was leaked, found party officials had concerns over the way Unite was allegedly recruiting members to ‘pack’ the local party before the vote to select its election candidate. Unite has always denied any wrongdoing.","Karie Murphy was suspended during a vote-fix scandal in Falkirk in 2013 .

"Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year claims he has been placed on paid administrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay. Brett Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly harassing and discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation. Bingham found out he was being placed on leave during a field trip with his students on Friday. Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year Brett Bingham claims he has been placed on paid adminsitrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay . He said it was his lawyer, who received a letter from the district, who broke the news. 'I returned to school and nobody spoke to me,' he told Fox 12. 'At 3.30 I just packed up my favorite plants and put a box of my stuff together that I was afraid would be thrown away and I left.' According to a complaint Bingham filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Civil Rights Division, problems with the district began shortly after he was named the state's  teacher of the year in October 2013. Bingham claims one such incident occurred after he was asked about his sexual orientation while giving a speech. The teacher said his department head left the event immediately and without saying anything to Bingham. He then claims she told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head'. Bingham then alleged that the district placed him under a 'gag order' in April and told him he could not publicly speak or write unless his comments were approved. The teacher said he then filed a grievance with his union, which stated that he felt he was receiving 'disparate treatment' because of his sexual orientation. Bingham (pictured here with his partner on their wedding day) claims one department head told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head' Bingham claims the following retaliation was swift. He said he was told that he now had to receive district approval before he could attend any teacher of the year events and was denied from appearing at two Gay Straight Student Alliance events, as well as working with a local LGBTQ community center. Bingham said management also began ordering him to pick up coffee and take out their garbage, 'menial tasks' he claims he was not asked to perform 'prior to the greater public awareness of my sexual orientation'. Relations between Bingham and the district worsened when school officials said the teacher would lose his job if he attended a gala for the National Education Association's Foundation, who were presenting him with an award, in Washington, D.C., he claims. District Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen allegedly told Bingham he would not be granted leave to attend any events related to teacher of the year, claiming he had too many school absences. Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation . Relations between Bingham and the district worsened after the teacher was told he would lose his job if he attended the National Education Association gala, where he was to be presented with an award . In a tweet Bingham claimed district officials told him they would consider letting him 'attend the NEA awards' if he recalled his state and federal complaints. Bingham was eventually allowed to attend the event after the Oregon Education Association found a clause in his contract that protected his job, according to OregonLive. Jorgensen was removed from the Superintendent position last week but the district claimed Bingham's complaints were not a factor, according to Fox 12. But Bingham believes nothing has changed and that there are other officials in the district who want to see him fired. 'There's no other explanation because I've never been in trouble,' he said. 'I have an excellent reputation.' MESD spokeswoman Laura Conroy declined to elaborate the district's reason for putting Bingham on paid administrative leave.","Brett Bingham has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District in Oregon for alleged discrimination .

"Top earner: The SNP have voted to make Nicola Sturgeon the best-paid politician in Britain . The Scottish National Party has voted to make Nicola Sturgeon the best-paid politician in Britain. The Scottish Parliament, which is controlled by the SNP, rubber-stamped a pay rise for all its members that takes Miss Sturgeon’s official salary to £144,687 a year. Her pay is now well above David Cameron’s £142,500 earnings as well as the £143,911 that Boris Johnson is paid for his role as Mayor of London. Aides to the First Minister sensed a looming PR disaster and have insisted she would not take her salary in full. The row follows the Scottish Parliament’s vote on a 0.7 per cent salary rise yesterday. The move – which was passed unopposed – increases the First Minister’s official salary by just over £1,000 to £144,687. MSPs are currently paid 87.5 per cent of an MP’s salary, a figure that reflects their lesser responsibilities. But they voted to break that link, saying it was because they could not accept a 10 per cent pay rise mooted for MPs after the election. However, the move means that MSPs’ wages will rise by 0.7 per cent to £59,089 on April 1. Miss Sturgeon will earn more than any other politician despite having no control of defence or foreign affairs, and only limited say on issues such as tax and benefits. Critics pointed out that she only serves about five million people, compared to 64million served by Mr Cameron. Her aides said that she would actually draw a more modest salary of £135,605. But Tory MPs accused the SNP of treating voters in the rest of the country with contempt. Brian Binley said Miss Sturgeon should pay for any MSPs’ pay rise by levying taxes in Scotland. Scroll down for video . Mr Binley added: ‘Sadly, I’m not surprised by this. Every person living in Scotland already gets far more spent on them than my constituents in England, and it’s no surprise to see SNP politicians wanting their share of it. ‘If people in Scotland want to pay for Nicola Sturgeon and her MSPs then that would be one thing – but it is taxpayers in England who are picking up the bill for the SNP’s profligacy. ‘People in my constituency are sick to death of being asked to pay up so that Scots can have more spent on them. Nicola Sturgeon's pay is now well above David Cameron’s £142,500 earnings - even though she only serves about five million people . ‘They are also sick to death of seeing the SNP, who wanted out of this nation six months ago, now wanting to run the country.’ Fellow Tory Charlie Elphicke said the pay rise underlined the threat posed by the SNP. ‘This is a harbinger of what the SNP would do if they ever got into government,’ he said. ‘We would get more spending, more borrowing and a total lack of restraint. ‘Nicola Sturgeon is obviously not worth more than David Cameron – the idea is laughable. But the SNP have no appreciation of the struggle faced by millions of people who work hard, pay their taxes and do their best to make ends meet. It’s all someone else’s money to them.’ On Monday, Miss Sturgeon made a speech in London in which she vowed to work with Labour to ‘lock the Tories’ out of power. She insisted voters would welcome her influence as a way to end austerity policies. Nicola Sturgeon's pay is also above the £143,911 that Boris Johnson is paid for his role as Mayor of London. The pay row came as Labour’s leader in Scotland claimed that the funding deal under which Scotland receives more than its fair share of cash for public services would be made ‘permanent’ if Labour wins power. The so-called Barnett Formula means that public spending per head in England stands at just £8,529, compared to a staggering £10,152 in Scotland. Tory MPs – and many Labour MPs in England – want the formula to be scrapped as part of any deal to give Scotland additional powers. But Jim Murphy said: ‘The Labour Party view is that the Barnett Formula is permanent – it is here to stay.’ And he added: ‘Abolishing the Barnett Formula would be a form of maximum austerity that Scotland has never seen the like of before.’","Scottish National Party vote to make Nicola Sturgeon best-paid politician in UK .

If the Queen is replaced as head of state, the island nation will retain links with the British Crown through its membership of the Commonwealth. However, Downing Street has said it was not aware of the decision, which was announced by Mr Stuart last night. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I expect the approach will be consistent with self determination, decisions around this being a matter for the people involved. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on their last visit to Barbados in 1989, when they flew to the island on Concorde . Meanwhile a spokesman for Buckingham Palace told Mailonline it was a matter for the government and the people of Barbados . The Queen last visited Barbados 26 years ago in 1989 for the 350th anniversary of the Barbados parliament. Prince Harry took a three-day trip there in 2010 when he played in a polo match for his charity Sentebale. The Earl and Countess of Wessex were the last British royals to visit the nation, in February and March last year. The eastern Caribbean nation became independent from Britain in 1966 but kept the Queen as its official head of state. The Queen is represented on the island by the largely ceremonial role of the governor general. A map showing the east Caribbean island of Barbados, which gained full independence in 1966 after being a British colony . Plans to make Barbados a republic have been on the horizon for a number of years. In 2005, the then prime minister Owen Arthur outlined his proposals for dropping the Queen in favour of a locally elected president, but the process was not completed. The same year, Barbados made the Caribbean Court of Justice its final court of appeal, rather than the London-based Privy Council, which has long served as the highest court of appeal for many ex-British colonies. In 2012, Jamaican prime minister Portia Simpson Miller also pledged to replace the Queen as head of state. Barbados was colonised by James I in 1625 after the first English ship under the command of Captain John Powell docked there. Wealthy English men were then allocated land in Barbados with many of the trees cut down to make way for cotton, sugar and tobacco plantations. Slaves in Barbados dance and march through the streets after slavery was abolished in 1834. Many slaves were taken to the Caribbean island in the 1700s to work on the land . Barbados formerly dominated the sugar industry. Pictured are sugar cane plantation field workers in 1910 . The island then went on to dominate the sugar industry and became the final destination for slaves, who were rounded up from West Africa. After slavery was abolished in 1834, many people were drawn to the country in due to its warm climate and slow pace of life. The island gained internal autonomy from Britain in 1961 and full independence in 1966, but remains a member of the Commonwealth. The Queen is sovereign of 15 Commonwealth realms, in addition to the UK, including the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Jamaica, Canada, Australia and New Zealand .

"A toddler has landed a role as Elizabeth I in the BBC's Wolf Hall - after producers put out a last-minute appeal for a ginger curly-haired child. Casting bosses searched through thousands of children on acting registers but couldn't find a suitable young actress to play the future Queen of England. Red-haired Abi Ward, now three, from Cardiff, was recommended by a friend who saw the plea on Facebook and within days the tot was on set alongside her on-screen dad Damien Lewis. Scroll down for video . Abi Ward is pictured on set with her mother, Debbie, actor Damien Lewis, centre, and father Rob . Like many toddlers, Abi Ward loves dressing up and hear swaps Elizabethan costume for a tradtional Welsh dress (left) and a witch's outfit . While she was initially frightened of the dark and atmospheric sets - which also attracted complaints from viewers - she soon settled into the royal Tudor role. The mini-actress had her own trailer and got VIP treatment from the cast, including actress Claire Foy - her TV mum Anne Boleyn - who read Abi stories between takes. Proud parents Debbie and Rob, both 35, had no idea the show would be so successful and can't wait to show Abi recordings of her acting debut when she's older. 'It has been such a lovely experience,' said Debbie, a full time mum. 'She tells everyone she was filming with Damien and Claire, but she's completely oblivious to the fact that she has worked with some of the biggest names in TV. 'We couldn't be more proud of her.' Three-year-old Abi was playing the part of a very young Elizabeth I in the BBC TV series Wolf Hall . The young actress is shown off to the crowd by Damien Lewis as Henry VIII in a scene from Wolf Hall . The youngster has a good look around her while playing a young Elizabeth I while in the arms of Damien Lewis . Show makers initially searched through casting companies in search of a little pale-skinned girl with curly red hair to play Elizabeth, but couldn't find anyone suitable. A runner on the show put out a plea on Facebook in May last year and it was spotted by a friend of Debbie and Rob's who instantly thought of Abi. The pair sent in photos of their daughter, along with height measurements, and after a meeting, they were called to their first day of filming at Montacute House, Somerset. Little Abi as Elizabeth I is pictured with her on-screen mother Anne Boleyn (Claire Foy) in a scene from Wolf Hall . The property was Greenwich Palace in Wolf Hall and Abi filmed a scene where Henry VIII - Damien Lewis - introduces his daughter to various nobility. 'It happened very randomly because a friend of a friend was working as a runner on the TV show,' explained Debbie. 'They were looking for a ginger-haired girl and Abi was the right age and hair colour. 'She put out an SOS to friends for a little ginger haired girl and put Abi forward. It was completely out of the blue. 'We had to send in some photos and her height and age - but it was mostly about her hair colour and then they asked us to come down to meet them. The youngster even had her own trailer while she was on the set during filming . 'Within a matter of weeks we had to go to Somerset for filming. 'It was very surreal. We went down the night before and Damien came down to see Abi, so she could meet him before filming, and the following day she did a bit of filming. 'It was with Damien and he was holding her and walking around the room, with everyone bowing down to her, introducing her to everyone. 'Damien was lovely. He was really, really nice and friendly. 'He came down to see her before filming and not in costume so Abi wouldn't be scared of him. 'Abi cried a lot to start with. I felt a bit bad about that. She was ok in the end though. It was just quite dark and atmospheric, and I think it gave her a fright. The tot takes a break and relaxes far way from all the fun of filming Wolf Hall . 'But she loved the costume because she's a typical girl who loves dressing up in long girly dresses.' Abi's final day of filming took place at Barrington Court, Somerset, which was dressed as the home of Cromwell's mentor and friend Cardinal Wolsey, in June. The episode's opening scene saw Abi sit on Anne Boleyn's knee and took place during a period when the pair's relationship hit the rocks. 'They were talking about some embroidered hats. It was when they weren't getting along so well,' said Debbie. Proud parents Debbie and Rob, an IT analyst, watched Abi's debut at home with a bottle of champagne, while the little actress slept upstairs, blissfully unaware. She said: 'We didn't realise how big it was going to be. With us just being there for two days, we didn't really know what the whole thing was about. 'It was just me and my husband - she was upstairs asleep. 'It was quite surreal to see her on TV. We forgot how young she looked.'

"Labour today hinted at hefty tax rises for people earning more than £80,000 a year. The party also indicated that profitable companies could be hit as Labour attempts to tackle the deficit without trimming Britain’s bloated welfare budget or imposing deep spending cuts. Ed Miliband has been deliberately vague about Labour’s plans to raise taxes to deal with the deficit, identifying only his proposal to reinstate the 50p tax rates, which experts warn may raise nothing. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking at the launch of Labour’s business manifesto today, said Labour would not hit those on ‘middle and lower incomes’, with taxes mainly rising for those on higher salaries . But, speaking at the launch of Labour’s business manifesto, the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said taxes would hit those with the ‘broadest shoulders’. He suggested that those earning more than £80,000 were rich and could bear to pay more. Mr Balls said Labour would not hit those on ‘middle and lower incomes’, with taxes mainly rising for those on higher salaries. He added: ‘If you look at people on middle and lower incomes – this isn’t only people on £10,000 or £20,000 a year, it’s £50,£60, £70, £80,000 a year – they are paying more tax.' He added: 'People on all these income levels are in our mind. What we want to do is find a way in which we can balance the books in the next parliament, get the debt falling but to do so in a way which is fair to people on middle and lower incomes who are paying quite a lot of tax already. ‘I can’t come along today and start making detailed tax policy – that’s for manifestos and budgets – but we’ve already been clear – our plans add up without a rise in tax on people on middle and low incomes. ‘People on the income levels (I am) talking about are very much in our minds when we talk about middle and lower incomes.’ Labour – which has ruled out rises in the headline rates of VAT, income tax and national insurance – also left itself lots of flexibility to raise corporation tax on company profits. David Cameron, at a rally in Wiltshire today, has claimed Labour will cost families £3,000 in tax rises over the next Parliament . Mr Miliband said Labour would ensure Britain’s corporation tax rate remains the ‘lowest in the G7’. But this would allow a Labour government to raise it from 20 per cent to 26.5 per cent, which is the rate charged by Canada, the second most competitive country in the G7. By contrast, the Conservatives have said they will keep the rate as the lowest in the G20, which is currently 20 per cent in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Meanwhile, Labour was boosted last night after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Tory claims about the party’s spending plans. David Cameron claimed yesterday that a Labour victory would lead to £15 billion of tax rises, costing families an average £3,000 each over the lifetime of the next parliament. Labour dismissed the claim, saying it was based on ‘made up figures’. The IFS also criticised the Tory figures, saying they were based on too many assumptions about Labour’s opaque tax and spending plans. The independent think tank said there was ‘little value in bandying around numbers which suggest either party would increase taxes by an average of £3,000 for each working household’. IFS director Paul Johnson said there was ‘some potential truth’ in the Tory claim, but said it was ‘unhelpful’ to make a claim based on so many unknown assumptions. Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said: ‘This is a disastrous and embarrassing start to David Cameron’s campaign. Within hours of making totally false claims about Labour on the steps of Downing Street, the IFS has totally undermined them.’","Shadow chancellor has been deliberately vague about Labour's tax plans .

"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the Queen looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed. But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqué depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast . Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal . One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her. Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy. The latest set of photos were created as part of a 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign being run  by the Body Shop ahead of Mothering Sunday.

"Multiple suicide bombings on two mosques in Yemen's capital today have left hundreds killed or injured. Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in  Sanaa during midday prayers in what was one of the country's deadliest ever jihadist attacks. At least 137 are dead and a further 351 people are thought to have been wounded in the devastating blasts, described by eyewitnesses as being like earthquakes. Scroll down for video . A suicide bomb attack on two mosques in Sanaa, Yemen, has killed 137 people. Worshippers rushed to carry injured men covered in blood from the building . The mosques are mainly used by supporters of the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group as well as Sunni worshippers. Above, bodies were covered in blankets after the blast . A group of men carry the body of a victim killed in the attacks using rugs from the mosque's floor . Injured people are carried on to a truck to be taken to hospital. Around 351 people are thought to be injured, medical officials reported . A group claiming to be the Yemeni branch of Islamic State immediately said they were responsible for the bombings. Charred bodies and pools of blood were seen at the scene of the explosions while footage from the al-Hashoosh mosque, showed screaming volunteers using bloodied blankets to carry away victims. At the Badr mosque at least 25 bloody bodies were seen lying in the street and inside the building. The mosques are mainly used by supporters of the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group as well as Sunni worshippers. The group posted an online statement saying that five suicide bombers carried out what it described as a 'blessed operation' against the 'dens of the Shiites'. It also warned of an 'upcoming flood' of attacks against the rebels . The claim offered no proof of their role - but it was posted on the same website that the Islamic State affiliate in Libya claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack on a museum in Tunisia. The first bomber was caught by militia guards searching worshippers at the entrance of the Badr mosque. Injured worshippers are helped to their feet in the aftermath of one of the devastating explosions . A Houthi militant runs from a mosque where a suicide bomber blew himself up in Sanaa .

Medics use a stretcher to carry a body from the scene of one of the devastating bomb blasts . He detonated his device at the outside gates while a second bomber entered the mosque and blew himself up amid the crowds, according to the official news agency SABA. One witness from the attack at al-Hashoosh said he was thrown two metres by one of the blasts. Yemen is torn by a power struggle between the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the north and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Hadi has set up a rival power base in the south backed by Sunni-led Gulf Arab states. The mosques in Sanaa are known to be used mainly by supporters of the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group, which controls most of northern Yemen. The rise to power of the Houthis since September last year has deepened divisions in Yemen's complex web of political and religious allegiances. Mohammed al-Ansi said: 'The heads, legs and arms of the dead people were scattered on the floor of the mosque. 'Blood was running like a river.' Another witness added: 'I was going to pray at the mosque then I heard the first explosion, and a second later I heard another one.' Hospitals were urging citizens to donate blood, the Yemeni rebel-owned Al-Masirah TV channel said. It also reported that a fifth suicide bomb attack on another mosque was foiled in the northern city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold. A prominent Shiite cleric, al-Murtada al-Mansouri, and two senior Houthi leaders were among the dead, the TV channel reported. Survivors compared the explosions to an earthquake and said some people were injured by shattered glass falling from the mosque's large hanging chandeliers. The television channel aired footage from inside the al-Hashoosh mosque, where screaming volunteers were using blankets to carry away victims.

Corpses were lined up on the mosque floor and carried away in pick-up trucks. The attacks come just two days after 23 people were killed when gunmen opened fire on tourists at a museum in Tunisia. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. had seen no indications of an operational link between the Islamic State group and Friday's attacks. He said the U.S. was investigating to see whether the IS branch in Yemen has the command-and-control structure in place to substantiate its claim of responsibility. Earnest said it was plausible that IS was falsely claiming responsibility for the incident. 'It does appear that these kinds of claims are often made for a perception that it benefits their propaganda efforts,' Earnest said.

"NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens today revealed those working in the health service should 'practice what they preach' Overweight NHS staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds, in order to set a better example to their patients, it has emerged. The drastic scheme could help 700,000 of NHS England's 1.3 million workforce, who currently struggle with their weight. In a drive to 'practice what we preach', the NHS will sign their employees up to one of three slimming classes, depending on the amount of weight they have to lose. Staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, who announced today's initiative, said: 'Today the NHS is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness. 'The 'h' in NHS stands for health, and that's going to require a far bigger emphasis on prevention.' It comes as Mr Stevens revealed tens of thousands of lives could be saved by a new initiative aimed at preventing people developing type 2 diabetes. The weight-loss pilot programme will initially be open to staff at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London. Porters, nurses, doctors and support workers have helped design the scheme. And there has reportedly been an overwhelming response from volunteers eager to sign up for the scheme. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: 'This is the first time this innovative approach to weight management has been piloted in the NHS. 'It is not just a weight-loss service but a comprehensive package of support, that includes eating better, being more active and improving self-esteem, which is tailored to the needs of NHS staff. 'By rolling out a public health scheme in our hospitals we are showing the nation that we are serious about tackling obesity and preventing life-threatening diseases.' Being obese and overweight can significantly increase a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. As such, a large proportion of cases could be prevented. Trials in the US, Japan, China and India have shown 30 to 60 per cent reductions in cases over three years in adults at high risk, after intensive lifestyle changes were introduced. The new National NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme, set to be unveiled by Mr Stevens at the Diabetes UK conference today, is set to run in line with the drive to improve the lifestyles of NHS employees. It is hoped the schemes will save lives as well as millions of pounds for the NHS by significantly reducing the four million people otherwise expected to develop type 2 diabetes in England by 2025. Mr Stevens revealed overweight NHS employees would be offered slimming classes to help shed pounds in a bid to set a better example for their patients (file image) England will be the first country to implement such a programme at scale, initially targeting up to 10,000 people at a high risk of type 2 diabetes followed by a national roll-out. 'The NHS already spends an estimated £10 billion a year on potentially avoidable illnesses, and the human toll is more than 100 amputations a week and around 20,000 early deaths every year,' Mr Stevens said. 'Yet for over a decade we've known that obesity prevention cuts diabetes and saves lives. 'If these results were from a pill we'd doubtless be popping it, but instead this programme succeeds by supporting people to lose weight, exercise and eat better.' The programme is a joint initiative between NHS England, Public Health England (PHE) and Diabetes UK. PHE chief executive Mr Selbie said: 'This innovative programme is putting 'evidence into action' on the ground. 'Despite Type 2 diabetes being largely preventable, 2.5 million people in England already have the disease with another 9.6 million at high risk of developing it and this cannot be ignored.' Type 2 diabetes usually develops after the age of 40 and is more common in people who are overweight. Seven places around the country have been chosen to take part in the initial phase of the programme, involving drives on weight loss, physical activity, cooking and nutrition. These are Birmingham South and Central clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), Bradford City CCG, Durham County Council, Herefordshire CCG/LA, Medway CCG/LA, Salford CCG/LA, Southwark and Lambeth Councils and Southwark CCG. The weight-loss programmes, which include advice on healthy eating, come as NHS England announces another new initiative to help reduce the number of cases of type 2 diabetes, a condition closely linked to being overweight. Experts say the scheme will save lives as well as millions of pounds for the NHS . Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This is a real step change in terms of highlighting the seriousness with which type 2 diabetes is viewed and we feel this prevention programme is hugely significant. 'We hope this will also send a clear message that still more needs to be done going forward to help people lead healthy lifestyles from the beginning to the ends of their lives.' British Medical Association (BMA) committee chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: 'The programme does have the potential to tackle one of the most serious conditions that when identified late can have serious implications for an individual's health, and which is costing the NHS considerably in time and expense. 'GP services are in the front line of treating this condition and GPs will welcome any initiative which seeks to reduce its effects on the nation's health. 'We do need to ensure that this programme enables all patients to access appropriate preventative treatments and empowers clinicians to help design the correct services. 'It must also avoid producing any additional bureaucratic burden on GP services and the wider NHS.'","Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, revealed weight-loss scheme for staff .

"Mike Holpin, a  recovering alcoholic from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, has an unusual way of keeping track of his children. With 22 that carry his last name, 18 who don't and 'probably a few more', Mr Holpin is one of the UK's most prolific fathers with offspring aged between 37 and three. To keep track of all his children, who were born to 20 different mothers, he has had their names tattooed across his back. Scroll down for video . Prolific: Mike Holpin, 56, has 40 children with 20 different women but thinks he may have more . Although he insists that he loves all of his children, Mr Holpin is no longer in touch with some, while others were removed by social services thanks to his alcoholism and womanising. Nevertheless, he says he is a changed character who wants nothing more than to reunite his vast brood - and would like to add a few more if he can. 'I'm as fertile as sin,' he explains. 'I don't believe in contraception and I love sex.' According to Mr Holpin, his first sexual experience came aged nine but his baby-making career didn't really get underway until he got a job at a fairground in his late teens. 'Boys working on rides like that, they're only there for one reason and that's to pull women,' he reminisces. 'Good looking boys are better but funny boys are spectacular. 'You have to do some manoeuvring but me, I thought, I just want sex. I'd pat them on the rump and if they say f*** off then they're not really up for it. If they say yes, then great.' Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo . Reformed: Mr Holpin, a recovering alcoholic, says he is a reformed character and wants to reunite his family . Taken: Because of his alcoholism, many of his children were taken by social services and grew up in care . Although Mr Holpin has had many girlfriends, he admits to having had only six serious relationships, all of which fell victim to his ongoing battle with alcohol. His children too have suffered because of his alcoholism, with nearly all being taken into care as a result. It is, says Mr Holpin, his biggest regret. 'Due to my drinking and my womanising, most of my kids have gone through the care system,' he explains. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they've suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I'm an alcoholic. I'm still an alcoholic - I just don't practise it.' Now the reformed character is hoping to reunite his huge brood and fulfil the promise he made to each child as they were removed. 'When they went into care, I made a promise that no matter how long it took, I will get my kids home,' he says. Perfect: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Adding: He hopes to add to his family, aged between 37 and three, in the future . 'I miss all the fun we used to have so I guess getting them back, my life will be set. My life will be perfect.' Mr Holpin also says he would like to add to his family with the help of his fiancée Diane but can't resist reminiscing about the pulling techniques he used in the past. 'There's nothing nicer than a single fellow with a baby,' he smirks. 'Sex? It's sex is all it is.  You could look like the back of a bus but sex is sex. You do doggy style if she's ugly. 'I'm only 56,' he continues. 'I'll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I'm doing what God wants.' Now, he says, he is a reformed character. 'I've got so much love in me for my kids, it's spilling over,' he says. 'I need them more than they need me to be honest. I can't be without them.' He also says he hopes his children will be able to forgive him, both for their upbringing in care and for his lengthy reproductive career. 'I can't make up for what I've done,' he admits. 'All I can do is be there for them now. I'll keep fighting.'","Mike Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, has around 40 children .

He added: 'At least we left 'em wanting more. And that alone, when you think about it, is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago. 'We had a lot of laughs, we had a lot of tiffs. We went to amazing places and we went to some s***holes. We nearly killed a presenter, we had to run for the border. 'When you're feeling low in your working day at any point, look around at some of the c*** on TV, then have a think about Top Gear, 2002- 2015, and say to yourself: ""I made that"".' Reassuring them that they will keep their jobs even though Jeremy Clarkson lost his he said: 'For those of you who still rely on it for work, don't worry, because the BBC will make sure the show continues. 'Our stint as guardians of Top Gear was a good one, but we were only part of the show's history, not the whole of it. Those two words are bigger than us.'. The email was leaked by a BBC member of staff yesterday, which led to Mr Wilman denying he had quit the corporation. It appears he is a member of BBC staff whereas Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond are self-employed on freelance contracts. These were all due expire today. Final time? James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson on set in the final episode shown before the presenter lost his job . New wheels: Clarkson was seen taking delivery of a black Mercedes car at his flat yesterday as he prepares for life after the BBC . Top Gear presenter James May has been spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob - who may  be in charge of trying to keep May and Richard Hammond . As the corporation confirmed Mr Wilman is still a member of staff he said: 'The email I wrote yesterday was not a resignation statement, and nor was it meant for public consumption. 'It was a private note of thanks to 113 people who have worked on the show over the years, but clearly one of those 113 is a bit of a tit, because they shared it with a website. 'I don't get this modern obsession with sharing, linking, forwarding, re-tweeting; whatever happened to a private moment? Andy Wilman, Top Gear’s longstanding executive producer, has known Mr Clarkson since they were children, when they both attended the £10,500-a-term Repton School in Derby. The two men have been inseparable for years, and BBC executives put trust in Mr Wilman to keep Mr Clarkson in check, following a string of scandals. The production company set up by Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear executive Andy Wilman, right, was formed for next to nothing in October 2006 and has now made them millions. The pair went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. New boys at Repton were called ‘stigs’ and the pair had the appropriate idea of calling their sometimes put-upon test driver ‘The Stig’. Bedder 6 was later bought into by BBC Worldwide in 2007, purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company. Its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago, where it made a £1.8million post-tax profit and paid out £700,000 to its shareholders. In 2012 BBC bought Clarkson out - making him £5million. There is speculation about where the name Bedder 6 comes from, and it is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. 'And if I were to resign, I wouldn't do it publicly, I'd do it old school by handing in my, er, notice, to someone upstairs in HR. 'I work behind the camera and I wouldn't presume for one moment to think people are interested in what I do. Now, everyone back to work.' Mr Wilman has been a regular visitor to his friend Jeremy Clarkson since his sacking a week ago, and was last seen leaving his west London flat in his Mercedes sports car on Friday. The previous day he had met with Clarkson and Top Gear co-star James May for lunch, presumably to discuss the scandal and what the team would do next. Last Wednesday, on the day the presenter's sacking was announced Mr Wilman was again at Clarkson's flat, this time with the star's girlfriend Phillipa Sage, . James May was yesterday spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob. The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer-by for an autograph. The BBC declined to say what the meeting between the two was about, although it appears creative director Alan Yentob is in charge of trying to keep May and Hammond. Last week he said  he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson. He also told the Media Show that it was 'perfectly natural' for the pair to have reservations about continuing Top Gear without Clarkson. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' He added: 'The question of what happens next for Top Gear is a conversation which must go on between the controller of BBC2 Kim Shillinglaw, between Andy (Wilman - producer of Top Gear) and the team.' Sources have told MailOnline that ITV are prepared to offer him £10million to sign for the trio, with Clarkson's executive producer and schoolfriend Andy Wilman having reportedly met with them. Netflix are also said to be keen to sign them up for an exclusive online, worldwide series that could make them substantially more money. BBC director general Tony Hall sacked Clarkson, 54, after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘unprovoked verbal and physical attack’ on junior producer Oisin Tymon, 36 because he could not have a steak. The row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the Yorkshire hotel where the TV crew were staying after a day’s filming. Well, at least we left 'em wanting more. And that alone, when you think about it, is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago. I know none of us wanted it to end this way, but for a moment I'd like us to look back and think about just what an incredible thing you all had a hand in creating. When Jane Root gave us the green light in 2002, the brief was to reinvigorate a car show and get an audience of three million. What you all ended up making was one of the most iconic programmes in TV history, a show about cars that went global, won countless awards, was devoured by non car fans and ended up in the Guinness Book of Records. We had a lot of laughs, we had a lot of tiffs. We went to amazing places and we went to some s***holes. We nearly killed a presenter, we had to run for the border. We started off with whoever we could get in the Reasonably Priced Car, and ended up with Tom Cruise. Throughout all this we made television that was beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen to. The work ethic never slipped, the desire for everyone in this dysfunctional family to do right by the show never faltered. Jeremy, Richard and James, as the visible tip of the iceberg, got most of the attention and praise, but you all in your own fields had such an immense hand in weaving this unforgettable tapestry. I would love to single out everybody by name to thank them for what they did, but it's impossible and I'd forget someone I shouldn't have and that would be crap, so I'll just say Jim, I'm sorry we never got a bear to drive an automatic. For those of you who still rely on it for work, don't worry, because the BBC will make sure the show continues. Our stint as guardians of Top Gear was a good one, but we were only part of the show's history, not the whole of it. Those two words are bigger than us. Anyway, when you're feeling low in your working day at any point, look around at some of the c*** on TV, then have a think about Top Gear, 2002- 2015, and say to yourself: 'I made that.' A big, big, big thank you, which will never be enough. Andy.","Andy Wilman forced to say he's not quit after email to 113 Top Gear staff .

"Microsoft is making a cheaper version of its Surface Pro 3 tablet computer in an effort to appeal to students and budget-conscious families. The new Surface 3 has a slightly smaller 10.8inch screen, but will run a full version of Windows. Microsoft hopes it will be able to replace a traditional laptop for many buyers, and help it fend off Apple's iPad and Macbook laptops. Scroll down for video . Microsoft hopes the new cheaper tablet will appeal to students and budget-conscious families - and lure buyers away from Apple. The new tablet has a slightly smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 . Atom x7 Processor . Front- (3.5MP) and rear-facing (8MP) cameras that both capture 1080p video . 10 hour battery life . 'As we planned the next addition to the Surface family, the questions to answer for our customers became simple,' said Panos Panay of Microsoft. 'What product would we build to be sure we could make the very best of what we built in Surface Pro 3 available to many, many more people? 'We started with what we’re known for — a great tablet that works as a laptop, the ability to run all Windows apps including full Office, and a pen experience that really sets Surface apart. 'We knew we would offer all of this in a more affordable package but decided at the outset that we would make no compromise on maintaining the beautiful fit and finish, the craftsmanship that so many love in our Surface products.' Priced at $499 (vs $799 to $1,949 for the Pro 3), the new tablet has a slightly smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 - a slower processor, and less flexible kickstand - just three angles rather than unlimited positions. A version with more storage and memory will cost $599. The firm will sell keyboard covers for £129, turning the tablet into a full featured windows laptop. Microsoft will also sell a stylus for the Surface 3 separately for $49 . A keyboard cover, one of the Surface's distinctive features, adds another $129. Microsoft bills the Surface line as a laptop replacement when used with the cover. And Microsoft will sell a stylus separately for $49. (It's included with the Pro 3.) The new Surface model is thinner and lighter, partly because it gets rid of the fan - similar to Apple's new MacBook laptop. At 214 pixels per inch, the screen resolution is comparable to the Pro 3's. Battery life is promised at 10 hours for video playback. The Surface 3 runs the regular version of Windows 8.1, just like the Pro 3. In the past, Microsoft has used a lightweight version called RT in its cheaper tablets. The Surface 3 also has a USB port, a feature that distinguishes the Surface line from most rival tablets.","Users can buy $129 keyboard cover to turn tablet into laptop .

"Aviation experts today reassured travellers that the A320 is still one of the safest planes in the world despite a crash in the French Alps which claimed 150 lives. As emergency crews worked to retrieve wreckage from the site near Digne-les-Bains, in France, theories continued to circulate about what caused Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 to fall from the skies. There has been some speculation about the track record of the model which experts were quick to quash. Paul Hayes, safety director at aviation consultancy Ascend, said: 'The A320 family has a very good safety record considering that there is a fleet of 6,000 aircraft out there.' Scroll down for video . The safety of the Airbus A320 is being looked at following the Germanwings crash in France (file photo) Safety experts said it was too early to speculate on the case of the crash, but noted that accidents during the cruise phase of the flight are rare, even though this comes less than three months after the AirAsia disaster. 'We have had a couple of events recently but in general jetliners don't crash during the cruise,' said Hayes. Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of best-selling book Cockpit Confidential, allayed any fears the accident was purely down to the aircraft model. 'The A320 is a very sophisticated and popular model,' Smith told MailOnline Travel. 'I am not seeing anything in this accident that encourages me to think it is specific to that model. All Airbus models are designed similarly, and the A320 is the blueprint for other variations such as the A319 and the A321. 'I don't like the idea of blaming these accidents on specific models; this question is asked all the time, and all it does it leads to aircraft being compared with other aircraft. 'Crashes are so rare, and so comparing them considering the type of model is statistically hair-splitting. 'What you will also see is there is lots of discussion, and sadly lots of misunderstanding concerning how computers and how pilots 'fly' the plane. 'Usually in these cases, there isn't a single case, and it is a chain of events that can lead to something like this happening.' Wreckage and debris lie on the mountain slopes after the crash of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . According to separate surveys published last year by manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, only 10 to 12 per cent of fatal accidents take place when the aircraft is at cruise height. The A320 is described as a 'workhorse' of the aerospace industry, transporting more than a million people a day from business travellers to backpackers. The 150-seat medium-haul jet is one of the world's most intensively used, together with its main rival, the Boeing 737. The Germanwings aircraft that crashed in the French Alps yesterday, killing all 150 people on board, was also flying on the industry's most widely-sold engines, made by French-US venture CFM. More than 3,600 of the jets are in operation and another 3,700 are waiting to be built as Asia's economic expansion fuels record demand. Put together with the rest of the A320 family of twin-engine, single-aisle jets - the A318, A319 and A321 - more than 6,000 are in use several times a day. Experts say its safety record is among the industry's highest, but it made grim headlines in December when an A320 belonging to Air Asia plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people on board. The crash is still being investigated. The Airbus A320 has been described as the 'workhorse' of the aviation industry (file photo) To airlines, the main value of the £65million ($97million) jet is reliability and quick turnarounds, the features it shares with the rival 737. But it made dramatic headlines in 2009 when a US Airways jet ditched safely in the Hudson River after a bird strike. Boeing statistics for its rival's best-selling model show that up to the end of 2013, there were 0.14 fatal A320 accidents per million departures where the plane was destroyed or written off. The comparable versions of Boeing 737 had a rate of 0.11 per million departures, making them both among the industry's safest models compared with the industry average of 0.76, or more than 4.6 for the earliest days of the jet age. A helicopter of the French civil security services flies near Seyne, south-eastern France near the crash site . At 24 years old, however, the A320 that crashed was at the upper end of the service life used by many first-tier airlines. Jetliners are built to fly safely for considerably longer but most major airlines sell them sooner for economic reasons. Patrick Smith added: 'Planes are built to last many years, so long as they are maintained in accordance with regulations, this shouldn't be an issue. 'There are airline specific procedures as planes age, and obviously the older they get the stricter the checks will get.' Jim Morris, partner in UK law firm Irwin Mitchell, added: 'There are many airliners out there older than this that are flying safely.' Germanwings parent Lufthansa recently placed orders for over 100 new A320s. To ordinary passengers, the A320 looks much like other jets. But in the cockpit it represented a revolution when it began service in 1988 as the first 'fly-by-wire' jetliner relying on computers to fly within safe limits and replacing the usual control yoke with a side-stick, inspired by the F-16 fighter. The increased reliance on computers, though increasingly common across the industry, prompted a bitter debate between Airbus and pilot unions over whether too much control was being taken out of human hands. The argument rumbles on to this day.","The Airbus A320 is one of world's most intensively used aircraft .

"The brother of a woman murdered by her husband is accused of mishandling more than $30,000 raised by a charity formed in her memory. Sheri Coleman, 31, together with her sons Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9, were found strangled in their beds in Columbia, Illinois, in 2009. Husband Christopher Coleman, a former chief of security for televangelist Joyce Meyer, was convicted of first-degree murder two years later and is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Mario DeCicco was named in Tuesday's lawsuit which alleges that 'at least $33,173' of the money donated to the Sheri Ann & Her Boys charity has been improperly spent . Sheri's brother Mario DeCicco was supposed to be managing a charity setup in their honor called Sheri Ann & Her Boys dedicated to combating domestic abuse. But on Tuesday he was named in a civil lawsuit which alleges that 'at least $33,173 of the charity's funds appeared to have been improperly withdrawn as cash and spent on expenses outside of the organization's mission.' Only $2,550 of the money appeared to have been spent on domestic violence prevention, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Allegations about the missing money first emerged last year and DeCicco told the Post-Dispatch at the time that he given $28,000 in cash to a woman's shelter in Chicago, although he refused to reveal its name. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who filed Tuesday's lawsuit, claims the money didn't go to the shelter. Her lawsuit alleges that DeCicco violated the state's Charitable Trust and Solicitation for Charity Acts and she is asking for a judge to order a full accounting of the money he withdrew as cash. Christopher Coleman was convicted of first-degree murder following the 2009 deaths of Sheri Coleman, 31, together with her sons Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9, . If foung guilty DeCicco would be liable for any assets improperly used  and could face criminal prosecution. Madigan also wants him removed as the charity's president and for it to be dissolved. 'The circumstances in this case are extremely disheartening,' Madigan said. 'I am filing this action to ensure that the misappropriated charitable funds are recovered and dedicated to violence prevention efforts as originally intended.' In the wake of the shocking murders, friends and neighbors had raised the money via garage sales, lemonade stands and other community events. A Bikers Save Lives benefit ride had raised over $15,000 alone. Prosecutors said Coleman, 32, killed his family to start a new life with a lover in Florida while avoiding a divorce that might have exposed an extramarital affair and possibly cost him his job as a bodyguard for high-profile televangelist Joyce Meyer. Friends and neighbors of Sheri Coleman and her boys raised over $30,000 which was supposed to go towards helping victims of domestic abuse . Prosecutors argued at his 2011 trial that Coleman feared he would lose his $100,000-a-year job as part of the personal security detail for multi-millionaire Pentecostal preacher  Meyer - who travels the world delivering evangelical lectures - if his affair were to become public. The year before the murders he started a relationship with Tara Lintz, a childhood friend of Coleman's wife, who testified that Coleman had promised he would serve divorce papers on May 5, 2009 - the same day his family were found murdered in their beds inside their Waterloo home. Pentecostal preacher Joyce Meyer, Christian Coleman's former employer, who travels the world delivering evangelical lectures . Coleman allegedly spent six months plotting the brutal murder, shortly after beginning an affair with Miss Lintz, a Florida cocktail waitress. The jury was shown explicit photos and messages exchanged between the pair, including a video of Coleman masturbating. They had also filmed a sex tape in Hawaii. According to the prosecution, Coleman started sending his family threatening, expletive-filled messages from a gmail account he set up himself. The first read simply: 'Your family is done'. They continued with 'tell Joyce to stop preaching [expletive] or your Chris's family will die' and 'I will kill them all as they sleep.' But prosecutors say the threats were in fact a ploy to set up a mystery stalker as the murderer. They claim he decided to kill his wife rather than reveal his affair and go through a divorce . Charismatic Christian Meyer - who Coleman had known since he was a child - gave a pre-recorded testimony saying that Coleman most likely would have lost his job had he been revealed as having an affair. The day before killings, Coleman said he wasn't feeling well and was given the day off by Meyer, who said was unusual behavior for her employee. The next day, May 5, 2009, Coleman left his comfortable suburban house in Waterloo to go to the gym at 5.43am. After his workout he said he called home and was worried when no-one answered, so he rang a neighbor, police officer Justin Barlow, to check on his family. Officer Jason Donjon, who entered the house with Mr Barlow, testified that they found the house covered in threatening messages daubed in red paint. The graffiti read: 'I am watching', 'punished' and 'u have paid'. Then they discovered the bodies of Mrs Coleman and her two sons, killed in separate bedrooms. Cops who entered the Coleman's home in 2009 testified that they found the house covered in threatening messages daubed in red paint and the bodies of Mrs Coleman and her two sons in separate bedrooms . Mrs Coleman was left naked in bed, strangled with a ligature. Her eldest son, Garett, was curled up in bed with spray paint on his sheets. Finally the youngest, Gavin, was seen lying face down with his limbs dangling either side of the bed and swear words daubed on his covers. Later, pathologist Dr Raj Nanduri, who performed the autopsy, said it was likely the victims were strangled between 3am and 5am - before Coleman left for the gym. Police also said they found a Word document on Coleman's computer that had details about Lintz, including her ring size, and even a name for their future child, Zoe. Coleman pleaded not guilty to all charges. He has never admitted having anything to do with the murders.","Mario DeCicco is accused of spending 'at least $33,173' of the money donated to the Sheri Ann & Her Boys charity .

"David Wawrzynski claims the 'Little Dipper' condiment package he patented in 1997 led H.J. Heinz Co. to develop its Dip & Squeeze ketchup packets, which it rolled out in February 2010 . A Michigan food entrepreneur claims the 'Little Dipper' condiment package he patented in 1997 led H.J. Heinz Co. to develop its Dip & Squeeze ketchup packets, which it rolled out in February 2010, lawyers in opening statements told a federal court jury in Pittsburgh on Monday. The trial, expected to last through until Thursday, will determine whether or not Pittsburgh-based Heinz used David Wawrzynski's 'concrete, new and novel' ideas when it developed the dual-purpose ketchup packets. If the jury rules in the Detroit businessman's favor and determines Heinz agreed to pay for the ideas, a separate trial will begin June 10 on how much Heinz owes Wawrzynski. 'Heinz says it didn't use any of Mr. Wawrzynski's ideas — they thought it up all on their own,' his attorney, Eugene Boyle Jr. told the jury. 'We're here to tell you that's not true.' Boyle told The Associated Press he can't say how much Wawrzynski is seeking because an expert hired to calculate the sum hasn't issued a final report. But Heinz attorney David Wolfsohn said Heinz owes nothing because the Dip & Squeeze owes nothing to the cone-shaped container that Wawrzynski invented. Drawings of two versions of that product were shown to the jury, including one with a keyhole-shaped opening that enables a person to dip a french fry into ketchup, while wiping off excess amounts as it's pulled out of the opening. Wawrzynski isn't claiming Heinz copied the exact design. Rather, he contends Heinz didn't have the idea for a ketchup container that could be dipped into and squeezed until they heard his pitch. Wolfsohn denied that claim. Heinz claims the Dip & Squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the 'Dunk 'n Squirt' that it shelved in 2006 because it couldn't make it cheaply enough . The Dip & Squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the 'Dunk 'n Squirt' that Heinz began working on in 2002 but shelved in 2006 because it couldn't find a vendor to make the throwaway ketchup packets cheaply enough, the company says. The packets must be cheap to purchase because fast-food restaurants and others give the packets away for free, Wolfsohn said. Prototypes developed in 2006 were keystone-shaped — like Heinz's iconic ketchup label — and had a peelable top if a customer wanted to dip a fry and a tear-off end so the ketchup could be squeezed, Wolfsohn said. Except for the keystone shape, the Dip & Squeeze packets are nearly identical. But Boyle insists the idea came from the 44-year-old Wawrzynski, who began working in the food industry at 13. After working at pizzerias over five years from the time he was 16, Wawrzynski launched Wok to You, a firm that delivers Asian food from 30 different Detroit-area restaurants. 'Dave's been tinkering with condiment packaging since high school,' Boyle said. When an earlier letter to Heinz didn't attract attention, he wrote to then-CEO William Johnson in March 2008 and met with Heinz officials a month later, Boyle said. Heinz doesn't deny the meeting took place, but says the discussions revolved around his hand-held, cone-shaped container designed to keep french fries from dripping ketchup. 'The ideas that were discussed at that meeting had nothing to do with the Dip & Squeeze,' Wolfsohn said.","David Wawrzynski patented his 'Little Dipper' condiment package in 1997 .

"Lara Fernandes-Pontes was knocked down by a Land Rover after she dashed out into the road to get a paddling pool for a friend's party . A six-year-old girl was knocked down and killed after she ran across the street to retrieve a paddling pool for a friend's birthday party, a coroner heard today. 'Happy' schoolgirl Lara Fernandes-Pontes was being dropped off at a classmate's party by her parents when the tragic accident occurred. The excited youngster had just arrived at her friend's house when she remembered she had left a small paddling pool in the boot of her father's car parked across the road. She dashed out between two parked cars to get it and was struck by a Land Rover Discovery in South Oxhey last July, Hertfordshire Coroners' Court heard today. The driver, who had been making his way down the narrow street at a slow speed, would have had 'no chance' of stopping before he hit Lara, the hearing was told. She was airlifted to nearby Watford General Hospital but doctors could find no signs of life and she was pronounced dead. Her parents were visibly shaken as the inquest was told forensic police investigators found scuff marks on the bumper of the Land Rover where it had struck Lara's head. Coroner for Hertfordshire, Edward Thomas, said: 'Mum said they had been at Hayling Road dropping Lara off at a party and dad had parked opposite the address. 'Lara and mum had alighted and crossed the road. As they approached the door Lara remembered she had forgotten a small paddling pool in the boot of the car - it was obviously a swimming party and she turned and ran back across to get it. That's when she was struck by the car. 'Obviously she was so looking forward to the party, she was so excited and she wasn't concentrating properly when this tragedy occurred. 'I'm sure that Lara died instantly. I have received various reports about Lara including her medical records. She seems to have been really healthy and well cared for. She was a very happy girl and you can tell that she was a very happy, very well looked after, very well cared for girl. 'She was going to a birthday party, the excitement children have going to birthday parties. She must have really been looking forward to that birthday party. Here we have a really healthy, young girl who was going to a birthday party. 'She died of a traumatic head injury and that's why she would have felt nothing whatsoever. She would have died at that moment, the instant it happened and there's nothing anybody could have done to save her. 'A lot of people tried their very, very best but the injuries she suffered were too severe.' Police constable Anthony Winter told the hearing in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, that the driver would have had around one second between seeing Lara and hitting her. He said that the Land Rover Discovery IV had been driving at between 14mph and 16mph at the time of the accident, and that Lara was so short the male driver would not have seen her above his bonnet at the point of impact. The six-year old ran out between two parked cars to get the paddling pool and was struck by a Land Rover Discovery in South Oxhey (pictured) last July . 'The driver had about one second to react by the time he saw Lara. You've got to see what's happening, think what you're going to do and then do it. With such a low distance and such a short time there's nothing he could have done about it.' The tragedy unfolded in South Oxhey, Hertfordshire, on July 13 last year. Coroner Mr Thomas said: 'This was an area of parked cars. The driver says he was mindful of going down the hill and then out of nowhere he saw a small person coming out from his right hand side. He said he reacted instinctively. 'Other witnesses saw a girl running diagonally across from a house where a party was going on and that she was looking ahead. They saw this four wheel drive car which wasn't driving fast. They said that it was 'bound to happen'.' He said that police had used witness reports and CCTV footage from a neighbouring house to piece together what had happened and calculate the driver's speed. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he described Lara's death as a 'tragic accident'. 'She just remembered something was in the boot of the car and she was going to get it. The poor driver had no chance whatsoever, it was quite clear that as soon as he realised what was happening it would have happened. 'There's no doubt from the CCTV and also the police calculations that the speed of the vehicle was well within the speed limit and it was an appropriate speed to be driving.' The youngster, who the coroner described as a 'a very happy girl' and a 'very well looked after girl,' was rushed to Watford General Hospital where paramedics attempted to revive her, despite her having no heartbeat. Lara was was airlifted to nearby Watford General Hospital (pictured) but doctors could find no signs of life and she was pronounced dead after the incident . The Coroner said: 'Lara was taken to Watford General Hospital after an air ambulance arrived. When the helicopter arrived they confirmed there was no heart beat, I am sure she died instantly.' He said the post-mortem 'confirmed she died of a traumatic head injury, so she felt nothing whatsoever. 'Nothing I can say can take away how awful this is for Lara's parents, her family and also for all of Lara's friends,' he added. The youngster's family were now set to return to their native Portugal following the outcome of the inquest, he added. The family declined to comment after the inquest. But Lara’s cousin, Jessica Fernandes Oliveira, 21, said at the time of the tragedy that the loss was ‘devastating’. ‘She will be eternally missed and remain in my heart, forever treasuring her beautiful smile that created wonderful memories in the short time she had been with us,’ she said. Aunt Gabby Araujo, 23, added: ‘I will miss her face lighting up when she was with me.’ Police are investigating the collision. The birthday girl’s mother, who asked not to be named,  revealed after the crash that she was even considering moving house to escape the memories of Lara’s death. ‘We have only good things to say about her. She was my daughter’s best friend and she was in my house all the time,’ she said. ‘I am very shaken up by what happened … She was so young. She always had a smile on her face. I might have to move because every time I open the door I am just going to see her face.’","Lara Fernandes-Ponteswas on the way to a party when  hit by Land Rover .

"The newborn child of murder-accused U.S. teenager Heather Mack was rushed to a prison clinic today after falling ill in her mother’s Bali prison cell. Just one week after the child’s birth in an Indonesian hospital, baby Stella Schaefer - named after Miss Mack’s co-accused boyfriend Tommy Schaefer - developed a high fever and her dark skin took on a yellowish color in the cell, which her mother shares with eight other prisoners. The little girl was hurried into the clinic, which is located within the prison walls, and given immediate treatment by doctors. Scroll down for video . Newborn: Heather Mack is pictured above leaving hospital for Kerobokan prison in Bali, Infdonesia, where her child has fallen ill . Tiny: Miss Mack's shawl briefly slips and the head of the tiny baby, famous even before she was born, is revealed . While the problem has not been revealed, a prison source told Daily Mail Online that Miss Mack and guards became concerned when the baby, whom she was carrying back to her cell, started to ‘burn up’ on Tuesday. But it was the yellow appearance of the baby’s skin that was causing the greatest worry. With Miss Mack being concerned about the child’s health, doctors told guards at Kerobokan Prison that she wanted her boyfriend, who is being held in the men’s section, to be present in the clinic while the baby was being treated. This was allowed and, according to sources, Miss Mack and Schaefer held hands while doctors attended to the child. Schaefer had first set his eyes on his baby daughter on Monday afternoon after his girlfriend returned from the Sanglah Hospital, where she gave birth to the baby via caesarian. He was escorted by guards to Miss Mack’s cell where, in a tearful meeting, he held his daughter in his arms, tears running down his face. Trial: Mack (left) and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right), both from Chicago, are accused of murdering Mack's socialite mother Sheila Von Weise-Mack, 62, and hiding her body in a suitcase at an upmarket Bali hotel . Women sharing Miss Mack’s cell also gathered around mother and child, but Miss Mack has been warned that their congratulations could turn to anger if the baby wakes them up with her crying night after night. ‘Keeping the baby in a humid, unclean cell, where prisoners sleep on the floor, is hardly the place for a newborn baby,’ said a Bali resident who visits the jail regularly. ‘Adults get sick in there, so what chance does a newborn have?’ Victim: Miss Mack with her late mother Sheila Von Weise-Mack, whom she and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer are accused of murdering . Reports from a jail source say that the baby will be kept in the clinic under observation while her mother remains in her cell. But if the child, born a few weeks prematurely, does not improve within the next 48 hours she will have to be returned to hospital. ‘There seems no doubt that the baby needs pretty intensive treatment,’ said the jail visitor after talking to prison officials. ‘It may be that she will have to be returned to hospital within a few hours.’ The drama surrounding the baby’s health was being played out on the day that Miss Mack and Schaefer were due to return to court for the continuation of the murder charges against them. They have been accused of killing Miss Mack’s 62-year-old socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack, from Chicago, in the upmarket St Regis Hotel in Bali’s seaside Nusa Dua district. Schaefer has admitted hitting her with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. The three judges who were due to hear the case were informed that the accused couple would not be available due to the baby’s health. The case was adjourned and is expected to resume next week. But while Miss Mack faces ongoing concerns about the baby’s condition and the prospect of being sentenced to death if she is convicted of her mother’s murder, she is understood to be under pressure in another direction. Schaefer’s mother, Kia Walker, visited Miss Mack in hospital and, after setting her eyes on the new-born baby, is understood to have begged Miss Mack not to take the child back to the prison with her. But as events have shown, that is what she did - but if the baby’s condition does not improve she will be sent back to the hospital again.","Mack gave birth to a child this week while being held in Indonesian prison .

"Police believe they have found the bodies of a pregnant celebrity chef and her husband three days after a man was charged with their murder. Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season eight finalist on the Food Network Star, and Joseph Codd, 45, were killed in their Leicester, North Carolina, home last Thursday, police have said. The remains were discovered in Buncombe County on Thursday, but officials say they have not been positively identified. Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker who they had hired to work on their home, was booked on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Believed dead: Police believe they have found the bodies of celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45 . Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged . Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21 . Dr. Sharon Sweede told Ashville's Citizen Times: 'I did a brief exam of these remains. We don't have positive identifications. We really can't make any other comment . It has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since . Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time . Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield . It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to The Charley Project cold cases website. In February, police were authorized to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens, Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.' Movie set: Mrs Codd (pictured in a Food Network photo) ) was due to cater on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production when they vanished. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd - she had just announced her firm would be providing food on the set of The Big Short . Home: In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (pictured). They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it . Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show,  'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder. In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday. Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'. Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed. Big names: The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell . Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.","Cristie Schoen Codd, 38 and Joseph Codd were reported missing Sunday .

"Anti terror powers drawn up amid concern at British Muslims  joining ISIS including Mohammed Emwazi, the 26-year-old known as ‘Jihadi John’ Sweeping new anti-terror powers will be introduced this week – including powers to stop ‘jihadi brides’ boarding planes and a ban on extremists working with children. The terror proposals are being drawn up by the Home Office amid growing concerns at the threat posed by home-grown fanatics. A Government counter-terror strategy would also lead to closer scrutiny of Sharia courts operating in the UK, and job centres would be required to help identify people potentially at risk of being radicalised. The raft of new measures were revealed in a leaked document published by the Sunday Telegraph, which calls on the government to be ‘more assertive’ in challenging extremism. It has been drawn up in the wake of worrying revelations about British Muslims going overseas to join ISIS including Mohammed Emwazi, the 26-year-old known as ‘Jihadi John’. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan admitted she was ‘concerned’ about what might be being taught in some schools. She told Murnaghan on Sky News: ‘I’m not going to comment on what is a leaked document, but I think as Education Secretary it would be right for me to say I am of course concerned about what might be taught in some of our schools. ‘And we have since last year required all schools to actively promote these fundamental British values so that our education system is opening up young minds, it is not closing them down. ‘And I think the messages that young people receive, whether it’s in school or outside school, are very, very important.’ The new strategy has not been signed off by ministers, and some of the measures could be expected to raise objections among Liberal Democrats if they are deemed to infringe civil liberties. It could lead to changes in the rules granting citizenship to encourage new arrivals to embrace ‘British values’. It also proposes a penalties scheme to encourage people on benefits to learn English. Schoolgirls Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum left the UK for Turkey to make their way to Syria to join ISIS . The document states that ‘in the past, there has been a risk that the Government sends an ambivalent and dangerous message - that it doesn't really matter if you don't believe in democracy’. It adds: ‘We need to stand up and be more assertive in promoting our values and challenging the extremists who fundamentally oppose them.’ ‘This will include explaining our foreign policy (and) promoting mainstream voices supporting the quiet majority in all communities who oppose extremism.’ The Home Office concluded that the so-called ‘Trojan Horse plot’ involving the infiltration of schools by extremists in the Midlands, was ‘not an isolated example of schools where extreme views became prevalent’. And it warned that universities, local councils and charities are vulnerable to ‘entryism’ whereby extremists deliberately secure jobs in particular institutions in order to promote their values. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to push through new anti-terror powers to stop British Muslims being radicalised . Three East London schoolgirls are still unaccounted for after leaving the UK heading for Syria. Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are thought to have been groomed by extremists using social media sites. Around 700 British Muslims are reported to have travelled to Syria to fight with Islamic State, and several hundred have returned to Britain. Last month the Washington Post uncovered the identity of ‘Jihadi John’ – the terrorist seen in multiple propaganda beheading videos featuring brutal murders of Western hostages. Last week the Mail revealed the staggering cost of benefits for Emwazi, a university graduate radicalised in London, and his family. It is thought that housing him and his relatives in affluent parts of London has cost taxpayers up to £400,000.","New anti-terror proposals are being drawn up by the Home Office .

"Police are hunting a masked gang who raided a Birmingham swingers club - attacking a man and a woman and sending semi-naked customers fleeing into the street. Three thugs targeted Tudor Lounge, based at the 400-year-old Stratford House in Highgate, just after 9.30pm on Wednesday, March 19. One man, aged 53, was punched to the ground, while a woman was pushed during the raid at the timber-framed, Grade II listed property - built in 1601 in the reign of Elizabeth I. Masked men stormed the Tudor Lounge swingers venue in Birmingham, pictured, during terrifying raid . The venue advertises itself as the leading and most exclusive 'swingers and fetish club in Birmingham . The raiders left the club empty handed but several customers were forced onto the street in their costumes . The gang fled empty-handed but the raid added to local concerns about the business, which has temporary planning permission as a private members' club from Birmingham City Council. The raiders did not appear to be armed when they stormed the historic venue. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'Masked men ran into the club and we then saw lots of customers, half-naked or wrapped in towels, pouring out into the street. 'Residents feel the club is potentially attracting a criminal element to the area. 'It's not what people had in mind when they settled here. 'We feel the planning application for a private members' club was a very clever one in that those who even knew about it did not realise it would be a swingers' club. 'It seems to be busy most nights and Saturday night particularly so. 'Residents are now having problems parking their own cars, there have been some incidents of parking rows with visitors to the club. 'There's been some lewd behaviour in the area around the club, people coming out kissing and all over one another. 'There's been a lot of occasions where cars of men are cruising around. 'A lot of young girls live close by and parents are worried their children could be propositioned. 'There's also concern about property values going down.' West Midlands Police confirmed they are investigating the raid where one man was punched in the head . A woman, not pictured here, was pushed to the ground but was fortunately uninjured by her shocking ordeal . The club features several bedrooms and Jacuzzi-style baths which can be shared by several people . The Birmingham Mail revealed in January how Stratford House had been converted into the swingers club. And earlier this month the council told the tenants to carry on swinging after concluding no planning breaches had taken place. But the violent raid has renewed opposition to Tudor Lounge. Locals are now planning a petition claiming they were not consulted properly about the club, which is sited near Calthorpe School grounds, a park and homes. The resident added: 'We know this kind of club exists all over the country but think it should not be based in a residential area. 'It should be in or close to the city centre. 'The applicant's temporary planning application, granted by the council, also stated that he was allowed a maximum of 50 people in the club but there are times when there are more than 100 cars parked around the club, cars which don't belong to residents.' Locals in Birmingham want the club, which has communal showers, to closed down . Residents have been petitioning Birmingham City Council to strip the club of its operating licence . The club even features its own dungeon where people can tie each other up and enjoy unusual activities . A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police are investigating after masked raiders gained entry to a private function at the Tudor Lounge Club in Stratford Place, Highgate, at 9.35pm on March 18. 'Three men wearing ski masks were seen in the corridor. 'One man, aged 53, was punched in the head, resulting in him falling to the floor. 'He was treated for a cut to his nose and bump to his head. Another woman was pushed, but not injured. 'No weapons were seen. The men then left the building. Nothing was reported stolen. 'Police inquiries are on-going into the incident. No arrests have been made at this stage.' The Mail previously told how the timber-framed property - an ancient monument - had been transformed into a club for swingers and fetish fans, complete with a dungeon. The building was officially advertised online under the name Tudor Lounge after its current tenants signed a ten-year lease with property owner, Benjamin Jackson, last March. The city council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and had claimed no complaints had been raised at the time. Earlier this month a city council spokesman said: 'Officers visited the Tudor Lounge on January 29, 2015 to establish whether any licensable activities took place at this venue. 'They found its bar operates on a 'bring your own drinks' basis - the drinks featured in photos of the bar area were actually coloured water and cooking oil. 'Also the club appears to be set up for participation, rather than the presentation of any performance for an audience which might require an entertainment licence. 'At present there is no justification for revisiting the premises, but if officers receive new intelligence regarding activities at this venue this position may be reviewed.' The Tudor Lounge website, featuring pictures of scantily-clad women, has boasted of being the UK's most exclusive swingers venue. 'The building has been fully refurbished with only one thing in mind - your pleasure and enjoyment,' it said. When previously asked about complaints about the property's current use, a spokesman for the club said: 'People should mind their own business. 'We are consenting adults.'","The raiders left the Birmingham swingers' club empty handed after the raid .

"BBC political editor Nick Robinson has undergone a life-saving operation to remove a tumour . BBC political editor Nick Robinson has revealed that a life-saving operation to remove a tumour from his lung had been a 'complete success'. Mr Robinson, who announced in February that he was undergoing treatment for lung cancer, said an operation to remove it had gone well and 'normal service will be resumed as soon as possible'. Writing in a blog on the BBC's website, the 51-year-old thanked doctors and nurses at the Royal Brompton and Royal Free Hospitals for looking after him. He said: 'I am now beginning a course of chemotherapy to try to stop the cancer even daring to think of returning. I'm also working to restore the strength of my voice after the op. 'Many thanks to all the doctors and nurses who have been, and are, looking after me - particularly at the Royal Brompton and Royal Free Hospitals. 'Heartfelt thanks too to the many people who have been in touch with their good wishes.' News of his illness last month sparked an outpouring of messages on Twitter, with Prime Minister David Cameron one of the first to tweet a get-well message. He said: 'Sorry to hear you'll be off for a few weeks. I wish you well - and a speedy return before the general election.' Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted: 'Best wishes for a speedy recovery. Look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail soon.' Mr Robinson, who is married with three children, used the blog to kick-start his return to work and covering the election with some advice for voters. His message was: 'It's all about you. Not them. You.' Mr Robinson had been diagnosed with a rare bronchial carcinoid tumour. Located in the lungs' larger tubes, they are usually slow-growing. But they can spread and trigger cancer elsewhere in the body, becoming fatal. Bronchial carcinoid tumours are different from 'normal' lung cancer, which forms among the cells that line the lung. Carcinoid tumours are actually cancers of tissues that produce hormones and send messages, called the neuroendocrine system. They can occur in numerous organs. Two-thirds appear in the digestive tract, a quarter in the lungs, and others in the pancreas, kidney, ovary and testes, according to Cancer Research UK. Mr Robinson faced vicious personal attacks by supporters of the 'yes to independence' campaign during the Scottish referendum . Dr Keith Prowse, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, said while bronchial carcinoid tumours were malignant, they tended to be less aggressive than other forms. He said: 'I've had ten or a dozen patients who have had it removed successfully and are still around, some of them older than I am. The majority are cured by surgery. 'It's often possible to remove the tumours completely, because they tend to grow inside the air passage rather than into the lung.' About 70 per cent of patients live at least five years after being diagnosed, he added. But he said if they did spread, they tended to be fairly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Most people with bronchial carcinoid tumours are diagnosed after the age of 60, although they can have existed for years without any symptoms. Mr Robinson has been the Corporation's political editor since 2005, when he was poached from ITN. His illness follows that of his BBC predecessor, Andrew Marr, who suffered a stroke in January 2013 at the age of 53. After lengthy rehabilitation Mr Marr has made a good recovery.","Nick Robinson announced in February that he was undergoing treatment .

"The Nichol family had never been on holiday to Turkey before, nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package. So as my wife Suzie, nine-year-old daughter Sophie and I arrived at the Marti Myra resort on the Mediterranean coast, the place was facing a tough test. First impressions were good. The reception area was plush and polished, with acres of wood, glass and marble. John Nichol with his wife Suzie and nine-year-old daughter Sophie at the Marti Myra resort in Turkey . To Sophie's delight, plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi-fi and watching giant TVs. As the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar, the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because Marti Myra is a huge, rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities. All 551 rooms were taken when we stayed, housing around 1,100 adults and 500 children. But there was never any sense we were competing for space. This may well be because the site is set in 100 acres, has seven pools, water slides, beaches, an amphitheatre, five bars and seven restaurants. Sophie quickly made friends with other British children and more or less disappeared for the fortnight. This is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools, visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised. That said, I suspect the amount of vegetables consumed at their private lunches was in inverse proportion to the volume of ice-cream eaten. If that was the case they were missing out, as the food was tremendous - endless buffets of fresh fish, salads, grilled meats - and 20 desserts. For a small supplement, guests can also choose from à la carte restaurants. Marti Myra is in the Kemer region, which is dominated by the towering presence of Mount Tahtali, the highest peak in southern Turkey. It demands a visit so we took the cable car to the 7,757ft summit. At €210 (around £150) for the three of us, it wasn't cheap but it was worth it to experience the glorious panorama. The pool complex at Marti Myra was a hit with the Nichols family . In true Nichol-clan style, this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool. The only other added extra we chose to invest in was one of the £100-a-day pavilions on the pristine beach. These private retreats came equipped with robes, sofas, sunbeds and a fridge. And if you couldn't be bothered to open the fridge door yourself, a waiter would bring over drinks and snacks. We could have taken part in all sorts of activities, from aqua-aerobics to archery, dancing and poolside It's A Knockout-style games. The beach party was a riot of noise, while the nightly entertainment included amazing Kenyan acrobats. The Kids' Club production of Grease had Suzie and I doing the full John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John routine... much to Sophie's utter horror. For a more peaceful break you can simply retreat to the calm of the rolling gardens. Marti Myra really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family. Sophie was happy - and if children are happy, contentment for all will surely follow. GETTING THERE .

"A 27-year-old son received no money and a charge for home invasion after failed attempt to rob his mother at knifepoint. Austin Smith, of Pekin, Illinois, had nine knives and wore a mask in his attempt to steal the woman's credit cards and cash, but he did not leave the house with anything. The would-be robber, who tried but failed to tie his mother up to prevent her from calling the police, was arrested 90 minutes after the attempted theft around 12.45pm Friday afternoon. Austin Smith, 27, of Pekin, Illinois, was charged with home invasion after allegedly breaking into his mother's house and holding her at gunpoint but failing to get any money . It is assumed the mother recognized her son despite his mask, Pekin Police's Mike Eeten told the Pekin Daily Times. Smith's mother had told him not to come by the house. The son did not live at the address where he is thought to have broken a rear window and was arrested at a apartment complex about a mile away.

"A young albino kangaroo, spotted grazing on a rural property beside her mother, has delighted three young children who were convinced that its strange colouring was a joke. Michael Collins, who said he had noticed the white roo as joey on his Wattle Glen property in Victoria before, said it often visited his land. 'The kids… came running into the house saying ""Dad! Someone spray-painted him"",' Mr Collins said to Nine News. Scroll down for video . Michael Collins' three children noticed the young female grey kangaroo grazing beside its mother on their rural Wattle Glen property in Victoria . Daniel Ramp, the Director of the UTS Centre for Compassionate Conservation, told Daily Mail Australia that he could confirm the kangaroo was an albino. 'Yes it's an albino, not spray painted. It's definitely an albino eastern grey kangaroo, a young girl with her mum,' Dr Ramp said. He added that the occurrence of albinism in any species was incredibly rare and occurred in one- in-20,000. 'The kids… came running into the house saying ""Dad! Someone spray-painted him"",' Mr Collins said . Albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes, skin, hair, scales, or feathers. Daniel Ramp, director of Centre for Compassionate Conservation confirmed the roo was a healthy . 'They tend to get reported when people see them and that happens once every couple of years - it's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species,' Dr Ramp said. 'I've got photos of an albino wombat down in Gippsland that we caught on some remote camera-traps last year.' However Dr Ramp, who is working with an albino kangaroo population at Bathurst in New South Wales, said the young grey roo appeared to be quite healthy after examining the video captured by Mr Collins. As part of his own work, Dr Ramp is examining whether higher than average numbers of albino kangaroos in a certain population indicate that there are wider problems at hand, such as inbreeding. 'While it's not particularly negative for the individual kangaroos, it may mean these animals are inbreeding more than they normally would because they are constrained and they are struggling to connect with other populations,' he said. 'In our Bathurst studies we are wondering if the landscape is fraught for kangaroos.' 'It's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species,' Dr Ramp said of albinism in animals. One of his remote camera traps that detects motion captured this image of an albino wombat at Cape Liptrap Coastal Park  in Victoria during research into the importance of foraging herbivores in reducing fire risk . Albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes, skin, hair, scales, or feathers .","Michael Collins said the roo and its mother often visited his rural property .
Daniel Ramp, the Director of the UTS Centre for Compassionate Conservation, confirmed it was a young, female, albino grey kangaroo .
Albinism is a rare genetic condition that occurs in one-in-20,000 .
Dr Ramp said while they were rare, more albinos than normal in one population could indicate a wider problem for the animal species ."
"The Labour party has been accused of using the x-ray of a victim of child abuse in an attack advert. Medical experts claim the image of a broken leg depicts injuries consistent with a history of violence on a child aged three to five. The advert was launched by Ed Miliband's party last week accusing the Tories of wanting to cut the NHS 'to the bone', despite Tory assurances that the health budget would be protected. Labour launched the poster last week claiming the Conservative party would not protect the health service from cuts . The controversial image was unveiled on Friday by shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as Labour's 'first poster of the 2015 general election campaign'. It showed the x-ray of a broken leg bone, under the headline: Next time, they'll cut to the bone.' It also featured the tagline: 'The NHS can't afford the Tory cuts plan.' But medics immediatly recognised the image as potentially showing the impact of repeated injuries suffered by an abuse victim. Labour stressed that the poster was designed by an external advertising agency, which used an image from a picture agency. But experts said it appeared to be 'very likely non-accidental injury', suggesting the broken bone could have been inflicted intentionally. Prof Christopher Colton, emeritus consultant in orthopaedic and accident surgery, Nottingham University Hospital, told the Telegraph: 'If that X-ray presented itself at a hospital, all the alarm bells would ring for possible non-accidental injury. 'There are absolutely clear two episodes of violence and possibly the bone bruise is a third.' Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'Labour must explain what due diligence they did to ensure their advert isn’t based on any child’s tragedy. The tone of their poster is unpleasant enough, I hope the provenance of the image is less toxic.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham and shadow chancellor Ed Balls unveiled the poster in Harlow, Essex on Friday . The x-ray shows a very recent break in the middle of the leg, but there is healed fracture above the ankle which could be three to four weeks old. There is also a 'slight white haze' in the centre of the leg bone suggesting a healed bone bruise or fracture which is around five to six weeks old. A Labour party spokesman said: 'This image is a stock photograph provided by one of the world's biggest picture agencies.​' Peter Dazeley, the photographer credited on the Getty image, could not verify where it came from. Mr Balls and Mr Burnham used the poster to launch a highly political attack on the Tory party. Mr Balls said: 'George Osborne's Budget set out plans for deeper and more extreme spending cuts after the election. 'Our NHS just can't afford these extreme and risky Tory cuts. And after their broken promises on the NHS in this Parliament nobody will trust what the Tories say about the NHS.'","Labour launched poster claiming the NHS faced a 'Tory cuts plan'

"A chilling 911 call made from inside the Ohio home where a mother allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter has revealed the chaotic scene after the body was found. Deasia Watkins, 20, had gone to bed after allegedly decapitating her baby, Janiyah, and repeatedly stabbing her body, leaving relatives to find the girl's remains early on Monday. Watkins' aunt, who had custody of the child, made the 911 call. 'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the call, which was obtained by the Washington Post. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!' Through sobs, the woman explains she was sleeping when her adult son brought his children over to her house to be picked up for school and discovered the body. Arrested: Deasia Watkins, 20, allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter, Janiyah (right) on Monday. She had been ordered to keep away from the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems . 'My son came in here and woke me up and said, ""Momma the baby's dead"",' she explains. Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.' He adds that he does not know where his cousin - Watkins - is and pleads with the dispatcher to send police before the young woman is able to hurt herself. Trying to piece together what has happened, the dispatcher asks the man if the baby is breathing. 'Listen lady, the baby is deceased,' he says, as his mother wails in the background. When the dispatcher pushes for more details, he says bluntly: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call . 'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby. The child had been stabbed 15 times and had a fractured arm, and the knife had been placed in her hand. Watkins was found covered in blood and asleep in a bedroom and was arrested for aggravated murder. She was taken to hospital for mental evaluation. Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that Watkins, who is under guard at Deaconess Hospital, is not talking to authorities. 'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking. 'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' The horrific killing came after Watkins had been forbidden to have contact with the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems, authorities said. Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected . Friend Chris Gulley, pictured, was at the couple's apartment in January when Watkins wouldn't stop screaming or talking about the devil. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis . But the aunt had apparently let Watkins move in with her and the baby a week earlier. Authorities were unaware of this because they could not constantly monitor the home, Deters said. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December. James Brown, who authorities believe to be the baby's father, told WCPO he had been dating Watkins for two years but about a month after the birth of the child, she 'just started acting different'. He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. She was hospitalized when police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their apartment on January 24, according to documents. In a 911 call, a neighbor tells a dispatcher: 'There's an infant screaming and then the mom's yelling at the baby, telling it to shut up... it's been going on for about an hour,' WCPO reported. Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out. Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. Victim: Authorities found the mother had placed the knife in baby Janiyah's hand after killing her on Monday . Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . 'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.' She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents neglectful. Deters said at the press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'. He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The impact of ISIS extremism in Syria is now being felt across the UK, maps charting the soaring number of terror arrests and convictions reveal. The almost weekly raids now being carried out by anti-terror police are taking place throughout Britain; from the eastern port of Dover to the western town of Hayle in Cornwall, and from Portsmouth on the south coast to Manchester and Bolton in the North. Whether it is stopping would-be jihadis from travelling to the Middle East, foiling planned plots when they return or disrupting their funding networks, the conflict in Syria has spawned a huge range of crimes for British authorities to deal with. A map charting the location of arrests made in response to the threat from Syria-linked extremism shows it is not an issue confined to big cities. As well as raids in London, Birmingham and Manchester, suspects have been detained in towns around the Home Counties, Wales and the Midlands. Behind bars for waging jihad: The growing number of convictions of extremists from around Britain for crimes linked to ISIS's war in Syria . Police estimated that, last year, up to five Britons a week travelled to Syria, making monitoring their movements on their return all the more difficult. Meanwhile, the number of Syria-related terror arrests increased six-fold from just 25 in 2013 to 165 in 2014. The Metropolitan Police said they are taking a 'cradle to the grave approach' to disrupting terrorism and last month made arrests in relation to an alleged scam in which say cold callers swindled pensioners out of money to fund ISIS. Senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing Helen Ball said earlier this year: 'We have been running exceptionally high numbers of investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for many years. 'Several attack plots have been disrupted, of various sophistication, from individuals planning to carry out lone attacks to more complex conspiracies, the majority seemingly directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas.' The range of suspected offences which arrests were made for include funding terrorism, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism and attending a terrorist training camp. Last May, father of two Mashudur Choudhury, from Portsmouth, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the Syria conflict. The 31-year-old went to the Middle Eastern country with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp last October. Since then, a string of further trials have taken place, with  convictions of women funding boyfriends and husbands fighting abroad, groups returning from jihadi camps and others inspired by the violence to plot atrocities in the UK. Web of terror: A map of the most high-profile terror arrests in the last six months shows the issue is not confined to Britain's big cities . Gathering evidence against foreign combatants poses extra challenges for the CPS, with lawyers often struggling to get reliable evidence from warzones or hostile authorities abroad. But Deborah Walsh, Deputy Head of Counter-Terrorism at the CPS, told MailOnline the service is gathering expertise in how to prosecute returning militants. She said: 'Whilst prosecuting acts undertaken in countries such as Syria always brings new and unique challenges, the existing success of our specialist prosecutors in securing convictions for offences committed abroad – for example in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and more recently in Syria itself - demonstrates that we are ready and able to take these challenges on. 'We work with police from an early stage in the investigation to ensure that wherever possible, international borders and areas of conflict are not a barrier to justice.' The former head of MI6 warned last month that there are 'several thousand' individuals of concern in Britain and demanded tougher anti-terror powers to prevent a ‘ghastly 7/7-style attack’. Sir John Sawers said ‘The threat that we face from terrorists here has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that. ‘What we don’t want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7-style terrorist attack here in the UK before political opinion changes. ‘The whole point is to move incrementally to ensure that the powers and resources available to the security services, intelligence services, are ahead of that threat.’ Sir John, who stepped down from MI6 last November, added: ‘I think in general when you look at the challenge that the security services are facing with the number of extremists here in the UK, elsewhere in Europe, they do a really professional job and, of course, they know many of these individuals, most of them who end up taking part in terrorist organisations.' A series of trials of extremists who travelled to the Middle East reveals many of them were woefully unprepared for life in a warzone and miss the comforts of the UK. Imran Khawaja, who was jailed for 12 years after faking his own death so he could return, was nicknamed 'Barbie' by fellow fighters and complained to his family about the lack of cocoa butter, toothpaste, moisturiser, and toilet paper. His relatives attempted to lure him back to the UK with images of them eating at Nandos chicken restaurant. He later decided to flee his terrorist training camp because of the lack of 'war booty', meaning women. ISIS propaganda videos mean many British fighters expect a glorified version of the reality, which is strict rules and a repetitive schedule . Mohommod Nawaz, 30, with his younger brother Hamza Nawaz, 24, were both jailed for going to Syria. Photos from the brother's phones showed the strict daily schedule at the camp included two sessions of 'military training', two sessions of 'Islamic lessons' and 'lights out' at 10pm. The day began at 4.30am with prayers, followed by physical training from 6am to 8am. There would be 'military training' twice a day and further Islamic lessons before bed. Messages Mohommod sent to his girlfriend reveal he was far from happy in Syria. He moaned about not being able to use his mobile phone while training and feared being caught charging it by other wannabe jihadis. He wrote: 'Aint allowed to have a phone when training…cos I don't have it on me and I can't charge it without someone grassing me up.' He also admitted crying to himself at night over worries he might not see his girlfriend in London again, writing: 'I fear we may never see each other again. I was crying bares [lots] last night.' Mashudur Choudhury, the first man convicted of Syria-related terrorism, said he was made to do the cooking and washing and look after children in a makeshift nursery. The complaints chime with those made by a number French Muslim converts in weepy messages home that were leaked to newspaper Le Figaro. One said: 'I'm fed up to the back teeth. My iPod no longer works out here. I have got to come home.' Another wrote: 'I've done hardly anything but hand out clothes and food,' he said, adding: 'Winter is beginning. It's starting to get tough.'","Police are having to deal with an unprecedented number of terrorists inspired and linked to Middle East conflict .

"McDonald's workers in 19 cities have filed complaints over burns from popping grease, a lack of protective equipment and other workplace hazards, according to labor organizers. The complaints are the latest move in an ongoing campaign to win pay of $15 an hour and unionization for fast-food workers by publicly pressuring McDonald's to come to the bargaining table. The push is being spearheaded by the Service Employees International Union and began more than two years ago. Already, it has included protests around the country and lawsuits alleging workers weren't given their rightful pay. On the job: McDonald's workers in 19 cities have filed complaints over burns from popping grease, a lack of protective equipment and other workplace hazards, according to labor organizers (stock image) The burns and other hazards were detailed in complaints announced Monday and filed with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration in recent weeks. Workers cite a persistent lack of gloves for handling hot equipment and say they've been burned while cleaning grills that have to be kept on. One worker says he was told by a manager to, 'put mayonnaise on it, you'll be good.' The complaints also detail a lack of training for handling hot fryers and slipping on wet floors. A representative for the Labor Department, Laura McGinnis, confirmed the complaints were received by OSHA but said the agency does not discuss ongoing investigations. Take care: Workers cite a persistent lack of gloves for handling hot equipment and say they've been burned while cleaning grills that have to be kept on (unrelated photo) Chain reaction: The complaints are the latest move in an ongoing campaign to win pay of $15 an hour and unionization for fast-food workers by publicly pressuring McDonald's to come to the bargaining table . In a statement, McDonald's Corp. said the company and its independent franchisees are committed to providing safe working conditions for employees, and will review the allegations. 'It is important to note that these complaints are part of a larger strategy orchestrated by activists targeting our brand and designed to generate media coverage,' Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem, a McDonald's spokeswoman, said in the statement. The complaints extend a central theme of the 'Fight for $15' campaign, which has been to hold McDonald's accountable for working conditions at its franchised locations. That would ease the way for worker negotiations and unionization across the company's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants, the vast majority of which are run by franchisees. McDonald's and other fast-food chains, including Burger King and Wendy's, have said they're not responsible for employment decisions at franchised restaurants. The matter has reached the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, which said late last year that McDonald's could be named as a joint employer in complaints by workers. Those complaints have yet to be heard, but whichever side loses is expected to appeal the decision. Kendall Fells, organizing director for Fight for $15, said the injuries at franchised and company-owned restaurants mostly came about because understaffing and employees being told to work too quickly - both of which he said were the result of a computer system that tracks sales and staffing metrics. The computer system was also cited in lawsuits last year that allege 'wage theft' by McDonald's and its franchisees for the denial of breaks and overtime pay. That system has been key in the argument by labor groups that McDonald's exerts enough control over franchised restaurants to be considered a joint employer. Nothing unusual: Mary Vogel, executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, said that the burns and other hazards detailed in the complaints are 'pretty universal' in the fast-food industry . Fells noted that workers are looking at every way they can hold McDonald's accountable, and that workplace injuries are just the latest issue they're bringing to light. Although the OSHA complaint system doesn't let workers name joint employers, Randy Rabinowitz, a health and safety legal expert who was hired by the Fight for $15 campaign, said there have been other cases where multiple employers are issued citations for the same violations. She said she's not aware of any such cases involving fast-food restaurants, however. She said the first onsite OSHA visits triggered by the complaints took place in the past week or so, and that the agency has six months to issue citations. Mary Vogel, executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, said in a conference call organized by labor groups that the burns and other hazards detailed in the complaints are 'pretty universal' in the fast-food industry. McDonald's, which saw customer visits at established U.S. locations decline in each of the past two years, has been trying to reinvigorate its image. Earlier this month, the company's chief administrative officer, Pete Bensen, said a big part of the U.S. turnaround will be what the company is doing around 'the employment image and our employee-employer relationships.'","McDonald's workers in 19 cities have filed complaints over workplace hazards, according to labor organizers .

"PM David Cameron (pictured leaving 10 Downing Street) has said he would not bid for a third term . For many of the greatest leaders in our history, one word was simply beyond them. From Gladstone and Churchill to Thatcher and Blair, they could not bring themselves to say goodbye. So by historical standards, David Cameron’s revelation that, if the voters send him back to Downing Street in May, he will step down after five years and allow somebody else to lead the Conservatives into the 2020 election, counts as a genuine bombshell. For some time, this has been predicted in Westminster. But nobody expected him to say so publicly, and certainly nobody thought he would do it on the brink of one of the tightest and most unpredictable election campaigns in history. Not for Mr Cameron the solemn goodbye in an address to the nation. Instead, he announced his intentions in a throwaway interview with a BBC journalist. It was absolutely typical of the man, the quintessence of laid-back insouciance. Even his rhetoric seemed remarkably casual. Terms in office, he remarked, ‘are like Shredded Wheat: two are wonderful but three might just be too many’. What makes Mr Cameron’s announcement so extraordinary is that there is simply no historical precedent. The great majority of his predecessors tried to cling on to power as long as possible, and had to be dragged kicking and screaming from office. Margaret Thatcher, for example, famously led her party into a third general election in 1987 with a promise that she would go ‘on and on’ – a remark that delighted her admirers and horrified her critics. Few people doubt that had she not been toppled in a coup in 1990, she would have led the Tories into a fourth election two years later. Indeed, if the Iron Lady had had her way, she would have led them into the 21st century, too. But Mrs Thatcher was far from unusual. The Victorian titan William Gladstone led the Liberals to victory in 1892 at the staggering age of 82, long after most of his colleagues thought he should have stepped down. Winston Churchill, too, had to be prised from office like an oyster from a shell. He should have resigned in glory after winning World War II and losing the 1945 general election. Instead, he refused to budge, even though he was increasingly debilitated by old age and a series of strokes. The most obvious recent example, though, is Tony Blair, whose premiership was undermined almost from the very beginning by gossip about the succession. According to Gordon Brown and his friends, Mr Blair had promised to step aside after two elections for his ambitious chancellor. But when he refused to do so, their relations degenerated into virtual civil war. In 2004, Mr Blair promised that if he won a third election he would soon resign to give his successor time to prepare for Labour’s tilt at a fourth term in office. The Brownites were furious at the delay. But far from lancing the boil of speculation, Mr Blair’s announcement only made matters worse. From that moment, his aura of leadership began to seep away. Since everyone knew he was going, they had nothing to lose in challenging his authority. And so it was that Mr Blair’s final two years in office, overshadowed by constant bickering over the date of his departure, were effectively a drawn-out public execution, as the former master of British politics suffered an agonising death by a thousand cuts. I am sorry to say this is almost certainly the scenario that awaits Mr Cameron. And his decision is all the more mystifying because he is under relatively little pressure to step aside. Whatever you think of Mr Cameron, the unarguable fact is that he remains the Tories’ single biggest asset. For the past ten years he has been comfortably more popular than his party. Scroll down for videos . David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . At the age of just 48, Mr Cameron is, by prime ministerial standards, a relatively young man. On top of that, Mr Cameron is clearly the most popular and credible of the major party leaders. Neither the laughable Ed Miliband or the anodyne Nick Clegg comes close to challenging his public standing. While he has his critics on the Tory backbenches, a leadership challenge would be almost unthinkable if he managed to win another term in May. If I had been advising Mr Cameron, I would have urged him to emulate Harold Wilson, who showed no sign of going anywhere until his shock resignation in 1976. Like Mr Cameron, the Labour prime minister was the dominant political personality of his age. He shrugged off accusations that he lacked substance to win election after election. He even managed to bounce back from defeat in 1970 – as I believe Mr Cameron could, too, if he really wanted to. So Wilson’s resignation, at the age of 60, stunned the nation. There had been not the slightest public suspicion that he was planning a quick exit. By contrast, Mr Cameron has, I think, made a rod for his own back. If he returns to No 10 in May, which looks increasingly likely, then it will be as a lame-duck Prime Minister. For the awkward squad on the Tory backbenches, the penalties for rebellion will seem trivial and short-lived, since a new leader will be along in a year or two. And for the Prime Minister’s ambitious colleagues, the leadership campaign will begin on the day he walks back into No 10. David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron invited the cameras into their Oxfordshire home ahead of the election, during which the Prime Minister made the revelation that he would step down before a third term . Indeed, for George Osborne, Boris Johnson and Theresa May, that campaign may well have already begun. And if Mr Cameron sticks to his promise to serve a full five-year term, it will drag on until the beginning of 2020. I can hardly think of anything more likely to undermine and debilitate a future Tory government – especially one with a narrow or non-existent majority. And I firmly believe that at some stage in the next few years – and probably sooner rather than later – Mr Cameron will have cause to regret his decision. It is, of course, to his credit that, far from clinging to the baubles of office, he is already preparing for a dignified exit. But, only weeks before the most uncertain election in living memory, it was surely a mistake to telegraph his intentions as he did. And if Mr Cameron manages to retain power on May 7, then I believe he will bitterly regret the casual manner in which he threw away so much of his authority.","David Cameron said he would not bid for a third term if he wins election .

"This is the heartbreaking moment a four-year-old Syrian girl 'surrendered' to a photographer when she mistook the man's camera for a gun. Taken at the Atmen refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey last December, the image shows the young girl frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed. The child has been identified as Adi Hudea, whose father died in the 2012 Hama massacre and who has been living with her traumatised mother and three siblings at Camp Atmen ever since.

Shocking: Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up' The image was taken by Turkish photojournalist Osman Sagirli but went viral earlier this week when it was shared on social media. Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up'. Turkish media researching the origins of the photograph later suggested Adi Hudea was a four-year-old boy, not a girl, and revealed he was a resident of the Atmen refugee in Syria. But BBC Trending have subsequently spoken to Sagirli himself who confirmed the image shows a little girl. Ms Shaban's tweet has since been reposted more than 14,000 times and prompted emotional responses from social media users. One wrote: 'I'm actually weeping seeing this. We've made this planet a horrible place, haven't we?', as another said: 'We are failing the younger generations and those still to come. SHAME ON US.'

The five-year-old Syrian Civil War has so far claimed more than 220,000 lives, including an estimated 10,000 children. Millions of people have been displaced by the conflict, with more than 12 million people - including five million children - still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. The image emerged as the Syrian government announced plans to import 150,000 tonnes of wheat for its starving population - just weeks after saying it had no need to do so. Despite millions of Syrians fleeing the fighting to neighbouring countries, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is grappling with ensuring there is enough grain for all. Trade sources say Damascus faced challenges importing sufficient stocks as payment problems and fighting have deterred many international firms from trading.

The state-run General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) has declined to give a figure for how much is left but said it is seeking 150,000 tonnes of wheat in an import tender that will close on April 13. The announcement came three weeks after the minister of internal trade and consumer protection Hassan Safiya said an improved wheat harvest in 2015 would translate into self-sufficiency. 'We need to import to bolster our strategic stocks and have started with this tender to test the market,' a Hoboob source told Reuters. Hoboob said the government was currently relying on its 2014 local harvest and drawing on its strategic reserves to keep its bread subsidy programme going.","Young refugee girl mistook Osman Sagirli's camera for a deadly weapon .

"Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up Andressa Urach (above) is joining an evangelical church - weeks after she ended up in intensive care with 'rotting' legs . Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up is joining an evangelical church - weeks after she ended up in intensive care with 'rotting' legs. Andressa Urach almost died from botched plastic surgery and feared she would lose her legs after fillers got infected and had to be removed. The 27-year-old, from Porto Alegre, has since revealed she thinks it was the prayers of her fans that brought her back from the brink of death. She is now planning on preaching to others about leading a pure life and claims to have already thrown away six wardrobes of clothes, lingerie and bikinis. The model has also removed any saucy snaps of her rear from her Twitter and Instagram accounts. She said: 'I believe completely that faith saved my life and it has changed my view about everything. 'It is not what you write or say that makes the difference with God but how you choose to live your life.' The mother-of-one came second in the popular Miss BumBum competition in 2012. She revealed she had two types of 'body fillers' - hydrogel and PMMA - injected into her upper legs to lift her bottom. She also had a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, boob job, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. But in July last year the model discovered the fillers were causing her leg muscles to rot, leaving her in excruciating pain. Miss Urach had an operation to drain 400ml of hydrogel from each leg - but she continued to complain of discomfort. Scroll down for video .

"Tony Blair achieved 'very very little' in his role as Middle East peace envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region, a former senior British diplomat said last night. Oliver Miles, the former ambassador to Libya, said Mr Blair was the 'wrong man' who had 'not been able to do the job'. Other critics branded Mr Blair's role a 'fig leaf' and said his role in the Iraq War made it impossible for him to do the job. Tony Blair achieved little in his role as Middle East envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region, a former British diplomat has said . He said the role, as the representative of the Quartet of the UN, the EU, Russia and the US, was a 'convenient excuse for doing nothing' and that was what he had achieved. Mr Blair has been the envoy for the four peace negotiators since shortly after he stepped down as Prime Minister in 2007. In that time, the Office of the Quartet Representative has received a total of £20million in funding, mostly from the US and EU. Mr Blair is not paid for the role. His office did not confirm the reports yesterday that he was planning to 'step back' from the job. It is thought an announcement is due later this week. There was no official reaction to the speculation about his change of role yesterday in Europe or the US, and Downing Street refused to comment on the speculation. A Downing Street spokesman would say only that the former PM had been 'important work as the quartet's representative.' Oliver Miles, a former British diplomat, said: 'I think he's the wrong man and I also think it's the wrong job' But Mr Miles was damning about Mr Blair's role, and of the suggestion he could take on a 'wider role' in the region. The job was, he said, a 'convenient excuse for doing nothing'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think he's not been able to do the job. I think he's the wrong man and I also think it's the wrong job.' 'He was appointed I think it was the day he ceased to be British Prime Minister and it struck me at the time as a very strange appointment in many ways. I'm surprised he accepted it frankly.' Asked if he was saying Mr Blair should play no role in the region, he said: 'Yes I am. I think it's a mistake. He's the wrong man. I find it hard to believe, frankly, that the British Government would support him having a wider role. 'I find it even harder to believe that the Russians, who are also members of the Quartet, would support him having a wider role. 'I'm afraid if they do the reason is simply that he is a convenient excuse for doing nothing and that's been the case over the eight years that we've seen him in that. 'The Quartet has not achieved anything and Tony Blair as its representative has achieved very, very little.' Tory MP Crispin Blunt said Mr Blair's decision was 'well overdue.' 'His effectiveness was ended almost as soon as he was appointed when he wasn't allowed to do the politics, he was only allowed to do the economics of the Middle East peace process. 'Frankly it was a waste of time, he never had the mandate from the Quartet to achieve peace.' Andrew Mackinlay, the former Labour MP and former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee said Mr Blair's position was 'always a fig leaf'. He was disqualified from day one from fulfilling the role of peace envoy because of Iraq – which runs like a vein through all conflicts in the Middle East.' Mr Blair has been the envoy for the UN, the EU, Russia and the US since shortly after he stepped down as Prime Minister in 2007 . On Sunday a Financial Times report said Mr Blair was planning to 'step back' from the job and in negotiations to 'recast' his role while remaining involved in the peace process. He is thought to have met John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, recently to discuss a possible job change. It follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Mr Blair's role in peace negotiations in the Middle East and his business pursuits. Sources told the FT that Mr Blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable. There is also mounting unease in the US and EU over his poor relations with senior Palestinian Authority figures. Mr Blair does not disclose his clients, but they have included countries such as Peru, Colombia, Kuwait, Vietnam and Kazakhstan. His corporate roster has featured PetroSaudi, an oil company with links to the Saudi royal family, finance firm JP Morgan and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi wealth fund. Senior diplomats told the Financial Times Mr Blair was being eased out. They said: 'It is long overdue. He has been ineffective in this job. He has no credibility in this part of the world.' A senior source in the US administration said: 'Our position is clear. Tony Blair has been a valued partner in trying to bring peace to the Middle East and we will continue to value his input and support.' Last year, a group of former British ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-Prime Minister to be removed from his role as Middle East envoy, raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and attempts to 'absolve himself' of responsibility for the Iraq crisis. David Cameron's official spokesman said yesterday: 'I have seen the reports that Mr Blair may be considering a revised role. 'He has been doing an important role as the quartet representative since the second half of 2007. In terms of his own approach to how he thinks he may be best able to make a contribution, that is principally a matter for Tony Blair. 'The Prime Minister thinks he has been doing important work as the quartet's representative.'","Oliver Miles said Mr Blair achieved 'very little' as Middle East Peace envoy .

"President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' Attorney General Eric Holder has openly endorsed automatic voter registration, adopted two days ago by Oregon, the first American state to officially embrace the measure, but Obama had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today. President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country . The president said the people in America who 'tend not to vote' are usually younger, of lower income and skew toward 'immigrant groups' and minority groups. 'And they're often the folks who are scratchin' and climbin' to get into the middle class,' he said, 'and they're working hard.' 'There's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,' he said. 'We should wanna get them into the polls.' The remark as a subtle reference to Republican efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government-issued photo identification card. Republicans say that such measures prevent voter fraud. Democrats claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process. Many Democrats believe that's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote Democrat, especially minorities, from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter ID laws as racist for that reason. Requiring the elderly, who sometimes don't drive, and minorities, who when they live in major cities often take public transportation, as well as the low-income sector of society, which can't afford always afford government identification cards, is a modern day poll tax, Democrats have argued. Supporters of the photo ID laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government-funded ids and offering free rides to the DMV in certain states. Obama's Department of Justice has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court, with the notable exception of Virginia, which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' The president is seen here mingling with guests of the event at The City Club of Cleveland . Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls. In Oregon, also the first state in the U.S.to conduct its elections entirely by mail-in ballot, Republicans worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail, which can easily be tampered with in residential areas, creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud. Millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up. The cost of implementing the law is also of concern, as the system will ensure that every Oregon resident receives a ballot unless they opt-out. There's also the question of where the DMV can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private. Automatic registration is popular in foreign countries, including Sweden, Argentina and Canada, where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically. Comparatively, just over half the U.S. population regularly votes. Roughly 56 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. Australia, which enforces mandatory voting, has a 100 percent rate of participation. President Barack Obama tours Magnet at Cleveland State University before his speech on Wednesday afternoon. Obama brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics . Speaking at the The City Club of Cleveland today, Obama brought the subject up on his own while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. 'I don't think I've ever said this publicly, but I'm going to say it now,' Obama said, before bringing up compulsory voting. 'We shouldn't be making it hard to vote, we should be making it easier to vote,' he said. Recalling his recent speech in Selma for the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday,' Obama said his Justice Department is 'vigorously' enforcing rights. 'The notion that this day and age we would deliberately be trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense,' he said, indirectly knocking conservatives. 'In Australia and some other countries there's mandatory voting,' the president, a trained Constitutional lawyer, added, saying moments later that it 'may end up being a better strategy in the short-term' to dealing with franchise issues. He followed up the remark by saying that 'long-term I think it would be fun to have a constitutional amendment process about... how our financial system works.' After the smattering of applause died down, he said that realistically, though, that would be a long-term proposition. President Obama holds a bottle of whiskey as he talks with Tom Lix, of Cleveland Whiskey, during a tour of the Manufacturing Advocacy & Growth Network (MAGNET) on Wednesday afternoon . Minutes before, in response to the man's original question, Obama had said he thinks the 'almost unlimited' amount of money that is spent on American political campaigns is, in his opinion 'bad for our democracy.' 'And I speak as somebody who has raised a lot of money,' he said, humble bragging. 'I'm very good at it.' Obama said he was 'proud' of the fact that his presidential campaigns 'refined' the use of the Internet for small-dollar donations. 'But I also got checks from wealthy people, too,' he noted. 'So its not that I'm not good at it,' he said, reassuring the audience. 'I just dont think its a good way for our democracy to work.' Continuing, Obama said the campaign finance system makes Members of Congress 'miserable,' especially those that are in competitive districts, because they constantly have to raise money. It also affects legislation, he said, positing that there's a reason why lobbyists 'have undue influence' in Washington. And most of the money politicians raise goes toward television ads, he said, which leads to an over-saturated market near major elections. 'And the nature of just the blitzkrieg, you guys here in Ohio, you just feel it, right?' he said, making reference to Ohio's status as a decision-making presidential state and therefore a target for TV ads. 'I mean its just every election season, you've gotta turn off the TV. It's just depressing.' Furthermore, most of the ads are negative because science shows that's more effective than feel-good messages when it comes to political campaigns. And 'it just degrades our democracy,' Obama stated, before moving onto another aspect of the problem.","He said it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country .

"The founder and leader of a controversial Atlanta-based megachurch has taken down his online appeal for 200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' so that he can buy a $65 million private jet amid a media backlash. Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. The televangelist, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, last week put a five-minute video up on his website asking for donations for a Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. Open palm: Reverend Creflo Dollar of the World Changers Church International wants 200,000 people from across the world to each donate '$300 or more' so that he can buy the world's fastest private jet . News of the plea broke soon after it was posted, with snarky headlines aplenty, including You Better Fly Commercial, Creflo Dollar, Jesus Wants Me to Have This Jet and Creflo Dollar Needs a Fancy Private Jet. The webpage, as of Sunday afternoon, had been shuttered, WXIA first reported. However, the faithful may still donate to the cause via the World Changers donation site, which remains open. Dollar - who is known to own two Rolls Royce's and multi-million dollar homes in Atlanta and New Jersey - last hit headlines in 2012, after being arrested for allegedly attacking his 15-year-old daughter. Battling: This notice has been posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar can 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ' Goal: Dollar wants to spend the $65 million he hopes to make in donations on a Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Televangelist: Creflo Dollar is the founder of World Changers Church International, which has about 30,000 members and an 8,500 seater amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome' Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', sending the sermons to churches all over the country via satellite. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,"" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' According to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Home: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents.

"With winter fast approaching, it only means one thing: the dreaded flu season is coming. Every year Australians book more than 80,000 doctors' appointments for cold and flu related illnesses alone which could be prevented by their decisions in Autumn, according to scientists. Now is the perfect time to get ready to resist the first wave of cold or flu this winter. Our lifestyle decisions in Autumn are key to ensure a sickness-free flu season, according to Sheila Zhou, expert Scientist at USANA, leading producer of high quality supplements. 'Summer is officially over, and with the cooler months often associated with sneezing, coughing, and fevers, it's no surprise many of us aren't happy about it. Lifestyle decisions during Autumn can save Australians from struggling through the flu season . For those stressing about getting sick during flu season, the secret is to just relax! Literally, meditate . 'Staying healthy during this time however, doesn't have to be difficult. 'By implementing a cold and flu prevention regimen before Winter starts will boost your immune system significantly.' Just 20 minutes of sunshine a day is the secret ingredient to ensuring a healthy immune system. 'Vitamin D is the key to strengthening the immune system,' said Ms. Zhou. 'If you have a sufficient storage of Vitamin D through Summer then it should last 30 to 60 days through the colder, darker months.' Vitamin D is vital for many areas of health including the absorption of calcium, preventing osteoporosis and regulating various cells in the immune system. 1. Soak up the sunshine . A significant number of Australians are deficient in vitamin D. Did you know that just 20 minutes of sunlight each day significantly boosts the production of vitamin D in your body? Vitamin D not only helps protect your body in maintaining healthy immune function, but it also assists in general wellbeing. Unfortunately, with the days getting shorter and the daylight hours diminishing, winter can be a difficult time to get the necessary sunshine, so supplements such as USANA's Vitamin D can be beneficial. 2. Drink like a fish . Like any other time of year, staying hydrated during winter is extremely important. Even though you may not feel as thirsty or sweat as much during the cooler months, drinking plenty of water is still essential to help eliminate waste and prime your body against infections from pathogens. 3. Get Moving . Never underestimate the importance of regular activity. Exercising is of course a great way to get into shape, but it also increases the number of natural killer cells in our bodies that fight off infection. So even if you only have time to walk around the block, making the effort goes a long way in keeping you healthy and infection free as the weather cools down. 4. Get creative in the kitchen . Eating brightly coloured fruit and vegetables is also a great way to keep infections at bay. They are rich in vitamin C and E and antioxidants. Their ability to increase the functionality of your immune system means that adding these fresh fruits and vibrant veggies to your daily diet helps your body safe guard itself from nasty viruses, while tasting delicious too! 5. Stress Less . You're probably aware that stress isn't good for you, but very few people are aware of how much it actually impacts your health. Stress takes an enormous toll on the immune system and makes you more vulnerable to everything from a common cold to major diseases. So if you don't already, make sure you get enough sleep and take time out to do the things you enjoy. The kitchen is another place to start preparing the body for winter as a plate full of colourful foods has been proven to help keep a cold at bay . Considering Australians live in a mostly sun soaked land, statistics show that a huge proportion do not get enough rays, resulting in the significant number of Aussies who are deficient in Vitamin D. '99% of skin cancers are caused by sun exposure, so understandably people are scared to go out too much,' said Ms Zhou. 'But sun exposure is really important, as long as people put on sunscreen.' 'At least 41 per cent of women are actually vitamin d deficient. ' 'People need sunshine to boost their immune system before winter. There are amounts of vitamin D in what we eat, but not nearly enough to rely on those foods alone.' Another tip for people stressing out about getting sick? Relax! 'Stressing less is crucial, but it is hard to tell modern people to live stress-free lives!' said Ms Zhou. Never underestimate the importance of regular activity. Exercising is of course a great way to get into shape, but it also increases the number of natural killer cells in our bodies that fight off infection . Drinking plenty of water is still essential to help eliminate waste and prime your body against infections from pathogens . 'It's the first thing to prioritise, whether it means yoga, meditation or exercise.' Sleep is another crucial step to boosting the immune system; ideally around six to eight hours of good quality sleep every night. The kitchen is another place to start preparing the body for winter. A colourful plate will help keep a cold at bay. 'Different coloured foods are crucial for the immune system, because different vegetables and fruit each provide different antioxidants,' said Ms Zhou. 'They are also rich in vitamins C and E which are very important for the immune system.' So what should go on our plates? 'To have sufficient vitamins and minerals the Australian dietary guidelines recommend having half a plate of salad with a variety of vegetables of different colours,' said Ms Zhou. 'That should be accompanied by a quarter of protein and a quarter of carbohydrate, including wholegrains or red, black or brown rice.' Sleep is another crucial step to boosting the immune system; ideally around six to eight hours of good quality sleep every night . Eating brightly coloured fruit and vegetables is also a great way to keep infections at bay. They are rich in vitamin C and E and antioxidants .","Every year 80,000 Australians visit the doctor because of a cold or a flu .
However, lifestyle decisions in Autumn can safeguard you from sickness .
Vitamin D from the sunshine is one of the best ways to boost immune system .

"George Osborne is expected to use his Budget to announce a £6billion boost to the country’s finances . George Osborne is expected to use his Budget to announce a £6billion boost to the country’s finances that will be used to fund tax cuts for the middle classes. Economists believe ‘a cocktail of good news’ including falling inflation will cut the borrowing bill by about £20billion. The EY Item Club, which compiles its forecasts using the Treasury’s economic model, said it expected the Office for Budget Responsibility to reduce the borrowing forecast for next year by £6billion. It was also claimed last night that owners of homes worth up to £1million will be able to pass them on to their children tax-free under plans drawn up by the Chancellor. Mr Osborne’s proposal is expected to become a key part of the Tory manifesto, but it will not be included in tomorrow’s Budget after it was blocked by the Lib Dems. Plans to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million were included in the party’s manifesto at the last election, but were vetoed as part of the Coalition deal. According to Treasury papers leaked to The Guardian, the proposed measures would also reduce the inheritance tax bill on properties worth up to £2million by £140,000. The tax break, which would mean around 20,000 fewer estates every year would have any inheritance liability, is expected to cost nearly £1billion. Scroll down for video . In the papers, the officials note that the move ‘will generally be very popular with the public and in the media’. The document, prepared for Treasury financial secretary David Gauke, added: ‘You have indicated a desire to reduce the burden of inheritance tax. ‘Having considered the cost of a substantial increase in the existing nil rate band you and the Chancellor have indicated you would like instead to introduce a more targeted measure to allow the family home to be passed onto the children of deceased without it leading to an inheritance tax liability. It is thought the Lib Dems leaked the papers ahead of the Budget in a bid to paint to Tories as the party of the rich . ‘This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house ... paying inheritance tax.’ A senior Tory source blamed the leak of ‘old advice’ on the Liberal Democrats, adding: ‘They are desperate. There is nothing in the Budget on inheritance tax, which we have said repeatedly is an election issue.’ It is thought the Lib Dems leaked the papers ahead of the Budget in a bid to paint to Tories as the party of the rich. The Government is set to announce the biggest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since the financial crisis. The standard rate will rise 3 per cent from October to £6.70 an hour, benefiting 1.4million, while the rate for apprentices will go up by a fifth, to £3.30. The changes, to be announced in the Budget, come amid the strongest economic growth for seven years and the lowest inflation for more than a decade.","The EY Item Club predicts next year's borrowing forecast  will be £6bn less .

"The mystery surrounding the demise of Jagger - an Irish setter which died under suspicious circumstances after returning from a dog show in Birmingham - could finally be solved. The beloved dog died days after returning from the Crufts show in Birmingham, sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was 'murdered' by a bitter rival. And just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast-acting illegal pesticide, residents of his hometown of Lauw, Belgium, have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer. Scroll down for video . It was revealed two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death, while residents in his hometown have revealed their fears they are in the grip of a serial cat killer . Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Lauw, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone. However, toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in Belgium as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast-acting. Now locals have claimed ten dead cats have been found in the past two months alone. One resident, Els van Marsenille, claimed she had lost three since January and her neighbour two, according to David Sanderson, reporting for The Times. Local Linda Jans said she was now too scared to take her dogs out for walks in the village, claiming a pet killer unhappy about dogs' barking could operate quickly by simply throwing poison out into the streets and parks. Prize-winning Irish Setter Jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium . Local veterinarian Patrick Jans, (unrelated to Ms Jans), said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats, but said there were 'symptoms suggestive of intoxication'. Their claims are backed up by the evidence - Caroline Kisko, secretary for the Kennel Club which organises Crufts, said this week two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death. 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death. 'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting. 'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours. 'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.' The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans reiterated this - telling the Mail Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. 'I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it's unlikely because of the long time delay. I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.' Aleksandra Lauwers (pictured with her son Jeremy and the litter Jagger was born part of) said they were struggling to cope with the dog's death .","Jagger, an Irish setter, died 24 hours after returning from Crufts dog show .

"LANDMARKS . by Robert Macfarlane . (Hamish Hamilton £20) At University College London in the Sixties, one door in the English Department was marked The English Place Name Society. During my three years as a student I never saw anyone enter or leave that room, and imagined mountains of dusty books and documents, rambled by spiders, forgotten maps of a dead world. A ciste: Gaelic for burial chamber. Because the original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills, streams and bogs have fallen out of use, Robert Macfarlane performs a miracle of resurrection in his new book. Reviving a fascinating archive of old terms from Anglo-Saxon to Old Norse, he dances through the closed door of the past — a labour of love as well as learning. Original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills, streams and bogs have fallen out of use . For years he’s been passionately engaged with the work of men and women who have written about the natural world, such as Richard Jefferies, Barry Lopez, Jacquetta Hawkes and Roger Deakin. These are his spiritual guides to the landscape he loves. For, as well as the milestones of the mind (those books and encounters which shape us), there are the landmarks all around us: from the smallest tussock to trees, rocks, beaches and hidden valleys. All of these were named by our ancestors with particular, peculiar and poetic terms which probably fell out of common use in the last 100 years. So, each chapter describes the work of one or two writers who have shaped Macfarlane’s thinking, and takes us on an imaginary walk into their worlds. And then comes a ‘glossary’, lists of names for things specific to one aspect of landscape. These lists are fascinating. For example, eit: a tiny word from the Isle of Lewis with a huge meaning: ‘The practice of placing quartz stones in moorland streams so they would sparkle in the moonlight and thereby attract salmon to them in the late summer and autumn.’ People in Essex used to call you ‘watery-headed’ if you were anxious about rain. And how about the glorious list of words for icicle: aquabob (Kent), clinkerbell and conkerbell (Dorset), daggler and dagglet (Hampshire), ickle (Yorkshire) and shuckle (Cumbria). Macfarlane says: ‘This is a book about the power of language — strong style, simple words — to shape our sense of place.’ He begins and ends this impressive and unusual book with children — which is as it should be. For who else will inherit the Earth? Like many of us, he was deeply shocked when the new edition of the Oxford Junior Dictionary left out words no longer seen as ‘relevant’ to modern childhood, including acorn, bluebell, buttercup, catkin, conker, dandelion, fern, heather, heron, ivy, lark, mistletoe, newt, otter, pasture and willow. That’s why Macfarlane ends by describing a thrilling project with primary school children given free access to explore a park in winter. Their writing about this experience, over months, turned the ordinary park into a place of wonder where ‘new stories seethed from its soil’. To deprive children of that natural birthright Robert Macfarlane celebrates in all his work is to cut out an essential part of their hearts.","Original meanings of place names have been largely forgotten .

"A £1billion tidal lagoon off the coast of south Wales will form the centrepiece of ambitious renewable energy plans to be unveiled today. George Osborne is set to use his Budget today to announce that the Government is beginning formal talks on funding the project to produce energy from turbines in Swansea Bay, south Wales. The scheme would be over an area of more than four square miles cordoned off by a breakwater, with power generated as the tides pass through turbines when going in and out. Scroll down for video . Construction: The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities . Below the surface: This graphic shows how the structure would generate energy at high tide, left, and low tide, right, meaning that water will flow through four times daily . Vast: The scheme would be over an area of more than four square miles of Swansea Bay in South Wales, creating a large tidal lagoon cordoned off by a huge breakwater . Artist's impression: Chancellor George Osborne is set to use his Budget today to announce a £1billion plan for the world's first tidal lagoon to generate electricity from turbines in Swansea Bay, south Wales . The Tidal Lagoon Power company will get the opportunity to discuss subsidies - which are expected to have to be about £150 per megawatt hour, reported The Guardian. Controversially, this is far greater than the subsidy of up to £92.50 per MWh agreed for the planned Somerset nuclear plant Hinkley Point C - and triple the wholesale electricity prices of £50 per MWh. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change is said to have been reassured that if a prototype can be built in Wales, it will be possible to launch the concept more cheaply elsewhere. The Swansea Bay scheme would need a six-mile sea wall up to 65ft high - although only half of this would be noticeable from land at low tide, according to Tidal Lagoon Power.

Other project: The Tidal Lagoon Power company will get the opportunity to discuss subsidies - which are expected to have to be about £150 per megawatt hour. Controversially, this is far greater than the £98 per MWh subsidy agreed for the planned Somerset nuclear plant Hinkley Point C (above, artist's impression) The wall would create a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day. The developers say the  project, along with four others, could meet 10 per cent of our electricity needs from the tides by 2023. The six-mile wall around Swansea Bay complete with turbines could generate electricity 14 hours a day. Tidal Lagoon Power believes the project will boost a UK supply chain and create a new export market if it gets the go-ahead. The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and a visitor centre. There are claims that it would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year, as well as create 1,850 construction jobs and 150 long-term jobs in its operation. When plans were first submitted last year, it was claimed that the ground-breaking project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in Swansea for 120 years. Developers behind the project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from the tides by 2023. Tidal Lagoon Power said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the UK, boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market. The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities. It is claimed that building more, larger lagoons would bring economies of scale. Other sites where lagoons are being considered, such as the Somerset coast, could have added benefits such as flood defences. Last month it was reported that the plan had been given a funding boost after investment management firm InfraRed Capital Partners agreed to provide £100million for the project. But, also last month, consumer charity Citizens Advice said the project was ‘appalling value for money’ and should not receive subsidies.","Government to begin formal talks on funding Swansea Bay energy project .

"Voters in every ethnic group want the number of migrants coming to Britain to be cut, reveals a report out today. Overall, the survey found that 79 per cent of respondents thought immigration levels should be reduced with 59 per cent wanting a big drop. This support for stricter border controls was shared by people from all ethnic groups, according to analysis by campaign group Migration Watch. Home Secretary Theresa May has been pushing for a firm immigration pledge to be included in the next Tory manifesto, after the failed a pledge to cut the number coming here to 'tens of thousands' Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced, with 38 per cent wanting it down by a lot. The same is true of black respondents with 57 per cent thinking it should be curbed and 32 per cent wanting a large cut. For those of mixed origin, 60 per cent wanted a decrease with 30 per cent wanting a big fall. Of those classed as ‘other’ ethnicities, 56 per cent wanted a drop with 32 per cent believing there should be a large reduction. For all minority groups combined, most want lower immigration levels while about 30 per cent want them to stay the same. Only one in ten want it to rise, making it unlikely that policies to curb immigration would deter ethnic minorities from voting for the Conservatives. The report is a response to the centre-right lobby group Bright Blue, which claims the Tories must abandon their target to limit net migration to attract more black and ethnic minority voters. Home Secretary Theresa May, who wants a firm pledge to cut migration in the Tory manifesto, recently quit as a member of Bright Blue’s advisory board. A poll by Migration Watch found that 60 per cent of Asians, 57 per cent of black people, and 60 per cent of those from mixed backgrounds wanted to see a cut (pictured, pedestrians on a street in London) Migration Watch said that while tighter immigration controls do not deter voters from an ethnic minority background, the tone of the debate must be ‘right’. It said black and ethnic minority voters are more likely to see previous waves of immigration as positive for the UK but are clearly concerned about current levels. Vice-chairman Alp Mehmet said: ‘The report confirms that the concerns of ethnic minority voters are very similar to everyone else and why wouldn’t they be? ‘The way to appeal to ethnic minority communities is to propose reasonable policies and reducing net migration to the level last seen in the early 1990s is entirely reasonable.’ Kiran Bali, a member of Migration Watch who has founded a series of inter-faith groups, said: ‘The majority of people share similar concerns. ‘They are worried about schools, hospitals, jobs and overcrowding. ‘It is ludicrous to lump diverse communities together in suggesting we all want mass immigration. Reasonable levels are the only way to achieve strengthened community relations.’ The Tories are expected to repeat David Cameron’s promise to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. It is now almost 300,000. The report is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey, a long-running poll of 3,000 residents. Blair aide: We didn't expect all those Polish plumbers . Sir Stephen Wall, EU adviser from 2000 to 2004, said Labour didn't see the attraction Britain would present to skilled Polish workers, such as plumbers . Labour failed to realise the UK would prove a magnet for Polish plumbers, Tony Blair’s most senior EU adviser admitted yesterday. The admission came in a series of revelations about how Labour chronically mishandled Eastern European immigration. In advance of Poland and seven other Eastern Bloc nations joining the EU in 2004, ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year. But more than one million have travelled to the UK, attracted by wages which are significantly higher than at home – with at least half settling here in what proved one of the biggest waves of immigration in British history. Sir Stephen Wall, an EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said: ‘We simply didn’t take account properly of the pull factor of England for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [in the UK] for their skills – you know, the Polish plumber.’ The remarks risk re-igniting the debate about Labour’s record on immigration – for which Ed Miliband recently apologised. Last night Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, told the Mail: ‘It is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between Britain and ... Poland. 'We said at the time the forecast of 13,000 a year was almost worthless. In fact, it was completely worthless.’ Yesterday it also emerged that former Labour Cabinet minister John Denham had written to Chancellor Gordon Brown and Home Secretary Charles Clarke in 2006 to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact but was largely ignored. Mr Denham said that wages were being driven down by as much as 50 per cent and that A&E departments were under strain, adding: ‘On EU migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine.’ Not backing down: Despite Mr Wall's comments, former Home Secretary David Blukett (pictured during his time in office) defended Labour's record, he is 'confident' mass migration was a good idea . In a further bombshell, respected economist Paul Ormerod, writing in the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, exploded Labour’s economic case for mass migration. He argued that it had a ‘barely perceptible’ impact on economic growth per head while suppressing the wages of the less well-off. ‘It is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out,’ he said. But former home secretary David Blunkett was unrepentant about the party’s record, saying: ‘I’m confident that it was the right decision, even though very few people now will stand up for it.’","Survey found 79 per cent want decrease while 59 per cent want big drop .

"An Australian farmer has dramatically pitched a tent in front of a coal train to protest against the expansion of the mining industry. Annette Schneider lay on a mattress over the tracks near Mangrove Road in Sandgate, north of Sydney, near Newcastle. The 54-year-old farmer, from Monaro in southern New South Wales, started her protest at 7am on Monday, but was taken into police custody about 10.30am. Scroll down for video . Annette Schneider, 45, spent three hours of Monday morning locked to a railway track near Newcastle . She had cut holes in the mattress to slot her arms through and locked them into a pipe running along the railway line. A group of 20 to 30 people were also on-site to support Ms Schneider. A spokeswoman for environmental group Front Line Action on Coal told Daily Mail Australia Ms Schneider wanted to make a statement about the expansion of the coal mining industry and the effects of climate change. In particular, the 54-year-old is worried about their impacts on farm land. Ms Schneider was trying to block the path of a coal train to protest against the expansion of the mining industry . The 54-year-old is part of the Front Line Action on Coal group who are an environmental group . Ms Schneider was trying to make 'a statement' to the government to ask them to consider issues surrounding the expansion of coal mines and climate change . 'She wanted to do this because she was frustrated with the government,' Front Line Action on Coal's Alex Walker said. 'The government is not listening to scientists. We’re not following the world and not listening to the world. We're kind of behind the times in Australia. '[Ms Schneider's] passionate about climate change and she wanted to make a statement.' A new report done by the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) estimates the annual costs of health-related issues caused by the five coal fired power station in the Hunter Valley costs $600 million. 'The coal industry is continuously dragging us down... and there are consequences and we need to do something about it before it's too late,' Ms Walker told Daily Mail Australia. Police came to arrest Ms Schneider three hours after she started her protest on Monday morning . The group claims surrounding mines are causing severe health problems in the areas as well as impacting on farming lands . 'In local communities, there has been an increase in severe health risks from breathing in coal dust. 'There's been a rise in asthma-related instances in children. People aren't sleeping as well as shortness of breath. 'Just the general implications you would get from breathing in dirty air, especially if it leeches into the water too.' A New South Wales Health Report from 2010 reported the Hunter regions most affected by open-cut coal mining and coal-fired power generation have higher rates of asthma and respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease compared with the rest of the state, according to the CAHA report.","Farmer Annette Schneider lay down in front of a coal train .
