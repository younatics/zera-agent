"Built in 1787, it served its local community for more than two centuries – but it is now a scene of torn Bibles, broken organs and smashed windows. Loxley Chapel in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was closed in 1993, and now sits among overgrown plants as an eerie abandoned place of worship. The Grade II-listed church, once known as Loxley Methodist Church and Loxley United Reformed Church, has been left in a shocking state of disrepair. Scroll down for video .

Plaques: The chapel was constructed in 1787 by Curate of Bradfield the Reverend Benjamin Greaves, along with some of his friends . The surrounding cemetery is also overgrown with graves being lost in the foliage - provoking outrage amongst families of the deceased. The keys of the enormous organ have been smashed to pieces, while a stack of Bibles and hymn books are now strewn across a storeroom. The chapel was constructed in 1787 by Curate of Bradfield the Reverend Benjamin Greaves, along with some of his friends. Upon completion in the 18th century, its consecration was refused because builders would not install an east-facing window for unknown reasons. It was eventually sold at auction for £315 and became an independent chapel, but had an average congregation of 200 worshippers by 1851. However it soon recovered because according to the Religious Census of 1851 the average congregation at an afternoon service was 200. Falling apart: The chapel is believed to be owned by Hague Farming of Bradfield, but nobody at the company was available for comment today .

Many of the 240 victims of the 1864 Great Sheffield Flood, one of Britain’s worst man-made disasters, are buried in the cemetery. The flood occurred when the Dale Dyke Dam broke as its reservoir was being filled for the first time. It sent 650million gallons of water cascading into central Sheffield while people were sleeping in their beds. Amongst the bodies that are buried here are the Armitage family, who lost 12 members including five children. RMS Titanic chief officer Henry Tingle Wilde - who is thought to have killed himself as the ship sank in 1912 - was baptised at the chapel. But the state of the church now has caused furious reaction among locals and visitors to the graveyard, who want action.

Reminder of days gone by: Copies of The Free Church Council Hymnal - priced at fourpence - sit abandoned at Loxley Chapel in Sheffield . Shropshire resident Iain Kelly has relatives buried in the chapel’s graveyard, and said he was ‘shocked’ at its state after visiting there in 2010. Mr Kelly said: ‘After a long search I was unable to identify the family graves and came away quite distressed at the total and utter neglect. Writing on Sheffield Forum, he added: ‘My horror was increased on the discovery that the burial ground is still accepting new customers, as it were. ‘I can’t help but feel that this is a shocking state of affairs being a microcosm of much which is wrong with our society. Here lay our dead. ‘Sheffield people laid to rest in originally quite beautiful surroundings but now ignored and forgotten. How did this come about?’ The chapel is believed to be owned by Hague Farming of Bradfield, but nobody at the company was available for comment today. However, one issue is said to be that while the owner has the freehold of the land, the grave plots still belong to families of the deceased. As a gale swept through Sheffield on the night of March 11, 1864, a water engineer was sheltering under the new dam when he noticed a crack. It was only wide enough to take a penknife, but it stretched along the earthen bank for 50 yards, following a jagged line 12 yards from the top. Just before midnight the dam burst, sending 650million gallons of water cascading into Sheffield in a disaster which killed 240 people in their beds. Great Sheffield Flood: The dam burst, sending 650million gallons of water cascading into the town in a disaster which killed 240 people . Half of those who died instantly were children, and around 60 more were killed as diseases swept through the stagnant water in the aftermath. But historians claim that one of Britain's worst disasters has been largely forgotten because the dead were northern and working-class. For years there was no full-scale memorial to those who died in Sheffield, with only a small memorial stone near Bradfield, where the reservoir stood. The dam was built by the Sheffield Waterworks Company from 1859 to provide drinking water for the people of the fast-growing industrial town. Diasastrous: The dam was built by the Sheffield Waterworks Company from 1859 to provide drinking water for the people of the town . It was also designed to provide a supply of running water for the mills in surrounding villages. But as it was being completed and filled the structure collapsed, sending water cascading down the Loxley Valley - devastating farms and hamlets. The floodwater then moved down to meet the River Don and laid waste to large areas of the centre of Sheffield. Harrowing stories emerged of how many of the victims died. One person who drowned was a new-born baby washed from his mother's arms. Three children died in a cellar while their parents were away. Then a village and now a suburb, Malin Bridge was worst hit - with 102 deaths.","Grade II-listed Loxley Chapel built in Sheffield in 1787 then closed two centuries later in 1993 .

"A Lib Dem councillor has apologised 'unreservedly' after he was caught playing Scrabble during a meeting. Martin Elengorn was snapped playing the game on his iPad by a Tory rival on Richmond Council who circulated the picture among council colleagues. Councillor Elengorn spent ten minutes playing Scrabble at the budget meeting before a party colleague passed him a note warning he had been rumbled. Martin Elengorn was snapped playing the game on his iPad by a Tory rival on Richmond Council who circulated the picture among council colleagues . And the 70-year-old  admitted the furore that followed has put him off the game. He told the MailOnline that he had 'sought solace' in the app during an opening speech by Conservative deputy council leader Geoffrey Samuel. 'Councillor Samuel was giving a speech in a bombastic and aggressive manor and, to be somewhat blunt, I'd run our of budget agendas and I unwisely sought solace in the Scrabble board,' he said. 'I admit it could be seen as (not representing those who voted for him). I do apologise unreservedly if it created the wrong impression. The councillor and keen Scrabble player said the incident had put him off playing the game for the foreseeable future . 'In fact I was listening to every word he said.' Mr Samuel, who was opening the annual budget and council tax meeting, called Mr Elengorn's behaviour 'outrageous'. 'He is paid, not an inconsiderable amount of money, to represent his residents and not play silly games. 'This is typical of his arrogant attitude and the flippant way he takes his public duties. 'If it was me, I would consider stepping down.' Conservative councillor Helen Hill, who took the photograph, said she was 'shocked' when she noticed him playing the game. Councillor Helen Hill (left) was 'shocked' to see Councillor Elengorn (right) playing Scrabble during the budget meeting and took the photograph . 'It was certainly a bit of a surprise,' she said. 'I didn't think it as a great idea to do right in he middle of a council meeting for the budget.' Councillor Hill said she decided to take the photograph as 'a comment on what he was doing when he should have been listening. 'He is just an eccentric individual,' she added. Lib-Dem leader Stephen Knight said: 'I think Martin recognises it was not the wisest thing to be doing in a council meeting. Tory MP Nigel Mills was forced to apologise after he was caught playing games on his iPad during a select committee hearing last December - as the Commons authorities launched a mole hunt for whoever caught him on camera. Photographs published by The Sun showed Nigel Mills enjoying online hit Candy Crush Saga during a Work and Pensions Committee evidence session. The Amber Valley MP, who has been issued with a tablet at the taxpayers' expense, initially told the newspaper he would merely 'try' not to be diverted by the game again. But in a statement  he said: 'I apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a Member of Parliament.' 'But I'd like to think people would be more interested in the content of the meeting than whether people were playing Scrabble.' Councillor Elengorn, who was a 'competent' Scrabble player said the whole incident had put him off wanting to play again. 'I have a routine, once a fortnight my brother and I play Scrabble- but he usually wins.' 'But I didn't look at the game again for a few days after this, I was rather put off it for a while.' John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Councillors receive a hefty allowance to represent the views of their constituents and hold the council to account — neither of which are achieved by playing Scrabble.' A spokesman for Richmond Council said they would not be commenting on the incident. It comes just weeks after Conservative councillor Eric Nicholson came underfire for spending two hours on his mobile phone during a debate at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria. The member for Cockermouth North played solitaire, checked his bank account and caught up with emails while hiding his Blackberry under the table during the meeting where a rise in council tax was being discussed. Mr Nicholson, who was elected in 1997, admitted after the meeting that he had been using his phone but insisted he was still 'concentrating'. Two months earlier, Tory MP Nigel Mills admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad during an important meeting in Parliament. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee in December. However, he spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen as he tried to complete levels of the popular game.","Martin Elengorn was snapped playing Scrabble at  Richmond Council .

But now it has emerged that he is the only party leader who would be liable to pay the levy on their property.

Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband he is the only party leader who would be liable to pay the levy on their property . Mr Miliband was mocked after it emerged his home had two kitchens when he posed drinking tea with wife Justine . Property website Zoopla found that Mr Miliband's north London home value at £2.73million, up by more than £1million since 2010. By contrast Mr Cameron's house in West London home would narrowly escape the mansion tax, being valued at £1.971million. Mr Clegg, who lives in Putney in south west London, would also escape with his home valued at £1.89million. Ukip leader Mr Farage is said to have a house in Kent worth a more modest £550,000. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: 'Soulless second kitchen or not, Ed Miliband's home is in a desirable part of London and is now worth a lot more than he paid for it before the last election. 'He may, however, have to put any plans for upgrading his kitchens on hold if Labour comes to power as his tax bill is likely to rise by at least £3,000 per year.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is said to have a house in Kent worth a more modest £550,000 . Under Labour's plan, people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £2million or more. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has promised to hike the levy for homes with over £10million, to ensure they make a ‘significantly bigger contribution’. The £2million limit will rise in line with property prices, instead of inflation ‘to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax’. Labour has joined the Liberal Democrats in promising an extra charge on expensive properties, to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in London. There will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home. The Lib Dems used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £2million, but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement.","Labour leader wants levy on all homes worth more than £2million .

"NSW Labor leader Luke Foley is campaigning to be the state's new Premier . A political party's attempt to use LOL cat memes as part of their election campaign has backfired after social media users pointed out they should be focusing on policy not comedy. NSW Labor, whose leader Luke Foley is campaigning to win the upcoming state election, posted a series of cat memes targeted at Liberal Premier Mike Baird on Saturday which they renamed 'Caturday'. But the party's Facebook fans were quick to point out cat memes had ‘become a bit passé’ and blasted ‘get your message across in an adult way, as it is adults who vote’. One meme showed two cats yawning with the tagline: ‘Mike Baird says prices won’t go up. LOL.’ Another showed a grumpy looking cat with the line: ‘Electricity privatisation… no.’ While a cute post showed a cat and a kitten cuddling with the words: ‘Labor is investing in schools for your little one.’ One fan of the NSW Labor party page, Sammy Yousef, wrote: ‘This is the best you’ve got? Freakin’ lolcats? That’s your counterargument?

Game over! Jesus Christ!’ Jenni May said: ‘Why the Hallmark cat ads? Aren’t you trying to sell intelligent political concepts. This approach will alienate all the “dog” people out there.’ '$1,000+ courses at TAFE? No thanks,' NSW Labor wrote alongside this cute kitten . Kate Marksell called for less cat posts and more 'policy, policy, policy please' 'Take it from this cat - whatever Mike Baird tries to tell you, prices will go up when he sells off our electricity network,' NSW Labor said on Facebook . The NSW Labor party used this sleeping kitten picture to illustrate how 'under Mike Baird, $3 billion has been ripped out of our healthcare system' Jason Muller commented: 'Ur resorting to using cats to get votes!' 'Really cats? Is this what political debate in NSW has come too,’ Anthony Bosh wrote . Bev Little wrote: ‘No more cats environment not friendly.’ Kate Marksell instructed: ‘OK, I like cats but enough with the cats. Policy, policy, policy please.’ ‘Yeah but honestly pictures of cats on them has become a bit passé,’ Peter Humble replied. ‘Most people aren’t posting pictures of their own cats anymore, text or no text.

"Snacking on unhealthy food should be viewed in the same way as smoking indoors, a leading anti-obesity expert has today claimed (file image) All meals should be served with vegetables, snacking should be socially unacceptable and a fizzy drinks tax must be introduced if the obesity epidemic is to be tackled, an expert said today. The Government's anti-obesity adviser said she wants food policy to be subjected to the same tough regulations as the tobacco industry. Professor Susan Jebb, from Oxford University, said social norms are 'terribly important', and as such, grazing on unhealthy snacks should be frowned upon. Poor diet is a leading cause of premature death in the UK, accounting for 12.5 per cent of the total burden of disease, primarily due to cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Two thirds of adults are overweight or obese as a result of overeating. In total obesity is linked to around 20 per cent of all ill health in the country, with 33,000 avoidable, early deaths a year, as a result. Preventing these avoidable diseases should be the Government's focus, if the health service is to become more sustainable, Professor Jebb is expected to say tomorrow at the annual Oxford London Lecture. The components of a healthy diet, consuming less saturated fat, sugar and salt while instead eating more fibre, fruit and vegetables, are well known. But to tackle the complex issues which have resulted in the rising tide of obesity in the UK, tougher measures are needed. Professor Jebb, is expected to call for a tax on fizzy drinks to help tackle the issue. Weight loss expert Steve Miller said  'gentle, politically correct' strategies have failed to encourage people to lose weight. Instead he said 'constructive fat shaming', and 'shock tactics' are the only way to help people realise they need to shed pounds. He said: 'As a weight loss specialist I advocate shock tactics including strong restaurant warning signs that read ""if you are fat, think before ordering"". 'Passengers on a plane should also pay for two seats if they are too fat, and irresponsible parents feeding their fat kids junk should be prosecuted. 'In addition assistants in fast food chains should refuse to serve dangerously fat customers. 'The NHS needs to offer alternative solutions including hypnosis. 'Shock tactics drives motivation high. Faffing about talking about food choices will no longer achieve the results we all want to see.' Professor Jebb, told The Times: 'When I was small, eating or drinking on the street was really, really bad form. 'The other norm I worry about is around vegetable eating, because in our house it would be inconceivable if a meal didn't come with vegetables... yet you go and have a meal out and often it will come without vegetables, you will have to buy those separately.' Professor Susan Jebb, from Oxford University, is calling for a tax on fizzy drinks, which have no nutritional value but rot teeth, to start a series of new, tougher measures, to change the way society perceives unhealthy food and drink. She said: 'It sends out a powerful message that these are unhealthy foods and it is one way to start shifting consumer behaviour.' (File image) She questioned when as a society we will get to the point where it becomes normal to view vegetables as an integral part of each meal. And she championed a more structured approach to meals, with less emphasis on grazing, noting when snacking it is difficult to know how much you have eaten. Both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out introducing a tax on junk food and fizzy drinks if they are to win the election on May 7. But Professor Jebb accused politicians of being 'too weak', urging them to take tougher action. She said fizzy drinks are a good place to introduce food taxation, because they have no nutritional value and rot teeth. The leading cause of childhood admissions in the this country is tooth decay, other experts have highlighted. Professor Susan Jebb is one of the key anti-obesity advisers to the Government . Professor Jebb added: 'It sends out a powerful message that these are unhealthy foods and it is one way to start shifting consumer behaviour.' The only reason such a tax is not yet reality, is because of fears it will be 'publicly unpopular', she said. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline while he welcomes Professor Jebb's ideas they would take at least 20 years to implement. 'The wish list that we can change attitudes towards not snacking in public is, in my view, unrealistic,' he said. 'We now have the mind set that we eat on the go, snacking anywhere, in front of the TV, in the car, anywhere. 'There is good evidence that suggests meal times are now set when people choose them to be, rather than being the set morning, lunch time and evening meals. 'Altering public opinion is difficult, if we were really set on it would take 20 years to change attitudes. 'If we really want to make improvements we have got to make sure the food we are eating and buying is as healthy as possible.' He told MailOnline that legislation is 'absolutely necessary'. 'If the level of taxation is as high as I think it should be, around 20 to 30 per cent I do think people would sit up and take notice,' he said. 'The question is how the taxation is applied. In my opinion it should be put on to the manufacturers. 'The Government needs to say to them that unless they bring down unhealthy levels of certain ingredients in their products they will be fined. 'And they need to make it clear the manufacturers cannot pass on the cost to consumers. 'Then it avoids the rise in the price of food, which affects those least able to pay the hardest. 'We need legislation of some variety, Professor Jebb is absolutely right, some kind of tax on fizzy drinks is a no brainer, we should have seen it 10 years ago.' Professor Jebb pointed to evidence in Mexico where the number of people drinking fizzy drinks dropped dramatically after the government there introduced a 10 per cent tax on sugary beverages. The nation is one of the heaviest in the Americas, with around 30 per cent of the population classed as being obese. But a survey, carried out last summer, reveals the new tax is making its mark. Just over half of the 1,500 people questioned said they have reduced their intake of sugary drinks since the fiscal measure was implemented.","Government anti-obesity adviser calls for taxation on fizzy drinks .

"The world's oldest pretzel has been discovered by archaeologists in Germany - and has lost none of its appeal despite being  baked 250 years ago. The popular snack was found at an excavation site in the eastern Bavarian city of Regensburg and experts believe it was thrown away in disappointment after being burnt to a crisp in the oven. The black pretzel was discovered alongside the charred remains of a bread roll and a croissant and it is thought that the food items have been preserved for so long because they were badly burnt by their 18th century baker. Lasting flavour: The world's oldest pretzel was discovered in the eastern Bavarian city of Regensburg . Silvia Codreanau-Windauer from the Bavarian Bureau for the Conservation of Historic Monuments told The Local: 'This is definitely the oldest pretzel ever found.' The mayor of Regensburg Joachim Wolbergs added. 'This discovery is really extraordinary, because it depicts a snippet of everyday life.' Pretzels are a traditional south German and Austrian delicacy and have been a favorite in Germany for centuries. In Bavaria, pretzels are often eaten for breakfast alongside weisswurst (white sausage) with sweet mustard. Also found: The charred remains of a bread roll were found near the pretzel and experts believe the baked goods have been preserved because they were burnt by an 18th century baker who then threw them away . Charred remains: The pretzel measures four inches and the mayor of Regensburg, where it was found, has called the discovery 'extraordinary' The earliest recorded evidence of pretzels comes from 1111 when they appear in the crest of German bakers' guilds in 1111. The snacks have long been integrated into the Christian faith. By the 16th century, it had become tradition to eat pretzels on Good Friday in Germany, and Catholics once considered them the official food of lent. Today, pretzels are most popular in the USA and Germany. Source: www.todayifoundout.com . Speaking to The Local, Ms Codreanu-Windauer added some historical context to the find, saying: 'The form of the pretzel is supposed to represent the crossed arms of monks. Eventually it ended up as a fasting meal.' Monks are the symbol of Bavaria's capital Munich and different orders and monasteries give their names to many of the state's most prominent beers. The excavation site in Regensburg has been a hit with archaeologists, who recently discovered a wooden house there thought to be up to 1,200 years old. On the site, which lies on the Danube, there are plans to build a museum for Bavarian history to mark the 2018 centenary of the region's status as a free state.

"The EU is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the United States which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant. American producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid (PAA) to remove harmful bacteria. The practice has been banned in Britain and Europe for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source, rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses. There are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs. However, the European Commission has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the American government and US chicken producers. The EU has lifted a ban on U.S. chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs . The proposal has alarmed consumer groups, who say it is at odds with European policy, which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms, rather than relying on disinfectants. Just last week, the chef and food campaigner, Jamie Oliver, warned that Britain and Europe risk importing inferior food from the USA under a new free trade deal called TTIP. Campaigners say the changes being planned to allow chicken washed with PAA are exactly the sort of thing that will become more common under the TTIP regime. Mute Schimpf, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ‘The EU’s approach to food safety is under attack, even before any trade deal with the US is agreed. ‘Despite repeated denial from the EU and national governments, the pressure is increasing to allow more imports of factory farmed meat rinsed in disinfectants. The EU must take a clear stand and ban all imports of meat produced in this way, and show the public that it is not caving in to US trade interests.’ Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has warned lowering standards risks allowing poor-quality US food into the British market . In the past, EU national governments have blocked moves by the European Commission to approve imports of ‘chlorinated chicken’ from the USA – chicken cleaned with a chlorine and water wash to kill bugs. This was done as a precaution and because it could mask poor hygiene standards, as well as harm the health of workers in abattoirs and lead to pollution. Consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of PAA and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant. The European consumer organisation BEUC insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the US. It said: ‘As the EU and the US are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement, we look to EU authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first.’ BEUC said allowing the use of these chemical treatments opens the door to lower hygiene standards on farms and in slaughterhouses. This is because producers may believe they can wash away any contaminants, rather than ensuring they are not there in the first place. It said: ‘We are concerned that PAA washes will not deliver any extra safety net. Rather, we see the risk they might be seen as a convenient substitute for good slaughter hygiene. ‘The availability of such treatment might lead slaughterhouse staff to be less vigilant on preventing carcass contamination to happen in the first place, hence putting consumers’ health at risk.’ The European Food Safety Authority has ruled that PAA is not toxic to humans, although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used. The death of a poultry inspector made the headlines in the US in 2013 and raised questions about the health risks associated with the use of chemical decontamination treatments of meat such as PAA. BEUC is also concerned that bugs might mutate and become immune to the chemicals used in the washing process, so getting through to the meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants. Consumer groups have said shoppers don't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals . The group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash. Research by the consumer group Which? in 2011 showed that 60 per cent of people were unlikely to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid. The British Poultry Council said the UK and European tradition of trying to keep harmful bugs out of the food chain, from farm to fork, was better for the public than relying on chemical disinfectants. Chief executive, Andrew Large, said: ‘Chemical treatments should never be used as a substitute for good hygiene practice. 'EFSA has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production, but British poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm-to-fork system.’","Food chiefs are to allow in chickens washed in peroxyacetic acid (PAA)

"A former Boy Scout saved by hero pilot Harrison Ford after getting lost while on a camping trip has told the injured star: 'Get better soon, my family is thinking of you.' Cody Clawson says Ford is a 'genuine hero' after saving his life in a dramatic helicopter rescue back in 2001. Cody was just 13 when he lost the trail during a Boy Scout camp in a remote forest just south of Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park. He was missing for almost 19 hours and helicopter pilot Ford – who lived part-time in Jackson, Wyoming at the time - joined a massive search-and-rescue mission to find him. Scroll down for video . This is the moment Harrison Ford rescued stranded Boy Scout Cody Clawson (both pictured) in his chopper . Rescue: Cody Clawson, pictured left as a boy scout aged 13, went missing during a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park and was lost for 19 hours overnight in the snow. He shone his belt to flag Ford down . 'Genuine hero': Clawson, now 26 and married with a son, hails the Star Wars actor as a real life star . Cody, now 26, recalls: 'We had just got to the camp and started unloading and I started to follow somebody who I thought was my dad. 'I lost track of him and before I knew it I was completely lost. 'I was just 13, I was pretty scared. I stayed where I was for about half-an-hour but no one came, so I started wandering, then I got really lost. 'I was missing overnight, it had rained and snowed that day so it was freezing cold. 'I was soggy, tired and hungry. I found a cave to take shelter and curled in to a ball. 'I was so tired I slept on and off.' Cody said he prayed to be rescued and was was only comforted by his religious beliefs. 'In the night I guess I had an epiphany or whatever you want to call it and the next morning I knew where I needed to go,' he said. 'I walked for a good few miles before I started hearing the search planes. I found a clearing next to a steep rocky outcrop and started making my way up. He was able to find a cave to sleep in and navigate himself but eventually, Clawson was stuck and afraid . 'I was about to start climbing it and that's when I saw the chopper.' Cody had seen Ford's helicopter circling above him but then suddenly the aircraft vanished from view. 'I had a Scout belt on which had a shiny brass buckle and I used it to reflect the sunlight to get their attention,' he said. 'I was definitely glad of my Boy Scout training at that point, but then the chopper passed over and had gone. 'I thought they hadn't seen me, I felt terrible and got a little depressed.' Luckily for Cody, Ford had spotted the teen and had set down his helicopter on the crest of a nearby hill. Cody recalled: 'This guy came down and was shouting my name. 'I was so relieved, he said, ""we're here to get you, but you'll never guess who's flying the helicopter?"" 'In my mind I was like, ""I really don't care"", I just wanted to get out of there. 'But he said it was Harrison Ford and I didn't believe him.' Cody said he didn't realize the rescuer was telling the truth until he got in to the back of the chopper. 'The pilot turned round and said, ""Good morning"". 'The way he said it reminded me so much of his role of Hans Solo in Star Wars. Then I was like, ""Oh my God, Han Solo has just rescued me, how cool is that"". 'I thought I was delirious at first but then realized I wasn't dreaming.' Ford flew the boy to a make-shift search and rescue headquarters that had been set up in the area. 'They said the camp was a mile-and-a-half from where I was so I was walking in the right direction,' he said. 'When we landed Harrison Ford came over to me and said: ""Boy, you sure must have earned a merit badge for this one."" 'But I told him I'd already earned this badge last summer, and he laughed. Avid flyer: Harrison Ford, 72, has been a trained pilot for more than two decades and has a bevvy of aircraft . Here he is pictured on an airfield surveying the fare. Clawson said he looked like Hans Solo in the driving seat . Crash: On Thursday afternoon, Ford crash-landed his vintage spitfire on a Los Angeles golf course . Handled: Experts hailed the landing as 'perfectly executed' as it was his only option when the engine failed . 'He had always been somebody I looked up to and appreciated. 'And what he did gave me a different perspective on stars. They sometimes get portrayed as snobby people, but there really is good, generous people out there. 'And to me Harrison Ford is one of those good people who we're lucky to have as an influence on our lives.' At the time Cody recalls Ford being interviewed about the rescue and the Indiana Jones actor said: 'I'm gonna fly anyway so I met as well fly search and rescue and help people.' Then Teton County Sheriff Bob Zimmer said Ford's volunteer efforts saved the department $1,000 an hour, the amount it would have cost to hire a private pilot. Cody admitted he was a little embarrassed by the incident but added that he was very popular with the kids on camp when they found out who rescued him. He said: 'The kids asked if I got an autograph but I told them, 'No, but I got a hug and a handshake, and that's better'. These days Cody, who lives with wife Kelsi and their 16-month-old son Kael in Ogden, Utah, works for a medical company making filters for dialysis machines. Life imitating art: Ford is perhaps best-known for his role as inter-galactic pilot Hans Solo in Star Wars . In the role, played alongside Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, he flew the fictional Millennium Falcon aircraft . He said that when he heard the news that Ford had crashed his vintage plane in Venice, California and had been injured, he was 'shocked' and 'genuinely concerned'. 'This guy saved my life, the first thing I thought is 'is he alright',' Cody said. 'I appreciated what he did for me all those years ago and I just hope he gets better and can help other people in future. 'He's a genuine hero, not just in the films, he's a great man.' It's not the only time Ford has been involved in a dramatic rescue. In July, 2000 the actor rescued Sarah George, 20, after she got in to difficulties on Table Mountain in Wyoming. George and her friend Megan Freeman, 22, were on a five-hour climb of the 11,106-ft mountain on July 31 when heat, altitude and dehydration left George sick and unable to take more than a couple steps. After another hiker called for help on a cell phone, the Star Wars star took to the air. Ford landed his helicopter in a meadow and picked up George; Freeman was told there wasn't enough room and had to hike down. 'He was wearing a T-shirt and a cowboy hat,' George told ABC News. 'He didn't look like I'd ever seen him before.' The ailing George vomited into the hat with about a minute to go before landing at Jackson's St. John's Hospital. 'I can't believe I barfed in Harrison Ford's helicopter,' she said.","Cody Clawson was 13 when he got lost in Yellowstone National Park .

"At first glance The Fliers and Explorers Globe appears to be an ordinary antique, hidden in a small over-looked office in downtown Brooklyn, at the end of a nondescript hallway. On closer inspection, however, you will discover it is actually one of the world's most fascinating relics, celebrating the giddy heights of exploration and adventure. What makes the artefact precious is not its beauty or age, but for the inclusion of the inked signatures and routes of nearly every single famous explorer and aviator in modern history, from Sir Edmund Hillary, to Neil Armstong and Amelia Earhart. The American Geographical Society's Fliers and Explorers Globe: The signature of Amelia Earhart, the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, is prominently featured . The society acquired the 18-inch globe in 1929 as a gift from AGS president John H. Finley. He invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names . Hillary was immortalised on the spherical relic, along with more recently, Ann Bancroft, who was the first woman to successfully finish a number of arduous expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic . This 18-inch globe is hidden beneath a dark cloth in the headquarters of the American Geographical Society, the oldest established national geographical organisation in the US. The valuable tradition of the globe signing started in 1929, when the society president, and editor-in-chief of the New York Times, John H. Finley would personally go down to the Lower Manhattan docks to welcome returning adventurers. Explorers would ink their routes and names on the prized object, documenting their piece of history in the moment it happened. Among those commemorated is Amelia Earhart who set records becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1928, and was the first individual to fly over both the Atlantic and Pacific. Tragically the aviation pioneer mysteriously disappeared in 1937 as she was trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator, and was legally declared dead in 1939. On May 20, 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh embarked on the world's first solo non-stop flight from New York to Paris. Enduring a 33.5-hour crossing, the 25-year-old was victorious and received international stardom, and his route was marked onto the globe to document the achievement. Sadly tragedy stuck in 1932 when his 20-month-old son was kidnapped and tragically murdered in what was called, 'the Crime of the Century.' In the society's own words, the globe is 'a priceless and unique symbol of humanity's unquenchable drive to explore the universe.' A crowning glory of the AGS institution, the globe would not have always seemed as out of place. The society was created in 1851 following Sir John Franklin's disappearance on his Arctic mission. A group of like-minded explorers banded together to create a rescue mission, and thus, the AGS was born. New Zealand explorer, Sir Edmund Hillary, became the first climber to reach the summit of Mount Everest, (left), and Charles Lindberg who made the first solo transatlantic airplane flight in 1927, (right). Both explorers are featured on the globe . Amelia Earhart stands June 14, 1928 in front of her bi-plane called 'Friendship' in Newfoundland. She inked her name on the prized artefact .

Despite the mission being unsuccessful the AGS grew in popularity, with scholars, businessmen and government officials joining the ranks, at its then office, a celebrated neo-classical building in Washington Heights, to discuss latest geographic news. Unlike rivals, National Geographic Society, who focused on photography and popular geography, the New York based society placed its efforts on sponsoring expeditions, geographic research and education. The society was the principal map resource for the United States for decades, and at its peak had a permanent staff force of over 80, contractually making maps for the government. Government revenues died down after the war, and with the AGS losing a lot of donations, the headquarters were sold in 1970.

It is strange that the globe, arguably the most fascinating in the world, is hidden away with nobody to witness the journey of Wiley Post, who in 1933 was the first to fly around the world, or Robert Peary, the first man to the North and South Pole. Current executive director, John Konarski III, said: 'It sits in my office and no one sees it. I'd like to get it into the public.' The society is facing a revival, with plans to relocate back to Manhattan, to the redeveloping South Street Seaport neighborhood, poignantly close to where the Finley would first ask explorers to leave their ink mark on history. Wiley Post, first pilot to fly solo around the world, inked his route on the AGS's globe . This unique artefact bears inked routes of their world changing adventures, but is rarely seen by anyone .

"A McDonald's employee has been charged with aggravated battery after he beat a customer so badly that he left him with permanent vision loss. Darrell Haynes, 35, was arrested last Thursday after he allegedly hitting a man in the parking lot of a Chicago location following an argument at the fast-food joint's counter on February 25. After the argument at the restaurant on the Near West Side of the city, Haynes reportedly followed the man out of the store and hit him in the face several times, rupturing his right eyeball,The Chicago Tribune reported. Darrell Haynes, 35, was arrested last Thursday after he allegedly beat a customer in the parking lot of a Chicago McDonald's restaurant after an argument at the counter . Haynes posted this on Facebook two days after he allegedly beat a man in a McDonald's parking lot in February . The victim, whose name and age have not been released, has no vision in his right eye. The man and a witness identified the McDonald's employee. Haynes was arrested at his mother's home last week and charged on Sunday. He is being held on $40,000 bail. Haynes, who has been married for four years and has children, posted several pictures of himself and the Incredible Hulk on social media two days after the alleged attack. One Facebook post read: 'U wouldn't like me when I'm mad..' In a statement, the Chicago McDonald's owner and operator, Ron Lofton, told Daily Mail Online: 'Nothing is more important to me than the safety and well-being of my customers and employees. This was an isolated incident, and the individual in question is no longer employed by my organization.

"An ally of the Russian opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow has branded a theory that he was killed by a devout Muslim because he defended Charlie Hebdo's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as 'absurd'. It emerged earlier today that police in Russia investigating the death of Boris Nemtsov were looking at theories that he was killed over his support for the French magazine, which published the controversial images. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov had said that Zaur Dadayev, one of the five suspects detained over the killing of Nemtsov was a 'deep believer' and was not happy by Mr Nemstov's supporting the magazine. Scroll down for video . Zaur Dadayev, who has been charged with involvement in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov inside a defendant's cage inside a Moscow court building . It has been claimed that Dadayev, pictured, is a devout Muslim, who was angry about the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in the French magazine Charlie Hebdo . The claims were made by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, pictured. Dadayev is a former member of the police in Chechnya . However, Ilya Yashin, who co-founded the opposition movement Solidarnost has now dimissed the theory, saying it was 'politically motivated'. He said: 'The official version of the inquiry is more than absurd. In my opinion it is the result of a political order from the Kremlin. He also added how Mr Nemtsov had 'never negatively spoken about Islam' and had merely criticised the Islamist extremists who gunned down 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January. Mr Yashin's comments come after Chechen leader Mr Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account: 'All who know Zaur (Dadayev) confirm that he is a deep believer and also that he, like all Muslim, was shocked by the activities of Charlie and comments in support of printing the cartoons.' He also confirmed that Dadayev had also been a member of the police in Chechnya and had been decorated for bravery. Mr Kadyrov is considered by many as one of Russian president Vladimir Putin's most loyal henchmen in the Caucasus region. He was installed by Putin as leader of Chechnya and has spoke of his support for Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Mr Nemtsov, 55, was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the Kremlin with his model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. Three suspects detained over the killing of Mr Nemtsov sit covering their faces in a defendant's cage at a court in Moscow yesterday .

An armed guard escorts one of the five suspects in the killing of Mr Nemstov into a court in Moscow yesterday . He had been a critic of current Russian president Vladimir Putin and considered a liberal. Yesterday, it was alleged Dadayev made a statement confirming his guilt as he and four other men appeared in court over the assassination. All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side. Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev’s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov.

"Hector Coria Gonzales (above), 46, was arrested at his home in Davis on Friday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials . Federal immigration authorities have arrested a former Northern California priest and are preparing to deport him to Mexico after he admitted to having sex with a 16-year-old altar girl - including in his church rectory. Hector Coria Gonzales, 46, was arrested at his home in Davis on Friday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. He is being held without bond at the Sacramento County's Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center while his case is reviewed by an immigration court. Gonzales was previously arrested on May 9, 2014 on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity with the girl on several occasions which took place in a car, at a home and at the church rectory, according to the Davis Enterprise. The following month, he pleaded guilty to statutory rape in Yolo County Superior Court for engaging in sexual acts with the girl, who was identified as 'M.L.' in court documents and belonged to the St. James' Parish in Davis where he served as a priest. He was in the country legally, but that changed when the Catholic Church stripped him of his priesthood after his conviction. Earlier reports said the sexual acts between Gonzales and the girl occurred from April 2013 to May 2014. After he pleaded guilty, Sacramento Catholic Church officials said they would ask the Vatican to have him defrocked, according to the Daily Democrat. Gonzales was being held without bond at the Sacramento County's Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center while his case is reviewed by an immigration court. In June, he pleaded guilty in Yolo County Superior Court to engaging in sexual acts with the girl, who was identified as 'M.L.' in court documents and belonged to the St. James' Parish in Davis where he served as a priest . 'Father Coria's behavior with the minor was a crime and a sin,' Kevin Eckery, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento told The Bee last year in a statement. 'He will now be held to account for his behavior.' During his sentencing last August, M.L. indicated that she was not abused or manipulated by Gonzales and that she did not want or need protection, according to earlier reports. Gonzales was reportedly sentenced to three months in jail and three years of probation after he pleaded guilty, according to ABC News 10. Michael Vaughn, assistant field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, said: 'We entrust members of the clergy to act as role models for our youth. 'Tragically, when that trust is violated, the effects are far-reaching.'","Hector Coria Gonzales, 46, was arrested at his home in Davis on Friday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials .

"Tony Douglas, the current chief executive of Abu Dhabi airports, will be in charge of the MoD's equipment programme and will earn £285,000 in salary, with a £250,000 bonus . A defence chief is to become the highest paid Whitehall civil servant after he was awarded a lucrative pay package to sort out botched reforms. Tony Douglas, who will be in charge of the department’s equipment programme, is to be given a £285,000 salary and a £250,000 performance-related annual bonus, it has been revealed. His basic salary – double what the Prime Minister earns – is 25 per cent more than that of Bernard Gray, the man he will succeed. It is nearly three times a brigadier’s £103,166 salary and 15 times a regular soldier’s pay of £17,945. The fatcat deal comes as 22,000 troops have been axed, along with warships, fighter jets and tanks, under an Armed Forces shake-up. Analysts warn of further devastating cuts to come. Andy Silvester, campaign director at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘If there isn’t a dramatic improvement, taxpayers will be rightly furious at the size of this pay packet. 'As in every part of the public sector, his performance in the job must be open to public scrutiny, and any bonuses awarded must be truly earned.’ The Ministry of Defence announced the appointment of Mr Douglas, currently chief executive of Abu Dhabi Airports, on Wednesday. He will start in September and is the latest in a line of senior business figures lured into the public sector with the promise of private sector levels of pay. In a statement released by the MoD, Mr Douglas said he would take pride in providing ‘utmost service quality’ and ‘value to the taxpayer’. He will take over from Mr Gray, who provoked a furore when he charged the taxpayer £23,000 for luxury hotel stays in his first ten months in the job – at a time when his department faced huge budget cuts. He then faced calls to resign after he failed in his efforts to part-privatise the way the MoD buys defence equipment, costing taxpayers millions of pounds. Mr Douglas's salary will be double that of the Prime Minister, three times that of a brigadier, on £103,166, and 15 times a regular soldier’s pay of £17,945 (file image) Mr Gray, a former Labour adviser and businessman who had been appointed to help bring down the military budget, saw his total pay deal rocket to £385,000 last year.

"They may have been good enough for legendary actor Gary Cooper and singing superstar Barbra Streisand, but it seems their Christian names are now no longer cool. It may be unimaginable that you won’t be able to call friends ‘Gazza’ and ‘Babs’ in the future, but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation. According to OurBabyNamer.com the name Gary reached peak popularity in 1952 in the US, coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered Garys. However, in 2013, only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called Gary. Legendary actor Gary Cooper was the flag-bearer for his Christian name in the 1950s . In another name shocker, Nameberry.com revealed that Barbra, spelled in the same unique way as global superstar Streisand, was also out. Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s, when it peaked at Number 511, only to drop off in the Top 1000 in 1971. To make matters worse the conventional spelling of Barbara, a Top 10 name for three decades, only just gets in the Top 1000. So no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner. Barbra Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s . Other names compiled by baby naming website Nameberry.com that look on the way out are Llewellyn as a boy's name and Claudine for a girl. The popularity of the 2013 Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis obviously has not rubbed off on cinema-goers. A common name in Wales, with the distinctive Welsh double-l beginning, Llewellyn appeared on the US list for six decades. Bye bye Baby: The girl's name Claudine is another one that has gone out of fashion . But despite its rich Welsh history, literary cred and quirky nicknames, Llewelyn doesn't cut it any more. While Claudine, the feminisation of the ancient Roman name Claudius, ranked in the Top 1000 for first half of the 20th century, then rose to new heights in 1970 thanks to the popularity of singer Claudine Longet, only to fall off the charts in 1975. Claudine along with most other once-popular -ine and -een-ending girls' names are now generally out of favour. The once popular Welsh boy's name Llewellyn is also out when it comes to babies' names .","The likes of actor Gary Cooper made this Christian name cool in the 1950s .

"Staff at Qantas are complaining about not getting enough sleep on their trips to Los Angeles because their hotel in the city is too noisy. Unions representing Qantas staff claim they've been inundated with complaints after flight attendants and pilots were moved to a hotel next door to the 'happiest place on earth' Disneyland and the busy convention centre. Qantas made the move from Costa Mesa, an hour and a half south of Los Angeles Airport, to the Anaheim Hilton in the last 12 months. In the last 12 months Qantas staff have been staying at The Anaheim Hilton which is right next door to Disneyland and its convention centre . Unions claim they have been inundated with complaints that staff are unable to sleep in the new accommodation Qantas is providing . This move follows airline chief Alan Joyce's announcement  of cost cuts worth $2 billion over three years after suffering losses in recent years. The new lodgings are about half-an-hour closer to the airport and reportedly cut accommodation costs by two-thirds, or approximately $100 per night. Flight Attendants Association Australia National Industrial Officer Steven Reed told Newscorp that flight attendants and pilots are unable to get adequate rest because of the noise coming from the theme park and its neighbouring convention centre. ‘By the time you get to the hotel you want to go for a walk and then get some rest, not face a rock band playing in the foyer and kids running up and down the halls.' He warned if crews aren't adequately rested they'll be required to report as ‘unfit for duty’ which could result in flight cancellations. Although the Anaheim Hilton is about 30 minutes closer to the airport than previous accommodation, unions insist the hotel is too noisy for airline staff . A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that they observe rigid protocols in relation to the amount of rest staff must get and it is always in the best interest of the airline to ensure these requirements are met. She said Qantas often 'go above and beyond' the regulatory rest requirements to ensure the 'wellbeing' of flight crew. In response to recent allegations that staff are being mistreated she said  the airline uses 'number of different hotels in LA', which are not limited to the Anaheim Hilton. A Qantas spokeswoman said ensuring its staff's well being is of the utmost importance . The spokeswoman said Qantas are trying to resolve the issue by collaborating with the hotel to better organise accommodation around scheduled music events that may cause concern for staff. A spokeswoman from the Aneheim Hilton said the noise heard from the convention centre is minimal, however, if there are events held in the courtyard the noise can be louder. She added that noise complaints are few and far between because of noise restrictions that are put into place at 10pm each night to ensure guests are not effected. Daily Mail Australia contacted Flight Attendant Association Australia however they were unavailable for comment. Unions are concerned that flights may be cancelled as too many staff will suffer fatigue .","Qantas staff have been put up in a hotel right next door to Disneyland .

"Cook MP Billy Gordon has released a statement, claiming he is considering his options and seeking legal advice following allegations over his troubled background. The Queensland government was plunged into crisis after Mr Gordon was ordered to quit when details of his criminal past - including allegations of domestic violence - emerged. Now Mr Cook has said that he is seeking legal advice and needs time weigh up his options. Scroll down for video . Cook MP Billy Gordon has been told by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to quit . ABC journalist Jessica van Vonderen tweeted extracts from a statement she said was made by Mr Gordon in which he said he is very concerned about his future. 'I have a serious eye operation tomorrow & I need further time to consider my options, seek legal advice...' according to the tweet. 'I am presently weighing up my options... I am very concerned I should be afforded natural justice..' Mr Gordon said he would not be making any further comment to the media about his situation but stressed that he was worried about his family life. 'I am very concerned at the impact this situation is having on my children who I love very much.' Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk ordered Mr Gordon to stand down after it was reportedly revealed he had failed to inform her of his past. Ms Palaszczuk received a letter from Mr Gordon's partner accusing him of these allegations, which were revealed earlier this week . The move means there will have to be a by-election to replace him - meaning the government's one-seat majority is under threat. It emerged last week that Mr Gordon, who is the member for the seat of Cook, had been accused of domestic violence by an ex-partner. Ms Palaszczuk had referred the allegations onto Queensland Police. The premier has been accused of trying to cover up Mr Gordon's history amidst fears that his possible departure could leave the party one seat-short of governing. Ms Palaszczuk told reporters on Sunday she had spoken to Mr Gordon on the phone and had made it 'very clear' to him that his position was 'untenable'. 'To say I am disappointed today would be an understatement,' she said. 'I feel absolutely sick, disgusted. For this to happen is unbelievable.' When asked what would happen if Mr Gordon did not resign, Ms Palaszczuk said she would not discuss hypothetical situations but that she could not see how the MP could have misunderstood her. The premier said during her conversation with Mr Gordon he had apologised to her and he was 'very distraught'. Ms Palaszczuk added the Labor Party would be looking into its candidate selection process to figure out how Mr Gordon's history was overlooked. Her announcement followed Mr Gordon making a public statement about his criminal past. Opposition leader Lawrence Springborg accused the premier of casting a 'gloss' over the allegations . 'Over the last couple of days details of my personal life have been made public,' he wrote on Facebook. 'In relation to allegations of domestic violence, the Premier has referred this matter to the Queensland Police Commissioner for investigation. 'I welcome this investigation and will provide it with full cooperation. 'The last couple of days have been a tremendous strain on my family and I. 'I have been extremely concerned about my children throughout this period as any father would be in this situation.' Mr Gordon also listed his full criminal history on his social media page, which included convictions for breaking and entering, stealing, breach of probation and bail conditions, public nuisance, unlicensed driving and an apprehended violence order (AVO). He expanded on the circumstances surrounding the AVO, which was brought against him by his mother. 'My mother at the time was concerned that I was going to return to a relationship with an ex-partner [we were at said ex-partner's residence] and I asked her to leave in a manner that she found threatening,' Mr Gordon said. 'My mother has confirmed to me that there were no allegations of physical violence made with respect to this incident.' It emerged earlier this week, Ms Palaszczuk had referred allegations of domestic violence against Mr Gordon to Police Commissioner Ian Stewart late on Friday afternoon. But she received the letter from Mr Gordon's ex-partner more than a week prior to forwarding it on to authorities, according to the ABC. If Mr Gordon steps aside while police investigate the allegations, Labor won't have enough seats to govern . Queensland police have confirmed the Premier has referred an allegation of domestic violence to them. On Friday, Mr Gordon made a personal statement in which he admitted he had not paid child support payments to his ex-partner but did not mention the more serious abuse allegations. Opposition leader Lawrence Springborg has accused the premier of casting a 'gloss' over the allegations when she suggested in parliament on Friday the matter was resolved. 1987: Breaking and entering, and stealing in Innisfail . 1990: Breaking and entering with intent, attempted breaking and entering, and stealing in Atherton . 1992: Breach of probation in Atherton . 1996: Public nuisance in Normanton . 1999: Breach of bail conditions, stemming from not attending a court summons from the 1996 incident . 2004: Driver's licence suspended for unlicensed driving . 2006: Again, he had his driver's licence for unlicensed driving . 2008: Served an apprehended violence order (AVO) as a result of a complaint by his mother . But by that evening, it had become 'a totally different story', he claimed. 'What changed in the intervening eight hours, was that the media found out that there were other issues - issues that the premier was very much aware of,' he said on Saturday. 'The simple question today [for] the premier is did she actually ask the member for Cook about these issues of domestic abuse?' he said. 'I think what we see here is a cover up.' In a letter to the Police Commissioner dated March 27, Ms Palaszczuk says her office received a letter outlining allegations against the newly elected member for Cook. These were immediately referred to Labor state secretary Evan Moorhead, who in turn encouraged her to make a complaint about the alleged conduct to the police, she wrote. 'Since that time, details of the allegations have been made public,' Ms Palaszczuk wrote. 'In light of this fact, I feel it is now incumbent on me to refer the matters to the Queensland Police Service.' The matter has serious implications for the fledgling Labor government, which holds 44 seats in the 89-seat parliament and needs the support of Mr Gordon to govern. If Mr Gordon steps aside while police investigate the allegations, Labor will not have enough seats to govern.

"The British tourist who died after shooting himself at a Thai gun range shared a toffee with the taxi driver taking him there in the moments before his death. Liam Colven was behaving 'normally' on the way to the Thalang range on Phuket on Saturday according to the taxi driver who took him there from a friend's hotel. The 21-year-old appeared in 'good spirits' and even shared a toffee with Pauseud Pasaman after telling him he was from Scotland. After firing six rounds at the range, Mr Colven turned a gun on himself in front of horrified staff members. Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye . Horror:  A distressed staff member first tries to stop Mr Colven shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened . The former hotel worker from Skye has been described by friends as 'one of the kindest men' they'd known. Describing the journey to the range from the Sunkiss Hotel in Phuket, Mr Pasaman said he seemed to be behaving normally. A receptionist said he appeared to be 'like everybody else' at the hotel but was not registered to a room. 'He was happy. He did not seem like the kind of man who was about to shoot himself. He was normal. Not drunk,' the 41-year-old told MailOnline from a makeshift taxi rank outside the hotel. Despite earlier reports which claimed the former hotel worker had been arguing with a friend, Mr Pasaman said the pair appeared to be having a calm conversation. 'They talked for around half an hour. Not fighting just talking.' 'They looked like they knew each other.' After their encounter, Mr Colven walked the short distance across the road and asked for a taxi. 'He said, ""I want to shoot"" so I took him there. The driver said there was 'some talk' during the drive but added that his 'English is not good' and the only thing he remembered was that he was 'from the UK'. The pair did share a toffee before Mr Pasaman dropped him off at the range. Taxi driver Pauseud Pasaman drove the youngster to the shooting range. He said he behaved 'normally' With his hands to his head, the staff members stumbles away from the range for help after witnessing Mr Colven's death . The man falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place . The British tourist shot himself after emptying one magazine at a target, staff at the Thalang range said . Thai police said Mr Colven was not registered to any hotels in the Bang Tao area but had been seen at a hotel talking to a friend before being picked up by a taxi . There, the 21-year-old shot himself in the head at around 3pm local time yesterday. According to a staf member, he bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target. He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. The youngster's death had left him 'shocked', Mr Pasaman added. He has since been questioned by Thai police over his account. 'He was a young boy. Twenty one is very young.' A Thai policeman claimed Mr Colven had not been staying in the Ban Tao area prior to his death and that the young man's belongings had been collected by officers and taken to a the Thalang police station. He added that Mr Colven had been at the Sunkiss hotel to 'visit a friend'. In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flung the sun hat he was wearing  seconds after the shooting. Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he gripped the table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head. The member of staff then fell to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place. He looked back at where the tourist's body is lying slumped on the ground where he fell after discharging the weapon. MailOnline spoke to a young neighbour of the Thalang range deep in the Phuket countryside (pictured) A young man living near the shooting range, who did not want to give his name, told MailOnline: 'It is sad. I heard shots and someone scream. 'The police came and took his body away.' The range the 21-year-old visited is deep in the Phuket countryside, down a number of rocky byroads and around an hour from the bustling hub of Patong. The spot is peaceful  at night with plenty of trees around and a tied-up elephant grazing in front. Lt Kraisorn Boonprasop of the Thalang Police said: 'We have taken statements from some witnesses but we will question more people at the scene and we have yet to review the CCTV footage.' Local officials have become increasingly concerned at the number of suicides among expats and tourists visiting Phuket. Mr Colven was reported missing in October 2013, sparking a police appeal. He did not return to his home in Portree on the Isle of Skye after visiting a relative in Glasgow. He was a student in Falkirk at the time, police records show. Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said. 'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come. 'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.' Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'RIP one of the kindest men I knew, a former work colleague and mate you will forever be in my thoughts.' Mr Colven worked at the Cullin Hills Hotel in Portree on the Isle of Skye before going abroad.

Local officials have become increasingly concerned at the number of suicides among expats and tourists visiting Phuket. Pictured is Paradise Beach on the Thai island . Southeast Asia has an unfortunate reputation as somewhere where dangerous weapons can be fired for fun if you know the right people. There are also dozens of legitimate shooting ranges across the country offering tourists a wide array of guns to shoot. It may be  illegal for a foreigner to own or purchase firearms in Thailand, but you can fire handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons at these establishments. In Patong, around an hour from Thalang, the Shooting Café is located in the Jungceylon shopping mall and boasts on its website that it has an 'air-conditioned, full-service café wrapped around the shooting range. 'There’s a closed-circuit TV system inside too, so you can sit at the bar with a drink and watch shooters firing on all cylinders.' The Old City, known as Rattanakosin, is the epicentre of gun culture in the capital Bangkok. According to thailawforum: 'almost 80 gun and weapons shops line Wang Burapha Road. 'Shotguns and rifles stand upright in retail window displays next to arrays of handguns and ammo. 'For Thais looking to purchase guns, there’s no other place to go, though for foreign gun-enthusiasts, the most you can do is look.' If you're an expat resident or seasoned traveller in the region the chances are you know at least one person who has 'rented' weapons from enterprising military personnel.","Liam Colven died yesterday after shooting himself on island of Phuket .

"Commuters have told of the horrifying moment a toddler was injured after she fell through the gap between a London Underground Tube train and the platform at one of the city's busiest stations. The three-year-old girl had been standing with on platform 2 at Baker Street station with her nanny and another child when she fell between the platform and a Metropolitan line train. It is thought they were trying to board a northbound service when the doors opened when her carer's back was turned. The three-year-old girl had been standing on the platform at Baker Street station, pictured, when she fell between the platform and a Metropolitan line train . The incident happened at 4pm yesterday and passengers quickly hoisted the girl to safety before she was subsequently checked over and assisted by station staff. Luckily, she only suffered a bruise to her forehead after she hit the metal foot plate of the train. She was taken to hospital for a check-up and was said to be in good spirits. A witness who saw the incident unfold told the Evening Standard: 'The little girl was waiting with an adult and another smaller child and was getting ready to board the train. 'There’s a gap on the platform where the track bends around and she fell into that gap. Some gaps are big enough for me to fit in.' Transport for London confirmed that the incident had taken place and said that an investigation had been launched into how the young girl fell. Steve White, operations director of London Underground said: 'A young girl fell between a train and the platform at Baker Street station. 'An investigation is underway but it seems that while her carer's back was turned, the girl stepped into the gap between the platform and train. 'The train was stationary throughout and the girl was pulled out straight away. Our staff made sure that she was taken to hospital as a precaution.' Baker Street underground station is the oldest in central London and has pronounced curve in the track, creating a large gap when a train pulls into the platform.

Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, said: 'This is a shocking incident and RMT is awaiting the outcome of the investigations by the Office for Rail Regulation. 'However, once again, RMT warned that there were dangerous gaps between platforms and the trains with this rolling stock. 'This incident again exposes the lethal nonsense of cutting station staff on the underground network.' It is the second such accident on a Tube platform in a week after a woman was injured at Clapham South station in south London after her coat got trapped in a door. Witnesses told of fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman on the northbound platform of the Northern line, and claimed the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached a 'crowded' platform.

"A 34-year-old mother of two shot and killed her young daughters at their upscale New Hampshire home before turning the gun on herself in what has been ruled as a murder-suicide. Assistant Attorney General Jay McCormack said police received a 911 call Saturday regarding a deceased woman at the home in Bedford. When officers arrived, they found two more bodies. The attorney general's office Monday identified them as Nina Obukhov and her two daughters, 8-year-old Katherine and 6-year-old Elizabeth. Scroll Down for Video . Murder-suicide: Nina Obukhov, 36, was found dead at this upscale Bedford, New Hampshire, home after killing her two young daughters, ages 6 and 8, and then herself . A makeshift memorial appears on display in front of the Obukhov residence on McAfee Farm Road . Autopsies confirmed that all three died of gunshot wounds to the head. The girls' deaths were ruled homicides. The manner of the mother's death remained undetermined, but authorities said it appeared the mother shot the girls and then committed suicide. Flowers and stuffed animals were left next to a pile of yellow police tape outside the home Monday morning. At the school Katherine, known as 'Katy,' attended, officials were trying to provide the children with as much normalcy as possible while also making grief counselors available. Deidre Helmke's son was in the same class as Katy for both first and second grade as part of a class that stayed together for their first two years of elementary school. Helmke, who served as 'room mother' for first grade at riddle Brook Elementary School, described it as a tight-knit group. On Monday, she was flipping through school yearbooks looking at pictures of Katy, whom she remembered as a 'little peanut.' 'She was a sweet little blonde-haired girl, quiet,' Helmke said. Helmke said Nina Obukhov also was quiet. While she didn't know her well, she saw Obukhov at school and occasionally bumped into her while running errands. It is believed that Alexey Obukhov and his wife Nina lived in the home with their two daughters, aged 6 and 8 . 'She didn't stand out as being any different from any other mom,' she said. 'She would chat a bit about the kids and then move on.' While school officials notified parents about the deaths on Sunday, they did not identify the victims, leaving Helmke and other parents unsure what to tell their children. Not wanting him to find out at school, she told her son that she 'heard a report that Katy passed away.' He teared up and wanted to know how. 'I told him I honestly don't know, and I gave him a hug,' she said. On Sunday, police were searching for Nina Obukhov's gun store owner husband, Alexey, but Monday's news release by the attorney general's office made no mention of the missing man. Police were searching for Russian gun store owner Alexey Obukhov after three people were found dead at an upscale New Hampshire home Saturday . Although police have said they are not looking for suspects, a 'be-on-the-lookout alert' was issued by National Emergency Alerts - New England at about 11.40pm on Saturday on Facebook. The statement announced that they were looking for Obukhov and his maroon BMW coupe with New Hampshire plates. Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 after hanging pictures of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong calling Obama 'firearm salesman of the year'. He is also the owner of a company called New Vector Corporation, according to online records. He also is the president of Collectible Arms and Ammo II Corp. Obukhov was previously arrested in August 2013 for a domestic violence assault but the charges were dismissed after his wife declined to testify, according to the Bedford Patch. National Emergency Alerts - new England, however, issued a 'be-on-the-lookout alert Saturday evening looking for a man named Alexey Obukhov . State and Bedford Police, along with a SWAT Team arrived on scene on Saturday. Police continued to investigate at the house throughout the day on Sunday . Then last year he filed a civil lawsuit against Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, seeking that all of his firearms and ammunition be returned to him . The lawsuit was denied, but Obukhov sued and in November, the state's highest court ordered that Obukhov's application for a pistol revolver license be granted even though Bryfonski believed that he was unsuitable to possess a concealed weapon, according to court records. New Hampshire State Police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene in Beford, blocking off the street and access to the home. The Attorney's General Office is also part of the investigation. 'This tragedy will affect all of us, and it will affect Riddle Brook School in particular,' Superintendent Chip McGee said in an email to parents of the Bedford School District on Sunday morning, reports Union Leader. Very few details about the case have been released, and causes of death and names of victims are being withheld pending the notification of family . Police blocked off the road in Bedford where the Obukhovs allegedly lived for the remainder of Saturday . While reassuring the public that there is no threat to the community, McGee said the school district is coordinating with the National Alliance of Mental Illness and the Attorney General's Office Crisis Response Team. 'Starting on Monday morning, we will have additional counselors at Riddle Brook School to work with those most affected. Counseling staff at all of our schools will be available to talk with students, parents and staff,' McGee said in his statement. '... This event will be known in our community, even among our children. Information travels fast. The event may trigger difficult memories and strong emotions in people.' Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 .","Officials ruled that Nina Obukhov, 36, shot dead her two daughters, 8-year-old Katherine and 6-year-old Elizabeth, and then herself .

"A mother has described the heartbreak of watching her son scratch himself until he bled due to severe eczema. Jessica Chandler said her son Ollie, who is now nearly two, developed skin so dry and flaky it looked as though he has been in a fire. She was mortified when strangers repeatedly asked if Ollie had been burned, and felt paranoid other parents believed she was neglecting her son. After an embarrassing confrontation on a train, in which she was once again asked how her baby got burned, Miss Chandler became determined to find a treatment that would help. Ollie Chandler, now nearly two, suffered eczema so severe people asked if he had been burned in a fire . His mother Jessica, 27, began searching for a cure for her son's condition online, as she became paranoid people might think her son's appearance made her look neglectful . Miss Chandler said her son would scratch his skin until it bled, which was heartbreaking for her to watch . While doctors struggled to find a cure, Miss Chandler stumbled on a cream she claimed almost cured her son’s eczema within weeks. She is now calling for greater understanding of the condition to help other mothers whose children are affected. The 27-year-old said: ‘I’m well aware it isn’t life threatening but when you have a little one who is constantly in pain, irritable and uncomfortable and medical professionals don’t seem to take that seriously, it is incredibly frustrating. ‘My son’s eczema was so bad he would scratch himself until he bled which was heartbreaking. ‘As a mother, watching your little one suffer like that is awful - but nothing I was prescribed seemed to work. ‘It got the stage that people were constantly asking me what had happened to Ollie and I even started to get paranoid that people might think I wasn’t looking after him properly when nothing could have been further from the truth.’ Miss Chandler, a furniture restorer from Wolverhampton, said her son had struggled with the condition since he was born. She said: ‘Ollie developed a rash soon after birth that would come and go for weeks. But I was told it was nothing to worry about.’ But as the months passed she noticed dry patches on his face and elbow. Then in November last year the rash began to darken and spread leading Miss Chandler and her engineer fiancé David Bennett, 28, to think their son had chicken pox. After a yet another stranger asked how Ollie had been burned, Miss Chandler became determined to find a treatment that would help her son . She stumbled across a cream containing beeswax online, created by a mother who had become frustrated with the medications her daughter had been prescribed. She claims she saw an improvement within weeks . Their GP diagnosed an infection and prescribed antibiotics but the rash got worse and doctors eventually concluded that the tot was suffering with severe eczema. Miss Chandler said: ‘By this stage he was crying all the time because he could not stop scratching and it was very upsetting to see him so distraught.’ But the creams prescribed did little to combat symptoms and Miss Chandler instead turned to keeping her son wrapped in clothing to prevent him from being able to scratch while she tried different lotions. Purepotions has a range called Skin Salvation suitable for eczema sufferers. The products contain beeswax, which the manufacturer claims works as a natural antibacterial barrier, protecting the skin from external irritants. They also contain hemp, which is rich in essential fatty acids which are lacking in those with dry skin. Purepotions claims the products replenish dry skin with natural oils and have no known side effects. The products contains no parabens, preservatives or perfumes, they say. She says she grew self-conscious of people staring when they went out, especially after Ollie had managed to scratch himself during the night. Miss Chandler said: ‘It wasn’t unusual for Ollie to scratch himself until he bled. 'And on top of that, his skin was very dry and flaky and his hair always looked greasy due to all the creams and potions. ‘I was terrified that people would think he was neglected because he looked like such a sorry little thing. ‘I was up most nights online researching and doing everything I could to try and improve his condition.’ She struggled on with numerous creams, but became concerned she was rubbing chemicals into her son’s skin and seeing no improvement. The turning point came in December last year when she took Ollie on a day out to Birmingham on the train. As they took their seats a lady leaned over and with a concerned look asked Miss Chandler how her son’s face had been burned. She said: ‘When I tried to explain that Ollie had not been in a fire and the marks on his face were in fact eczema I felt like I was lying even thought it was the truth. ‘It made me more determined than ever to find something that worked.’ While searching for a cure online she found an article by a mother who had invented her own cream after becoming similarly frustrated with the medications her daughter had been prescribed. Within a few months of applying the cream daily she said the it nearly cured Ollie's eczema . Miss Chandler said: ‘Ollie is so much happier and not scratching anywhere near as much as he did'. He is pictured as a baby . Natalie Balmond had designed Skin Salvation in her kitchen after struggling with her daughter’s condition. Her company Purepotions had sold thousands of bottles and the cream was made available on prescription. When Miss Chandler read Purepotion’s Skin Salvation was available on the NHS she urged her GP to allow her to try it. After a few weeks of applying the cream daily, she claims she began to see an improvement, and has since seen  80 to 90 per cent of the eczema clear up. She said: ‘I am over the moon to have finally found something that works. ‘Ollie is so much happier and not scratching anywhere near as much as he did. ‘Finally he can enjoy being a happy child again and we can go out without people asking what has happened to him.’","Jessica Chandler, 27, was repeatedly asked if her son had been in a fire .

"A woman has written a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways. Sleep-deprived Melbourne based-actor, Lucy Gransbury, even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics. Also a comedian, Gransbury used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief. Gransbury posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Scroll down for video . Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website . 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. 'Last night, like many other nights, it was at 4.30am, a time of morning that should be reserved for breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants,' she said. She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: . 'A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. 'I have genuine concern that this man is: A) not sure how to human B) brain damaged C) actually a moron.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' As the thoughtful neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.

"An angry Christian mother fears her daughter will ‘become a religious minority’ after she was allocated a place at a Sikh school. Kirsty Jarvis said 11-year-old Freya has been looking forward to moving up to secondary school in September. But they have been left ‘shocked and upset’ by the decision by council admissions officers to give her a place at the Khalsa Secondary Academy, despite it not being named as one of her preferred choices. Khalsa Secondary Academy, where Kirsty Jarvis does not want her 11-year-old daughter Freya to go as she would be a 'minority' The Sikh faith school opened in the village of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, last September despite protests from residents. Mrs Jarvis, who lives in the nearby village of Farnham Royal, said most of Freya’s friends have been allocated places at a school in the town of Beaconsfield. ‘We’re a practising Christian family and while we aren’t wanting her to go to a Christian school, my daughter should not be expected to attend a Sikh school,’ said Mrs Jarvis. ‘We knew we were ever so slightly out of the catchment for a number of our first choices but we never thought we would be given Khalsa. ‘In this day and age I could not imagine ever sending my child to a school where she would become a minority. 'Although it’s open to all, each day they take students off for morning prayers and my daughter would not be doing that, and she would, therefore, be taken out and isolated. I’m not sure she would be able to cope with that.’ St Giles Church in Stoke Poges. Khalsa Secondary Academy opened in the village in September . Khalsa Secondary Academy opened with 180 pupils, and aims to build up to 850. The school intends to cater for students from all backgrounds, with ‘50 per cent of places prioritised for non-Sikh students’. Plans to open the school were put forward by Slough Sikh Education Trust in 2013. Khalsa Primary School was already open in Slough, which is just across the border in Berkshire and has a large Sikh population. But the trust said there was no suitable site for the new school in Slough. There was a legal battle over the plans to open the school after people in Stoke Poges protested, saying they were worried about extra traffic and the ‘urbanisation’ of their village. A Buckinghamshire County Council spokesman said: ‘Where we can’t meet any of a parent’s preferences, then the nearest school is allocated. ‘In Mrs Jarvis’s case, Khalsa Academy is the nearest school at 1.771 miles away, although Burnham Park E-Act Academy is the catchment school where there are still places. 'The advice to parents is – accept the place at this point and then appeal for preferred schools.’","Freya Jarvis not happy at being allocated Khalsa Secondary Academy .

"A hapless smuggler who tried sneaking an incredible 146 iPhones through Chinese customs by strapping them to his body was caught after officers spotted him walking strangely. Chan Shih, 30, was found with 126 phones taped around his waist and another 20 around his legs while travelling from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, reports People's Daily Online. A customs spokesman said: 'He appeared to be a big man and was wearing a very loose fitting T-shirt and trousers and had a small carry bag. Caught: Smuggler Chan Shih, 30, with the iPhones he had tried to smuggle into China from Hong Kong . 'But as he moved towards the Nothing to Declare exit officers noticed he was having difficulty with walking and asked him if he was OK. 'He said he had injured his back after falling over but officers were suspicious so asked him to go through a metal detector. 'When it went off he said it was because of his gold bracelet, but when officers searched him they found the phones cellotaped around his stomach. 'Then they found more around his calves.' Cunning plan: He had 126 handsets taped around his waist and another 20 around his legs . The haul from the known smuggler was the biggest ever seized by Chinese customs . The customs official - from Louhu checkpoint in Shenzhen - added that this was not the first time the man had been caught trying to sneak electronic goods onto the mainland, but it was the first time he had been caught with so many. It was also a record in phone smuggling for a single person. The spokesman said: 'This is the fifth time he has been caught smuggling since 2011. 'In total he has tried to bring in 511 iPhones and 127 CPUs, all of which he strapped to parts of his body. 'He needs to think of a new way of doing it as it is getting a bit obvious.'

"A former NFL star and his new bride are calling it quits. Jennifer Conrad has filed papers to end her marriage to Keyshawn Johnson just seven months after she and the wide receiver said 'I do' in an intimate beachfront wedding ceremony. This also comes three months after one man claimed that Johnson was having an affair with his model wife. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Conrad has filed for divorce from former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (above) Johnson played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst . TMZ reports that Conrad claimed the pair separated back in February and is citing irreconcilable differences as the reason behind the split. She is asking for primary custody of the couple's two children, 5 and 2, and notes in the papers that she did sign a prenuptial agreement. Johnson and Conrad's wedding was a four-day celebration that spared no expense last August in Newport Beach, California, with the ceremony taking place at the swank St. Regis hotel. Then, in December, a man came forward alleging Johnson had been having an affair with his wife. Brian Holloway sought an annulment after claiming his wife, Alicia Tarry, was having an affair with Johnson just six months after they were married. Holloway claimed he went through his wife's Twitter direct messages, and found numerous exchanges between her and Johnson, including a request for a graphic nude photo. 'Send me a p**** shot,' one direct message says. 'I'll get one in a few sorry have a guest over,' the other person responds. In December, Brian Holloway sought to annul his six-month marriage to model wife Alicia Tarry (above) saying she was having an affair with Johnson . Tarry says she did not have an affair with Johnson, and that these messages were 'illegally obtained.' Johnson seems to echo this statement, with a source saying he has 'no idea what the guy's talking about.' Johnson, who played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst and enjoy a very brief stint on Dancing With the Stars, is said to still be trying to repair his marriage with Conrad and get her back.","Jennifer Conrad has filed for divorce from former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson .

"Snuggled up together and almost holding hands in their sleep, this is the heart-warming moment twin baby girls were reunited after spending their first six weeks apart as they battled for life. Darcey and Eden Mold, who were born six weeks premature and with holes in their hearts, were immediately placed in separate incubators. Weighing just 4lb 13oz each, they were wired up to a tangle of bleeping monitors, tubes and drips. After weeks of complications and treatments in hospital, the twins were finally well enough to go home and have their first cuddle in a Moses basket, dressed in matching pink sleep suits. Katy Mold, 31, gave birth to twin girls Darcey and Eden (pictured) after going into labour at the 34-week stage of her pregnancy and both girls were born with holes in their hearts - known as congenital heart defects . Parents Katy (pictured left with the twin girls) and David Mold (right), from Sway, Hampshire, have been in and out of Southampton General Hospital after both girls fell unwell after the birth and needed urgent care . Their mother Katy, 31, said yesterday: 'They're both little fighters. They really are both little miracles.' The twins were born just one minute apart in an emergency Caesarean on November 25, after Mrs Mold's waters broke 34 weeks into pregnancy when she choked on a crisp. Eden, who was born second, was immediately whisked away for checks and medication as she had large holes in her heart. Mrs Mold, who was wheeled in her hospital bed to visit the pair in intensive care nine hours after their birth, said: 'Just seeing them so small and so helpless, it was very hard. I couldn't hold them. Mrs Mold gave birth after her waters broke when she choked on a crisp. The girls weighed just 4lbs and 13oz when they were born (pictured) and while Darcey was allowed home straight away, Eden was kept in hospital . As well as being born with large holes in her heart, baby Eden (pictured in hospital) also had a condition which meant she had a narrowing of the aorta and had no septum between the two ventricles of the heart . 'Sitting around watching them in a box was the hardest thing.' But this was only the start of an emotional roller coaster for Mrs Mold, a college secretary, and her husband David, 47, who runs an event management business. When Eden was eight days old, she had to have a six-hour operation to repair narrowing of her aorta, the large blood vessel in the heart, and to have her pulmonary artery 'banded' to reduce blood flow to her lungs. The operation was a success but days later Darcey, who had been allowed to go home because her heart condition was not life-threatening, turned blue and was rushed back to Southampton General Hospital where her sister was recovering. While baby Darcey (pictured) was originally allowed home after birth, she was taken into intensive care just weeks later after being struck down with a severe case of bronchiolitis - a lower respiratory tract infection . Both Eden (left) and Darcey (right) spent six weeks apart while both were cared for on different wards at Southampton General Hospital. They have since been allowed home and are now three-months-old . The girls are pictured enjoying their first cuddle together at just five-days-old. They were later separated for six weeks while Eden received heart surgery and Darcey was cared for in intensive care for a chest infection . Diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a respiratory infection, Darcey spent 12 days sedated and ventilated and had to be given a blood transfusion. Eden was finally well enough to go home on New Year's Eve and Darcey on January 2. They joined their sisters, Matilda, six, and Jemima, nine, at the family home in Sway, Hampshire. Now nearly four months old, the twins are both making a good recovery, although Eden faces further heart surgery this year, when surgeons will patch up the holes in her heart. Mrs Mold said: 'I feel like I have been running on this rollercoaster of adrenaline ever since the birth ... I've been constantly on red alert, worried my children might die. I feel very lucky that both my girls are okay at the moment.' She added: 'Everyone at the hospital was amazing. 'The care we've had has been second to none ... I'm glad they're both better and doing well, we couldn't be prouder.' Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart. The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum. A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD). ASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired. - National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute . The twins, who are now three-months-old, have been recuperating at home with their older sisters, six-year-old Matilda and nine-year-old Jemima. Pictured (from left) Matilda, mother Katy, Jemima, Darcey and Eden .

"Contractors building a highway tunnel under Seattle are preparing to remove the world's largest  boring machine so that it can be repaired. The gigantic drill, known as Bertha, stopped working in December 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two-mile journey to replace the aging Alaska Way, which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake. Its stalling left crews working on the $80million project scrambling to determine how to rescue and repair the five-storey, 2,000-ton drill. But, using its own power, it was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit's opening, and it is now ready to be extracted. Now managers of the project are preparing to show off the cutting head as the refurbishment takes place. Scroll down for video . The machine, known as Bertha, stopped working in December 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two mile trip to replace an aging waterfront highway . Bertha , which weighs around 2,000 tons, was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit's opening . Workers are now preparing to fully extract the gigantic mechanism. It will then be shown off the media . The machine had experienced various mechanical issues, including increased temperatures, before it stalled out . There had been concern that Bertha, buried 120 feet underground, might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues, including increased temperatures, before it stalled out. The machine's breakdown and other construction issues have left the project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles. Supporters, including Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, have said it was important to make sure the corridor project is completed. The original highway overhaul was expected to cost $2 billion and be completed by 2015. The new timeline for replacing the busy Alaskan Way Viaduct, damaged in a 2001 earthquake, is 2017. State transportation officials, contractor Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP), and manufacturer Hitachi Zosen were readying next steps in Bertha's removal and repair, a project spokeswoman said on Friday. 'STP has told us that taking the machine apart and lifting it to the surface will take significant time and effort,' a statement said. Along with mechanical issues, the project has been set back by other concerns. In February, four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed, causing them to fall 25 feet. Two Seattle firefighters walked about a half mile into the State Route 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out. A fifth worker escaped injury, while his four colleagues were taken to Harborview Medical Center, he said. One of the men suffered a fractured arm.

"This is the jaw-dropping moment a group of daredevils walk the tight roped hundreds of metres above the ground between colossal cliffs. On March 6, local and international members of the highlining community ascended Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains, 80 km west of Sydney, for a weekend of death-defying walks at heights between 60 to 100 metres in the air. The past time involves fixing a one-inch thick rope between two mountains and walking in between them, sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever. While most people are confident walking on a rope low to the ground, the mental hurdle of doing so from a heart-stopping height coupled with the environmental variables such as sudden gusts of wind makes it vastly more challenging. Tim Desmond walks a highline at Corroboree Walls in Mount Victoria, Blue Mountains, as part of a highlining meet-up on March 6 . Local and international members of the highlining community ascended on the National Park, 80 km west of Sydney, for a weekend of death-defying walks between the rock faces . Sydney-based electrician Luke Sarantos (pictured) said highlining was the opposite of thrill-seeking: ‘It’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space' But Sydney based electrician Luke Sarantos, who took part in the event, told Daily Mail Australia highlining is the opposite of thrill-seeking. ‘It’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space. In a way it’s like the opposite of thrillseeking.’ Sarantos said the gathering, which was organised on social media, drew in over 70 experienced and novice highliners from across Australia and the world. ‘It went off without a hitch. There were guys from all across Australia, and even some from France and Canada. You can tell the community is gaining traction,’ he said.

Kyle Beall, of the United States, takes a moment to reflect (left), while another daredevil uses an unorthodox method at Corroboree Walls . The meet-up saw seven highlines used ranging from 8 metres 95 metres in length, anchored at heights ranging from 60 metres to 100 metres in the air. But despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights, Sarantos said it is an 'extremely safe sport.' ‘I won’t get on a skateboard or even play football because I find those are too dangerous. Every safety mechanism in highlining has a backup and you can’t physically fall on to anything off the line.’ Highlining is an extreme form of slackroping which sees participants walk between two anchor points set up with enormous elevation from the ground or water, sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever .

Tim Desmond hangs from a highline after falling off. Sarantos said there have never been any deaths resulting from highlining . He claims he has never witnessed a significant injury and there have never any deaths in the sport. Sarantos said he has been highlining for about four years, and while it’s easy to pick the sport up, it becomes increasingly difficult once you progress beyond a novice level. ‘Once you reach ropes 60 metres in length or more, it gets incredibly difficult,’ he said. Safety is paramount with numerous safety harnesses and procedures used to maintain a well measured and safe environment . The crowd of 70 that gathered for the event shared a similar passion for adventure and the outdoors .","On March 6, local and international members of the highlining community ascended on the Blue Mountains .

"No good deed goes unpunished as exemplified by the alleged beating to death of an elderly man on Wednesday by three people he'd helped in the past. Cincinnati man Carl Engel, 73, was found dead at his St. Bernard home with multiple blows to his head and his body. Police say that suspects James T. Kirby Jr. 22, Mario Demarcus Lewis, 26, broke into Engels home in attempt to burglarize it on Saturday night as Chasidy Nicole Brewer, 20, acted as a lookout across the street. Scroll down for video . Suspects: James T. Kirby Jr. (left) 22, Mario Demarcus Lewis (center), 26, allegedly  broke into Engels home in attempt to burglarize it on Saturday night as Chasidy Nicole Brewer (right), 20, acted as a lookout . WLWT reports that the men broke into Engel's front basement window to search his home for cash and values when Engel interrupted them. That's when the alleged beating occurred. Kirby allegedly assaulted him from the top of the stairs and into the kitchen. Kirby has been charged with aggravated burglary, aggravated murder and tampering with evidence. All three suspects have been arrested before and are being held at Hamilton County Jail where bond was set at $1.25 million for each of them. Cincinnati.com reports that the suspects were identified on Saturday night when police saw them attempting to destroy evidence at St. Mary’s Cemetery. Murdered: Carl Engel was discovered beaten to death in his home on Sunday and was known to help his friends and neighbors just because they needed it . Three days before Engel's death, Kirby allegedly broke into the home and took cash. A neighbor called police on Sunday after they saw the basement window broken and they didn't hear from Engel. When police arrived, he was dead. Engel worked for the village's service department for over 30 years. He has a son, a daughter, and two grandchildren. Neighbors told WCPO that Englel was the kind of man who would help other people in need. They said the killing was a chilling occurrence for the neighborhood. The scene: The three suspects allegedly broke into Carl Engel's home several times and on Saturday night beat him to death when he discovered their antics .

"To the untrained eye it may appear to be nothing more than an unfinished DIY project, but this is in fact a rare work by abstract artist Mark Rothko - which is set to sell for £35million. The painting, No. 36 (Black Stripe) has never appeared at auction before but is seen as one of Rothko's seminal works and has featured in every major museum exhibition about the artist. Rothko is widely regarded as being one of the most important American post-war artists, alongside Jackson Pollock, and this work was completed in 1958 at the height of his influence. Rare: This work by Mark Rothko, No. 36 (Black Stripe), has not been on the market for 30 years and auctioneers expect a bidding war when it goes under the hammer in New York in May . As with most Rothko artworks, the canvas is massive, measuring 5ft 7in by 5ft 2in, and features three rectangles of red, black and orange layered over a red background. The piece is from the collection of the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, Germany, one of Europe's most important and prestigious private museums for contemporary art. Painted by Rothko at the height of his influence in 1958, it is viewed as one of the seminal works by one of America's greatest post-war artists . Enthusiast Frieder Burda acquired the painting more than 30 years ago but has decided to sell it to expand his collection. It will be on view top the public in Hong Kong and London before being offered at auction at Christie's in New York on May 13, where the auctioneers expect a bidding war. Frieder Burda said: 'The decision to part with a work from my collection has been very carefully considered and hasn't been easy for someone like myself who has a very personal relationship with all works of the collection. 'No. 36 (Black Stripe) by Mark Rothko is an exceptional work, a solitaire within the collection from which it is hard to separate.' Brett Gorvy from Christie's said: 'Painted in 1958, this vibrant, powerful and deeply emotive painting was created during Mark Rothko's most influential and acclaimed period. 'Here the artist has arrived at a new structural language of color that was to define his most famous body of works, The Seagram Murals, painted at the same time and which today constitute the celebrated Rothko Room at the Tate Modern, London. 'No. 36 (Black Stripe) is the quintessential Rothko - orange, black and red - passion and blood. This 1961 Rothko, entitled Orange, Red, Yellow, sold for almost £58million when it was auctioned at Christie's in New York in 2012, setting a new record for the artist's work . This Rothko painting is entitled Mural No. 4 and formed part of the artist's famous Seagram Murals set . 'This is the first time that the painting has been on the market for thirty years and we are sure to see a bidding war at the auction in May for this extremely rare and universally enticing work, especially with such a prestigious provenance and exhibition history.' Born in Dvinsk in Russia, he emigrated with his family to Portland, Oregon, in 1913. He was an art student at Yale until 1923, and moved to New York two years later where he began his career. Despite his successful and highly acclaimed career, Rothko was a life-long sufferer of depression, and killed himself in 1970 at the age of 66.","Painting No. 36 (Black Stripe) has been in private collection for 30 years .

"Authorities say a crash that killed two adults and two small children was no accident, but a murder-suicide. On Dec. 23 Ulysses Montero, 25, was driving with his girlfriend Julie Lopez-Elias, 24, and two of their three children Julissa Montero, 4, and five-day-old Delias Montero when the vehicle crashed into a retention pond in Kissimmee, Florida, WFTV reports. Though the crash was initially believed to be an accident, an autopsy report declared Montero's manner of death a suicide and the others' homicides. Purposely: Police say Ulysses Montero (left) purposely drove a vehicle carrying his girlfriend Julie Lopez-Elias (right) and two of their children into a retention pond in December 2014 . Stacie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Kissimmee Police Department, told the Orlando Sentinel that the medical examiner determined there was no indication that Montero suffered a 'medical episode' prior to the crash. 'It was determined that the driver had physical control of the vehicle prior to entering the pond and that his actions were deliberate and not accidental,' she said. A mechanic determined the car did not have mechanical deficiencies, police say, and video evidence of the crash shows no other vehicles were involved in the incident, WFTV reports. The medical examiner determined that Lopez-Elias and the two children died from drowning. Children: Two of the couple's children, Julissa Montero, 4, (photographed) and five-day-old Delias Montero were in the vehicle at the time, both died from drowning .

"Harrowing audio and video footage has revealed the moment a drunk Texas student was shot dead by a police officer during a traffic stop. Cameron Redus, a student at University of the Incarnate Wood, was killed by Corporal Christopher Carter outside his San Antonio, Texas, apartment on December 6, 2013. The officer's microphone captures the 23-year-old accusing Carter of trying to sexually assault him and calling him pathetic. His last words are: 'You are going to shoot me?' Carter told Redus to stop 29 times and asked him to put his hands behind his back 20 times. Scroll down for video . Cameron Redus (left) can be heard calling officer Christopher Carter (right) pathetic and accusing him of sexual assault before he was shot dead outside his San Antonio apartment on December 6, 2013 . He ignores repeated requests by Carter to stop and put his hands on the hood of the patrol car. Carter, who resigned from from the University of Incarnate Word police force after the shooting, has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing after a Bexar (BAYR) County grand jury decided not to indict him on Wednesday,KENS 5 reported. Redus had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was pulled over. His family contend that his son did make some mistakes that night, but they did not warrant the severity of the response. An autopsy conducted in March last year revealed all of the five shots fired by Carter were at close range. In the build-up Carter is heard on the audio repeatedly telling Redus to 'stay right there'. The front-facing camera in Carter's car was not working at the time, so all you can see is the back seats of his patrol car. Moments later Carter is heard telling Redus to step back before firing six bullets (scene pictured) You can hear Redus telling the officer he is scared and during the pat down says: 'Are you going to rape me right now?' Carter then tells him to put his hands behind his back as he is under arrest. The struggle then heats up as the pair fight for control. At one point Redus accuses the officer of choking him. He then tells Carter: 'You are pathetic. Are you going to shoot me if I don't stop?' 'Is that what cops do? They shoot people.' All the while Carter keeps telling Redus to stop, but he refuses to listen. Redus then says: 'You piece of s***'. Carter then fires six shots at close range, killing Redus. The student's family have said he was never aggressive or confrontational but, according to Corporal Carter, Cameron tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically. Redus' family contends that even though he made some mistakes that night, he did not deserve the aggressive response by Corporal Carter . His parents, Mickey and Valerie Redus, and their other sons, released a statement last year saying they were 'devastated' by the autopsy findings. 'We are stunned to learn that Cameron was . shot in the back from very close range. The report also shows that the . shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle, again from very close . range,' they wrote. 'That knowledge, coupled with information from the earlier police . report indicating that Cameron died on his back with his legs underneath . him, has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core.' The family added that they did not . condone his decision to drive while under the influence, but said they . were 'thankful' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on . the night in question. They added: 'Cameron’s mistakes do not negate the . amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving, encouraging and . compassionate person that he was. 'While mistakes do bear consequences, . the extreme and brutal results of Cameron’s encounter with Officer . Carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes.' The University of Incarnate Wood said they have fully supported the decision to release the audio tape of the confrontation. Following Carter's clearance by a grand jury, the school's management said in a release that they hope the recording will 'put to rest much of the misinformation disseminated by persons characterizing the recording.' They reveal that during the recording, you will hear Carter say: . 'Put your hands behind your back' – 20 times. 'Stop resisting' – 25 times . 'Stop' or 'Stop it' – 29 times . 'Stop or I will shoot you' – 5 times . 'You are under arrest'/'being arrested'/'resisting arrest' – 3 times. The last statements made by Cpl. Carter to Mr. Redus are: 'Stop, stop, stop, stop, get back, get back!' (Source: Beirne, Maynard and Parsons, LLP)","Cameron Redus, 23, was killed by Christopher Carter on December 6, 2013 .

"They are often seen as a healthy alternative to breakfast or chocolate treats, but it seems cereal bars may be better suited to the confectionery aisle. Research by Which? found that some cereal bars – including those aimed at children – contain more than 40 per cent sugar. The consumer group analysed the amount of sugar in 15 leading bars and breakfast biscuits and found many of them were not as healthy as most would think. Scroll down for video . Which? survey found Kellogg’s Coco Pops Snack Bar, which contains 42% sugar, was the worst offender . Kellogg’s Strawberry Nutri-Grain bars contain 31% whole grain cereal, but are also made up of 33% sugar . The worst offender was Kellogg’s Coco Pops Snack Bar which contained 42 per cent sugar. Other bars marketed at children, such as the popular Choc Chip Harvest Chewee Milk, were also high in sugar and saturated fat. And while Kellogg’s Strawberry Nutri-Grain Fruit Breakfast Bars contain 31 per cent whole grain cereal, they were found to be made up of 33 per cent sugar. Which? is now calling for clear nutrition labelling on the front of all packs to alert consumers to the amount of sugar they contain. Its executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s worrying that cereal bars, especially those aimed at children or claiming to be healthy, contain so much sugar but most don’t make this clear on the front of the pack. ‘We now want the Government to tackle this issue head on by making sure all manufacturers use traffic light nutrition labelling, encouraging reductions in sugar, fat and salt and ensuring manufacturers promote their products responsibly.’ The study found only one of the products, Mars’s Tracker Bar, had the ‘traffic light’ nutrition labelling making it clear to the buyer that the bars are high in sugar and fat. Only the Mars Tracker Bar (pictured) had the ‘traffic light’ nutrition labelling making it clear to buyers that the bars are high in sugar and fat .

Now, friends of the family are opening up about the incident in an interview with People, revealing that Ashton spent every day after the incident at his brother's bedside and was in a complete state of shock that someone would murder his parents. Scroll down for video .

'He would cry and say, ""Landon is 8 years old and he doesn’t have a dad,""' said Sarah Verbeek, a former girlfriend. 'He'd say, ""I can't believe somebody killed my parents.""' Ruth Briscoe, one of Andra's childhood friends, said that the first time she saw the young man after the tragedy; 'He collapsed on me crying. It was pretty powerful.' Ashton, who had no previous run-ins with the law, was arrested in March 2014 after police determined he was the 'lone suspect' in the murder. The found a semi-automatic in his car and phone records placed him in the area around the time. What still remains a mystery however is why he did it, especially to those who knew the young man. 'I don't have a reason why. Just a lot of problems,' Ashton initially told authorities. 'He never showed any signs of aggression or threatened to hurt someone,' said Verbeek. 'He wasn't that kid seen on TV crime documentaries that secludes himself and doesn't talk to anyone. He never spoke bad about his family. He never talked about guns. Nothing.' Two weeks after the shooting, Ashton and his brother Myles (right) filed for custody of their adopted siblings . It all happened in this home outside San Diego, California . In fact, many seem to think that only thing that is off-putting is how he behaved in the days after the incident. 'He talked about how he loved his parents,' said Andra's sister Lesley Summers. ''He said he'd had a dream that they weren't dead, and they drove up and Andra said, ""Bullets can't kill us.""'

Ashton drove 18 hours straight from Seattle to his family's $2.5million luxury home on February 9, 2013, and said he spent 15 minutes pacing outside his parents' bedroom deciding what to do before killing them.

"A man accused of stabbing a 17-year-old girl to death in a Melbourne park allegedly went on a violent crime rampage in the hours before he handed himself into police. Sean Christian Price, who has been charged with Masa Vukotic’s murder, has also been charged with six other offences including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking. On Thursday night the 31-year-old, from Albion, west Melbourne, faced an out-of-sessions court hearing, charged with murder after the teen’s brutal killing on Tuesday night. His alleged crime spree on Thursday morning ended just moments before he handed himself in at Sunshine Police station at around 11.30am. Price was remanded in custody overnight and will appear at the Melbourne Magistrate’s Court Friday morning. Scroll down for video . A man in his 20s, identified as Sean Price, arrived at St Kilda police station in handcuffs (centre) and a blue forensic suit, flanked by homicide detectives . The man stuck up his middle finger and smiled as he arrived at St Kilda Police Station . Masa Vukotic, 17, was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she was walking on a footpath near her Doncaster home - in Melbourne's east . The Canterbury Girls' Secondary College student was a fan of the Lolita trend, which is popular in Japan . Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia that along with Ms Vukotic’s murder Price has also been charged for the alleged physical and sexual assault of a woman and the assault and robbery of a 26-year-old man. Both alleged victims were taken to hospital. Price has also been charged with attempting to carjack a vehicle belonging to a 77-year-old man in Sunshine in Melbourne's West. Price put on a show of defiance as he was driven into a Melbourne police station to answer questions about the murder of Vukotic on Thursday afternoon. The man stuck up his middle finger and smiled as he arrived at St Kilda Police Station. On Thursday afternoon, he wore a forensic jumpsuit and was in handcuffs as he arrived at the police station to be he questioned over Tuesday night's fatal stabbing in the affluent suburb of Doncaster. Price handed himself into police around 11.30am just hours after detectives released CCTV of a man wearing a red T-shirt boarding a bus minutes after the attack. Homicide squad detective Inspector Michael Hughes said the man was known to police but had no connection to Ms Vukotic. Det Insp Hughes was unable to provide further information on the man as he was entitled to the due process but added the suspect had not been drug affected. He would not comment on whether or not a weapon had been found on the suspect. Det Insp Hughes thanked the public for their assistance that led to the arrest. Police are still investigating whether he has any links to the area where Ms Vukotic died, since the park is not easy to find. 'He was in the area. Was he there for sinister purposes? I don't know,' the detective said. 'We'll probably find out there is a connection to that location.' Police were no longer looking for any other suspect, Det Insp Hughes said. Police say the man is known to them and there is no one else they are looking for in relation to Masa's death . He also smiled while flanked by detectives as he drove past television cameras . A man in his 20s from Albion - in Melbourne's west - allegedly seen in CCTV footage has been arrested . The breakthrough came after it emerged the suspect allegedly asked a man for directions near to where Ms Vukotic was found. This comes after friends and family of the girl - who was known affectionately as 'Marci' - paid tearful tributes on Wednesday. Her boyfriend Tim Draper was accompanied by a friend as he knelt down and left a message among the growing pile of flowers and tributes left for his murdered girlfriend at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve. He broke down in tears as the friend tried to console him. The heartbreaking letter began with: 'My dear love, you will always be in my heart', The Age reported. 'I know you're up there looking down and weeping. But please, my dear, holster those tears,' the letter read. Boyfriend Tim Draper broke down as he knelt to leave his tribute and was comforted by a friend at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve . The boyfriend of Masa Vukotic made an emotional tribute to his girlfriend following her death in Melbourne . Family and friends gathered at the scene where Masa tragically murder on Wednesday to leave tributes . 'I will always be with you and you know that to be true. I love you, my dear, and I always will remember you. Love from your lover, Tim.' The pair had only been dating for month before Ms Vukotic was brutally murdered, but they had been friends for a while. 'She was a really smart and caring person, and she was a really caring person to me,' Tim told Daily Mail Australia. The young man also paid tribute to Ms Vukotic, writing: 'I love you Maša Vukotic And i will always keep you in a special place in my heart. you rest easy now xxx [sic].' The 17-year-old was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she exercising. Victoria Police said she may not have even heard her attacker as she had headphones on at the time. A friend's note is attached to flowers at the site. The letter from 'Pippa' said Masa would be 'forever in my heart' Tributes for the teenager continued to flow at the scene of Masa's murder in Doncaster . Friends were seen kneeling by the flowers and messages, and silently remembering her . They comforted each other after news broke that a man was in police custody following the murder . Detectives said the suspect had got on at Doncaster Road near the park at 7.09pm before getting off near the intersection of Hoddle Street and Johnston Street at Abbotsford. He was captured carrying what looked to be a white plastic bag, which could possibly have carried the murder weapon. A witness who was allegedly stopped by the suspect said he appeared nervous and seemed like he knew the answer to the question about directions. 'It was almost like he was trying to, I guess, lessen his suspicion,' Inspector Hughes told ABC radio earlier on Thursday. He added they were also looking to get their hands on records from myki - the smart card ticketing system used in Melbourne. It comes as friends of the murdered Canterbury Girls Secondary College student paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci'. 'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. On Wednesday night, more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found. 'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said. 'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.' Friends of the murdered Canterbury Girls Secondary College student paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci' The 17-year-old student had a flair for dressing up. Her friends said the world would 'certainly become a darker place without her' Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro . 'She inspired myself and so many others to love ourselves and be confident in who we are. She never missed a moment to remind her friends that she thought they were wonderful.' Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion. Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro. Her distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park following news of her death. Photos of Masa show her smiling while travelling in Italy and her pet rabbit, Roger . The 17-year-old's body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene. She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene. Earlier on in the investigation, police released CCTV footage of a man running from the crime scene carrying a plastic bag and arrested a man who allegedly matched that description on Wednesday afternoon. But he was released after being questioned and is no longer a suspect. Ms Vukotic has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer. 'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said. 'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.' Her friends are organising a memorial picnic at Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne on March 28 to be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'. She was murdered at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve near her Doncaster home . Tributes started flowing for the girl on Wednesday, with strangers even leaving their condolences . An emotional woman places flowers as a child looks on at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve . She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her . They are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japapese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related'. 'Marci needs to be remembered - her name needs to be known. She was an amazing influence on so many lives,' they said. 'She was an absolutely gorgeous girl and without fail would always make me laugh or smile,' said a friend. 'I can only wish her self confidence and will to learn inspires others and her memories live on for the years to come.' The friends shared photos of Ms Vukotic with a bright smile on her face as she dressed up for 'Cosplay', where people dress up as fictional characters for conventions.

"Passengers have been told by rail companies not to travel by train this Easter as the closure of major routes will cause chaos. Beleaguered travellers have been warned that ‘Easter is cancelled’ as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: ‘Easter is effectively cancelled – our line is shut. We’re advising people not to travel. ‘What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.’ Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the £100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: ‘There’s a spanner in the works. Don’t get caught in planned improvement works.’ It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: ‘There won’t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.’ Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will ‘severely reduce services to the North and Scotland’, it said. Services are also likely to be ‘extra busy the day before and after affected days’ and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an £81million programme from Network Rail ‘to improve the ageing infrastructure’. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter – such as through the summer – to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: ‘We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.’ He insisted that there were ‘good contingency plans in place’ while the improvements are carried out.","Virgin tells passengers to avoid travelling on West Coast main line .

"The body ex-Royal Marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield who was killed fighting against Islamic State was given a hero's welcome by hundreds of Kurds at Manchester Airport today. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, became the first Briton to be killed fighting the terror group in Syria when he was brought down by mortar fire on March 2. He was with Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria, and his body was repatriated today. Scroll down for video . Hero's welcome: The body of ex-marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was repatriated to Manchester today . Emotional: The mourners, many in tears, paid tribute to the ex-marine - known as Kosta to his comrades - and threw flowers at his coffin as it passed . Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Mr Scurfield's body was flown to Manchester because the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), who he was fighting alongside, has a large base in the city. The mourners, many in tears, paid tribute to the ex-marine - known as Kosta to his comrades - and threw flowers at his coffin as it passed. There were shouts of 'martyr' and 'hero' from the crowd, many of whom carried his picture. His mother Vasliki said she was proud of the her son for standing up for the freedom of Kurdish people in Syria. 'Although he did not die fighting for a British cause he died representing British values,' she said. Hozen Kasen, a prominent member of PYD in Manchester, added: 'We are very proud that Konstandinos Erik Scurfield went to represent us in a plight that was not his own. 'He is not just a Kurdish hero but a humanitarian hero and will go down in history as such.' Welcomed home: There were shouts of 'martyr' and 'hero' from the crowd, many of whom carried his picture . Honoured: Mr Scurfield, 25, was described as a Kurdish and humanitarian hero who will go down in history . Proud: His mother Vasliki said she was proud of the her son for standing up for the freedom of Kurdish people in Syria . Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner who organised the event, told MailOnline: 'The mood was one of great admiration for this man who had fought alongside the Kurdish struggle out in Syria. 'We wanted to be there to welcome him home and pay our respects. I felt it necessary to acknowledge his return and his sacrifice. 'This is Kosta returning today, but we are seeing funerals every day in Rojava.' Last week, Mr Scurfield's body was returned to his family at a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border, attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds. His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father Chris and uncle. Swarmed: Crowds mobbed the vehicle carrying the ex-marine's body and threw flowers as his coffin passed . Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine . Hozen Kasen, a prominent member of PYD in Manchester, said: 'We are very proud that Konstandinos Erik Scurfield went to represent us in a plight that was not his own' Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said.The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. Mr Scurfield has been described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East'. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. His family, including his archaeologist parents and student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death, they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' Mr Scurfield, 25, became the first Briton to be killed fighting the terror group in Syria when he was brought down by mortar fire on March 2 .

The former Royal Marine's body was handed over to his father and uncle in a coffin which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack. Soldiers turned out for the ceremony on the Syria-Iraqi border last week . Earlier this week, Mr Scurfield's mother told a reception in Parliament: 'Let's stop standing by and let's instead think creatively about grinding down and putting out the biggest threat to the world since the Nazis. 'Kosta was not a mercenary, he wasn't an out of work soldier looking for an adventure or something to do to pass the time. 'And although this is not the way that many of us would have had him choose, it is the way he considered best for him and I'm proud of him for finding the courage to do this.' Mrs Scurfield urged governments and media across the world to 'shine a spotlight' on ISIS and to name and shame all organisations and states supporting them in any way. She added: ""He was a small drop in an ocean but he has caused big ripples."" Mr Scurfield's body will  be taken to Leicester where a post-mortem examination will be carried out.","Ex-Marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was brought down by mortar fire .

"The Labour Party has received donations totalling almost £600,000 from a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager whose identity officials have tried to keep secret, it emerged last night. Martin Taylor has been unveiled as the benefactor who has given the Labour Party donations totalling £591,800 since 2012 – making him the party's fourth-largest donor. Ed Miliband has had at least one private meeting with him. Labour leader Ed Miliband has had at least one private meeting with multi-millionaire hedge fund manager Martin Taylor, who has been unveiled as the benefactor who has been giving Labour Party donations of £591,800 since 2012 . The Labour leader has previously attacked the Conservatives for being 'the party of Mayfair hedge funds' – yet Mr Taylor's firm is based in the same exclusive area of London. Labour has promised to be open about its financial supporters. But the party faced accusations last night that it had repeatedly failed to identify Mr Taylor. Labour has promised to be open about its financial supporters. But the party faced accusations last night that it had repeatedly failed to identify Mr Taylor . A Liberal Democrat peer suspended himself from the party last night, amid claims the Lib Dems had accepted another potentially illegal donation. The party reportedly took cash from a journalist posing as a businessman who registered the donation as coming from his stepfather. The Electoral Commission is now investigating the matter, as using a relation as a proxy is not permitted. A Lib Dem spokesman said Lord Strasburger – recorded discussing the donation in a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation – denied wrongdoing. The peer insisted he had 'committed no offence' but added: 'I have resigned the whip ... until the investigation is completed.' Prospective candidate Ibrahim Taguri stood down earlier this month following claims he had told an undercover reporter how to make a donation that would not be declared publicly. The Times reported that it first asked Labour about his identity several months ago. Parties are required to identify all donors who have given more than £7,500. But because only the name of the donors are published, it can be difficult to identify individuals with a common name such as Taylor. Yesterday, under further pressure from newspapers, Labour issued a statement from Mr Taylor which identified him as a hedge fund millionaire. The donor said: 'There is no mystery. This 'Martin Taylor' is me. I am a born and bred Londoner, who also happens to be a hedge fund manager. And I am proud to support the Labour Party.' The 46-year-old runs a fund for Nevsky Capital and at one point was in charge of more than £2billion of funds. He said his support reflected a belief that 'everyone should contribute to society and that those who are lucky enough to earn a lot should contribute more'. Mr Taylor is domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that the revelation exposed Labour to a charge of hypocrisy and the party should detail all donations. Last night a Labour spokesman said: 'We are grateful to people from all walks of life who support the Labour Party and our better plan.'","One of Labour's biggest private donors is hedge fund boss Martin Taylor .

"Terrifying new reports have revealed that farmers in New Zealand have been sent letters which threaten to contaminate baby formula, in an apparent protest against the use of pesticides. Sent anonymously to Federation Farmers and Fonterra in November, the letters also included small packages of milk powder which were laced with concentrated 1080 poison, according to the NZ Herald. Detailed in the letters were threats claiming that if New Zealand didn't stop using poison 1080 - a chemical used in pesticides - by the end of March the senders would contaminate baby and other formulas. Letters sent to Federation Farmers in New Zealand last November contained threats to contaminate baby formula with poison 1080 . Police are now appealing for the public's help in catching the letter senders. They launched their investigation in November, headed up by an Auckland-based team called Operation Concord and involving up to 36 police officers. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key has described the attack as a 'form of ecoterrorism'. 'Police have advised there is a low likelihood of the threat being carried out, but because of the nature of it, both the police and ministers have taken the treat seriously,' Mr Key said in a press conference in Parliament according to the NZ Herald. He also added that testing through each step of the supply chain was carried out before the public was notified of the potential threat. Mike Clement, Police Deputy Commissioner of National Operations said the threat needed to be treated in a serious matter despite that fact it could be a hoax. Mr Clement urged the person, or people, responsible for the distribution of the letters to make themselves known to police. 'The letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted,' Mr Clement said. No specific brand was targeted and officials say they are certain no formulas are currently contaminated . Ministry for Primary Industries Deputy Director General Scott Gallagher said he was sure that New Zealand baby and other formula was still safe despite the threats. 'This criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a domestic policy outcome,' Mr Gallagher also said. He also confirmed that there is currently no 1080 poison in any baby formula. Mr Clement urged people to check packets for any signs of tampering or interference after 'this criminal blackmail threat', and said that no particular brand had been targeted. As officials have been aware of the threat since last November, they are positive that there is currently no danger of contamination and in fact formulas are safer than ever due to stricter screening and control. Global dairy company Fonterra said the whole industry is onside with the investigation, ready to assist police and government officials. Chief executive Theo Spierings revealed the news of the threat made him 'quite angry.'","Threats to poison baby formula have been made to farmers .

"Bats are often associated with vampires, caves and other dark, creepy or dingy imagery. But this adorable little fruit bat wolfing down a banana is bound to change your perception. Filmed by Denise, a lady who rescues and cares for fruit bats, the video shows a much sweeter side of what is usually considered a rather spooky animal. Hungry fellow: The tiny fruit bat calms down completely when it spies a banana . The bat appears to pull hilarious facial expressions as it tucks into the fruit snack . Munching on the banana, the wide-eyed bat looks extremely excited as it fills its mouth before lifting its head back in satisfaction. Going in for another bite with even more enthusiasm, the bat opens its mouth as wide as it can and stuffs its face once more. Looking at the camera while it finishes its mouthful, the bat takes one last big bite of the banana and uses its pointed tongue to help shovel down the food. Before lifting its head one last time as if completely full and entirely satisfied. According to Storyful, an abundance of rainfall in Brisbane, Australia in recent weeks has resulted in food supplies becoming scarce - as a result, this bat was rescued by a lady called Nanette. At one point the bat is even seen poking its tongue out as it makes sure it has eaten every last morsel . Denise is among the people rescuing the bats from fruit netting during the poor weather. Referencing the video, Denise said the fruit bat was initially a little feisty until it spied the banana. After that he was happy once and began stuffing his face with the food – as is seen in the video. There's no need to be scared of these bats judging by the adorable rescue animal at Denise's shelter . Denise told MailOnline: 'Rain is good news for the coming winter but it's not such good news for hungry bat bellies. 'Although there is a magnificent array of native flowering occurring, rain washes the nectar and pollen out of the blossom and flying-foxes are forced to seek sustenance elsewhere. 'As a result we get an increased number of calls for bats trapped in large aperture fruit tree netting during and after rain events.' Denise added: 'Please net, grow and harvest sustainably. Never use any netting you can poke your finger through and use shadecloth or a similar weave to protect your fruit. Even better still, take what you need and share the rest with our wildlife.'","The bat is wide-eyed in excitement as it munches on the banana .

"Scottish Labour MPs are defying Ed Miliband by telling voters on the doorstep they would not support a post-election deal with the SNP. In an indication of a growing split in the party over its election strategy, several MPs are indicating that they would not be prepared to back any arrangement with Scottish Nationalists after May. Some are even said to be threatening to quit the party rather than be part of an administration propped up by the SNP, which wants to break up the UK. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing a rebellion in Scotland over his plan to do a post-election deal with the SNP . Despite pressure from shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Miliband has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the votes of SNP MPs to enable a Labour government to take power if he fails to win a Commons majority. There is rising Labour panic at polls suggesting the Scottish Nationalists are heading for a landslide victory north of the border – picking up dozens of MPs at the expense of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The latest suggest that the SNP could win as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 seats, including Labour strongholds currently held by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling. That would mean Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond holding the balance of power at Westminster, threatening a constitutional crisis. One Scottish Labour MP said: ‘Labour MPs on the doorstep are saying “if you vote for us we won’t do a deal with the SNP”. The group are united. I’m not aware of a colleague who is advocating against that position.’ Another MP said: ‘There’s no prospect of any deal with the SNP and I’m making that clear on the doorstep. ‘But I don’t want to be focusing on the issue of deals, and I understand why it hasn’t been ruled out [by Mr Miliband]. We would end up getting diverted into a campaign that’s all about deals, rather than our key message which is that we can have a Labour majority government.’ In constituencies where there was a strong No vote in last year’s independence referendum, or where there are large numbers of middle-class Scots who traditionally vote Lib Dem or Tory, Labour’s candidates are now telling people on the doorstep there will be no pact with the SNP. The move – in defiance of Mr Miliband’s official stance - is designed to encourage tactical voting towards Labour. But in more working-class areas such as the west of Scotland where the independence campaign performed better, MPs fear ruling out a deal could make voters leaning towards the Nationalists ‘more bloody-minded’. Ian Davidson, Labour chairman of the Commons Scottish affairs committee ruled out a deal with the SNP . Ian Davidson, the Labour chairman of the Commons Scottish affairs committee, is among those who insists any deal with the SNP is ‘simply not credible’. ‘They are simply not trustworthy,’ he said. Three other Labour candidates told the Daily Mail a deal should not be ruled out, but several others have insisted it should be formally rejected. One politician said there is strong evidence on the doorsteps that Tory and LibDem supporters are ‘considering voting Labour for the first time to stop the SNP’. “We have to squeeze Tory and LibDem voters and tell them that we won’t be dealing with the SNP,” the MP said. “But I do understand why some MPs don’t want us to rule it out. People who are thinking of voting SNP might see it as belligerent nonsense. If the LibDems were somehow heading for 50 seats, we wouldn’t be pressed to rule out a deal with them. ‘People are split. People know there’s a problem with ruling it out, but there’ s also a problem if we don’t.’ At last weekend’s Scottish Labour conference in Edinburgh, Mr Miliband ducked the question haunting his election campaign and failed to rule out a deal with the SNP. He repeated the line that a vote for the SNP makes it more likely David Cameron will return to Number Ten, which has so far failed to impress Scots voters. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has upped pressure on the Labour leader by ruling his party out of any government involving the SNP. ‘Our view is that, in the same way we would not countenance putting Ukip in charge of the EU, we would not countenance putting the SNP in charge of a country that they want to rip apart. It’s as simple as that,’ the Liberal Democrat leader said. That was seen as a rebuke to Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, who has mused publicly on the idea of a Lib-Lab-SNP coalition. Yesterday, Labour’s biggest private donor suggested that working with the Tories would be preferable to a deal with the SNP. ‘If you look at what’s happened in Germany and other countries where grand coalitions have happened, they have been reasonably successful,’ businessman John Mills said. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘Labour are all over the place. The polls show a majority of Scots want SNP MPs providing a strong Scottish voice in Westminster.’ Last night former Labour welfare minister Frank Field warned the party leadership that a Labour-SNP deal could lead to a breakaway ‘English Labour Party’.","Ed Miliband is facing a rebellion north of the border over SNP deal .

Scroll down for video . Career change: Rob O'Neill (left and right in Liberia), the former Navy SEAL who is said to have shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, has been hired by Fox News as a contributor . He is said to have fired the shots that killed the Al Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind during a raid on his compound in May 2011. Chairman and CEO for the network Roger Ailes said: 'Rob O’Neill is an American hero who dedicated his life to serving our country and protecting our freedoms. 'It’s incredibly rare to have someone in a television contributor role with his leadership experience and expertise at the fighting unit level. 'His military insight will be a major asset to the network and we are honored to have him.

O'Neill was with his team in Miami for diving training in 2011 when he and a several other senior SEALs got the call to deploy for a special mission. At first, military officials only gave the team a vague understanding of the mission, leading them to believe they were going to Libya to capture Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi since it was around the time of the Arab Spring. But eventually it dawned on the team that they could be after a much bigger target, someone who had evaded capture for nearly a decade. The team was trained for the mission on a replica of the Abbottabad compound where it was believed bin Laden was hiding. O'Neill called the team the 'Martyr's brigade' and that nearly everyone wrote letters home to their family, believing they wouldn't be coming home.","Decorated veteran will be a contributor providing military expertise .

"Labour would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, Tristram Hunt said . A Labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, the party’s education spokesman has said. Tristram Hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an ‘avalanche of bureaucracy’ and increase confidence in the regulation process. The proposals, which would result in Ofsted taking a less hands-on approach, could be a reality by 2020 if Labour was elected, he said. Mr Hunt acknowledged that the regulator had been a vehicle for progress, but said it was beginning to ‘choke something far more precious’, and threaten the ‘joy’ of schooling. Speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Liverpool, he said: ‘We can begin the process of “mass devolution” where important powers over professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development and peer review are handed over to profession-led bodies – and we will. ‘Ofsted needs to move towards a supportive, light-touch, profession-led, centrally moderated, peer review system of inspection. ‘I want this conference to hold me to account for moving towards it over the course of the next Parliament.’ The proposals would see teachers and head teachers helping to assess the performance of other schools. Scroll down for video . Ofsted would regulate this process, although the details of how the system would work have not been finalised. Mr Hunt said: ‘Let nobody tell you this is a soft touch. Let nobody tell you this is a threat to standards. Rather this is the embodiment of trust, collaboration and a 21st-century approach to rigour and under-performance.’ The proposals would see teachers and headteachers helping to assess the performance of other schools (file picture) He added: ‘I want to see an inspectorate that moves beyond box-ticking and data-dependence. ‘I want to see an inspectorate that allows heads with a strong track record the space to innovate and develop a richer criterion of school achievement.’ Priya Dutta, spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘The system needs an overhaul, and in general we would welcome proposals for this. ‘But the problem with peer review is that it’s so open to abuse. ‘We would be sceptical about how impartial this peer review would be, so these things would need to be planned very carefully. ‘I’m slightly wary of Ofsted taking a step back because I think there needs to be an independent teaching review body. I wonder how effective peer review would be in practice.’","Labour plan to overhaul school inspections so teachers assess each other .

"Do I welcome the news that Next is about to overtake M&S? Sales at Next grew 7.2 per cent last year, to £4 billion, while it’s predicted that clothing sales at Marks & Spencer will have drooped like so many Per Una gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week. They will also be about £4 billion. I loved Next, the brainchild of George Davies, when it launched in 1982. It was the first brand to give us affordable luxury, with its very first campaign giving us chunky 100 per cent wool knits, soft chambray, and very British tweed. It gave us the revolutionary Next Directory in 1988, a classy precursor to online shopping, and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online, becoming the largest ‘etailer’ in Europe. Scroll down for video . The smart outfit: Next's foil pleated skirt and blush formal jacket (left) wins for being conventional over Marks and Spencer's double breasted Crêpe Drape coat (right) deemed too strange for a wedding . Now, though, I find its success troubling: it survives and conquers through bargain-basement prices, undercutting Marks by scrimping on quality. A real leather weekend tote in the very first Next Directory cost £99; today a similar version is £72. In 1988 a wool blazer was £60; today a synthetic version is £34. And it flourishes, of course, by offering young women instant credit: I must point out its interest fees are ferocious – as is its hounding of late payers. To achieve these startling new figures, Next has abandoned what it once did really well – classy tailored minimalism for the office – and now chases catwalk trends. But it has always thought on its flatform-shod feet, while M&S seems to lumber, and is offering quality, yes, but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at. (Remember the recent £345 all-wool winter coat?) After comparing the two giants’ ranges here, I think it’s time Marks’s style director Belinda Earl went five days a week from her current three, don’t you? The smart outfit for a wedding... or for work . NEXT: Foil pleated skirt; £45 Blush formal jacket, £34 . This accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late, but I love it, and I love, too, the soft pink jacket. It’s very Rick Owens: long, lean and slim fitting. The outfit only works on the slim – pleats are never good on the wide of berth. M&S: M&S Collection double breasted Crêpe Drape coat, £65; Cut-out rear panelled skater dress, £45 . A trench may seem strange for a smart wedding, but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below. Sling it over your shoulders for work. And the winner is... Next wins for being truly conventional, which is what women want for work or a formal occasion – but do beware the midi length, which can be frumpy: you will need to make sure the rest of you is sleek, with killer heels, not flats. The 'casual gypsy' look . Casual gypsy: Next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top (left) over M&S's fringed kimono . NEXT: Ochre crochet trim top, £28; flared jeans, £20 . The jeans are almost identical to M&S’s, but crucially cheaper. The top will have people asking when the baby’s due, but at least shows some flesh. M&S: Limited Edition fringed Kimono jacket, £39.50; flared jeans, £29.50; vest, £9.50 . The jeans are nice and inky, but quite narrow for flares, while the gypsy top is just awful: it swamps the wearer. And the winner is... Next by a whisker. The summer dresses . Summer dresses: Marks and Spencer's Per Una Lace Shift dress (right) wins hands down over Next's sack-like printed folk dress (left) NEXT: Paisley print folk dress, £30 . A little bit sack-like, but I can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy. M&S: Per Una Lace Shift Dress, £75 . This dress is lovely: a very current, sub-Erdem print, a scalloped hem that softens the knee area, and a bit of a sleeve, which is what women told Marks and Spencer’s style director Belinda Earl they want – plus it’s easily smart enough for a wedding. And the winner is... M&S wins hands down: it has a sexy shape, but is forgiving, too. The suede persuasion . Suede persuasion: M&S win by a country mile with the Autograph Suede Skirt (right) while Next's effort (left) completely missed the boat on the trend . NEXT: Suedette Tassel Jacket, £55 Dark denim flared jeans, £20 . Next completely missed the boat on this trend: all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels, just £55 as it’s faux. M&S: Autograph Suede Skirt, £199; Autograph knitted jumper, £35 . When Alexa Chung was photographed in this very now Autograph suede skirt last week, the M&S website started smoking, even though it won’t hit stores until April 10. Suede and leather always do well for M&S and this will shoot off the rails: it’s not mumsy, and feels luxurious. Younger women will opt for the shorter, £75 version at Topshop. And the winner is... M&S, by a country mile: real skin at Next would be prohibitively expensive, so in a way it’s great they don’t even try. The funkiest of the accessories . Funky accessories: Next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms (left) over M&S's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs (right) NEXT: Denim flatforms, £35; Suede fringed rucksack, £62 (Flared jeans, £28; Blush utility jacket, £55) Much funkier than M&S, Next has done lots of small, neat saddle bags, too, which were all over the catwalk. M&S: Limited Edition faux leather cross body bag, £35; Autograph sling backs, £45 (Per Una white jeans, £39.50, Autograph knitted jumper, £35) A huge improvement on last summer. The cross body bag is a good size, and faux is infinitely better than cheap nasty leather. The sling backs are very Kate Middleton. And the winner is... Next by a nose.","Sales at Next grew 7.2 per cent last year while it’s predicted Marks & Spencer's clothing sales will have dropped .

"For alligator handler Jason McDonald, being mere inches from the jaws of alligators is all in a day's work. But for those of us not quite so fearless, we can see what's it's like to wrestle one - without the danger - thanks to the GoPro he wore to capture this footage. Mr McDonald wore the camera as he caught Bertha, a 10ft female gator who weighs 500lb, at the Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, Colorado. Scroll down for video . Experienced alligator handler Jason McDonald wore to GoPro to show what's it like to wrestle the creatures . Thanks to the camera, we can see the handler's point of view as as he caught 500lb female gator Bertha . He uses his hands to keep the gator's mouth shut and his whole body to hold the large creature down . In the clip, Mr McDonald approaches Bertha, the largest gator at Colorado Gator Farm, and holds her down . He is seem jumping on top of the large creature and using just his weight to hold her down. The 34-year-old even opens the reptile's mouth with his hands while an awestruck crowd watch. Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals, said he became involved with Colorado Gators 10 years ago, when he signed up for a wrestling class. And his work at the farm is in stark contrast to his day job as a crematory manager. He said: 'I wanted to get a pet gator and I had heard that the farm offered classes. The clip shows Mr McDonald as he uses a rope to handle the gators and then wrestle them with his bare hands . The 34-year-old is seen demonstrating his gator handling skills in front of a crowd at the Colorado Gator Farm . Mr McDonald, pictured with Bertha, prefers the larger, but slower reptiles to the smaller ones who are faster . 'I really enjoyed the rush I felt catching them and the experience of helping treat them for wounds and seeing them recover.' Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm, but in 1987, its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators, as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses. 'While we don't breed gators, we have saved over 200 and currently have a population of around 400,' he added. Surprisingly, he has never sustained a serious injury from handling gators - and insists he prefers catching the larger ones compared to the smaller ones, which are more mobile. He said: 'The bigger gators the less flexible and much slower as they have more mass to move. 'Bertha is one of the original gators we got from Florida and she is extremely large - with the average size for a female being around eight foot. 'We have geothermal wells that keep the water hot - that's the reason we can have gators in one of the coldest places in the US - and it's also why we have such big and healthy gators.'

"An American Idol reject whose lullaby made her a viral sensation has revealed online she almost aborted her baby - and in the process started a new viral moment of parents sharing photos of their children that almost never existed. Kimberly Henderson, 26, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December. The clip - which has since been viewed more than four million times - landed the full-time nurse an opportunity to record her own track and since then her phone has apparently been ringing off the hook. Scroll down for video . Kimberly Henderson, 26,  an American Idol reject whose lullaby made her a viral sensation has revealed she almost aborted her baby (pictured after the birth) The single mother-of-four who was rejected by American Idol three times has revealed the baby she sang to in the video clip almost never existed after she considered an abortion . But now the single mother-of-four who was rejected by American Idol three times, has revealed the baby she sang to in the video clip almost never existed after she considered an abortion. In a Facebook post, Henderson, who works as a full time nurse, explains that two years ago this week she had booked an appointment at an abortion clinic, but sat there for seven hours crying as she tried to make her decision. She then re-posted her post from that day, writing: 'I had my mind made up. My boyfriend was cheating on me. I have small kids, what will people think?? I kept telling myself I'm all alone I need to do this. Sitting there.. I could hardly make out anyone or anything through the tears. 'People were eating fast food around me, laughing, texting. I on the other hand was a wreck. I kept my face down, my face was drenched in tears. 'I kept telling and giving myself every reason to go through with this even though I did not believe in it. 'I kept saying I'm on birth control this could not happen.I kept trying to justify it. But my heart was heavy. I felt like I was about to make a horrible horrible decision. Henderson and three of her children. In a Facebook post, Henderson, who works as a full time nurse, explained that two years ago this week she had booked an appointment at an abortion clinic, but sat there for seven hours crying as she tried to make her decision . Henderson with her youngest daughter Vaida Everly who she says she is 'in love with' 'My once tiny 6lb baby is now 18lbs. Full of life. Full of energy. Loves to laugh. Loves to smile,' she writes . She says she had a difficult morning getting to the clinic as she had to find a babysitter because her daughter was ill, her car broke down on the drive and she arrived for her appointment late - and then she began to wonder if 'God was giving me signs to not do it.' Henderson explains that when she was called for her appointment she was looking in her wallet for her ID when a card fell out out - it had been left on a table by a couple she had served that week and had their church name on it. She says a verse from the bible which was written on the card gave her strength and then two of her best friends called and said they would support her. She writes: 'I told the lady I changed my mind. As I was about to walk out. A young girl no older than probably 19 says to me..""Are you going to do it?"" I told her I couldn't.. She said..""I wish I could be brave like you.."" I told her she was brave and she could do the same thing. 'She said she had to do it because of some serious circumstances.. As I turned around she said..""When you see your baby's face for the first time you're gonna be so glad you walked out of here today."" She says that when she left the clinic she felt an 'enormous amount of relief and strength.' Henderson said she had a scary pregnancy and admits to suffering weak moments but gave birth in September 2013. 'I welcomed my beautiful Vaida Everly into this world with both my best friends by my side. I remember seeing her for the first time and bursting into tears,' she writes. Rock-a-bye-baby: Henderson seen in her original DIY music video which went viral last December . '6lbs 4oz of pure perfection and no matter what pain I felt physically and emotionally... She gave me a feeling of joy that I can't even explain. A kind of joy that if a war was going on outside I wouldn't even know it. I am so in love. My once tiny 6lb baby is now 18lbs. Full of life. Full of energy. Loves to laugh. Loves to smile.' Henderson explained that the reason she is telling the story to her fans is that Vaida is the baby she was singing to in her video which went viral. 'The video that has touched millions of people all over the world,' she writes. 'Singing to her in our kitchen for a memory keep sake is the reason our entire life is about to change. For the good. For the better. She was meant to be here. I'm so lucky.' Her post has inspired hundreds of woman across the world to post photos of their children who they almost aborted. Their reasons vary - one mother posted a photo of a smiling little girl and wrote alongside it: 'I almost had an abortion also because I got pregnant from a rape and was single with three small boys. So glad I didn't because she is my only baby girl.' Another posted a photo of herself standing next to her son in a prom outfit and wrote: 'This is my best decision ever as well!!! I was so scared and already had a little one. I went too...and couldn't follow through. He is now almost 17 and my very best friend!' A mother of six posted a photo of her and her children and wrote: 'I walked out of planned parenthood at 18. I was scared and alone and it seemed like the right thing at the time. 'We got married and had a handsome baby boy and a bunch more like him! He will be 16 this year and we will be married 16 years! He's the young man standing next to me! Such a joy!!! Beautiful story!' Another mother posted a photo of a girl in a wedding gown marrying a military officer and wrote: 'My beautiful choice on her wedding day. Thank you for being brave enough to share your story!'

She told Fox News that she is being courted by four different record companies and she is working with a manager to negotiate a deal. She says she has been singing since the age of two and doing it full-time would be a dream come true. Currently Henderson  works two jobs as a healthcare worker and receives help from relatives with child care. She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own high-gloss music track in Los Angeles. The beautiful ballad, which she penned in just 24 hours, focuses on her her experiences as a single parent. The first verse describes her earliest months as a young mother to her baby girl. 'My friends are doing normal things like going to the movies and on dates and out on the weekends. And I’m at home,' she explains. 'I felt like I was missing out on something, but coming home to her and being with her gave my life more meaning.' The music-making trip of a lifetime was paid for by Cosco Kids, a company which makes baby products. Tiny Hearts was released in January and it is jumping up the charts . An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio . Apparently the firm found out Henderson was in a bad car crash and a Cosco car seat saved her child’s life. Managers from the business then came up with a way to support her musical endeavors. Tiny Hearts was released in January and it has jumped up the charts. An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio. Candid footage also showed her getting a makeover with a stylist and make-up artist injecting some added star appeal. Henderson says getting rejected from American Idol will not stop her from doing what she loves. She concluded: 'They have good things to say. They just said, ""You have a really unique voice, we think you’re good, but it’s just not your time yet."" 'So I’m guessing maybe now it’s my time.' On a more personal level, Henderson hopes that fame might help her to reconnect her with her own mother, who disappeared from her life when she was 11 years old. 'I don't know where she is,' the singer told The Huffington Post, adding, 'But I keep thinking that maybe if she somehow sees my video or my new song, she'll come forward and try to reach out.' Henderson says her family are excited about her recent breakthrough. Along with Whitney Houston and Sam Smith, Christina Aguilera is another of the blonde's musical idols.","Kimberly Henderson, 26, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her daughter, Vaida .

"Zaur Dadayev (pictured) was originally reported to have confessed to the killing, but has now claimed this confession was made under torture and threat of death . The only man to so far confess to the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov has dramatically denied any guilt and claims his confession was forced under torture and threat of death. Zaur Dadayev was said to have admitted to the killing but he now claims he was told that by confessing, a friend he was with could go free. If he failed to confess he would be killed in a grenade explosion, a fate he alleged another suspect named Bislan Shavanov met in recent days. Five people have been detained in connection with Nemtsov's shooting on February 27. Dadaev was the only one who, according to a judge, confessed to the killing, though in court he didn't admit guilt. He said: 'At the time of the arrest I was with a friend, my former subordinate Ruslan Yusupov. And they said that if I confessed, he would be freed. 'Otherwise the same thing would happen to me as to Shavanov.' The official version is that Shavanov killed himself with a grenade as police came to arrest him. He added he was not guilty and the judge did not allow him to speak, he told Moskovskiy Komsomolets newspaper. Human rights experts who met Dadayev and other suspects in detention found 'traces of torture and beating' on their bodies, it was reported. 'We are carefully checking into this,' said chairman of the Moscow Public Monitoring Commission, Anton Tsvetkov. 'There are reasons that lead us to believe Zaur Dadayev confessed under torture,' said Andrei Babushkin, a member of the Kremlin's human rights council. There were 'numerous wounds' on the body of the suspect. Earlier law enforcement sources claimed forensic tests 'give reasons to believe that Dadayev was the man who shot Nemtsov'. However, the source admitted the murder weapon had not been found yet. Nemtsov - a prominent Putin foe - was gunned down close to the Kremlin on 27 February as he walked home late at night with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya. Nemtsov was gunned down close to the Kremlin last month as he walked home late at night with his girlfriend . His body sits in a body-bag as authorities work at the scene of his killing in Moscow last month . More startling revelations to be reported today included claims Nemtsov's murder was ordered by a senior security official in Chechnya. The identity of the man - named only Ruslan, and said to be a close relative of top political figures in the region - is known to Vladimir Putin and the FSB, but he has not been detained, reported Novaya Gazeta, Russia's leading investigative newspaper. The Russian president has been told in addition that three other prominent liberal figures are on a chilling Chechen 'hit list'. They are exiled Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who was jailed for a decade under Putin but now says he has ambitions to become president; Alexei Venediktov, respected editor of editorially independent Ekho Mosocw radio; and glamorous Ksenia Sobchak, a TV presenter and opposition blogger, daughter of the president's political mentor Anatoly Sobchak, former mayor of St Petersburg. Other media in Russia today named him as Ruslan Geremeev. In sensational claims, the newspaper reported that the man who ordered 55-year-old Nemtsov's murder is a highly decorated major in the same Interior Ministry unit called 'North' in Chechnya in which alleged killer Dadayev served until recently. Novaya Gazeta said it did not name him because of the presumption of innocence, but admitted the alleged mastermind's identity 'is known to dozens, if not hundreds, of members of the FSB and the Investigation Committee'. People walk past flowers left at the site where Nemtsov was killed on the evening of February 27 . Nemtsov was a prominent anti-Putin foe. Pictured is his casket being carried at his funeral . He is said to have been questioned by investigators on Monday, though not detained. His uncle was named as Suleiman Geremeev, a senator for Chechnya in the Russian upper house. Another relative is Russian MP Adam Delimkhanov, a close henchman of powerful Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadryov, a key Putin ally. 'The head of state was informed about the details by the director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov,' reported Novaya Gazeta, which is part-owned by ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and by Alexander Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard. Several reports say the disclosures prevent a major challenge for Putin, because he must allow the prosecution of a key figure from the security services professing total loyalty to him in Chechnya - or snub his Moscow law enforcement cadres who have exposed the murder plot. For some time, there has been a power struggle between those under Kadyrov's command, and those at federal level in Moscow, with claims the Chechens have a free hand to conduct illegal operations.","Zaur Dadayev had confessed to shooting opposition leader Boris Nemtsov .

"Target has proposed to pay $10million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against the retailer following a massive data breach in 2013. Individuals affected by the breach could get up to a maximum of $10,000 each, the proposal says. Details of as many as 40million credit and debit card accounts were exposed during the breach, which hurt its holiday sales that year. Scroll down for video . Target, based in Minneapolis, has proposed to pay $10million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against it following a massive data breach in 2013 . The company has offered free credit monitoring for affected customers and overhauled its security systems. The proposed settlement would also require Minneapolis-based Target Corp. to appoint a chief information security officer, keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers. It would be required to establish a procedure to monitor data security, and to respond swiftly to future breaches. 'We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution,' Target spokesman Molly Snyder said in an emailed statement. The company said in court documents filed in Minnesota that the funds for reimbursements will be kept in an interest-bearing escrow account. Claims will mostly be submitted and processed online, through a dedicated website. Target's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year . The chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident. Over the 2014 holiday season, Target offered free shipping on all items. It recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $25. And on Wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands. Target's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from Canada has been met with optimism on Wall Street. The retailer's stock traded above $80 for the first time Monday. Earlier this month, Target said it would lay off about 1,700 people, eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $2billion in costs. It will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth. This will involve an investment of about $1billion, which will be aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online. A court hearing on the proposed settlement is set for Thursday in St. Paul, Minneapolis.","Target's 2013 data breach exposed details of up to 40million bank accounts .

Gina said: 'Men who were repulsed by me in the past are now stopping me in the streets and begging to take me out. 'I spent my younger years completely alone, wishing I had a boyfriend. Now they're wishing they had me.' Sick of feeling unattractive, Gina - in 2007, then aged 31 - began ploughing her savings into cosmetic surgery after a lifetime of feeling lonely. Gina was 31 when she first began ploughing into her savings to fund her plastic surgery - she said the bullying affected her confidence and she felt like she had no friends . Gina used to be a teacher but she has now left that behind to start her own online store: Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store . Gina then left teaching in 2013 to launch Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store and had her most recent operation in summer last year. She, who is currently looking for a new man, said: 'The worst period that I lived through was in my adolescents, during school and even at university people would call out rude comments to me. 'It affected my confidence I had no friends. People didn't want to know me or be my friend. I wasn't attractive to people for sexual relationships. 'I thought I looked ugly and manly and I had problems dating, men didn't find me attractive. I had a few flings but I just didn't find myself attractive.' Gina said she had a few flings before she embarked on her operations but she did not find herself attractive . Gina says she now feels like a model thanks to her £40,000 make-over but she wouldn't put herself at the levels of Kate Moss and co . But she believes spending eight years in an out of hospitals across England, Tunisia, Pakistan, Cyprus, Belgium, Thailand, has paid off despite having to undergo corrective surgery for botched operations. She said: 'I wouldn't put myself at the level of Kate Moss, Beyonce or Naomi Campbell but I feel like a model. 'It may have cost me my life savings but it was worth it. I only have one regret, I should have transformed myself sooner.'","Gina Blacks had surgery after being called, 'manly' by cruel men .

"President Barack Obama ordered the federal government on Thursday to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 percent, as the U.S. seeks to spur other nations to get serious about climate change. Obama's executive order also directs the government to ramp up use of renewable energy sources to 30 percent of the federal government's consumption. The White House said U.S. taxpayers could save up to $18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade, compared to 2008 levels. 'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday, where he toured a rooftop solar panel installation after signing the executive order at the White House. 'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' President Barack Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday after signing the executive order at the White House . The White House said U.S. taxpayers could save up to $18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade, compared to 2008 levels. Obama is pictured her giving the order . Major companies that sell to the federal government like GE, HP, Northrup Grumman and Honeywell will also announce voluntary commitments to cut their own emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, the White House said. IBM, for example, said it will cut its energy consumption 35 percent by 2020 and buy at least 20 percent of its power from renewably sources by that year. The operator of an estimated 360,000 buildings and 650,000 vehicles, the federal government is the country's single largest energy consumer. The Department of Defense alone is responsible for roughly half of that consumption, a senior administration official said. All told, the government pollution cuts along with industry contributions will have the effect of keeping 26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases out of the air by 2025, or the equivalent of what about 5.5 million cars would pump out through their tailpipes in an average year, the White House said. Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama, told reporters that the president's mandate is a 'triple win' for the environment, the economy, and the taxpayer. Yet it was unclear exactly how either the government or private companies planned to meet its targets. 'The potential from this announcement,' Deese said during a call with reporters, 'is significant both because we can drive substantial reductions across the entire federal footprint and because our efforts to do that leverage both innovation and investment in the private sector.' While at the Energy Department, Obama also discussed the new emissions targets at a roundtable with federal suppliers that do more than $1 billion per year in business with the government. The U.S. government is responsible for only a small portion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but the Obama administration is hoping that taking aggressive steps at home will increase the political pressure on other countries to do the same. 'Certainly our hope is that we are laying forth template that other countries could also learn from and look at as well,' Deese noted. President Barack Obama tours solar panels on the roof of the Energy Department on Thursday with Eric Haukdal, Energy Department Energy Manager, left, Deputy Energy Secretary Liz Sherwood-Randall, second from the right, and Kate Brandt, Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, right . Climate change was reportedly a topic  of discussion at the president's Oval Office meeting on Thursday afternoon with Prince Charles, who is next in line for the throne in Britain, and the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla. A major global climate treaty, in the works for years, is supposed to be finalized in December at a summit in Paris, but most countries have yet to announce what their national contributions to the pact will be. Earlier this month the European Union unveiled its contribution, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990. The U.S. has yet to announce its contribution to the treaty. But in a bid to build momentum last year, Obama set a U.S. goal to cut emissions up to 28 percent by 2025 — compared to 2005 levels — in a joint announcement with China that boosted hopes that an aggressive climate treaty may come to fruition. The president hasn't fully explained how he'll meet that goal, but his aides have suggested that unprecedented pollution limits he's imposing on power plants will get the U.S. much of the way there. Obama's executive order directs the federal government to cut energy use in federal buildings 2.5 percent every year between 2015 and 2025 and reduce the amount of water used in federal buildings 2 percent every year through 2025. It also advises federal agencies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from government-owned vehicles by 30 percent per mile by 2025, compared to the levels in 2014, and put more hybrid and zero-emission vehicles in their fleets. Additionally, it seeks to ensure federal agencies are getting 25 percent of their energy — both heat and electricity — from clean sources by 2025.","'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday .

"Killed: Trang-Thuy Nguyen, 37, died in hospital Tuesday after being hit by a falling wooden plank . A 37-year-old woman was killed in Manhattan's West Village by a piece of plywood that was blown out of luxury condo development in high winds. The woman has been named as Trang-Thuy Nguyen - she was taken to a nearby hospital but died after the wood struck her body. She was pushed into a wall at a parking garage and struck her head, a source told the New York Daily News. The incident occurred on West 12th Street at 5:50 p.m on Tuesday. The plywood came from new construction The Greenwich Lane - a 200-unit development in five buildings and five townhouses that stands on what was once the site of St. Vincent's Hospital. ABC 7 reports the woman was on her cell phone as she passed the entrance to a parking lot entrance, when the 4-by-8 sheet of plywood, separated from the security fence across the street. The Greenwich Lane, which is LEED certified, has apartments starting at $3.65 million. It is nearly completely sold out and already have some interest from designer Michael Kors who is reported to be purchasing a penthouse at the development.

"The courier firm City Link broke the law when it went bust over Christmas – but it can only be fined a maximum of £5,000. MPs investigating the collapse say today it ‘is clearly in the financial interest of a company to break the law’. A report also said firms were incentivised to ‘ignore the statutory redundancy consultation period, if the fine for doing so is less than the cost of continuing to trade, especially since this fine will anyway be paid by the taxpayer’. Scroll down for video . Courier firm City Link broke the law over job cuts when it went bust over Christmas, but can only be fined a maximum of £5,000. File photo . The Redundancy Payments Service can fine firms up to £5,000 if they fail to register a consultation, but the financial benefit to firms of trading on regardless can be significantly higher than this fine. The report published today by Parliament’s Scottish Affairs and Business, Innovation and Skills Committees probed the failure of City Link. Some 2,586 workers lost their jobs, with many hearing about the impending collapse on Christmas Day. When a company intends to make more than 100 staff redundant there is a statutory period for consultation of 45 days. This did not happen in the case of City Link, owned by Better Capital and run by private equity tycoon Jon Moulton. Ian Davidson MP, chairman of the joint committee, said ignoring the consultation period had a high human cost that appears not to have featured in the decision making process at City Link. Ian Davidson MP (pictured) said ignoring the consultation period had a high human cost . ‘Employees were denied a reasonable notice period in which to seek alternative employment’, he said. ‘The system provides perverse incentives to withhold information or to skip proper consultation processes in contravention of the law and at a high cost to workers struggling to cope with the loss of their livelihoods.’ Moulton, who bought the troubled firm for £1 in 2013, insisted he had tried to save the company but failed. City Link faced fierce competition from bigger rivals DHL and Fedex and the business he inherited was in a bad state. He said he personally lost £2m and his firm £20m. The committee recommended the government review the requirements for consultation on redundancies so that employees understand what they can expect and company directors have a clear understanding of their responsibility to employees. It said: ‘The processes for company insolvency do not offer sufficient protection to workers, suppliers and contractors and the balance should be shifted’. The politicians called for workers should be given better rights under the Insolvency Act 1986 regardless of whether or not they are directly employed. Davidson said: ‘We are dismayed that, although it was clear for some time that there were serious questions over the ability of City Link to continue trading after December 2014, small businesses and self-employed drivers . . were encouraged to take on additional costs. ‘Contractors feel they were deliberately deceived as to the true state of the business. City Link and Better Capital are morally, if not legally, responsible for the difficulties that many of these individuals and small business now find themselves in.’ The workers can take the firm to an employment tribunal which if successful can make a ‘protective award’ of up to 90 days pay for each employee that was not consulted. When a company intends to make more than 100 staff redundant, there is a statutory period for consultation of 45 days. File photo . But since the businesses is no longer trading, Davidson says this either comes out of whatever funds are left, or from the taxpayer. Moulton said Better Capital only continued to trade so that parcels could be delivered in time for Christmas and that the firm had no financial benefit from continuing to trade. ‘Better Capital does not accept that it, as a secured creditor, should have done any more than it did,’ he said. ‘Better Capital could have recovered much more of its investment by precipitating an earlier insolvency, but we did not do so to allow every possible solution to be considered.’","Firm can only be fined maximum of £5,000 for job cuts when it went bust .

"A skydiver narrowly avoided death after a double parachute malfunction resulted in him plunging to the ground at around 25mph. The footage captured on the skydiver’s head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over Perris, California. Initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane, his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the Californian landscape on his camera. So far so good: The skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over Perris, California . But suddenly, the bridle, which connects the pilot chute – a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute – to the deployment bag containing the parachute, wraps around the pilot chute. It then appears that the reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL (reserve static line) system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled. This sends the skydiver spiralling out of control, and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft. The skydiver's reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled . The skydiver is sent spiralling out of control and back down to earth at a height of more than 1000ft . As he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute. But as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet. The man was later taken to the hospital where, remarkably, he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising. Writing online after the incident, the skydiver said that he was very lucky to be alive and that some of the people who witnessed the fall expected it to be fatal.

"When it comes to style, few would argue that top designer Tom Ford has it in spades. So no surprise that the fashion guru's former home in Chelsea, London, has a certain je ne sais quoi. The stylish apartment, where the American lived between 1994 and 2004 whilst heading up Gucci, is now on the market for a cool £1.15m with estate agents Strutt and Parker - who say having a famous former tenant is proving a big draw for the property. Inside the apartment, where Tom Ford lived between 1994 and 2004, while heading up Gucci . The apartment located in Redcliffe Gardens in SW10 has a master bedroom, and a stunning roof terrace . Post apparently still arrives for the designer, pictured, from time to time . The designer is now  based across the pond but there are still plenty of stylish neighbours to rub designer shoulders with - Adele, Kylie Minogue and Frank Lampard among them. Arranged over two floors and flooded with light, the 900sqft apartment has a bright and airy feel. The apartment has been updated since the designer left more than a decade ago. When the current owners did refurbished the property they claim that they found a number of Gucci material samples with handwritten notes. The cool apartment located in Redcliffe Gardens in SW10 has a master bedroom and en-suite, an open-plan reception room and kitchen and a stunning roof terrace. Up the spiral staircase there's a further bedroom and shower room and access to the roof terrace with view across the city. Wooden floors and industrial style lamps and staircase give the pad a the cool factor - as does the muted colour palette. The 53-year-old designer has a degree in architecture, so perhaps it's the apartment's stylish split-level structure that appealed. Apparently parcels apparently still arrive for the designer from time to time - so you never know what unexpected extras might be thrown in for the £1.15m price-tag. Simon Rose, Head of Strutt & Parker in West Chelsea, said: 'This flat is special for a number of reasons. 'A stone's throw from the Kings Road, it's been recently refurbished, it split over two levels linked by a cool spiral staircase and features a fabulous private roof terrace perfect for summer parties.

"Convicted rapist Luke Lazarus has told a courtroom that he believes he could have been a CEO and had the 'world at his feet' before his conviction. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the 23-year-old lived a very lavish lifestyle in Vaucluse with his parents and held a graduate marketing position with beverage company Lion. Lazarus' father is known for owning prominent nightclubs in Kings Cross and Bondi Junction. Convicted rapist Luke Lazarus has told the Sydney District Court that he could have been a CEO . Luke Lazarus's parents are seen leaving the Sydney District Court on Thursday . 'I essentially had the world at my feet,' he told Sydney's District Court. 'My life, at least in Australia, has been completely destroyed and now I have to live the rest of my life knowing every single person in Australia, or at least Sydney, knows I have been convicted of a sex offence,' The Daily Telegraph reported Lazarus as saying before breaking down in court. Lazarus still believes that the incident in May 2013 was completely consensual. During the trial, the jury were told that Lazarus told the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before and ushered her into an alleyway. The woman attempted to go back inside but Lazarus forcefully told her to get down on the ground on all fours. 'I essentially had the world at my feet,' he told the court after leaving Lion beverages following the conviction . Luke's father Andrew Lazarus is a prominent night club owner in Sydney and owns the SOHO where the incident took place . He then sexually assaulted her for ten minutes and afterward, put her phone number in his phone. She informed police the next morning who seized CCTV footage from the venue which confirmed Lazarus led the woman into the alleyway. Text messages from the evening show Lazarus messaging a friend saying he had no recollection of the night but he did take a woman's virginity and it was a 'pretty gross story.' Lazarus told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement.' He also added that it made him physically ill to think that the incident was not consensual. The 23-year-old was allegedly seeing an American woman but ended the relationship due to his parent's disapproval of her not being Greek. Psychiatrist Dr. Christopher Rikard-Bell, said Lazarus was suffering emotional symptoms as a result of the break up. Lazarus is to be sentenced on Friday.","Luke Lazarus has told Sydney District Court that he could have been CEO .

"Islamic State torturer-in-chief Jihadi John scratched the outline of a sword on the face of one of his victims in order to signify that he was to be beheaded, according to an account by a hostage held by the terrorist group. Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, 46, who was released a year ago, says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists, who all spoke with British accents. And he reveals that they named them the 'Beatles' because they liked 'beating' people, not simply because they were British. The leader of the group, who came to be known as Jihadi John and has since been identified as Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, went on to behead five hostages. Telling his story: Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, 46, who was released by ISIS a year ago, says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists, who all spoke with British accents . Killer: The leader of the so-called 'Beatles' - who came to be known as Jihadi John (left) and has since been identified as Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi (right) -  went on to behead five hostages . Mr Marginedas, a seasoned war reporter held for six months by ISIS, has published a detailed account of his ordeal at the hands of the 'Beatles' in the Spanish newspaper, El Periódico de Catalunya. The hostages were eventually taken to a prison in Raqqa, northern Syria, where the 'Beatles' had a room next to the prisoners, separated only by a broken glass door and a curtain. Mr Marginedas said the three masked 'Beatles' liked to burst into their cell shouting and threatening the prisoners, and always ended up 'beating' at least one of the hostages. Prisoner: Marc Marginedas, a seasoned war reporter - was held for six months by Islamic State terrorists . On one occasion he recalls how Jihadi John carried out a savage beating of one of the hostages who had been told to approach the door. Recalls Mr Marginedas: 'Once in position, [Jihadi John] took a red pen and began to draw a sword on the [unnamed] hostage's face, letting him know, in this macabre he would end his days in Syria, beheaded.' 'The pen tip broke before he finished the sketch, but Jihadi John wanted to finish his work with the rest of sharpened pencil, already cut almost like a knife, tearing the skin of the cheek with a vengeance, and leaving for the following days a visible wound in the face, outlined by the scar.' Mr Marginedas also claims that the Beatles were only put in charge of the prisoners because Islamic State commanders couldn't spare hardened fighters from the battlefield. And he believes this may have been a source of a grievance to them which only served to fuel their cruelty. Mr Marginedas was captured on the 4th of September 2013 by rebel jihadists, close to the city of Hama, in Western Syria. He had entered the country three days before, through Turkey; accompanied by members of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). According to Mr Marginedas, Jihadi John was a 'manic-depressive', similar to that of a serial killer so often depicted in films. Ill-treated: Marc Marginedas said the three masked 'Beatles' liked to burst into their cell shouting and threatening the prisoners, and always ended up 'beating' at least one of the hostages . His first victim: American journalist James Foley was the first Western citizen to have been killed on film by Jihadi John in a sickening propaganda video . Another Spanish journalist, released shortly after Mr Marginedas, has told how the prisoners had to wear orange jumpsuits and had to memorise in Arabic a number written on their back. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javier Espinosa, described how Emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages. Espinosa, a journalist for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, said Emwazi liked to carry an antique metre-long sword with a silver handle, of the kind Muslim armies used in the Middle Ages. After enduring a mock execution at the hands of Jihadi John, Mr Espinosa said 'that encounter confirmed the psychopathic character of my interlocutors.' Emwazi was among 'psychotic' extremists who pillaged the Spaniard's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Slaughtered: Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines (right) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by Jihadi John . Sick: James Foley (left) became the first Westerner to be murdered by the terror group's British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as 'Jihadi John', (right) in a shocking filmed beheading last August . Mr Espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova when the pair were working near the Turkish border in 2013. Alongside American journalists and aid workers including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, they were locked in ISIS prisons - as Mr Espinosa describes them as 'elegant mansions' and the former government headquarters in Raqqa - across the war-ravaged country for months. Being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace. On one occasion, the Spaniard notes, a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive Sharia law. The European and American hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved, Mr Espinosa claims to have been told. Instead they were being picked off one by own, their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos. Story: Pictured right is Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held along with his colleague Ricardo Garcia Vilanova (left) by ISIS between December 2013 and March last year. Espinosa, described how Emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in captivity, held by ISIS terrorists . Mr Marginedas recounts an incident in February last year when Jihadi John visited the hostages and claimed that he had been wounded in combat: 'Once, on a February evening, he appeared in the room and began walking in circles to the silent hostages. He seemed limp, and claimed that he had been wounded in combat during the day. 'He said ""I wonder what you would do to me if you were in my position,"" hinting that he was aware of the suffering being imposed on innocent and the desire for revenge that may be raising his performance.' Mr Marginedas says the jihadists' evil cruelty is further demonstrated by another episode in which the 'Beatles' gave the leftovers of their food to half the starving hostages while the remaining hostages were ordered to watch their fellow prisoners eating. This, he says, was designed to sow bad feeling among the prisoners - which it did, with recriminations against those who had played the Beatles' game by eating the food. Mr Marginedas was one of the first of the 19 hostages from 11 different countries to be released by IS. He recalls how Jihadi John first told him the good news: 'Marcos, Marcos [is the name on my passport], are you ready to go? ' , he asked in a quiet, mellow voice. ""Yeah, I replied, instinctively looked up by the surprise news that was giving me and forgetting that when we spoke to the 'Beatles' I had to keep my eyes focused on the ground, fearing that we might end up identifying these three masked by eye. '""Do not look at the eyes!"", he shouted, lifting his hand.","Marc Marginedas, 46, was held by ISIS militants for six months last year .

"MPs have accused bosses of HSBC of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ducking responsibility for the Swiss tax dodging scandal. Chris Meares, who ran HSBC’s global private banking arm between 2006 and 2011, told the Public Accounts Committee he was not aware of alleged tax evasion taking place on his watch. Asked repeatedly whether he accepted personal responsibility for the scandal, he said he took responsibility for ‘controls failings’ which allowed the wrongdoing to occur. But he added: ‘I do not take fairly direct responsibility for individual actions of people in Switzerland that I was unaware of.' Scroll down for video . Chris Meares, who ran HSBC’s global private banking arm between 2006 and 2011, told the Public Accounts Committee he was not aware of alleged tax evasion taking place on his watch . Chief executive Stuart Gulliver and HSBC board director Rona Fairhead also angered MPs by insisting they were oblivious to the wrongdoing in Switzerland, where staff allegedly helped wealthy clients including arms dealers and a blood diamond smuggler evade taxes between 2005 and 2007. The committee’s chairman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: ‘Nobody at the bank... has deigned to accept responsibility for what was massive, illegal terrible tax evasion.’ She added: ‘Either you were incompetent, completely and utterly incompetent, in your oversight duties or you knew about it… I don’t believe you did not know.’ Her fellow committee members also expressed disbelief that HSBC’s bosses in London were unaware of what was happening in Switzerland. Conservative MP David Burrows said: ‘You are asking us to accept that Switzerland was off on a frolic on its own - that nobody in London knew what was going on’. He added: ‘I cannot believe that nobody knew the unlawful actions that were taking place in Switzerland, and if they didn’t know then they jolly well should have done. ‘What we’ve essentially got is blind eye knowledge – holding the telescope to the blind eye so that you in London didn’t see what you suspected was going on in Switzerland.’ Question time: MPs accused BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead as either being aware of wrongdoing or being 'utterly incompetent' HSBC’s chairman Douglas Flint has already heaped blame on Mr Meares and his predecessor Clive Bannister, the son of four-minute mile legend Sir Roger Bannister, who now runs insurance company Phoenix. Mr Flint told the Treasury Select Committee last month that the two men ‘certainly bear fairly direct responsibility’. Yesterday, Mr Meares - who is now chairman of fund manager Quilter Cheviot - rejected claims that he was being made the ‘fall guy’ by HSBC.

"A photo of a giant cat coming down the stairs of a house, teeth bared and biting for the chandelier has caused a sensation on social media. Users have nicknamed the creature Catzilla, Kat Kong and Fluffy Destroyer of Worlds. Others have suggested it would make a great horror movie. Disappointingly, or doubtless to some people's relief, the photo actually shows a normal-sized kitten playfully exploring the inside of a meticulously detailed dollhouse. Hear me roar! The photo of a giant cat destroying a house is actually a kitten playing in a dollhouse . The photo was taken by Cade Ritter, 18, of Austin, Texas, in an effort to get fostered kittens adopted into permanent homes. Ritter, a photography student at Rice University in Houston, took a series of photos at home a few years ago when his family fostered a litter of five kittens with the help of Austin Pets Alive, he told ABC. 'As people started adopting them, my mom thought it would be a good advertisement for the remaining kittens to have a little photo-shoot.' The kitten in the picture was the wildest out of the litter, but was eventually adopted. Ritter kept one of the cats, whom he named Sophie. The photo came about when Ritter and his mom, Austin-based artist Barbara Atwell, decided to use a dollhouse Ritter's great-grandfather had built by hand many years before. 'It's quite the amazing piece of carpentry,' Ritter said. 'It even has a working light system.' Users on Reddit were as impressed by the dollhouse as they were amused by the photo. The general consensus was that  the combination is a winning one. 'I just realized that as a cat owner, I now have a valid reason to buy a dollhouse,' said one user.

"His paintings are some of the most valuable in the world - yet many of them are slowly fading away. Now scientists have discovered Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece's are falling victim to the artist's choice of pigments he used in his paint. They have found that a rare mineral in an intense red-coloured paint used by the Dutch impressionist is turning white as it breaks down into flaky white crystals. Scroll down for video . The colours in Van Gogh's masterpiece Sunflowers, two versions of which are shown above on display at the National Gallery, are feared to have also changed as the yellow and red pigments have degraded over time . Samples from Van Gogh's paintings have been found to contain the lead-based mineral plumbonacrite that reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. They say this mineral is the missing link that may explain why the red lead paint, known as minimum, is turning white. Red lead is not the first pigment to be found in Van Gogh's work to be failing to stand the test of time. Researchers recently revealed that a red lake pigment he also used has been fading. This had led them to conclude that the blue irises of his Field with Irises near Arles, painted in 1888, were originally a purple colour. Curators at the Van Gogh Musuem in Amsterdam have also found that the colours in Van Gogh's Bedroom are also fading during a project to restore the painting. They found in a series of letters to his brother and sister, Van Gogh described in detail the vivid colours of his room. This allowed scientists to reconstruct how the painting would have originally looked. They found that the pale brown floor should have been a richer purple and peach colour while the blue walls were originally an orange-red and violet. Previous work by Professor Janssens has also shown that a bright yellow paint, known as chrome yellow, in Van Gogh's paintings has also been changing colour. When exposed to ultraviolet light, his team found the bright orange-yellow pigment darkened into a chocolate brown colour. He believes that Van Gogh's technique of blending white and yellow paint together may actually be to blame for the chemical reactions causing this darkening. The researchers, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium, studied microscopic paint samples taken from Van Gogh's Wheat Stack Under a Cloudy Sky, which he painted in 1889. Dr Koen Janssens, a chemist at the University of Antwerp, said their findings may explain why other paintings by Van Gogh, such as the priceless Sunflowers and The Bedroom, have faded over time. Speaking to Chemistry World, he said: 'Normally, the idea is these paintings are there for a hundred years, or 500 years, and they’re static – nothing really changes. 'But the opposite is actually true when you look in detail.' The researchers examined a minute flake of paint taken from a globule on the surface of the pond in the artists oil on canvas painting Wheat Stack Under a Cloudy Sky. The pond originally featured bold red colours that were intended to convey the impression of autumn leaves on the pond. However, over time the red leaves have been turning grey and then white, taking on the appearance of the clouds in the sky above. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Angewandte Chemie, used a technique known as x-ray powder diffraction tomography to study the paint fleck. They found that at the centre of the fleck, the paint was still a vivid red colour where the original red lead pigment had been protected from the air while the colour changed closer to the surface. Red lead was thought by much of the art world to be a relatively stable pigment, so the idea that it has been breaking down has surprised many. The researchers found that around the red pigment in their sample was a layer of plumbonacrite and then around that white crystals of lead carbonates, hydrocerussites and cerssites. Scientists took a microscopic flake of paint from the pond in Van Gogh's Wheat Stack Under a Cloudy Sky (shown on the left) and found that beneath the surface the vivid red lead pigment originally used remained (top right and bottom right) but had degraded to grey and white colour on painting's surface (bottom centre) Descriptions by Van Gogh of the colour of his lodgings that he painted in The Bedroom show that the floor and walls actually contained more red pigment, giving them more vivid shades than they have today . Experts have used computer reconstructions to boost the red in Van Gogh's The Bedroom to see how it would have originally looked before they faded under the bright lights that has caused the red pigment to degrade . They believe that sunlight has caused the original red pigment to be converted into plumbonacrite, which in turn reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form the white crystals. Professor Janssens and his colleagues propose that impurities in the original red lead pigment, also known as minium, may have triggered the degradation in the first place. They say a compound known as litharge, a natural lead oxide mineral, is often a remnant of the process of producing red lead pigment. This mineral is more reactive than the other minerals in red lead and so may have triggered the production of plumbonacrite. Speaking to Mail Online, Professor Janssens said: 'It might be that this can be interpreted as an indication of a low quality minium, but this is not certain. 'There are some indication in the literature that the residual amount of PbO (litharge) is also due to the starting material. Experiments are ongoing to clear this up.' To make matters worse, however, during restoration efforts of the painting, experts have added zinc white pigments to Wheat Stake Under a Cloudy Sky in an attempt to boost what they believed to be white pigments in the pond. The red leaves on the pond in Van Gogh's Wheat Stacks Under a Cloudy Sky have faded to white . Professor Janssens said: 'The presence of plumbonacrite in paintings or painters materials is very scarce. 'In our case, the presence of this carbonate-poor lead compound in between the red lead and the carbonate-rich lead white layer strongly suggests that plumbonacrite is present as an intermediate degradation product formed during the whitening of minium.' The findings could help future attempts to restore Van Gogh's paintings to their original colours by allowing scientists to work out what the pigments used were. Museums could also help to slow the fading by changing the environment in which the paintings are being kept. However, the findings suggest that many of Van Gogh's most valuable paintings may be under threat. Professor Janssens said: 'We know of several in which minium is present at the surface.' He added that other pigments used by Van Gogh may also be unstable. He said: 'We are currently looking together with colleagues from the U.S., Italy and the Netherlands at the instability of the red dye eosine that Van Gogh used to give some of his paintings a red/purple tone and also sometimes to make white areas somewhat pinkish. It fades fast.' Van Gogh's paintings are widely considered among the most valuable in the world. One,  known simply as Irises, is listed among the most expensive paintings ever sold and is thought to be now worth more than £70.6 million. Van Gogh struggled to sell his paintings during his life and wrestled with mental illness that led to him cutting off his own ear and later shot himself at the age of 37. It was only after his death that the importance of his work began to be truly recognised and his works are now among the most expensive paintings ever sold. In 1993 his painting A Wheatfield with Cypresses sold for £36 million. Philippe Walter, director of the Laboratory of Moleuclar and Structural Archaeology in France, told Chemistry World: 'For the conservation of works of art, it is important to look at this phenomenon to be sure to take care about the quantity of light [in museums].' Van Gogh, shown in the self portrait on the left, used vivid red colours in many of his paintings, like the $50 million 'Poppy Flowers' (right) which was stolen from Cairo's Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum in 2010 .","Red lead pigment used by Vincent van Gogh has been found to be fading .

"Islamic State continue to maintain their brutal regime in eastern Syria, publicly executing two alleged spies and whipping a man for drinking wine. According to Raqqa is being slaughtered silently, a well known Syrian activist network based in Raqqa, Islamic State executed the two men on charges of working as spies for the Assad regime. Both men were allegedly tried by an Islamic State court and publicly executed somewhere near the Syrian city of Raqqa. Scroll down for video . The victim's head was brutally cut off and shown resting on the back of the severed neck. Their bodies were left unburied somewhere near Raqqa. It is unclear when the men were executed but it is thought that the atrocity was carried out earlier this week. The photos show a large group of Islamic State militants, dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons, standing in a circle. Forced into the middle of the circle by one of the fighters, the victims are shown blindfolded with their hands tied behind their back. Two IS fighters are shown holding up a large black banner, adorned with the Islamic State logo. Unusually, no local residents can be seen watching the executions, suggesting the savage execution was carried out secretly, away from the main city.

"A mother has successfully sued police for wrongful arrest after being handcuffed in front of her Down's syndrome daughter over false claims she left her alone outside for 45 minutes. Valerie Cadman-Khan was left 'humiliated' when officers led her away from her Middlesbrough home in front of her crying daughter Aimee. Cleveland Police accused the 56-year-old of negligent behaviour, claiming she left the child alone for 45 minutes in the garden. Valerie Cadman-Khan has successfully sued Cleveland Police for wrongful arrest after being handcuffed in front of her daughter Aimee when she was 12 . The 56-year-old was led away from her former boyfriend's house in front of her daughter amid false claims Aimee, who has Down's syndrome, had been left alone for 45 minutes in the cold . Middlesbrough County Court heard how officer Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer lied to the local authority child abuse investigation to justify arresting the mother of five. On the day in question in November 2008, he had been called to her former partner's home over an unpaid tax bill. Aimee had been left in the man's care and was sitting outside when police arrived. Mrs Cadman Khan was at work. But the police officer began 'banging' on the front door and later claimed the child had turned 'purple' because she was not wearing a coat. Upon her arrival at the property Mrs Cadman-Khan, who left work early because she was not feeling well, was arrested and taken away by police. Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer was accused of 'freestyle lying' in his version of events . Aimee was forced to watch the incident, all the while screaming: 'I want my mummy,' she claimed. Her mother launched a wrongful arrest suit and has won her case against the force. Her claim for £34,000 in compensation will be assessed at a later date. Speaking of her ordeal the teacher, who works for the council at  East Coast Training, a pupil referral centre, said: 'It was never about the money - it was about clearing my name after the injustice to me and my little girl. 'This should never have come to court, I only wanted an apology. 'All I could hear was my little girl shouting ""I want my mummy, I want my mummy"". 'It was horrendous.' After arresting Mrs Cadman-Khan on suspicion of child neglect, Det Sgt Helyer 'lied under oath' to claim Aimee had been mistreated, the court heard. 'He falsely asserted that Aimee had been purple and suggested the client had been violent to him,' Nick Stanage, barrister for Mrs Cadman-Khan said. 'Sadly this was a witness that even when caught in a lie by the court he was unwilling to be honest about it.' 'For a woman of good character from that profession to be arrested and accused of allegations of child neglect and cruelty is of the utmost seriousness.' He denied maliciously arresting the mother of five, insisting that all of his actions were in Aimee's best interest. 'In the balance of probability it was more likely Sgt Helyer overreacted and was led by his concerns for Aimee,' said Nathan Adams representing Cleveland Police. 'He accepted in evidence he lost his temper and was banging on the door. He was concerned for the mental and physical wellbeing of Aimee.' Judge Gillian Matthews QC however told the court the sergeant had been 'freestyle lying' in his accounts. 'One of your problems is the witness has lied. He was prepared to mislead the court in what I call freestyle lying,' she said. The force will apologise pending her judgment on suitable reward, Mr Adams added. Mrs Cadman-Khan was left 'humiliated' by the ordeal throughout which Aimee, now 18, could be heard screaming: 'I want my mummy' The mother of five has successfully sued Cleveland Police.

The school said the frat is now facing 'disciplinary sanctions' that range from 'probation, suspension, or permanent revocation of recognition'. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'.

One woman, Tracy, lives in perpetual fear of her ten-year-old son Robert and his vicious onslaughts which range from kicks to punches. Indeed, she says sometimes his attacks are so violent, she's had to call the police to come and save her. 'I've got locks on my bedroom door - at the top and the bottom - so I've got somewhere safe to run away from Robert,' says Tracy, who lives in Preston. 'Sometimes it's just a clip around the head, other times it's a punch or a kick.' In the past two years, Tracy has had to call the police on numerous occasions to intervene. 'Once the police used riot gear to go up the stairs after him,' Tracy said. 'He used to throw a paddy when he was two and people used to say to me, ""don't worry, he's going through the terrible twos, he'll grow out of it"" but it didn't stop, it just got worse, and it hurts a lot more now.'

'Robert can be full of life, full of energy, very loving and very caring,' adds Tracy. 'But the other side he can be violent and primarily nasty. I've had to put locks on my door so if Robert is getting violent I have somewhere safe to go. 'It's terrible having to have somewhere in the house that's safe for me - this is my home, I should feel safe all the time. Tracy anxiously peers through the window wondering what mood her son will be in when he returns home . 'He kicks, hits and throws things at the wall. When he's in a temper, he's got so much force behind him. 'I'm scared that one day he's really going to hurt me, and if it isn't me, it's someone else and then he will get into trouble for it.' Robert's stepfather, Steve, said he's concerned about the escalating levels of violence. 'He can be evil at times and chased Tracy out of the house with two bread knives and we had to call the police. Eight-year-old Bailey hates getting ready for school in the morning, lashing out at his mum Sarah . Sarah says she has tried everything to stop Bailey attacking her and disrupting family life . 'He's grabbing a knife more and more often. Is he going to use it or is it just a threat? We don't know.' Elsewhere, Sarah and Chris are struggling to cope with the behaviour of their son, eight-year-old Bailey, on school days. The eldest of three children, Bailey shouts and hits his mother and younger siblings, Kenzie, four, and toddler Millie. 'Sometimes he kicks me and punches me if I switch the television off or tell him to eat his breakfast or sit still,' said Sarah, who lives in Burnely. 'He punched me in the nose this morning and most mornings I don't think I will get him out of the door to school.' Bailey, who has also been diagnosed with ADHD, now does kick boxing, which Sarah hopes will help him learn to control himself. 'I've tried everything,' said Sarah. 'I've taken time off work to go on a course about ADHD, I've tried different strategies. My kids are everything to me.' On the show, viewers will see behaviour specialists Lorrine Marer and  also Ann Ramsden from the Rosalie Ryrie Foundation work with Bailey and Robert respectively, teaching the families different techniques and looking at the causes of each boy's actions. My Violent Child will be shown on Channel 5 this Wednesday at 9pm.","Mum Tracy has called police to save her from being attacked by schoolboy .

"Texas's prison agency is scrambling to find a supplier to replenish its inventory of execution drugs, which will be used up if the state goes forward with two lethal injections scheduled for this week and next. Prison officials only have enough pentobarbital for the scheduled executions of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday and Randall Mays on March 18, but they don't know how they will conduct lethal injections on four others scheduled for April. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice declined to say why it has not been able to obtain more pentobarbital from the same compounding pharmacy that provided the current batch of the powerful sedative last March. Texas's prison agency only has enough lethal pentrobarbital for two executions. Manuel Vasquez, left, is scheduled to be injected on Wednesday while Randall Mays (right) will be executed on March 18 . Texas prison execute inmates in chambers like this one. But with limited pentobarbital, the state is looking into other options for execution . The state switched to that source several months after its previous supplier cut ties, citing hate mail and potential litigation after its name became public through an open records request from The Associated Press. Prison officials have since waged a legal battle to keep the name of its latest supplier secret, but it's unclear how much longer they can do so after a state judge last year ordered the agency to divulge the source. That ruling is on hold pending the outcome of the state's appeal. Prisons spokesman Jason Clark said the state's lawyers have advised the agency not to comment on whether the current supplier has backed out or whether the judge's order has affected its ability to find a supplier. Although Texas, traditionally the nation's busiest death penalty state, faces the most imminent deadline for replenishing its pentobarbital supply, other states are experiencing similar problems. For example, South Carolina ran out of pentobarbital — part of its three-drug execution formula — when the drug expired in 2013. The state has been unable to replenish its supplies because it can't find a company willing to sell them anymore, according to Corrections Director Bryan Stirling. The state's last execution was in 2011, and no new executions have been scheduled because cases are tied up in the appeals process. Kent Sprouse (pictured) is scheduled to be the next inmate to be executed after Mays. He is on death row for the shooting deaths of a North Texas police officer and another man in 2002 . If Texas executes Vasquez and Mays as scheduled, a new supply of pentobarbital will be needed by April 9 when Kent Sprouse is scheduled to die for the shooting deaths of a North Texas police officer and another man in 2002. Three other prisoners are set to follow Sprouse to the death chamber in April, and at least one more is set for May. 'We're focused on multiple fronts,' Brad Livingston, the Texas agency's executive director, said last month before a prison board meeting in Austin. 'We're not ruling anything out, but clearly securing additional pentobarbital is part of our game plan.' Livingston was traveling Monday and not available to provide an update. While Texas prison officials administratively could change the lethal drug they use, a method change would require legislative action. 'At this time, it's not a topic of discussion,' said state Sen. John Whitmire, who chairs the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. Because pharmaceutical companies stopped selling U.S. prisons drugs for use in lethal injections, Texas and other death penalty states have turned to compounding pharmacies for made-to-order execution drugs. Last week, a Georgia woman's execution was delayed, then called off, when prison officials said they noticed the compounded pentobarbital planned for her lethal injection appeared cloudy, rather than clear. The Georgia Department of Corrections cited 'an abundance of caution' in delaying punishment for Kelly Gissendaner, who would have been the first woman put to death in that state in 70 years, and a second inmate, Brian Terrell, who was set to die this week. Executions for death row inmates take place in Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit (pictured) Texas has executed a nation-leading 521 inmates since 1982, when it became the first state to use lethal injection. It's now been nearly three years since Texas began using pentobarbital as its only capital punishment drug, switching in July 2012 after one of the chemicals in the previous three-drug mixture no longer was available. The last 17 Texas executions, stretching back to September 2013, have used compounded pentobarbital, and the last nine from compounding pharmacies the state has refused to identify. Texas officials have insisted the identity should remain secret, citing a 'threat assessment' signed by Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face 'a substantial threat of physical harm.' Law enforcement officials have declined to elaborate on the nature of those threats. The U.S. Supreme Court, meanwhile, has refused to block punishments based on challenges to secrecy laws. However, the high court is reviewing Oklahoma's lethal injection method, resulting in a hold on executions there, after a punishment using the sedative midazolam followed by two other drugs went awry. Oklahoma lawmakers now are considering a switch to nitrogen gas as the first alternative to injection while officials in other states are considering a return to firing squads or the electric chair.","Texas's prison agency has enough for two lethal injections of pentobarbital .

"A group of patients who criticised their local GP surgery on Facebook   have been told to consider finding a new doctor in an attempt to stifle negative feedback online. Staff at the Trent Meadows Medical Practice near Burton, Staffordshire, had been monitoring social media comments and culprits have since been sent 'threatening' letters. Sylvia Blackshaw, 35, had written   that on three occasions she waited for 90 minutes for an appointment for her newborn baby. But she was later accused of abusive behaviour by the surgery who branded it 'inappropriate patient behaviour' and warned her that she should consider finding an 'alternative practice'. Row: Jenny Wheeldon, left, and Sylvia Blackshaw, right with son Jake, have been told to consider finding a new GP after their surgery saw their criticism online . Spark: Surgery staff were obviously monitoring comments on Facebook and sent a letter on the back of this one . Mrs Blackshaw had said 'OMG. Demand a recount!' in a comment on a glowing report for the surgery from health watchdog the Care Quality Commission on her local paper's Facebook page. A fortnight later a  letter sent to her home from the surgery said: 'We have a zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face, over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients.' A copy of her Facebook criticism was also attached. Warning: This letter from GP partner Judith Crosse has also been sent to other critics . Several other patients  also received a letter. Mrs Blackshaw said: 'On three occasions I have been left sat in the waiting room for an hour and a half with a screaming newborn baby. 'When I saw that the surgery had been praised I was shocked. I don't rate them. 'We're mothers of young children living in the village. It's the only surgery. I think they should take the criticism and use it to make the surgery better. 'People might receive that threatening letter and think they are being chucked out.' Another patient, Jenny Wheeldon, 34, was left upset by her letter, which came after she described months of poor service at the surgery in an online comment. She said: 'I have had mistake after mistake. I didn't think what I put was bad. It's our opinion - that's what social media is for.' Several more people say they have received the letter, signed by GP partner Dr Judith Cross, which argues that complaints should go through the proper channels. The letter says: 'The partners at the practice are aware of your comments and how you feel. We have zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face, over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients.' The letter invites recipients to speak to the patient liaison manager and one of the GP partners, but adds 'in the absence of such a meeting, it is felt you might give consideration to finding an alternative practice to receive your general medical services'. Response: The surgery's management says that it has a 'zero tolerance' on abuse and says patients should complain through them . A spokesman for Trent Meadows surgery said he was unable to comment on individual cases but said that the letter was proportionate. He said: 'While people do have a right to air their opinions on social media, practice staff feel we have a duty to protect the reputation of the practice from unfair criticism for the sake of our other patients and staff. 'Trent Meadows Medical Practice takes all patient comments seriously. If any patient has a concern or complaint, we offer the opportunity to contact the surgery through its complaints procedure.' Trent Meadows was one of the first GP practices in the country to be inspected and awarded a rating of 'good' by the inspectors.","Surgery near Burton has accused online critics of 'inappropriate behaviour'

"An overweight woman was spurred into losing four stone after she found a text on her boyfriend's phone describing her as an 'embarrassment'. Amy Jones, from Winsford, Cheshire, had no idea that her partner felt that way and the text was such a shock that she decided to make a positive change. Before finding the message, the 21-year-old says her boyfriend had always been supportive of her as her weight spiralled to more than 15 stone after they set up home together. Another turning point came for Amy when this picture was taken of her at her father's wedding, she cried when she saw the picture saying she looked almost as big as the tractor . Amy Jones was inspired to lose more than four stone after she found a cruel messages on her boyfriend's phone calling her weight an embarrassment.  Pictured: Amy before her weight loss (left) Amy now (right) Then one day she discovered his true feelings - expressed in a text message to a mutual friend. 'She is massive - she is an embarrassment,' said the message which inspired Amy to go a body blitz which has seen her lose four-and-a-half stone, going down to 10st 11lb. She went down from a size 18 to a shapely size 10 and lost 38cm of fat from her body. Amy, 21, says that although they had their fall-outs she had never suspected that her weight would be an issue. 'It had always been a pretty volatile relationship and we did argue a lot. But my boyfriend was always very supportive when it came to my weight.' Amy was horrified when she found the text to a mutual friend that read: 'She is massive - she is an embarrassment' spurring her on to make a huge change to her lifestyle . Amy added that he would even compliment her on her size and discouraged her from losing weight. 'He always said that I looked fantastic and he liked me with a fuller figure when I asked him if I should lose weight. 'I was reassured by his comments even though I knew that I was getting out of shape. 'The reason why I had got so much fatter was because I had moved in with him. 'He was a body builder who was down the gym all the time. After switching her diet Amy lost almost a quarter of her body weight in less than a year . 'I would basically eat the same meals as him and then not go down the gym.' Amy's weight shot up until it reached 15st 4lb when she attended her dad Martin's wedding in Swindon last year. She was pictured standing in front of a tractor looking larger than she had ever been. When she saw the picture in the weeks after the wedding, she realised she badly need to turn things around. After discovering her boyfriend's text Amy split up with him but the pair have remained friends . Amy said: 'I cried when I saw the picture - I was so badly out of shape, almost as big as the tractor! 'I had always been curvy but what was worrying was how much weight I was showing on my legs. 'I thought, ""This is not me - this is not who I want to be."" Then she discovered that hurtful text message and this was the final push she needed to turn her life around. But before she could think about losing any weight Amy knew the first thing she needed to do was to split with her boyfriend. She said: 'The text message was the final straw but things had been rocky before then. We split up but actually stayed friends afterwards. 'I don't harbour any grudge about the text message. He was only telling the truth. I just wish that he had been a bit more honest with me beforehand because I might not have got into such bad shape.' Amy was also advised by her mother Clare, 42, that she needed to lose weight. She said: 'Mum was being cruel to be kind. She told the truth as well and said I needed to change things fast.' Amy, who works as a PA, cut down her calories by no longer sharing calorie-laden meals with her body building ex. She stopped some of her dieting bad habits - notably eating a packet of crisps and a bar of Galaxy from the vending machine at work. Walkers Cheese & Onion Crisps, Galaxy bars, pasta, bread, vodka and Red Bull . Butternut squash soup, grilled chicken with vegetables, dried coconut snacks, Diet Coke. Amy also began to take a dietary supplement, Forza Raspberry K2s,  to curb her appetite and give her more energy. Amy says that once she began to shed the pounds she was inspired to continue losing almost a quarter of her body weight in less than a year. 'The weight just fell off me and I lost more four-and-a-half stone in less than six months. I am now down to just under 10-stone and a size 10. 'I am not going to stop here, though. I would like to get down to a size 8.'","Amy Jones' weight spiralled out of control after moving in with her partner .

"‘There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress,’ Charles Dickens wrote about having to chasing a hat in The Pickwick Papers. But in the modern world, the same could easily be said about repeatedly forgetting an important password. Now researchers have turned to the great Victorian author to help find a way of making passwords both secure and more memorable. Researchers have turned to the works of Charles Dickens (illustrated) to generate secure but memorable passwords according to new research by US-based computer scientists. They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords . They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords. The process works by looking for two characters that commonly appear together but then generating a third letter that does not. Millions of internet users still rely upon easy-to-crack passwords such as ‘qwerty’ and ‘123456’, but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts. However, a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise. Researchers have shown that passwords such as ‘mnbvcxz’, ‘qaz2wsx’ and ‘adgjmptw’ can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength. The analysis was made by hosting firm WP Engine using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant Mark Burnett. They spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people. For example, ‘qaz2wsx’ was in the top 30. They also noticed that a website called Zxcvbn scored these words as zero, or low, for so-called entropy. Entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of ‘information entropy’. This comes from information theory and is measured in bits. The more bits a word is assigned, based on the number of guesses it would take to crack, the stronger the password. Other words that received a low score include ‘qwertyuiop’, ‘1qaz2wsx’ and ‘zxcvbnm’. This is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard, known as ‘keyboard walks’. The same approach is used to generate the third character using the second and third letter and so on. The result is 56-bit passwords that look like English but are not, making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess. Among the examples produced by the approach from the Tale of Two Cities were: 'The cusay is wither?' and 'Ther highly to a vice of eart'. This password would be entered as they are typed above, including spaces. According to Dr John Clements, a computer and software engineer at the California Polytechnic State University who devised the approach, these are easier to remember than random strings of letters and characters that are often recommended by password generators. He said: 'Users are very bad at choosing passwords. 'Today, the general assumption - evidenced by the lack of systems using randomly assigned passwords - is that users cannot be expected to recall secure passwords . 'If we’re convinced that random passwords are a good idea, and that recalling a 56-bit password is at least within the realm of possibility, we must try to find a set of passwords that are as memorable as possible.' Research on passwords has shown that most people tend to use letters or words that are easiest for them to remember. Mark Burnett, a Utah-based password researcher who recently published a list of 10 million passwords taken from those shared over the internet, found that the most commonly used password is 123456 followed by the word password. Others tend to use their own name or use a password that is identical to their username. These are easy to break as most hackers will use easy to remember passwords when trying to break into an account. They will also tend to use real words when attempting to guess someones password. The graph above shows the distribution of letters following 'ca' in Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. Among the examples produced by the approach from the Tale of Two Cities include: 'The cusay is wither?' and 'Ther highly to a vice of eart'. These would be entered as they are typed, including spaces . 1. 123456 . 2. password . 3. 12345 . 4. 12345678 . 5. qwerty . 6. 1234567890 . 7. 1234 . 8. baseball . 9. dragon . 10. football . 11. 1234567 . 12. monkey . 13. letmein . 14. abc123 . 15. 111111 . 16. mustang . 17. access . 18. shadow . 19. master . 20. michael . 21. superman . 22. 696969 . 23. 123123 . 24. batman . 25. trustno1 . Source: Mark Burnett . Online security experts recommend using a random string of letters, numbers and characters that use both upper and lower case letters. An eight-character password generated in this way can produce around 72 quadrillion possible variations - making it virtually impossible to guess. However, these are difficult to remember. Dr Clements' approach, which was highlighted by the magazine New Scientist, uses Markov models which are a way of generating random states based on states that currently exist. In the approach he took, two letters like 'ca' may appear together in a piece of text, then the chance that they are followed by the letter 'r' is 278/1397 for example. However the chance of those two letters being followed by the letter 'f' or 'x' is far less in that piece of text. By randomly generating letters using an algorthim that selects those letters based on meeting certain pobability rules of it appearing with the two preceeding letters in a piece of text, the method produces random but familiar looking passwords. Dr Clements said that the approach is not just limited to the works of Dickens. Indeed it could be used to generate passwords from a person's own emails, for example. He said: 'Naturally, the choice of A Tale of Two Cities is largely arbitrary - any corpus of reasonable length will suffice. 'One intriguing possibility would be to choose the full text of all of the e-mails in a particular user’s history. 'This text would presumably reflect the style of text that a particular user is accustomed to read and write, and should in principle be extraordinarily memorable.'","Computer expert applied probability theory to Dickens' Tale of Two Cities .

"She's suddenly been thrust into the limelight after accusing a talent show contestant of stealing someone else's style - but according to users on Twitter, Natalia Kills's own look is far from original. The Bradford-born singer, 28, was fired from the judging panel of New Zealand's X Factor, along with her husband Willy Moon, after accusing hopeful Joe Irvine of copying her spouse on Sunday's show. However, viewers have taken to social media to point out that Natalia  appears to have turned  to a range of different artists including Jessie J, Lady Gaga and even Johnny Depp for fashion tips of her own. Scroll down for video . Natalia launched an angry tirade at X Factor New Zealand contestant Joe Irvine, she said that she was 'disgusted,' at the fact that she thought he looked like her husband, Willy Moon . Natalia launched into a tirade at Joe on the first of the live shows, saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.' Natalia's comments seemed to be based around the fact that Joe had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit, a look favoured by her fellow judge - and husband of ten months - Willy. Yet users on Twitter soon posted pictures that showed how Natalia's own  hair and make-up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by Lily Allen and Elizabeth Taylor. Some of the the funnier comparisons include Johnny Depp in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Lord Farquaad from Shrek. She's even been compared to astrologer Mystic Meg and Lady Gaga. Twitter users were quick to comment on the fact that many of Natalia's looks seem to have been influenced by other people, this hilarious example compares her to Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory . Natalia has also been accused of stealing looks from Lady Gaga, these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles . In one picture comparison on Twitter, Natalia's bun, blunt fringe and cat eye make-up looks similar to a look worn by Lady Gaga. While other shots showed pictures of Natalia posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of Lady Gaga's own photo poses. Another black and white shot of Natalia sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples, miming having a gun pointing to her head. Singer MIA also posed the same way in a black and white photograph. But when asked about Natalia's look being similar to other celebrities' style, a spokesperson for her said: 'I have known and worked with Natalia for over 15 years - she speaks from her heart and says what's she's feeling. 'She's a very talented and passionate young lady. Natalia has always had her own style and many leading international designers are always sending her outfits.' This montage of pictures shows Natalia looking strikingly similar to Lady Gaga (right), Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra (center) and the singer MIA (left) Another funny example compared Natalia to Lord Farquaad, an animated character from the hit movie Shrek . But in her X Factor attack last night, Natalia, who was born Natalia Noemi Keery-Fisher, lambasted Irvine further,  saying: 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' Irvine, who was appearing on the first live episode looked visibly upset by her comments and at one point seemed to be fighting back the tears. Her husband Willy Moon, from Wellington, who she married last May,added:  'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. 'It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' This user joked that the cartoon character Dore The Explorer would be mad that Natalia had stolen her hairstyle . There has been several posts which compare Natalia to Lady Gaga, here the pair shares a similar hair style and sunglasses to the singer . And Natalia's outburst wasn't the first time she had raised eyebrows while filming the X Factor. When she first joined the show she was criticised after one round of auditions in Auckland where she apparently swore and screamed at audience members, which included children. At the time a representative for the show confirmed the incident saying: 'During a long day of filming, The X Factor NZ judge Natalia Kills expressed frustration at the behaviour of some sections of the audience. 'Her words were not well chosen, and both Natalia and TV3 apologise for any offence caused.' Since being dropped from the talent show, Natalia  tweeted saying: 'I love you guys, thanks for your support & understanding my passionate opinions! You know what they say about me...' She added a link to her video for her song Problem which includes the chorus, 'That girl is a problem.' Natalia's hair has been compared to Jessie J (centre) and even Mystic Meg (left) This Twitter user joked that Madonna had called and wanted her hair back . But who is this controversial singer and songwriter who, despite working with Madonna and the DJ David Guetta, until last night was barely known in her home country? Born in West Yorkshire, the grammar school girl travelled extensively with her parents between Jamaica, the UK and Spain. She became a child actress aged nine and appeared in the BBC's All About Me, voiced Amy Franks in the Radio 4 soap The Archers and made appearances in Casualty, Doctors and Coronation Street. Her father experienced a spell in prison and at the age of 14 she left home and began pursuing a music career in earnest in 2003. Natalia said: 'I moved out when I was almost 15 and spent my whole teenage years with no money, fighting with my boyfriend, joining a cult and getting in trouble with the police.' She has spoken about having suffered with depression and having been suicidal in her younger years. And, when in 2013 she released her album Trouble she told Life and Times that she wanted to use it to confess all the bad things she had ever done. According to Kills these included: 'Stalking my ex-boyfriend, trying to set fire to the house with us both in it, getting taken away by the police, leaving home at 15, making out with strangers and running away to Paris.' During the X Factor Natalia sat next her to her husband Willy Moon who also had some choice words for X Factor contestant Joe Irvine . She told Digital Spy: 'I remember when I was 19, I loved my boyfriend who didn't love me back so much - disturbingly much - that every time he hurt me I just desperately wanted to jump off the highest bridge I could find, or walk into the fastest truck. 'I was just completely out of control of my erratic feelings of love and passionate desperation.' Yet Natalia has admitted in the past that she feels remorse over her actions, telling Electrocutie Music that her album Trouble was inspired by her rocky life: 'You know what? I do have regrets. 'The album is actually full of regret. There was a point where I left home and was trying to be a grown-up. I had an awful boyfriend who treated me badly. 'I wound up in a religious cult that I was in for a few years. It kind of shaped my mind to be good and do the right thing. I felt like “doing good” went against my inner nature.' She is yet to comment on whether she regrets the comments she made on last night's X Factor.","Singer Natalia Kills, 28, was fired from New Zealand X Factor after tirade .

"Should a man pay for dinner while on a date with a woman? As if the dating game wasn't difficult enough, this issue has now become a minefield for men and women over the last few years. As females fight for equality on all terms, stars like Emma Watson have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way. But others, like Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton say that a man SHOULD look after a woman - in her new blog for Babycentre, the singer explains why Emma's stance on male chivalry is wrong. Natasha Hamilton with her boyfriend Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive . Natasha, who is currently dating Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive, said: 'What is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘chivalry’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay? 'This is not a weakness on either side, it’s about letting a man be a considerate, generous, kind human being. Why emasculate him? It’s unnecessary. 'This just puts more pressure on women.' Natasha goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world, so through no fault of their own,females bring home much less money than their male counterparts. She said: 'I recently took part in the TV show The Big Reunion, which was a great success. 'But the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon.' Actress Emma Watson recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward . Natasha continued: 'There are so many expectations placed on women now. 'If shows like Ex-On-the-Beach are anything to go by, its common place for lads to think they can “bang” as many “birds” as they want, like we’re pieces of meat. 'This is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today. 'On top of this, now it’s being suggested girls “pick up their own tab”. Well, it just gets rosier for men doesn’t it?' Natasha Hamilton (left) with her Atomic Kitten band mates Jenny Frost (centre) and Liz McClarnon (right) in 2003 . In fact, Natasha believes that in the 21st Century, it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex. She said: 'I personally think that men should look after women. That is not a weakness. 'By allowing them to do that, it may create more empathy and stop some men viewing women as “bangable” pieces of meat. 'I fully expect my three boys to be respectful, kind and generous to their future partners too.'","Emma Watson tried to pay for meal on date and it made the mood awkward .

"Grieving relatives of the two Australians killed when a Germanwings Airbus was flown into a mountain in the French Alps have visited the memorial in a French village near the crash site. Relatives of Carol Friday, 68, and her 29-year-old son Greig, both from Melbourne, flew to Europe this weekend and drove into the alps on Monday. Carol Friday's brother Malcolm Coram and his daughters Georgie and Pippa laid yellow and green Australian flowers, poems and messages at the memorial. Melbourne man Coram, who lost his sister and nephew in the Germanwings disaster, says he is not angry about what happened and feels sorry for the parents of the co-pilot accused of deliberately crashing an Airbus A320 into the French Alps. Mr Coram is preferring to think of the crash as an accident for now because it's too painful to contemplate his relatives were murdered. Scroll down for video . Carol Friday's brother Malcolm Coram and his daughters Georgie (right) and Pippa (left) laid yellow and green Australian flowers, poems and messages at the scene . Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, enroute from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight . Carol Friday and her son Greig died almost a week ago when, prosecutors say, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane he was flying. The passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday. Mr Coram on Monday visited a memorial to them and the other 147 victims in the tiny French village of Le Vernet, near the crash site. The refrigeration mechanic was joined by his daughters, Georgina and Philippa, who are nurse Carol's nieces and acoustic engineer Greig's cousins. 'I'd dearly love to go up and just visit (the crash site) but we obviously can't,' Mr Coram told reporters after laying flowers at the modest stone memorial. 'This is as close as we're going to get. 'It was very, very sad. You just sort of look at it (the memorial) and say a few words like 'I love you'.' The brother of Carol Friday and uncle of Greig Friday, Malcolm Coram (centre), and his two daughters Philippa (left) and Georgina (right), make a statement . The family spoke about the death of Mr Coram's sister Carol Friday and nephew Greig Friday at the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern France, on Monday . Australians Carol Friday and her son Greig were killed when Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 crashed en-route to Dusseldorf, Germany on Tuesday March 24 . French officials say the co-pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft but the family are treating it as an accident . Mr Coram said the entire family, including Carol's husband Dave, was in shock. 'Dave lost half his family in one second,' he said, before adding: 'You feel sorry for the parents of the pilot. Wow, how would you feel if your child did that?' Carol's other two brothers have remained in Australia 'still in denial', Mr Coram said. 'We have decided to treat this as an accident at this stage and thus deny the perpetrator his wishes. 'There's never going to be conclusive proof of what happened. We like to think of it that way. It helps for us. 'It's better off being calm ... there's no point being angry. It's happened.' The Corams will stay in the Alps for a few days. They have some paintings by Carol of the Australian bush they plan to leave at the memorial on Tuesday. Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering . A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart' They'll also read poems and letters from other family and friends. Mr Coram then wants to return in September when he could reach the crash site on a new road being built to allow all-terrain vehicles to help transport body parts and remove some of the larger pieces of the Airbus. 'I hope to get more members of the family over here in the next few months,' he said on Monday. Dave Friday and the couple's daughter Alex were too devastated to travel to France this week. Investigators have described the difficulty of searching the site as 'unprecedented' due to a combination of mountainous terrain and the violence of the impact. Lubitz was treated for suicidal tendencies 'several years ago' before he received his pilot's licence, German prosecutors said Monday. But while they've declared the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane, Georgina Coram believes treating it as an accident, for now, makes coping a little easier. 'The enormity of it right now - with that added emotion - was too much for us at this stage,' she told reporters. Relatives of the victims of the air crash visit the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern, France . Relatives of Australian victims of the crash of a Germanwings Airbus A320 answer journalists' questions as they arrive at a funary stele set in Seyne-les-Alpes, the closest accessible site of the crash . Flowers laid for the victims of the plane crash in Germany on Friday . 'Maybe down the track we'll be able to process the anger that comes up with thinking that someone did this on purpose and it's essentially murder.' Georgina said both Carol and Greig loved the outdoors and it helped to know 'that their final resting place is at least somewhere beautiful'. Since the plane crash, Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues. Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.' Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others. Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit. 'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said. A helicopter flies over the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes, French Alps . Part of the writing on the fuselage of the plane is visible on a piece of the wreckage (centre) on the mountainside . The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer. 'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read. Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English. Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering. 'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said. 'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled. 'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said. 'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights. 'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.'","Carol Friday and her son Greig were among the 150 people killed .

"Police are hunting gunmen who shot dead three models in Honduran capital Tegucigalpa, after forcing them from their car and making them lie in the road. Alma Mariela Vargas, 28, from San Marcos de Colón, Madelyn Ramirez Zambrano, 21, and Blanca Velasquez Alejandra Mejia, 20, both from San Pedro Sula, were being driven in a Toyota SUV in the Valle de Angeles area of the city when they were attacked. Their car was apparently intercepted by gunmen in a car and a motorcycle on Sunday morning. Forensic staffers and policemen stand at the site where three models were shot dead in the Valle de Angeles municipality in Tegucigalpa . Models Madelyn Ramirez Zambrano (left) and Blanca Velasquez Alejandra Mejia (right) were both killed by gunmen in Honduras . Alma Mariela Vargas was killed in a cold-blooded execution with two other models on Sunday morning . They were forced out and executed in cold blood, police said. A man and another woman in their party were injured in the shootout and taken to Escuela Hospital for treatment. Police found 15 bullet casings at the scene, according to Laprensa.hn. An official said that one of the gunmen asked for one of the models by name before the murders took place. She was shot first before the other two were killed, he said. The tragedy followed the arrest in Honduras of Jose Miguel ""Chepe"" Handal, the alleged leader of a drug trafficking organization that coordinated the shipment of tons of Colombian cocaine via Mexican cartels to the United States. Handal, a prominent Honduran businessman, was taken into custody without a struggle in the northwestern city of San Pedro Sula on Thursday near a hospital where his father was receiving treatment, President Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a television interview. Police found 15 bullet casings at the scene, according to a Honduran newspaper report . Hernandez said Honduran judges would likely be in charge of the case because there has not yet been an extradition request from the United States. Since 2013, the U.S. government has identified Handal as a drug trafficking kingpin who supplied Colombian cocaine to Mexico's Sinaloa and rival Los Zetas cartels using clandestine airstrips as well as land-based routes into Guatemala, where the Mexican gangs have a presence. Handal's father and his wife were also designated as leaders of the organization by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""After several months of searching, today Chepe Handal has been detained and will now be judged,"" Hernandez said in a post on his Twitter page. Drug-related violence in Honduras has increased in recent years since Mexico's drug cartels expanded there, enlisting Honduran gangs and using its Caribbean coast to transport South American cocaine to consumers in the United States.","Police are hunting gunmen who shot dead three models in Tegucigalpa .

"An obese mother starved to death after being left unable to keep food down by gastric weight-loss surgery. Angela Jones from Portsmouth underwent a gastric bypass in 2010 at Spires Southampton Hospital after ballooning to 26 stone. The mother of two had been suffering arthritis and struggled to exercise for much of her life. But within days of the operation the 42-year-old showed signs of complications, struggling to keep food down despite being given anti-nausea pills. Over the following years she was rushed in and out of hospital, with doctors forced to insert feeding tubes to keep her alive. Angela Jones died after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The 42-year-old dropped from 24 stone (left) to just four in as many years.She died in March 2014 a few months after being photographed (right) In March 2014, weighing  20 stone less than when she underwent the surgery, the mother of two died. Her daughter Chantel has since told of how she wished her mother had never had the operation at all. 'I’ll never be able to forget the horror of how mum died. She thought the gastric bypass would be the start of a new life when she’d finally have the slim figure she always dreamed of,' she said. 'Yet by the end she was so thin, just a living skeleton confined to a wheelchair. 'She just faded away in front of my eyes. I won’t ever get over it.' 'I speak on behalf of the whole family when I say people often mistakenly think these operations are the answer to being obese. 'But the truth is we believe my mum would still be alive if she hadn’t had this done.' Mrs Jones, a former carer, struggled with her weight after being unable to exercise for much of her life, her daughter added. The mother of two with daughters Melissa (left) and Chantel (right). The women begged their mother not to undergo the surgery but had their fears dismissed when she believed doctors' advice, they said . Mrs Jones struggled with her weight for most of her life after being born with hip problems which made it difficult for her to exercise . 'Mum had always been overweight. She was born with a hip problems and developed arthritis that made exercise difficult.' Despite 'adoring' Chinese takeaways the mother of two made several attempts to lose weight. 'She tried every diet going but she just simply couldn't maintain her weight loss and whenever she lost a stone she‘d put it all back on again and more. Aged 37, her weight peaked at 26 stone. At just 4ft 9in, this gave Mrs Jones a BMI of 79, 49 points above the official classification for someone who is obese. The 42-year-old was in and out of hospital for three after having the operation. Above, she is at a healthy weight despite complications . After having treatment for a range of weight-related problems, doctors urged the woman to consider more drastic action. 'The doctors were blunt. In hindsight they frightened her into wanting the surgery,' said Chantel, 19. 'They said she would die without an operation. At the same time (my sister) Melissa and I were growing up and she longed to be slim and buy normal clothes. 'She was fed up of ordering outsize stuff and dreamed of accompanying us on clothes shopping trips.' Chantel and her sister begged their mother to avoid the surgery but say they were dismissed because she trusted doctors advice. After dropping two stone naturally, Mrs Jones underwent the procedure in hospital in 2010. Despite being unable to keep food down afterwards, doctors insisted she would recover, and sent her home. Yet despite being prescribed anti nausea drugs, the sickness continued. 'All her food had to be liquidised because she couldn't swallow any lumps at all. It was heartbreaking to see her having to drink her meals. Even then, often she still couldn’t keep anything down.' Within three months her weight had dropped to 18 stone. 'Mum was delighted about the weight loss but doctors were worried she was losing too much weight too fast.' Over the next six months Mrs Jones became gradually thinner, encountering a range of ailments including pancreatitis along the way. In March 2011, a year after the operation, she was rushed to hospital weighing just four stone - an astonishing 20 stone less than the previous year. There a feeding tube was directly inserted through her side into her stomach while doctors urgently tried to reverse some of the gastric bypass to allow Angela to eat more. 'She was in hospital for two months and when she came home it was terrible as not only could she still only eat liquidised food, she had to go through the indignity of being fed via a tube into her stomach every day,' said Chantel. 'Being fed through her stomach took ten hours of being hooked up to a machine – it was no life at all.' The stress of her health problems put pressure on her marriage to Chantel's father, Bryan, and he later left the family home. 'I would sit there begging mum to eat. In desperation I’d even try spoon-feeding her like a baby. 'But by now because every time she ate, she’d be sick, she’d developed a fear of food. She’d cry and in tears say she just couldn’t manage it. The 42-year-old became too frail to eat her own food and eventually contracted pneumonia. She is pictured at her daughter's wedding (top left) and in her home (right) in some of the last photographs taken of her . 'It broke our hearts.' In November that year, after being rushed to hospital having collapsed, Mrs Jones was told her organs were shutting down. She returned home two weeks later but was in and out of hospital over the next two years. In March 2014 Chantel woke up to find her mother had passed out on the sofa. She was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to revive her. Over 6,500 weight loss procedures are currently performed in the UK every year with gastric bypass one of the most common operations. This number is set to increase with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE) recommending the NHS should offer even more weight loss surgery to thousands more people to tackle the growing obesity epidemic. It works by inserting a small pouch at the top of the stomach. This is then connected to a section of the small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel. This means that it will take less food to make you feel full. Gastric bypass surgery is often favoured over gastric band surgery by doctors. This is because unlike a band – which temporarily makes the stomach smaller and can be removed - it is permanent. The patient and gives better weight loss results for the very obese. But devastatingly, three days later she died. A post mortem found Angela’s problems began when she had the bypass. 'A lack of food led to her losing too much weight and her body not being fed vital nutrients,' said Chantel. 'She was so frail she couldn't fight off any infection and finally died from pneumonia she'd picked up during a hospital stay. 'The gastric bypass starved her to death. She was skin and bone when she went.' The young mother, who welcomed baby Ruby-Mae seven months ago, said doctors did not properly warn her mother of the risks involved. 'Doctors presented this operation to mum as the answer to all her problems. If mum had been told all of the risks she never would have agreed to go ahead. 'We don’t feel the risk of severe side effects, which can be fatal, were ever properly explained to mum. 'We bitterly regret my mum ever allowed doctors to persuade her having weight loss surgery was the answer to her obesity problem.' 'I only hope telling mum’s tragic story makes anyone else think twice before having gastric surgery. 'If it stops just one person going through the same nightmare, it will be worth it.'","Angela Jones, 46, died in March last year three years after gastric bypass .

"Michelle Obama urged Cambodian students to finish their education, follow their dreams and speak up to demand greater freedoms and more equality in their Southeast Asian country. The US first lady did not explicitly criticize Cambodia's human rights record or its government, which has been ruled for 30 years by authoritarian strongman Hun Sen, the prime minister. But she sent a pointed message, and one that she delivered seated beside Hun Sen's wife, Bun Rany. Scroll down for video . Michelle Obama hugs Sohang Vean, a student at a local high school she was visiting to encourage women in the country to continue their educations . Mrs Obama (left) was accompanied on her visit by strongman Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's wife Bun Rany (right) A traditional gesture of head bowed with hands pressed together (right) was used by the First Lady to greet students at the school in Siem Reap, in the country's north . Mrs Obama is on a five-day trip to Asia to promote the US-led education initiative 'Let Girls Learn,' which she and the president announced earlier this month. The community-based program, to be run by the Peace Corps, is meant to help millions of girls in the developing world stay in school and overcome economic or cultural pressures that force many to drop out. 'Let Girls Learn' is starting in 11 countries, including Cambodia. Mrs Obama's visit follows a three-day trip to Japan, which is helping to fund the project. The First Lady, pictured,  concluded her tours of Japan and Cambodia and returned to the United States . Mrs Obama almost suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction as she boarded the aircraft home . Mrs Obama spent five days travelling south east Asia in a bid to promote female education . The trip has given the first lady, who is traveling without her husband, a chance to soak up some of Asia's rich culture. In Japan, she visited Buddhist and Shinto shrines, and in Cambodia she traveled to Siem Reap, home to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex. At a high school outside of Siem Reap, Mrs Obama greeted students with a traditional Cambodian gesture of hands pressed together with a head bow. Only 20 percent of Cambodian children finish secondary school, but the rates are even lower for young women . Mrs Obama spoke to the girls about the importance of education as part of the Let Girls Learn program, which targets gender equality in developing countries . She walked the compound's dirt paths and then met with ten girls who shared tales of rising early to feed their families and help with farming before heading off on long treks to school and studying late into the night. 'You are role models to the world,' said Mrs Obama, seated on a wooden school chair beside the students and Cambodia's first lady. Education brings empowerment, she added, and urged the teens to 'finish your education and then follow your dreams.' 'Use your voices to advocate for good things — whether it's more education, better health care, more freedoms, more equality,' she said. 'Not just here in Cambodia, not just here in Siem Reap, but in the world. I hope that you all will feel empowered to do that.' As Mrs Obama spoke, Bun Rany smiled and made no comment. However, she expressed Cambodia's 'full support' for the education initiative, and said the government was giving priority to female students for state scholarships. She later said through an interpreter that women should pursue education and 'don’t just belong in the kitchen,' according to the Phnom Penh Post. Mrs Obama's trip marks the first by a sitting American first lady to Cambodia. Cambodian first lady Bun Rany (right) remained silent during remarks that could be seen as criticism of her country and husband, though she later said that she supported education for girls . The Cambodian first lady later said through an interpreter that women, including those in her country, 'don’t just belong in the kitchen' The First Lady's visit to Cambodia (pictured) follows a three day trip to Japan on a quick Asian tour without the president . Mrs Obama also spoke to volunteers of the Peace Corps program, which is administering the Let Girls Learn schools throughout the world . Barack Obama became the first US president to visit Cambodia in 2012, and pressed Prime Minister Hun Sen in private on a variety of human rights and political issues during a meeting that White House officials described as tense. Hun Sen is one of the world's longest-serving heads of state, and has been regularly criticized by political opponents and human rights groups for monopolizing power and brutally crushing dissent. His supporters say he has helped stabilize the country, which is still haunted by a 1970s genocide that saw nearly 2 million people die under the ultra-communist Khmer Rouge regime. During its brutal reign, the Khmer Rouge closed schools and executed intellectuals among its many victims. Foreign aid and investment have helped the economy grow rapidly in the past decade, but the education system and overall development remain stunted. Even today, most Cambodian children drop out of school. According to 2014 statistics from the Education Ministry, 95 percent of children enter primary school, but only 20 percent finish secondary school. Mrs Obama also took a tour of Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap and took a picture with the pool that reflects the monument . The Angkor Wat temple complex was first built in the 12th century by the Khmer empire and has functioned as both a Hindu and Buddhist house of worship . Mrs Obama wore trainers to walk around on the dusty paths of the temple while accompanied by her guide . Poverty is the main problem, especially in rural areas, where families can't afford the minimal costs of education and keep children home to help support the family, according to UNICEF. Cambodia's problems with child prostitution, child labor and human trafficking also play a role, and often target girls. After meeting students Saturday, Mrs Obama spoke to a group of US Peace Corps volunteers who will be running the global project and called on them to share American values with their students. 'Values like equality, inclusiveness, fairness, openness ... aren't just American values, we know this. They are universal human values,' she said. 'When girls get educated, when they learn to read and write and think, that gives them the tools to speak up and talk about injustice and demand equal treatment. It helps them participate in the political life of their country and hold their leaders accountable.' To wrap up the day, the first lady changed into casual clothes, sneakers and sunglasses and toured Angkor Wat, Cambodia's grandest monument, built in the 12th century by the Khmer empire. A tour guide led her to one of the area's popular photo stops, where the temple's iconic towers are mirrored in a reflecting pool. 'It's beautiful,' Mrs Obama said. 'It's amazing.' The first lady began her journey home on Sunday. The First Lady climbed up steep steps to view the elaborate carvings at Angkor Wat, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Mrs Obama, who used the help of a handrail to come down the steps of Angkor Wat, has concluded her five-day journey .","First Lady inspires young girls but does not criticize strongman PM .

"If you've ever gone out, got drunk and made ill-advised calls to exes, friends or family you'll know the dread and embarrassment that sets in the morning after. But now an app has been developed to save you from such shame. Drunk Mode lets you block certain contacts for a period of up to 12 hours while on a night out and only unlocks these numbers if you can solve maths puzzles. Before a night out, users of the Drunk Mode app select which contacts they want to block. They then choose the timeframe (left), which ranges from three to 12 hours. If an attempt is made to contact the blocked number a 'Drunk Quiz' appears that asks them to solve an equation (right) Drunk Mode was built by Indiana-based developers from Launch LLC. Before a night out users select which contacts they want to block and for how long. This ranges from three hours up to 12. If an attempt is made to call or message a blocked contact a 'Drunk Quiz' pop-up appears. This reveals how long is left on the Drunk Mode clock and says: 'If you're ready to disable Drunk Mode please solve the following equation.' One example is shown as '571 + 332 + 57'. Users can additionally enter a list of 'Drinking buddies' and track their movements on the app (left).

Last year, developer Bruce Yang unveiled the Sobrr app. It lets users post as many drunken updates and photos as they like, before they're automatically deleted after 24 hours. It even deletes friendships that the user made overnight, too. The self-destruct feature is similar to Snapchat and Facebook’s Slingshot, but the developers claim Sobrr is different because photos are only shared within the user’s geographic area. After an answer is entered, the user clicks 'Submit disable attempt' to unblock the contact. If the answer is entered incorrectly and they try to call the contact again, a new equation appears. Users can additionally enter a list of friends, or 'Drinking buddies', they are out with and track their movements on the app. These friends need to be fellow Drunk Mode users but can be selected from the phone's contacts list or Facebook.

"A 13-year-old boy shot dead his six-year-old brother and wounded his older brother in an argument about food while their mother was at work. The shooting happened shortly after 6pm in Hudson, in the westernmost end of Pasco County, Florida, in the family's mobile home. The three brothers were home alone eating dinner when the argument broke out, said Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco. The shooting happened just after 6pm in the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park on Bachmann Avenue, Hudson . They lived in the home with their mother and an 18-year-old brother. The mother was at work and the oldest brother was not at home. The shooter shot dead his younger brother and wounded his 16-year-old brother, who then called police for help. Sheriff Nocco said: 'This is a horrific scene. Sadly we talk about too many tragic situations that happen in Pasco County and this is a nightmare when you hear about the ages of these boys, a six-year-old that was probably playing in his room, an argument over food and he lost his life. 'This is tough on us as law enforcement, this is tough on a community. And for the friends of these two boys, this is going to be tough tomorrow for them at school.' The shooting took place at this mobile home park in Hudson, in Pasco County about an hour north of Tampa . An argument over food led to a 13-year-old boy to shoot two of his brothers, killing his younger brother . The County Sheriff Chris Nocco described the shootings as a 'nightmare' and 'tough on the community' He did not give the names of the shooter or victims and said it was not clear who owned the gun. The 16-year-old's wounds were not believed to be life-threatening and he is being treated at an area hospital. Neighbor Stephanie Ridgeway said: 'I don't understand it really. It doesn't make any sense.' Linda Cobbe, spokeswoman for the Pasco County School District, said: 'We're devastated that this would happen to such young children, and we are prepared to provide whatever services are needed at their schools.' The shootings happened about two miles away from the location of another family slaying. In August, three members of a family and a fourth man were discovered dead. The ex-boyfriend of one of the victims is awaiting trial in connection to those deaths.","Shooting happened after 6pm in family's mobile home in Hudson, Florida .

"It's a complaint heard in grand houses up and down the country – they just can't get the staff. And it is a problem that even afflicts Downton Abbey as the producers prepare to shoot what will be the sixth – and final – season. So popular have its stars become that they are cashing in on 'the Downton Factor' to take up lucrative film and television jobs in America. The majority of the cast have spent the past few months auditioning in Hollywood, and a source said: 'Everyone connected with the show knows that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.' One LA producer said: 'I've had more than one agent for the stars of Downton coming on to me asking what is available. 'They've all been in town, trying to get their faces out there, trying to cash in on that goodwill and grab work while they can. 'The Downton Factor has become something of a joke in LA. You can't turn around at a dinner table without seeing another face from the series. 'Of course, most of the Downton cast are classically or theatre-trained, so there's no question that they can act. But the big question is can they prove they are more than one-hit wonders?' Here we take a look at those who have already gone west as part of the Downton brain drain... Scroll down for video .

"Ed Balls today ambushed George Osborne on live TV by forcing him to agree to take part in a head-to-head election debate on the economy. The Tories had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would-be Chancellors until the leaders' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely. But appearing together on BBC One, Mr Balls forced Mr Osborne to shake on the deal, raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day. Appearing together on BBC One, Ed Balls forced George Osborne to shake on the deal, raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day . Mr Balls insisted Prime Minister David Cameron may be 'scared' of a one-on-one debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband but he was up for the showdown with Mr Osborne. After he was put on the spot, the Chancellor shook Mr Balls's hand but suggested Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, should be included. Speaking on BBC One's the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Osborne said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place. Asked if he was keen on the debate, shadow chancellor Mr Balls replied: 'Of course, and I would like to go further. George and I don't need the broadcasters to sort these things out. Mr Osborne tried to claim that his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander should be included as well . 'George is not a coward. David Cameron doesn't want a head-to-head with Ed Miliband but I'm very happy - I will have a head-to-head debate, just the two of us, the potential chancellors during the election campaign. Addressing Mr Osborne, he said: 'You can say now - are you up for it?' The Chancellor replied: 'As I say, happy to have these chancellors' debate, just as we did in the last election.' Mr Balls extended his hand out to Mr Osborne to shake on a one-on-one debate, telling the Chancellor: 'Come on George, let's go for it.' Mr Osborne appeared hesitant, saying he would be happy to meet Mr Balls in a debate. He shook the shadow chancellor's hand, adding to Mr Balls: 'We're going to see who else wants to be part of it. I have got a very effective Chief Secretary who I think would also want to be part of that debate.' Mr Balls added: 'If only David Cameron was up for a one-to-one debate like George, it would be alright - for some reason David Cameron is running scared.' Mr Osborne said: 'I think we should include Danny Alexander.' Mr Balls countered: 'No, one-to-one. We just shook on it.' Speaking on BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Balls said he was unsure if Mr Osborne had agreed to the debate or not. He said: 'He started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head-to-head debate with me. By the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy Danny Alexander. 'It was clear and then it was unclear. I thought George Osborne was going to do what David Cameron has ducked for weeks and weeks. 'He started the handshake doing it - by the end, constructive ambiguity I think.' Labour's Ed Balls squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power-sharing deal with the SNP. A surge in support for the Scottish Nationalists looks set to deprive Labour of a majority and leave Nicola Sturgeon's MPs holding the balance of power. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today vowed never to enter coalition with a party which wanted to break up the union. Uncomfortable: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls appearing on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show today . But Mr Balls refused to match the promise, despite being challenged as many as 12 times during a TV interview. He would only say that Labour has 'no plans, no need, no desire' for a pact with the SNP. Challenged on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Balls said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country's deficit are 'completely wrong' and 'irresponsible'. But his opposition to the SNP did not stretch to categorically ruling out sitting in Cabinet with them. Told by Mr Marr to say the words ""I rule it out"", Mr Balls replied: ""Ed Miliband said it's nonsense. It's not part of our plans. 'You know Andrew, you've been covering politics for 30 years, parties, large parties at this stage say we're fighting for a majority and we are. 'I'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals. 'We're fighting for a majority.'","Labour shadow chancellor bounces his opponent into agreeing to contest .

"After a grim and heart-breaking funeral farewell for murdered schoolgirl Masa Vukotic on Thursday, friends and loved ones chose to celebrate her life with laughter, colour and style. The Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne were lit up by over 500 people dressed in pink and frills, donning bunny ears, bows and carrying bright balloons during 'Princess Marci's Royal Parade' on Saturday afternoon. Petar and Nadja Vukotic, Masa's brother and sister, also attended the event where they released 17 white doves for the 17-year-old.

Petar and Nadja Vukotic, Masa's brother and sister, also attended the event where they released 17 white doves for each year of their sister's life . The Canterbury Girls Secondary College student's father, Slavolijub Vukoti, was seen walking amongst the parade, dressed in black and carrying one of many pink balloons which were also released as part of the memorial walk.

Sean Price, 31, has been charged with Masa's murder as well as six other crimes . However mourners used the parade as a way to remember the 'loving', 'charismatic and hilarious young woman' whose love for the colour pink, Lolita Japanese fashion and Cosplay - the practice of dressing up as a character- was well known. 'This event is really us celebrating who Marci was, because as much as she would have loved for us to mourn for her, she also would have wanted us to come together and become stronger from this,' Melanie Givord, the event organiser, told The Age. The 16-year-old said Masa supported raising awareness about violence against women, adding that her death 'could have been prevented'. 'If this had of happened to someone else, she would have been so angry about it and she would have made sure everybody knew about it,' she said. Masa's father (left) and mother, Natasa Vukotic (centre), were consoled by mourners, friends and strangers who had been touched by their daughter's tragic death . Her family was presented with a memorial book that had been signed by attendees . The parade organisers also used the event to collected donations for The Rabbit Run-Away Orphanage .

'Marci had a passion for animal rights and for her pet rabbit Roger, and would always love to share with the world how adorable her little bunny was.' A funeral for the 17-year-old stabbing victim was held two days earlier at Springvale Botanical Cemetery. 'Marci had a passion for animal rights and for her pet rabbit Roger, and would always love to share with the world how adorable her little bunny was,' a notice for the event stated . This event is really us celebrating who Marci was, because as much as she would have loved for us to mourn for her, she also would have wanted us to come together and become stronger from this,' Melanie Givord, the event organiser said . Ms Givord described Masa as a feminist who would have wanted to raise awareness about violence against women . The bright colours and lighter atmosphere were a stark contrast tot the emotional funeral held for Masa on Thursday . 'I never got to tell Masa just how important she was to me although I know in my heart she knew how much I loved her,' Nadja said. 'Darling Masa, I love you so much and that will never change. You may be gone but you will never be forgotten.' During the packed service, Slabvoljub Vukotic, wearing a pink pocket handkerchief, promised his daughter the family would try to be brave in the days and weeks to come. 'We will try to be as brave and courageous as you were....I promise I will come to you one day but until then my heart bleeds for you,' Mr Vukotic said. Masa Vukotic, 17, was farewelled at a public funeral in Melbourne on Thursday . Her siblings Nadja (right, holding her sister's portrait) and Petar walked out of the chapel surrounded by 400 mourners . Her distressed mother Natasa was overcome with emotion when Masa's coffin was carried out of the chapel . Hundreds of mourners gathered at Melbourne's Springvale Botanical Cemetery on Thursday for the funeral . Masa's mother Natasa then managed to take to the podium to make a heart-felt promise to her daughter. 'From the first moment I looked into your eyes, you were my most precious Masa. I know this is not our final goodbye. I will race to you with open arms and say to you 'come to your mum'.' 'With every sunrise and every sunset you will be in my soul and you will be in my heart.' 'I will love you as I always have…. I will always think pink.' Her school friends, many who wearing pink ribbons in their hair and arms, created a sea of pink flowers outside the chapel. During the service, Slabvoljub Vukotic, wearing a pink pocket handkerchief, promised his daughter the family would try to be brave in the days and weeks to come . Masa, a student at Canterbury Girls Secondary College, was stabbed to death as she walked near her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east last Tuesday night . While Masa's life was much too short, life is not measured by the number of breaths you take but by the number of breaths that take your breath away. Masa had many breath-taking moments in her life. She was born on December 1 1997. Since birth she was bursting with life, vitality and passion. She was 17, sparking, outgoing, funny, intelligent and simply one of a kind. Masa loved life and was eager to embrace all it had to offer. As a perfectionist she excelled in everything she did but she especially love reading, travelling and spending time with her family and friends. The devastated family of murdered Melbourne teenager Masa Vukotic have issued a deeply moving statement about losing their 'ambitious, passionate' daughter and sister . She loved to dance and perform. She loved Cosplay. For those of you who don't know what that is Cosplay is a performance art where costumes and fashion accessories represent a specific character or idea. Masa had more costumes and accessories than anyone. She used to take her mum shopping and she'd always buy another dress to take home and add to her collection. Masa also had an unrivalled love for fashion which she said she developed as a baby as a result of her mum changing her outfit three or four times a day to take baby photos. On a recent trip to Paris and Montenegro she managed to pack, among many other things, four heavy winter coats so she wouldn't be photographed in the same one. Her room is all pink with her collection of costumes, quirky posters and so on. She had skill to take selfies like no other and she was indeed the princess of selfies. She made many many friends in her short life. Masa loved her sister Nadja and brother Petar dearly. She shared a special bond with them both and that is a bond that only family who are close with siblings share. You'd hear Masa and Nadja talking together, performing various roles in front of the camera. Masa and her mother were very close. They laughed together and often debated together. Masa always seemed to win the debate. Masa wanted to become a lawyer and dreamed of enjoying drinking lattes in a range of different outfits. Masa was an inspiration to many. Her motivation and drive were exceptional and would have been an outstanding wife. She used to go on walks with her father which would usually end up in some make-up store. The family would like to express their gratitude for the love and support they received from their family and friends and community at large. A particular thank you to Victoria Police. Masa touched all our hearts. Even if you do not know her personally. We miss her beautiful smile, her funny little mannerisms and the sparkle in her eyes. Masa we love you, you will be in our hearts forever. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","'Princess Marci's Royal Parade' was held for Masa Vukotic on Saturday .

"Rich claret and bronze tones, black bevelled glass and gold objets d’art create an opulent feel inside one of London's grandest homes. The five-bedroom house in the capital's upmarket area of St John's Wood - now on the market for £30million - is the latest project by top interior designer Celia Sawyer. But according to the designer, the same principles she applied to the uber-luxe mansion can be used in a property a fraction of the size. Celia's latest project, 42 Avenue Road, is a magnificent, refurbished, detached residence in the exclusive . St John's Wood area of London . Celia's project in St John's Wood: According to Celia, mirrors can be cleverly positioned to maximise light and give the feeling of space . She said: 'Whatever the size of the property or your budget you can create a stylish interior by using clever tricks.' However, she admitted there are  some advantages of having a mansion to play with, like this one on Avenue Road. 'It is enjoyable creating interiors when you have large spaces, which allow you to be creative and define areas.' 'But if you have smaller space you can get creative with glass, mirror and lighting.' Here, Celia reveals her ten simple design rules to transform any property into a style haven, whatever the size or budget. The bedroom in 42 Avenue Road: 'There is nothing nicer than stepping out of bed onto a luxurious carpet for that feeling of comfort and luxury each morning,' she says . Celia Sawyer reveals her 10 simple design rules to transform any property . Rule 1: Mirror mirror on the wall . According to Celia, mirrors can be cleverly positioned to maximise light and give the feeling of space. 'I will always use mirrors in rooms to enhance the sense of space and depth,' she said. Rule 2: Keep the floor constant . 'Linking flooring throughout enhances the sense of space.' Keep the hallway  living room, dining room and kitchen the same, she advised. 'This will create a larger open-plan space and help your furniture and style flow.' Rule 3: Create a colour punch . Celia advises keeping the colour scheme neutral but adding an accent shade to stay on trend. 'By keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change, giving you more flexibly in the future,' she explained. Rule 4: Find your star pieces . 'One of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room,' said Celia. The designer suggests a fantastic light, or an amazing centrepiece that captures attention on entering the room. Rule 5: Play with textures . Celia advises layering and using different textures to add luxury and glamour. 'Mix plenty of textures with chrome, metallics and leather to really bring out the beauty of the contrasts.' Rule 6: Plan ahead . According to Celia, mood boards are essential so that you plan your room out correctly. 'You can choose the colours, layouts and style your rooms in advance to achieve your vision,' she said. Rule 7: Go large for impact . 'Large pieces of furniture in smaller rooms  give the impression of a larger room when executed properly.' So don’t hold back on using large sofas and armchairs to create impact. Rule 8: Set the mood . Think about the mood of the room and create a lighting scheme that fits. You don't need fancy LEDs or  systems, lamps can be just as effective. 'Mood lighting is essential to create a desired vibe in the room. From up-lighters to smart, changeable LEDs that give a warm glow, lighting is a powerful tool that must be used wisely,' said Celia. The bath creates a focal point in the bathroom:  'One of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room,' says Celia . 'By keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change, giving you more flexibly in the future,' Celia explains . Rule 9: Walls . Are your walls a blank canvas for displaying art, or are they to be treated as features in themselves? 'These are important question to ask yourself,' advised Celia. 'In some projects I mirror the entire wall to create a feature piece. It’s important not to mix up the two up!' Rule 10: Don't forget comfort . There's no point making your house a masterpiece if it's not enjoyable to live in. One comfort Celia never goes without is carpet in the bedroom. 'There is nothing nicer than stepping out of bed on to a luxurious carpet for that feeling of comfort and luxury each morning,' she said. Celia advises keeping the flooring in the hallway living room, dining room and kitchen the same, as in her latest project . Go large for impact, says Celia, who used these over-sized pots in her St John's Wood project . The lounge in 42 Avenue Road: Mood lighting is essential to create the desired vibe in the room, says Celia . The grand piano creates a focal point in the luxurious lounge . The bright and airy sitting room in the £30million St John's Wood mansion . The living space towards the rear of the home has been divided into two areas, to allow for a formal end and more relaxed social space . It's a long way down at the £30million mansion . The mansion's kitchen where Celia  has sympathetically blended her signature contemporary style with the traditional features of this elegant house . The study features display shelves with soothing lighting . The house has an impressive leisure and entertaining area that includes a stunning swimming pool, Jacuzzi and steam room .","Designer's latest project is on Avenue Road in London's St John's Wood .

"Best watch your back hipster London eateries; there's new kid on the block coming to take your crown. Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known -  is set to open its doors in Soho this May. The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens. The Melt Room, which only serves toasties such as the classic grilled cheese sandwich (pictured) is set to open its doors in Soho this May . The grilled cheese sandwich shop follows in the footsteps of the UK's other single-item restaurants – Porridge Cafe in Old Street, London; Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches, and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe. The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. All combinations are served between hand-made, organic, sourdough bread from London's local Wapping bakery and use free-range Native Breeds meat from Gloucestershire. Sides such as crisp pickles, relish, cheese-friendly sauces and cheese on toast popcorn will be available to 'heighten the experience'. Melt Room will also serve luxury toasties such as this pulled lamb melt with mustard dressed greens . The cafe is the brainchild of self-confessed grilled cheese aficionado Andrey Datsenko who wanted to 'fix his own grilled cheese cravings.' Mr Datsenko said: 'I spent the better part of my youth studying hospitality management in New York and very quickly became addicted to the delicious and hearty grilled cheese sandwiches the city had to offer. 'I am very excited to launch Melt Room, not only to fix my own grilled cheese cravings, but to offer Londoners a gourmet American-inspired version of this much loved snack.' Nik Williamson who runs The Porridge Cafe . The menu includes the Classic – the holiest of grilled cheese sandwiches made with Keens sharp cheddar double slices; slow and low lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens and melted Swiss, and rare roast beef coupled with Sparkenhoe red Leicestershire. The shop will open from 7am for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with 12 seats available for guests to enjoy a quick meal accompanied by cheesy tunes. And don't fret if you can't get yourself a seat – they're also introducing a local delivery service. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015 . In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks. But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London. Alan and Gary Keery of The Cereal Killer Cafe in Brick Lane serve 120 cereals with 20 toppings and 12 milks . 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. Moo’d, opened by best friends Zoe Blogg and Jen Gibb in Leeds in February this year, offers 100 different cereals as well as ‘cocktails’ consisting of mixed varieties of different brands. Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace this month, and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon.'","Melt Room to open in Soho this May and will serve breakfast toasties .

"An elderly couple driving home from a visit to their granddaughter were pulled over and ordered out of their car by a heavy-handed sheriff's deputy, who subjected them to a 20-minute interrogation about heroin smuggling. Cancer sufferer Charles Tharp, 69, and his wife found themselves confronted with a sniffer dog and asked whether they had heroin, methamphetamines ir ecstasy stashed in their Toyota. The overzealous sheriff's deputy pulled the pair over on a highway in Walton County, Georgia, and took issue with their window tint before moving on to illegal narcotics. Scroll down for video . Drug interrogation: Charles Tharp, 69, was ordered out of his Toyota by an overzealous deputy in Walton County, Georgia . Couple: Tharp and his wife, who has not been named, were asked whether they had a variety of narcotics, including heroin and ecstasy, in their car . Dashcam footage of the ordeal, obtained by CBS46, shows Tharp, who suffers back pain, standing outside for the duration of the stop in blustery weather. The deputy can be heard asking which drugs Tharp might have in the car. He lists methamphetamines, heroin and ecstasy in turn, to which Tharp replies 'no, sir' each time. The officer had initially said that the windows on Tharp's Toyota, which are factory-issue, were tinted too darkly. He took a measurement at the roadside which seemingly confirmed his suspicion - but it was later disproved by a test from the car's dealership. Serious: The deputy brought out a snarling sniffer dog to examine their car . Unusual vacation: The Tharps were driving home through Georgia after a visit to the granddaughter, above, who lives in Texas . The Tharps were only passing through Georgia the time. They were on their way home to North Carolina after visiting their granddaughter in Texas. In response to the unexpected stop, Tharp said: 'I don't honestly know what the stereotype looks like for a heroin smuggler. 'But I don't think a couple of senior citizens driving a handicapped license plate car with their little cocker spaniel really looks like we're much of a threat to anybody.' Walton County Sheriff's Department are now investigating the incident. A spokesman for the department admitted: 'In hindsight, maybe he did go a little far'.","Charles Tharp, 69, and his wife were pulled over on a Georgia highway .

"The owner of Moonlite BunnyRanch - Nevada's most famous legal brothel - describes getting a kiss from Marilyn Monroe and his desire to reclaim the word pimp from its negative connotations in his memoir, The Art of the Pimp. Dennis Hof, 68, has become the object of desire for budding 18- to 21-year-old prostitutes through creating a sense of camaraderie in the word 'pimp'. At BunnyRanch, which is featured on HBO's late-night reality show Cathouse, he created a brothel where women could set their own prices and deals but still split earnings with the house. Scroll down for video . Brothel: Dennis Hof, owner of Moonlight BunnyRanch, writes in his new memoir of his run-in with Marilyn Monroe and includes first-hand accounts from ex-girlfriends that show what it was like to be with a pimp . Life story: Hof, 68, opened his brothel in Lyon County, Nevada, in the early 1990s. His goal was to train prostitutes in investing, sales and negotiating prices for sexual favors . Hof starts his memoir with the story of how he got his first erection - something he can thank Marilyn Monroe for, according to the New York Post. He was an eight-year-old boy at the Arizona State Fair when he saw a 'gorgeous, red-lipped blonde' waving at him while filming a movie. She kissed him on the cheek and introduced herself as Marilyn Monroe. And from then on, Hof sought out young, voluptuous blondes to fill his fantasies. He didn't start out in the brothel industry, however. He owned five gas stations in the early 1970s, but during the gas shortage of 1972, he began a deal with a local massage parlor: He set aside gas for the women so he could use their services whenever he liked. 'I had always enjoyed sex, sure,' he writes, 'but until [then] I hadn't realized how little I knew about it. So, of course I kept going back, a willing student... I soon realized I had a big problem: I loved f****** and I couldn't get enough of it.' And he then realized that he 'had fallen madly in love with prostitutes'. He moved into real estate and became a regular at the Moonlight Ranch brothel in Mound House Nevada. And when it went up for sale in the early 1990s, he bought it for $1million in Lyon County, one of the only counties that still allows legal prostitution. He changed the business's name to 'Dennis Hof's World Famous Moonlite BunnyRanch' and trained all of the women in investing, sales and negotiating prices for sexual favors. Entertaining read: The Art of The Pimp will be released for sale on March 17. In the book he describes 'one man's search for love, sex, and money' Smart money: Hof made sure the prostitutes were independent contractors who could refuse any act or customer. Earnings are split between the women and the house . All the women: Hof started dating prostitutes after realizing monogamy wasn't for him. He made sure all the women were aware that he was having sex with others . Hof made sure the prostitutes were independent contractors who could refuse any act or customer. But after realizing monogamous relationships weren't for him, he decided to date exclusively prostitutes and made them all aware of his lack of interest in seeing only one woman. According to him, however, all relationships ended when the women found out he was having sex with other women. Hof seems to have a realization when during a recent conversation he had with his best friend, porn star Ron Jeremy. 'It's not enough to be a good guy, and it's not enough to buy them s***, and it's not enough to teach them how to make serious money. You have to give them your heart and soul. If you hold back, even a little bit, they know it, and it kills them.'. 'For f***'s sake, Dennis,' Jeremy said. 'You sound like a girl!' In parts of his memoir he allows people to write pages of their experiences with him, including working girls Krissy Summers and Cami Parker. Summers's account of their relationship explains the first time they met in person, after corresponding online for years, starting when she was a college freshman. Friends: Hof, pictured center, with best friend Ron Jeremy (left) and Joey Buttafuco, once told Jeremy that it wasn't 'enough to be a good guy', because 'if you hold back... they know it, and it kills them' Narcissist: During a first-hand account of being in a relationship with Hof, Cami Parker says that he tried to change the way she looked constantly, because 'everyone knows Dennis likes skinny little-girl bodies' 'I walked in and he said, ""Hi, I'm Dennis Hof,""' she writes. 'And I remember thinking, ""I know who you are."" And then he said, ""Take off your pants."" That was it. ""Take off your pants."" I was absolutely terrified. Dennis was only the second man I'd ever been with.' Parker calls Hof a 'soulless pimp' and explains the first time she arrived at the ranch, aged 22, after seeing Hof on the Tyra Banks show. When the girls met her they told her, 'Daddy's gonna love you!' and asked if she would have sex with Hof. 'Well, you want Daddy to like you. You won't have a very good time if he doesn't, so if he wants you to, you definitely should,' the women told her. Parker ended up in a relationship with Hof, but he tried changing the way she looked consistently. She entered the ranch as a 5ft 4in, 107lb woman with A-cup breasts. But Hof would 'forever tell me to lose weight', and she hit '96 pounds with DDs', which 'led to a very serious - and nearly deadly - eating disorder. Everyone knows Dennis likes skinny, little-girl bodies'. Hof eventually broke up with her - through another girl at the ranch - because she was 'too old for him'. She was 23, while Hof was 65. Psychotherapist Dr. Sheenah Hankin writes a scathing review of Hof, claiming he 'encourages them to be jealous and yearn for his attention' while laughing at 'how they bicker, bitch and fight with each other over him'. 'Dennis uses the women he ""loves"" for his own desires, loyal companionship and sex,' writes Hankin. 'Like any pimp, he exploits them. This is sadistic behavior, and it is both unrecognized and denied.' She calls him a narcissist, with 'no empathy', who's 'clueless about his lover’s hurts and fears or his part in creating them'.","Dennis Hof, 68, who owns Moonlite BunnyRanch in Lyon County, Nevada, is releasing memoir titled The Art of the Pimp on March 17 .

"David Cameron has complained about the 'buggeration factor' of trying to push policies through Whitehall. The Prime Minister used the colourful phrase as he expressed frustration with the civil service's processes of consultations and reviews. The word buggeration is defined by the Urban Dictionary as a term 'used to describe a feeling of absolute c*** but with a hint of light-hearted optimism'. Mr Cameron's remarks echoed Tony Blair's famous phrase about the 'scars on my back' when he spoke about the difficulties of NHS and education reform. Scroll down for video . Frustrated: Prime Minister David Cameron has complained about the 'buggeration factor' of trying to push policies through Whitehall . However, the Prime Minister declined to repeat Mr Blair's remark exactly, saying it sounded 'a bit Fifty Shades of Grey'. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Prime Minister insisted the Conservatives needed another term in power to restore the country's economic fortunes. 'The first thing is finish the job,' he said. 'With a five per cent budget deficit and still too many people unemployed, with growth that hasn't worked its way through so everyone feels the benefits, the job isn't done. 'The ambition is for Britain to be the best place in Europe to start, grow and run a business, schools where we are not lagging in the tables but we're absolutely busting through the top, a welfare system where it pays to work, where you're always better off in work. 'And from this a sense that the values of the country will have changed to be ones where people feel deep national pride.' Mr Cameron said Kenneth Clarke, the former chancellor of the exchequer, was crucial in maintaining Cabinet support for austerity measures over the last five years. 'He sat round the cabinet table and said, look, this is going to take longer than you think, stick with it — there's no alternative package.' Apart from presiding over a recovery led by the private sector Mr Cameron says he hoped to be remembered as the prime minister who resolved two key questions facing Britain. History: The Prime Minster's remarks echoed Tony Blair's famous 'scars on my back' phrase about difficulties of NHS and education reform but Mr Cameron said that sounded 'a bit Fifty Shades of Grey' 'One is, does the United Kingdom want to stay together? Yes. Secondly, does the United Kingdom want to stay in a reformed European Union? Yes,' he said. Mr Cameron said his pledge to hold an EU referendum would mar 'the moment when Britain stops sleepwalking towards the exit'. 'I think that's what's happening now. The British public can see what's happening: Europe is changing before their eyes and they haven't been asked about it,' he said. He conceded some Conservatives would 'vote to leave altogether' whatever deal he strikes with Brussels on a looser, more trade-based relationship. But he added: 'I think there can be a coming together after that.' Mr Cameron sought to dismiss speculation that if reelected, he intends to stand down in 2018 after holding the referendum. 'I'm standing for a full term and that is what I want to serve,' he said.","PM is frustrated by civil service's processes of consultations and reviews .

"Russian secret services may have executed the troops suspected of shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, say sources involved in the investigation of the crash over eastern Ukraine. The Dutch-led probe is leaning towards a conclusion that a BUK missile fired from rebel-held territory downed the Boeing 777, killing all 298 on board. And it is highly likely the aircraft was shot out of the sky by Russian military personnel, according to a report by the Netherlands' state broadcaster NOS, citing anonymous sources in the police and the group of investigators working on the probe into the plane's loss. Scroll down for videos . Cover-up: An official probe looking into the downing of MH17 (pictured) is leading to the conclusion that the plane could have been shot down by Russian military personnel from rebel-held Ukraine . Destructive: The Dutch-led probe suggests a BUK missile (pictured in 2010) fired from rebel-held territory downed the Boeing 777 . Weapon: A driver in Ukraine filmed this BUK launcher on the back of a military track rumbling back across the Russian border two days after MH17 went down . 'My sources believe that these people might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything,' said Dutch journalist Robert Bas. Those who allegedly shot the missiles at the Boeing have been 'untraceable' for investigators, it is claimed. 'So in the end there may be no trial, unfortunately, just the report on the results of the investigation,' he added. Sources close to the investigation also complain they are under siege from persistent attempts by Russian secret services to hack their computer system and plant spyware software on their smartphones, reported NOS. Phones and laptops used by investigators in Ukraine had to be 'destroyed' subsequently because they were infected with spyware, it was claimed. Even home communications devices of police officers on the investigation were removed because they were 'contaminated', it was alleged. The long-awaited probe into the crash of flight MH17 is not due to unveil its findings until October, but NOS says its claims are based on 'several anonymous sources in the police and the group of investigators'. Russia has strongly and repeatedly denied any role in shooting down MH17, and also dismissed claims that the aircraft was hit by pro-Moscow rebels. Denial: Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) blamed Ukraine for obstructing investigators from the crash site - and Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the plane's destruction . Damage: Russian media has said th holes in the plane's fuselage are not consistent with the damage caused by a BUK missile, which investigators believe could be the reason for its demise . Yet the evidence 'points in one direction', namely a ground-based attack by a BUK missile, it was claimed in Holland. Despite this, the official probe - which has examined more than one million documents, videos and photographs - has not so far ruled out other versions on the downing of the plane. 'It is a leading version now but not the only one, they are still investigating the other options,' said the journalist. Investigators were hampered at the crash site by fighting in the region between pro-Moscow rebels and the Ukrainian army. The Russian media has highlighted claims that MH17 was hit by a Ukrainian warplane in the vicinity at the time of the crash on 17 July 2014. Doomed: According to Ukrainian intelligence chief Vitaliy Naidahis, this was a picture of a missile being fired from Snizhne in Ukraine towards the MH17 flight . Aftermath: Sources investigating the root of MH17's destruction (pictured) complain the Russian Secret Service is 'persistently' trying to hack their computers . A suspected 'executioner' - a Ukrainian air force pilot - was even named. Western secret services have also been blamed. Yesterday, Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda cited an expert saying that the holes in the fuselage of the crashed plane did not match the damage normally caused by a BUK missile. 'At least 9 holes were found which are typical for the damage from an 'air-to-air' missile, suggesting that MH17 was shot from a plane. While Western governments have pointed towards a BUK system being responsible for downing the Boeing 777 on 17 July 2014, such a conclusion by an international air crash investigation would be a devastating blow for Moscow.","It is highly likely the aircraft was destroyed by 'BUK' surface-to-air missile .

"Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women . The length of time that a woman can expect to live in good health is getting shorter, according to an official analysis. Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women. However, women still live longer than men overall – though the gap is closing. The statistics, released yesterday, showed that over the past three years the expectancy of life in good health for a baby girl in England has dropped by nearly four months. But during the same period, the length of time that newborn baby boys can expect to live in good health has risen slightly. The latest figures are gathered from the Annual Population Survey run by the Office for National Statistics, which collects data on 320,000 people every year. Health life expectancy is calculated from the number of people who say they are in good or in very good health. Experts say these changes are as partially as a result of the major economic, industrial and family upheavals of the past 50 years. Men are likely to live longer now because few work in dangerous industrial jobs like coal mining, and fewer drink heavily or smoke. Women, however, are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs, as well as bringing up children. According to the ONS, in the three years between 2011 and 2013, a baby girl born in England could on average expect to live in good health for 63.9 years. This compares with 64.2 years between 2009 and 2011. In contrast, a boy could expect good health for 63.3 years if born between 2011 and 2013, compared with 63.2 years from 2009 to 2011. This means that men now spend 80 per cent of their lives in good health, compared to 77 per cent for women. Overall life expectancy for women is 83.1 years, and men 79.4. However, the figures also show a major divide between north and south. Women are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs, as well as bringing up children, according to the ONS . Newborn boys in the South East are likely to get 6.3 years longer in good health than those in the North East, and girls in the South East an extra 6.6 years. But women in the south are losing ground in terms of health expectancy much faster than those in the north, as health improves in the area. Commenting on the results, the ONS said: ‘The health status and mortality rates of a population change year on year due to exposure to different risks and treatments affecting health, and also through inward and outward migration.’ High levels of fitness in middle age can help men survive cancer, a study has found. Researchers discovered that of those who developed lung, bowel or prostate cancer, keeping fit cut the chances of them dying from their disease by a third. Almost 14,000 US men had their cardiorespiratory fitness monitored using treadmill tests for nearly seven years from the age of 65. For the men who developed cancer, a high fitness level was associated with a 32 per cent reduced risk of death. Mid-life fitness also lowered the risk of being diagnosed with lung and bowel cancer, but apparently not prostate cancer. The researchers, from the University of Vermont, told the journal JAMA Oncology that future studies were required to look at fitness and cancer in women.","Men are now likely to live a longer portion of their lives in good health .

"The widow of a terminally ill man who was conned out of almost half a million pounds by a close friend condemned the fraudster as a 'despicable man'. World-famous lighting architect, Jonathan Speirs, was persuaded to part with a total of £476,864 by friend and neighbour Keith Cameron through a complicated ruse. Now Jonathan's widow Elizabeth Speirs, 58, has revealed the heartless crime has left the family struggling for cash. She has been forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh which she shared with her husband for 24 years. Heartless: Neighbour Keith Cameron convinced his terminally ill friend Jonathan Speirs to part with nearly £500,000 in a complicated ruse . Cameron, 54, conned Jonathan - who was dying of stomach cancer - out of thousands of pounds by claiming his company, Chase Telecom Ltd, required money to win a valuable contract to supply telecom services. The devious businessman repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that investors had pumped millions of pounds of money into the business. Cameron, who was a close family friend of the Speirs, insisted Jonathan could expect to receive a return on his investment of around £2 million within two years. But it later emerged the entire operation was a lie and that Cameron, also from Edinburgh, had been using Jonathan's cash to maintain a luxury lifestyle. The father-of-two, who has now been declared bankrupt, was found guilty of fraud at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday and will be sentenced next month. Jonathan's wife Elizabeth said the cruel scheme had left her and her two daughters, Lucie and Erin, in 'dire straits financially.' Tragic: Elizabeth Speirs is being forced to sell the home she shared with her late husband Jonathan (right) after cruel scheme left them broke . Elizabeth, who recently underwent radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer, said: . 'It hasn't quite sunk in - I'm just very grateful that the jury saw through him. 'He's just a despicable man, and what he did to my husband - who was a good man - is just awful, and the financial situation he has left us in is awful. 'I'm going to have to sell my house soon, as I can't afford to stay. 'I never got a chance to grieve for my husband because I found this out right away. I feel like I have been robbed of so much in my life - my husband, a friend, and the chance to build a new life for me and my daughters. 'My husband had withdrawn money from a policy that he had taken out in case either he or his [business] partner became ill, so that he could exit his company without any financial impact. 'The Camerons have been friends with us for a very long time. They were people we trusted.' On Wednesday, the court heard Cameron had a mortgage of £1.34m million, had bought cars for his wife and daughter, took holidays in a luxury villa and sent his two daughters to an Edinburgh private school. One of his daughters also attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts in New York and had a student flat near the Empire State Building. Victim: The late Jonathan Speirs was duped into paying £500,000 to Cameron, who spent the money on funding a luxury lifestyle . Cameron had signed off three payments to Jonathan amounting to £75,935, in what were supposedly dividends from the telecoms company but it later turned out to be . Jonathan's own money funnelled back to him. Elizabeth said: 'He [Cameron] did it because he was broke. 'Our money paid for two Minis - one for his wife and one for his daughter. It paid for the school fees for his daughters, and holidays to Portugal and Spain. 'He has been living a lie for many, many years. He hasn't worked since 2009 - since then he has purportedly been setting up a business. He just got used to the good life and he didn't want to give it up. 'But his wife and his daughters are not implicated in this - I want to make that clear. 'It's not something you would have been looking out for. When somebody comes back to you with good states of account and it's a friend who you know has a good track record, you think everything is going to be okay. 'It's not something you would expect of a friend.

A list was posted online by a group called the 'Islamic State Hacking Division' gave personal information for 100 US military members and called upon its lone wolf 'brothers residing in America' to kill them. However, several service members spoke out on Sunday, saying that the intimidation tactic was 'not going to work'. Scroll down for video . A group called the Islamic State Hacking Division posted information about 100 US military members online . In the posting, the ISIS hacking division asked its followers to kill military members 'wherever you find them' Several military members whose information was linked in the attack said that they were not afraid of the extremists who had targeted them . The ISHD said it wants 'lone wolf' attackers to go after the military members and 'kill them wherever you find them'. One of three service members who spoke anonymously to ABC News said that it was not surprising that the extremists wanted to kill members of the US military. 'I wouldn't say I'm scared,' one said. 'It's just part of this 'new war' against an enemy with a different, more developed capability than what we've faced in the past. 'We have to make the adjustments in order to continue to win the battles.' ISIS claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information. However, a defense official said that the list did not appear to be from a breach, and that the names and addresses were publicly available online. 'We really weren't surprised because all the people I saw on that list are on a webpage some place anyways, all that information was already public,' and identified soldier told ABC. The group claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information on the list, though much of the information could be found publicly online . Posting read: 'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk' The ISHD posting read: 'With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in America can deal with you. 'And now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for? 'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe.' One anonymous serviceman said that the list's publication was 'regrettable'. The Defense Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into the matter, the New York Times reported. An official told the paper most of the information on the list could be found in public records, residential address search sites and on social media. Many of the personnel on the list were mentioned in news articles about air strikes on ISIS. However some of them were part of units that had no connection to the Middle Eastern bombing campaign. The US Marine Corps said it was visiting all affected staff, and urged caution online. 'It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information,' US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement. He added that the threat remained 'unverified'. The US Marine Corps (pictured, October 2014) announced that it was visiting all affected personnel and urged its soldiers to be careful about their online footprint . ISIS (pictured) has claimed responsibility for previous online-based attacks on the US military, notably hacking Central Command's Twitter account in January . US Central Command issued a statement on its Facebook page saying that 'We are operating in a ""new norm"" in which cyber threats are real and constant.' 'Any CENTCOM teammate or family member could be targeted. To that end, we all should maintain a heightened sense of vigilance whether dealing with work or home computer usage, specifically as it relates to Social Media.' One serviceman said that 'We have a footprint -- the best we can do is to make that foot print not so deep in the sand'. The faces of the women who appeared on the list were blurred out. IS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past, including against Central Command, which oversees the air war against the IS group. In January, the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date, forcing the military temporarily to take down the command's Twitter feed. The words 'CyberCaliphate' and 'I love you ISIS' replaced Central Command's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended.","The list was published on internet by the 'Islamic State Hacking Division'

"A father and son team have created replicas of the Transformers robots out of scrap metal  using instructions downloaded from the internet. Peasant farmer Yu Zhilin and his son Yu Lingyun use pieces of scrap metal they have collected from disused cars in Hengyang in China to construct huge robots, similar to the characters of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee who appeared in the multi-million pound films. They have just sold an army of the metal robots for almost one million RMB (£110,0000) constructed in their own makeshift workshop. Xhilin decided to start building the huge models in 2007 when he realised how valuable they could be in China - where the latest Transformers instalment, Age of Extinction, was the highest grossing film ever in the country. The film targeted Chinese audiences, with Chinese car brands  featured throughout  and Hong Kong used as the backdrop for some of the action sequences. The pair join a cult of Chinese people who have started making replicas of the metal robots that have earned such notoriety in the country. Last year a team of farmers in Xiaoye, a village in the eastern Shandong province, began making the models at a cost of around $16,000 (£11,000) and selling them to property developers who have installed them in shopping malls in China. Yu Linguin has been helping his father Pu Zhilin (right) produce models of Transformers, using scrap metals from cars they have collected .

"When I first became a Mum, I never questioned getting my children vaccinated. It was just what you did when you have children - you do what your doctor tells you, because they know best. My husband and I had never been told that there could be any adverse reactions, only a bit of redness and swelling at the injection site. So as each of our six eldest children got progressively sicker after each vaccination, we never made that connection. Out of our six vaccinated children, our 16, 12 and 10-year-old have moderate to severe Autism, our 25-year-old has ADHD, our 14-year-old has a severe language disorder, and our 20-year-old has severe mood swings. Tasha David (back right) tells how she chose to not vaccinate her two youngest children Sasa, eight (front left), and Chiante, five (front middle) after her first SIX (back row L-R: Asante, 16, Jourdahn, 25, middle row L-R: Deveraux, 20, Sahara, 14, Acacia, 10, Armaan, 12) suffered health problems . They also suffered from chronic ear infections, bronchiolitis, asthma, eczema, psoriasis, urinary infections, gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders, allergies, chemical sensitivities and intolerances. We tried genetic testing to look for answers, but no reason was found for our children’s afflictions. So I started looking for answers on my own. I read books, went to seminars, read all the scientific studies I could get my hands on and that’s when I discovered that our family was not the only one. There were many other families suffering from the same issues as ours. 'Out of our six vaccinated children, our 16, 12 and 10-year-old have moderate to severe Autism, our 25-year-old has ADHD, our 14-year-old has a severe language disorder, and our 20-year-old has severe mood swings' Fighting fit: Tasha says her two youngest children have 'thrived' and have never been sick . This realization led us to not vaccinate our five and eight-year-old old and they have thrived because of it. Out of all their siblings they should have been the most susceptible to genetic problems considering that I was in my late thirties when I had them and was overweight. Yet our two youngest never had to suffer through the many illnesses that their brothers and sisters did. Not because they had never been exposed to illness because like all preschool and school children, they had been. But they had a resilience that had been taken from their siblings. They have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives, but more importantly they had none of their sibling’s disorders. This was an especially bitter sweet realisation for me, as I looked at them and realised just how much my other children had lost because of me. I had to come to terms with the fact that my ignorance about what I allowed to be put in to my children’s bodies had caused at least two (possibly three) of my children to NEVER be able to have the chance to be independent, fall in love and have a family. That when I die, they face the possibility of living with strangers who don’t love them the way they deserve to be loved. 'They have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives': David's youngest, Chiante, five, and Sasa, eight, are healthy . People need to realise that vaccination is not one size fits all, that there are families in your community that are struggling with the harm that vaccines have caused. Have we so quickly forgotten Saba Button,  Lachlan Neylan [both toddlers were left severely disabled following flu shots in 2010 and 2012, respectively], and Ashley Epapara? [who died a day after receiving a flu shot in 2010] This is why vaccination must always remain a choice - otherwise we are saying that some children matter more than others. This issue has been thrown in to the spotlight once again by the tragic loss of four week old Riley Hughes to Whooping Cough. My heart goes out to this family - no parent should ever have to suffer through the death of their child. Unfortunately a few journalists have seized on this tragedy to create more hatred and animosity towards innocent children and their families. They are recklessly setting parents against each other and in the process they are doing a great disservice to this family and to the other families that are not aware of the shortcomings of this vaccine. In 2009 a fully vaccinated nurse is suspected to have infected four infants with Whooping cough in a maternity ward in Sydney, as well as several studies since then that show that this vaccine is not providing the protection that our children deserve. Tragic: Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . In 1991 we had a 71 per cent vaccination rate for Whooping Cough, yet there were only 347 cases, but in 2011 with a vaccination rate of over 92 per cent, we had over 38,000 cases. How can the unvaccinated be to blame? Pregnant women need to be aware that vaccine product inserts say that the effect of this vaccine on the development of the embryo and foetus has not been assessed. Vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended unless there is a definite risk of acquiring pertussis. The attacking of parents whether they vaccinate or not needs to stop, because at the end of the day we all love our children dearly, and we all want what is best for them and for all children. Divisiveness is not the answer and it never will be, we will only find real solutions when the fighting stops and open discussion begins.

"A teenage girl has been charged with robbery after she was caught lying on Facebook about her involvement in the fatal ambush. Haley McKibben, 18, was allegedly involved in a plan to rob 23-year-old John Kinsey Jr who was found shot dead in his car last Saturday in Indianapolis, Indiana. McKibben was asked to 'set up' Kinsey by Julius Gordon, 19, so that the pair could rob him of a stash of marijuana and Xanax, according to an affidavit seen by Daily Mail Online. The 18-year-old reportedly got in the car to smoke with Kinsey and then sent a text message to Gordon to let him know where they were parked. Haley McKibben, 18, has been charged with felony robbery for her part in an ambush on John Kinsey, 23, who was fatally shot in his car, allegedly by Julius Gordon (right), for his stash of Xanax and marijuana . She also warned Gordon that Kinsey was armed. The 23-year-old was later found dead in his blue Buick with a gun and his driver's window shattered. Police named Gordon as a possible suspect when he went to hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound. The teenage girl at first told police she had been sitting with Kinsey in his car when someone tried to rob him. She was shown pictures of potential suspects - including Gordon - but said that she did not recognize anyone. Investigators then took to Facebook - and found that Gordon and McKibben were friends on social media. Police then discovered phone records of their text messages. Gordon has been charged with two counts of murder, robbery and being a felon in possession of a handgun. McKibben has been charged with robbery. Both suspects were being held in the Marion County Jail.","Haley McKibben, 18, was allegedly involved in a plan to ambush 23-year-old John Kinsey in Indianapolis on Saturday .

"A desperate mom who posted an appeal for a kidney donor in the rear window of her car has found a donor after a stranger saw the message and offered to help. Christine Royles was 23 when she learned she had two autoimmune diseases, lupus and ANCA vasculitis, leading to kidney failure, the Portland Press Herald reported. The South Portland woman went on the national waiting to find a donor, but chose to go a different route, according to the newspaper. Plea: Royles wrote this message on the back of her car looking for for assistance . Needing help: Christine Royles, seen left with her fiance Dominick Morrilly and right with her son Talan, scribbled a want ad for a kidney on her back windshield after going on the national waiting list for a donor . The Portland Press Herald reported that Royles painted an appeal for a donor on the rear window of her car, along with a phone number. The message read 'Looking for someone 2 donate me their kidney! Must have type O blood :) (you only need one kidney.)' Josh Dall-Leighton, 30, saw the message on a trip to the Maine Mall with his family, according to the newspaper. The father-of-three, who works as a corrections officer, called. He told the Portland Press Herald 'I just looked at my wife and said, ""I have to try."" I think it was the fact that I have three kids of my own, and that really resonated with me. 'If (my wife) needed a kidney and I couldn't provide for her, I would hope that somebody else would kind of step up and help her out.' Meeting for the first time: Christine Royles and Talan met Josh Dall-Leighton and his son Christopher last Tuesday . Treatment: Royles posted a photograph to Facebook showing her two-month dialysis supply. She reportedly spends 10 hours on a dialysis machine when she gets home from work . The Windham stranger has been classified as a potential match and the surgery is set for May, according to the newspaper. Royles, 24, told the Portland Press Herald:  'The fact that someone with a young family is going to take time off work to help some random person is unbelievable to me.' The newspaper reported that Royles spends 10 hours on a dialysis machine upon returning from her Applebee's job. WGME reported that the South Portland Applebee's will host a fundraising pancake breakfast on behalf of Dall-Leighton next month. A GoFundMe page is also seeking donations. The GoFundMe page says 'Two of his sons are twins that were born at 29 weeks in 2014. They need a lot of care and have special needs.' Royles explained to WGME 'He's going to be out of work for a month or maybe two months, so I just wanted to make sure he has a bit of money for his family.'

"Cancel your plans to journey through the centre of Earth or, at least, adjust your arrival time at the other side. Research has found that it would only take a person 38 minutes to make it from one side of the planet to the other - not 42 minutes, as previously calculated. The hypothetical scenario finds that when the different densities of Earth’s layers are taken into account, the trip is four minutes shorter than predicted. A student from McGill University in Canada examined the hypothetical scenario of falling through Earth (graphic shown). Originally it was thought the journey from one side to the other. When Earth's density is considered, the new estimate is 38 minutes and 11 seconds . The latest time estimate was calculated by Alexander Klotz, a graduate student of physics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada and published in The American Journal of Astrophysics. ‘This was a bit of a surprise to me,’ Mr Klotz told The Times. Theoretically speaking, as a person falls through Earth, gravity is constantly changing as they make their way to the middle. Consequently they would speed up as they approached the centre, and begin to slow down again as they made their way to the other side. Ignoring drag effects due to the presence of air, it would take exactly the same amount of time to make the journey either side of the core. Under these conditions, the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side. Earth’s density is less than 2,200lbs (1,000kg) per cubic metre at the surface, but 28,700 lbs (13,000kg) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles (6,370km) below. And 2,200 miles (3,500km) from the centre, about half way, there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core. Using these numbers it would take 38 minutes 11 seconds to fall through Earth - four minutes and a second quicker than thought. ‘Basically, the way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110 per cent of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero [per cent] at the centre. The original theory goes like this: If a hole was dug from one point on Earth to the other on the opposite side, it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through. For example, if a person fell from London to the Antipodes Islands - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take that long to travel the whole way. Of course, they'd need some sort of tunnel that could survive the intense heat and pressure inside Earth, and their body would also need to be able to survive the conditions. Plus handle a top speed of 18,000 mph (29,000 km/h). Theoretically speaking, as a person falls through Earth, gravity is constantly changing as they make their way to the middle. Consequently they would speed up as they approached the centre, and begin to slow down again as they made their way to the other side. Ignoring drag effects due to the presence of air, it would take exactly the same amount of time to make the journey either side of the core. The original theory goes like this: If a hole was dug from one point on Earth to the other on the opposite side, it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through - but the new estimate is four minutes and eleven seconds quicker. Shown is a promotional Red Bull photo of Felix Baumgartner . As you fall through Earth (interior shown in illustration on the left), gravity is constantly changing as you make your way to the middle. So, you would speed up as you approached the centre (illustrated right), and begin to slow down again as you made your way to the other side . Wish you were here? If you fell from London (left) to the Antipodes Islands (right) - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take 38 minutes and 11 seconds to make the journey . Last week it was announced a new 'superviscous' layer in Earth’s lower mantle had been discovered. The breakthrough could explain why parts of Earth’s sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles (1,500km) underground. It could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the Earth’s interior, suggesting it is hotter than previously thought. The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Utah by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in Earth's interior. This new layer extends from 410 miles (660km) underground to 930 miles (1,500km). In the layer, liquids are under such intense pressure that they are extremely stiff - known as superviscosity. Under these conditions, the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side. But Mr Klotz said previous calculations did not take into account the densities of Earth’s layers. For example, research has shown that the planet is much denser at its centre than at the crust, near the surface. Using seismic data, he found that Earth’s densiity was less than 2,200lbs (1,000kg) per cubic metre at the surface, but 28,700 lbs (13,000kg) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles (6,370km) below. And 2,200 miles (3,500km) from the centre, about half way, there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core. Using these new numbers in, Mr Klotz found that the time to fall through Earth was actually 38 minutes and 11 seconds - four minutes and a second quicker than thought. The same is true if a person was to fall between any two points on Earth.","Originally it was thought the journey from one side of the Earth to the other - such as London to Antipodes Islands - would take 42 minutes .

It was under construction at the time with dozens of workers onsite. The collision, which took place around 11:30am, caused heavy concrete support beams to topple down and halted moving traffic in both directions. The truck's wedged cab was left completely crumpled and several other vehicles were damaged as debris scattered. Scroll down for video . Freak accident: At least one person has died and three more have been injured in a bridge collapse in Salado, Texas . Crumpled cabin: A truck that was too high for the thoroughfare smashed into a highway bridge under construction along Interstate 35 . All coming down: The collision, which took place around 11:30am, caused heavy concrete support beams to topple down and halted traffic . One witness said he saw smoke and flames coming from one truck and it took firefighters 'a while' to put the blaze out. Construction workers rushed to the scene to see if they could help remove debris. Victims were taken to Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple for treatment but no updates on their conditions have been released. Veronica Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the Austin American-Statesman the bridge was just over 14ft high. She said there were three signs posted two miles before the overpass stating the clearance height as 13ft 6in. A lower figure is given to provide a margin of safety. According to the Texas DoT, trucks carrying loads higher than 14 feet must have a permit for an oversized load in order to travel on Texas roads. New technology at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) then determines a safe route for the driver to take. A spokesman said: 'First of all, the truck drivers know the heights of their vehicles. That's information that they provide to our DMV prior to moving out on the road with a load. 'If the height of their vehicle exceeds the height of the bridge, they're going to be diverted'. But Lares Trucking, which owns the truck that crashed into the bridge, said the driver was not aware the bridge could not be safely passed and had a permit to carry the load. Julian Lares said: 'It's a new bridge. Why don't they construct it more high? It's a new bridge. It's not an old bridge. Why [did] they give me, why [did] they consider the permit for such a small bridge?"" He added that the truck's driver, Valentin Martinez, had driven for his company for more than a year and had never been in any crashes.

Now their father, Kristopher Dohm, is in the Pasco County Jail, while their mother, Sandra, is flying down to be reunited with the boys. Dohm's friend, Edward Tarras Jr., who faces nearly two dozen sex-related charges, including sexual exploitation of a minor, was also arrested after the joint investigation by federal, state and local law enforcement.

Kristopher Dohm was booked into Paso County jail (mugshot left) after he was found with the children in a hotel room. They were staying with Edward Tarras Jr - who is facing nearly a dozen sex-related charges in Tennessee - including sexual exploitation of a minor . Distraught: Ms Hughes Dohm had released a heart-wrenching video (pictured) begging for the return of her  sons, whom she thought may have had their appearances altered by her former husband . Tarras missed a court date in August and police in Tennessee said at the time that he cut off an ankle monitor and fled town, investigators said. He was then listed as one of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted fugitives. He was tracked down after his cellphone was traced to Florida by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Marshals service, according to Sgt. Bobby Gibson with the Smyrna police department in Tennessee. He said the two were friends from growing up together in New Jersey. Prosecutors previously said Tarras had lured teen girls through an Internet ad seeking models to photograph. Tarras was appointed a public defender Thursday and was ordered held without bond in his first court appearance. Both men were jailed at the Pasco County Central Detention Center. Dohm also was being held without bond. Dohm's sons were reported missing by their mother February 9 after she said they weren't returned home by their father in violation of a custody agreement. According to NJ.com, Kristopher had been planning the abduction for some time. Sandra  reported Parker and Jackson missing on February 9 after her former husband failed to return them to her New Jersey home. 'Abducted': In her video, posted on YouTube , Ms Hughes Dohm told her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. You should not have taken them from me... they need their mother.' Above, the two boys . Together: Addressing her sons, she added: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night' The boys had been scheduled to stay with their father for a week under a custody agreement that was made during the couple's 2012 divorce, but Kristopher had been required to bring them home that Sunday night. Instead however, he abducted Parker, who has asthma, and Jaxon and drove out of the state in his 2009 grey Nissan Pathfinder, swapping out his license plate with stolen plates along the way to avoid detection. Sandra released a heart-wrenching video begging for the return of her two sons earlier this week, noting that they may have had their appearances altered by Dohm, who suffers from diabetes. In the footage, posted on YouTube, the distraught mother, who shares custody of the boys with Dohm, tells her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. They need their mother.' Addressing the boys, she adds: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night. 'I love you and I will never, ever stop looking for you. Please come home soon and safe.' Ms Hughes Dohm had also released some personal details about her children in the hope that the public may be able to help in locating them, including their nicknames and their favorite restaurants. In a post on a dedicated Facebook page, called Help Find Parker And Jaxon Dohm, on Saturday, the mother-of-two wrote: 'It has now been 5 weeks since I last spoke to my Parker and my Jaxon.' Happier times: Parker (right) and Jaxon (left) are pictured collecting pumpkins in a family photo on Facebook . 'Kris may call Parker by Park, Parker Choo, Chewy or Moose. He may call Jaxon by Jax, Action or Action Jaxon. Parker and Jaxon LOVE Taco Bell - they prefer the Dorito Tacos and soft tacos. 'They also like McDonalds, Italian Subs from QuickChek and Slurpees from 7-Eleven.' She added: We have a lot of eyes out there and I ask that you continue to keep watching out for them.' Last week, Thomas McCormick, Chief of Detectives at the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office, said the alleged abduction may have been an attempt by Dohm to gain custody of the two youngsters. Giving more details: In a post on a dedicated Facebook page , called Help Find Parker And Jaxon Dohm, on Saturday, the mother-of-two wrote: 'It has now been 5 weeks since I last spoke to my Parker and my Jaxon' Former couple: Last week, Thomas McCormick, of Sussex County Prosecutor's Office, said the abduction may have been an attempt by Dohm (right) to gain custody of the two youngsters from his ex-wife (left) 'We believe, based on recent information regarding their father's medical condition, that he may not be making great decisions,' Chf McCormick said. 'We believe that their [the boys'] safety could be at risk.' According to prosecutor Francis Koch, Dohm had allegedly asked his former wife for a few extra days with his sons so that he could fly them to Reno, Nevada, to visit 'his dying father.'. However, investigators later found that Parker and Jaxon's grandfather was not dying, while no legitimate travel plans were made, Ms Koch said. Arrest warrants were quickly issued. On February 20, a federal warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was put out for Dohm. Nine days earlier, a state arrest warrant had been issued for interference with custody. A vehicle matching the description of Dohm's Nissan Pathfinder had been seen in the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, early on February 6, though there had been no further sightings. It is not known at this time who alerted authorities to the boys location, or if their father did in fact alter their appearance in any way. Change? Police believe the boys' appearances may have been changed following their alleged kidnapping.

"It is tempting whilst on holiday to let your hair down and enjoy the freedom of being away from home. Some holidaymakers take that freedom a little too far or fail to do their homework on local customs or laws, leading to calls for tourists to preserve some of their modesty and put on another layer or two. From a bikini ban in Spain to a law that requires knees to be covered whilst shopping in Dubai, MailOnline Travel has compiled some of the clothing bans from around the world which have led to embarrassing incidents or fines for visitors. Underboob photos have been posted by celebrities such as Rihanna and Suki Waterhouse to their many fans . Underboob selfies in Thailand . It was revealed this month that Thailand would be banning women from taking underboob selfies to avoid the 'obscene' material causing 'public panic'.

Last year Qatar issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered trousers and are not modest enough to wear in public. Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country. The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting. The pamphlets asked visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.' It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.' The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account. Cover up or pay up! Beware if you are in Spain and fancying strolling off the beach in a bikini and heading into town, as you could face large fines . Shelve the swimsuits in Spain . Holidaymakers who feel the need to wander off the beach and into the town in their bikinis and speedos should think again in Spain. In 2011 Barcelona announced that tourists who wander the streets in their swimming costumes, or less, could face fines. Mallorca followed suit with this last year and said penalties of up to £500 could be dished out for wearing swimming costumes in the street. Aimed at both tourists and citizens, the laws are part of Palma City Council's 'Good Citizen Plan' which is known in Spain as the 'Ordenanza Civica.' Cover up in the Vatican . Fed up with tourists walking around the Holy See in skimpy outfits, instructions were issued in 2010 to cover up, particularly when entering St Peter's Basilica. However, reports emerged of the Swiss Guards - the Pope's private army - implementing the rules across the city state. Men in shorts and women who had not covered their shoulders were reportedly pulled aside in the July heat to be informed they were not dressed appropriately. In order to enter the Vatican they were forced to buy shawls and trousers form nearby shops to ensure they were modestly dressed enough to pass inspection.

"Pressure is mounting in Moscow to exhume the bones of the tragic last Russian emperor and his family amid doubts expressed by the Russian Orthodox Church as to their authenticity. The bones which are believed to belong to murdered Tsar Nicholas II, his empress Alexandra and three of their children were dug up in 1991 and are now buried in a crypt in St Petersburg. The famous ruler was forced to abdicate his throne during the First World War in 1917 before he and his family were exiled to western-Russia by the Bolshevik revolutionaries that overthrew him. And on 17 July 1918, the Russian royals were marched into a cellar and mercilessly shot by firing squad on the orders of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin. The proposal to exhume their remains was backed this week by a pretender to the Romanov throne and a senior official in Vladimir Putin's government. The Romanovs: There is growing pressure on the Russian government to dig up the bodies of Russia's last emperor Nicholas II (pictured), his wife Alexandra (centre) and daughters Olga (left), Tatiana (top) and Anastasia (right) - his other daughter Maria and son Alexei (both pictured) were never buried . Remains: The skulls of Nicholas II (right), his wife Alexandra (left) were discovered in 1979 and buried in a crypt in St Petersburg in 1998 - along with their daughters Olga, Tatiana and Anastasia . Forgotten: Although his sisters Olga (left) and Tatiana (right) received a state burial at Peter and Paul Cathedral, Alexei's (centre) remains were never buried . And MailOnline can also reveal that eight years after the discovery of the alleged remains of crown prince  Alexei - brutally shot aged 13 with other members of his family - they have still not been laid to rest. Instead his bones - and those of his sister Grand Duchess Maria - lie almost forgotten in cardboard boxes stashed in the Russian state archive with Putin's government refusing to order a burial in the face of objections from the church. Many will see this as the final indignity to a boy born to be tsar, pictured here in remarkable private family photographs, who was deprived of his throne by the two Russian revolutions of 1917. For three hundred years, the House of Romanov was regarded by millions of Russians as the living embodiment of the Russian nation who believed the tsar was appointed by god to rule the empire. It is widely believed that his remains and those of his wife, their children and several servants were originally found in a forest near Yekaterinburg in 1979 and subsequently dug up 11 years later as the USSR was collapsing. Exhaustive DNA tests were conducted in Britain and the US involving matches with living relatives, including Prince Philip, after which they were interred in a crypt in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in royal capital St Petersburg in a 1998 ceremony. Objections: The Orthodox Church refuses to accept the opinion of leading DNA experts who say the bones are those of the tsar Nicholas II (top left), his German-born empress Alexandra (bottom right) and their children . Concession: A Senior official in Vladimir Putin's government Sergey Mironenko says 'it is necessary to listen to the church' and dig up the royal family's remains. Pictured are the remains of Alexei and his sister Maria, 19, discovered in 2007 and still have not been buried . The Bolsheviks justified the Romanov's murder by claiming their royal relatives were supporting the 'White armies' - as Nicholas II's cousin was King George of Britain. Before murdering them, the chief executioner Yakov Yurovsky said: 'In view of the fact that your relatives in Europe are continuing their assault on Soviet Russia, the presidium of the Ural Soviet had sentenced you to be shot.' Now Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna - a claimant to the defunct throne - has made clear the Russian Imperial House would not oppose exhuming the remains of the tsar and four other members of his family if deemed necessary by Putin's government and the Orthodox Church. Sergey Mironenko, the senior archivist under Putin, said on Spas TV: 'To find out the truth it is necessary to listen to the church representatives and exhume the remains that were buried in Peter and Paul Cathedral.' Behind the controversy is the Orthodox Church's refusal to accept the opinion of a host of leading DNA experts in Russia and the West who say the bones originally found buried in 1979 in the Urals forest are those of the tsar Nicholas II, his German-born empress Alexandra and their children. Despite the bones being interred in 1998 close to other Romanov rulers at a ceremony when tsar lookalike Prince Michael of Kent represented the Queen, the Russian church has refused to accept they are unequivocally the right bones. The discovery of two further sets of small fragments of male and female human remains in 2007 - shown by DNA tests to be haemophiliac Alexei and his sister Maria, 19 - added to the historical mystery. The church refused to bury them with the rest of their family, claiming the scientific proof was insufficient, yet genetic experts say it is '80 trillion times more likely' that the male's bones were Alexei's than not. Regal: For three hundred years, the House of Romanov - eventually led by Nicholas II - was regarded by millions of Russians as the living embodiment of the Russian nation . Taken: Had history taken a different route and the Romanov's not been executed, Alexei (pictured) would have become Emperor and Autocrat of Russia - as well as head of the Orthodox Church . Ironically had history taken a different route, Alexei would have become Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russia's - as well as head of the Orthodox Church. Lawyer for the Russian Imperial House, German Lukyanov, said that if the Russian government requires it the Romanov's descendants would 'not be against further examination' of the bones. He said: 'It is crucially important to consider the opinion of the Russian Orthodox church about possible exhumation, and for society to come to an agreement on this. 'Grand duchess Maria Vladimirovna will support the opinion of Russian Orthodox church. ' Senior official Mironenko said further tests on the bones should be carried out with experts trusted by the church. He was 'strongly against' burying the supposed remains of the crown prince and his sister without new tests which satisfy the Russian church. Church representative Vsevolod Chaplin said there was an understandable desire 'to bury the remains which are now stored in an office' at the archive. Cover up: Regarding the buried bones, a church representative said: 'Many people would like to know the truth - and suspect that the truth is hidden from them' But added: 'Many people would like to know the truth - and suspect that the truth is hidden from them. 'I think that we should allow a wide range of competent experts, and not necessarily only the Orthodox, to the study of all available remains.' In 2011, the Russian Investigative Committee - its equivalent of the FBI - completed a probe into the royal deaths, and concluded based on DNA evidence that the bodies found in the Urals were genuine, including Alexei and Maria. Along with the remains of the 50 year old tsar were his 46 year-old wife Alexandra Fyodorovna, their daughters Olga, 22, Tatyana, 21, and Anastasia, 17. The dismembered bodies of their servants Yevgeny Botkin, 53, Anna Demidova, aged 40, Aloizy Trupp, aged 62, and Ivan Kharitonov, aged 48 were also there - while Alexei and Maria's bodies were dumped 230ft away. The church - and some Romanov relatives - have accepted an earlier White Army investigator called Nikolai Sokolov's account that the royals were disposed of at another location, at a nearby abandoned iron mine at Garina Yama. They were supposed to have been stripped and burned to ashes. Proof: In 2011, the Russian Investigative Committee concluded on DNA evidence that the Romanov bodies found in the Urals were genuine . Doomed: Within a year of this photo being taken, the Russian revolution swept across the country and forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate . However others contend that while they were originally thrown into Garina Yama, the royals were later removed to a new burial place by the Bolsheviks to hide them from the White forces which soon retook the area. The church also points to a DNA test which failed to find a match between a handkerchief stained with Nicholas's blood during an assassination attempt in Japan before he became tsar. They stress the bones said to be the tsar's did not show marks from a sword wound in this attack. The scientists leading the identification of the tsar and his family were Peter Gill of the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, England, Pavel Ivanov of the Genetic Laboratory in Moscow and Michael Coble of the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in Rockville, Maryland, US. The analysis showed a match between the tsarina Alexandra and Prince Philip. A common female ancestor of both was Queen Victoria. 'The DNA testing was clear and convincing,' said Coble. Proof: In 2011, the Russian Investigative Committee completed a probe into the royal deaths and concluded based on DNA evidence that the bodies found in the Urals did belong to Nicholas II (left) and his family . When the other remains were found in 2007, analysis only confirmed the previous findings, say the scientists. When the boy's Y chromosome was compared with the bones believed to be his father Nicholas II's and a living donor Andrei Romanov who also descended from Tsar Nicholas I - they matched. Finally, a blood sample from a shirt worn by Nicholas during the Japanese attack - stashed in a St Petersburg museum - showed matching DNA. Church sources say they require 100 per cent certainty. The Chaplin said it was important not only genetically match a particular individual fragment remains with other members of the Romanov family, but also to consider the integrity of the skeletons, and whether 'they all correspond to each other genetically'. The lack of a sword wound led to doubts, he said. A final decision on exhumation would rest with President Putin.","Orthodox Church and family's descendants calling for bodies to be dug up .

"Julian Kremer, 49, stole almost £2million from estate agency he worked at and used cash to fund gambling habit and bought 'Laird' title . A bookkeeper stole almost £2million from his employers and used some of the money to buy a plot of land in Scotland - complete with an aristocratic title. Julian Kremer, 49, admitted fiddling the books at the estate agency he worked for in Wokingham, Berkshire, and used most of the cash to fund an internet gambling habit, a court heard. Five members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents were made redundant due to the losses while the company fell into financial ruin. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get'. Prosecutor Jane Davies told the court Kremer's crimes came to light on January 31, 2013, after the salaries of two employees had not been paid. She said: 'Steven Jones, the company director, made inquiries about the balances in five of the company accounts because it was believed the balances were not as they should have been.' The court heard he had altered the figures on at least two of the accounts to an inflated sum to make them look higher than they were. He was confronted by staff and admitted taking £1.9 million over a four and a half year period, from July 2008 to January 2013, and spent more than £630,000 on gambling. Mr Recorder Martin Heslop QC said: 'One of the gambling companies described him as their best customer.' Credit card bills showed payments exceeding £4,000 a month and some of the cash was spent on hotels. He also bought a small plot of land in Scotland which meant he could use the title Laird Julian Kremer and he asked for his personal details to be altered to reflect the name change. Company director, Steven Jones, who runs the company under the names Richard Worth Ltd, Richard Worth Residential Ltd and Richard Worth Holdings Ltd, told the court he had known Kremer for almost 20 years. Miss Davies said: 'Kremer stole around £250,000 a year and told Mr Jones cash flow was not improving due to debts. 'After the discovery, Mr Jones did everything he could to minimise financial ruin for the company. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court (pictured) on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get' 'He had to borrow £250,000 personally and made redundant five members of staff. He took on a £1million debt which will take many years to repay. 'The business was the bedrock of his retirement planning and he doubts he will ever recover from the financial disaster.' Defending, Llewellyn Sellick said Mr Jones had sold the letting limb of the business and the other was still trading. He told the court: 'He is of hitherto good character, he accepts this involves a very large sum. He made an immediate confession to his employers and he repeated this when he was arrested. 'He now has nothing. He was heavily addicted to gambling and had to sell his £400,000 house. 'By the 1990s, he had lost three of his grandparents and his mother's brother. His brother Simon was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 aged 41.' Kremer separated from his wife in 2007 and has been in a civil marriage with his now husband since 2011. Mr Sellick said: 'He knows he has to be punished. I ask that you impose a sentence that will not crush him entirely.' The court heard Kremer, formerly from Wokingham, and now living in Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to one count of theft from an employer in January. Kremer admitted altering figures to make them look higher than they were and his crimes only came to light after there was not enough money to pay two members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents in Wokingham . Jailing him for five years, Mr Recorder Heslop said: 'This case paints a sad picture of a man of previous good character. 'There are severe financial and personal consequences for those who suffered as a result of this theft. A suspended prison sentence is, I am afraid, wholly inappropriate. 'This was a professional, sophisticated and at times extremely clever and deliberate theft involving fraud, forgery and misrepresentation to those for whom you worked and it is a theft on a very significant scale carried out over a substantial period of time. 'The total sum is £1,981,936 and this is as bad a case as one could imagine. It is quite clear the money went on gambling. 'There is also evidence of high living. You were using this money to enjoy a significantly high level of living.' Kremer, carrying a large holdall and wearing a black suit and yellow tie, wiped his eyes as he was led away while family members sitting in the public gallery sobbed.","Julian Kremer, 49, admitted fiddling books at Richard Worth estate agents .

"A high school teacher charged with murdering her ex-husband earlier this month is expected to be released on bail after a judge halved her bond to $250,000 at a hearing on Thursday. Cara Ryan, 45, is accused of killing John 'J.J.' Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, after an argument on the evening of March 7. Rush's daughter, Meghan, 21, who testified at the hearing, sobbed as Circuit Judge Michael Andrews announced his decision to halve Ryan's original $500,000 bond. Meghan Rush, 21, wept in court on Thursday after a judge halved stepmom Cara Ryan's bail to $250,000 . Cara Ryan, 45, is accused of killing John 'J.J.' Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, after an argument on the evening of March 7 . Authorities allege that Ryan shot Rush after calling him to her home with a sexually suggestive text message, reports The Tampa Bay Times. Police said Ryan started dating a detention deputy after separating from Rush earlier this year. She eventually admitted to investigators that the deputy had texted her the night of the killing and Rush became angry after seeing the message. The couple divorced in 2006 but had been in an on-and-off relationship since. Rush's family say that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February. During Thursday's bail hearing, Meghan Rush testified that her stepmom and her father had often fought during their marriage. Forensic specialists told the judge that they believe Rush was shot at about 10:14 p.m. Ryan called 911 at 10:17 p.m. and told the dispatcher that Rush had raped her and so she had shot him. During Thursday's bail hearing, Meghan Rush testified that her stepmom and her father had often fought during their marriage . Authorities allege that Ryan shot Rush after calling him to her home with a sexually suggestive text message . Since then Ryan has changed her story several times and at one point she claimed a stranger had burst into her bedroom before she fired the gun. She has been charged with second-degree murder. Though acknowledging that the evidence against Ryan is 'pretty significant,' Judge Andrews said her family ties made her a low flight risk. Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had worked in the forensic unit at the St Petersburg Police Department. He retired after being injured following an on-duty car crash in 2005. Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said. Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home,  WTSP reported. Split: Ryan, a high school teacher, and Rush, a former cop, had divorced in 2003 but had rekindled and had moved back in together. But their relationship soured again and he moved out last month . Scene: The shooting unfolded following an argument at Ryan's home, pictured, on March 7 . 'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said. Ryan, who owns the home where Rush was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades. Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter. On a gofundme page set up in her father's memory, their daughter Meghan paid tribute to his service. The page has raised more than $6,000 of a $10,000 goal. 'The unexpected death of John has been an emotional roller coaster for our family,' she wrote. 'We are all proud of John's service and we always greatly appreciate the day to day sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make just like John has.'","Meghan Rush, 21, wept in court on Thursday after a judge halved stepmom Cara Ryan's bail to $250,000 .

"The convicted killer featured on the popular 'Serial' podcast filed a brief Monday with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals stating the case for why his conviction should be overturned. Adnan Syed, 34, was convicted of strangling his high school sweetheart Hae Min Lee in 1999 and has been serving a life sentence since 2000. He was 17 at the time of Lee's death. The lawyer for Syed is arguing his client should be granted a new trial because his former attorney, Christina Gutierrez, made mistakes that were 'deeper than the typical error or omission'. Scroll down for video . Adnan Syed, the subject of Serial, was convicted of strangling his high school sweetheart Hae Min Lee in 1999 . Syed, who was 17 at the time of Lee's (right) death, has been serving a life sentence since 2000 and is now 34 . Maryalnd Court of Special Appeals agreed to hear Syed's appeal in February after two unsuccessful attempts . Syed's new lawyer Justin Brown claims Gutierrez failed to interview an alibi witness and never inquired about the possibility of a plea deal. Gutierrez, who was disbarred by consent after questions arose about her handling of client funds, died 12 years ago amid legal and health problems, the Baltimore Sun reported. In the filing, Brown wrote: 'The errors by trial counsel were of such a fundamental nature that Syed must be given a new trial. 'The circumstances here are worse than the circumstances of any other case in which a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel relating to an alibi issue.' The basis of Syed's appeal is that Gutierrez failed to interview Asia McClain, a student at Syed's school who said she was with him in the library at the approximate time of Lee's death. McClain had written to Syed after his arrest offering to speak with investigators and his attorney. In her letters, McClain also mentioned two other witnesses who said they saw Syed at the library.

"You might want to think twice the next time you put some bacon under the grill. A video has revealed just how smart pigs are, which may leave some people a little more reluctant to tuck into a choice cut of pig. The latest evidence of the creature's intelligence shows a pig sorting shapes without any human intervention. Moritz the pig in Berlin, Germany has solved a complex puzzle. The pig did it without any help from a human. In a video (shown) the pig puts coloured shapes into a wooden block. Recent research also revealed they have empathy like humans . The video was recorded by Nicolle von Eberkopf, who lives in Berlin, Germany. In a video, Moritz the pig places coloured pig-shaped blocks in corresponding coloured holes on a wooden board. The pig does this using its mouth, without any help. ‘Animals are an important part of our society,’ said Ms von Eberkopf. The sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human. In an elaborate experiment, experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates. This findings by Wageningen University in the Netherlands suggest that swine respond to each other’s feelings, and adds weight to the argument that the practice of separating the animals in farms is especially cruel. The pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress, by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat, or putting them in a stressful situation, such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen. Untrained, ‘naïve’ pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness, or one that expected discomfort. All the pigs were then played the same music – a piece by Bach - used in training. Some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them, either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress, such as keeping their ears back, urinating and defecating. Despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all, they were still taken to another pen, leaving the naïve pigs behind, and were either rewarded or punished, depending on their training. The naïve pigs, which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates, reacted to the trained pigs’ behaviour anyway. Asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed, using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft 'chirp,' Discovery recently reported. Consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant's mouth so they are vulnerable, perhaps showing they are there to help. Crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent, with researchers at the Konrad Lorenz Research Station in Austria finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight. Ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it. University of Portsmouth research has shown that orangutans (stock image) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others. When one orangutan laughs, others often join in . Scrub jays - another member of the Corvid family - have 'funerals' for deceased friends, according to research by the University of California, Davis. They fly over the dead body, wailing and screeching, which may be a sign of grief. Mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends. Garet Lahvis, an assistant professor at Oregon Health and Science University, said: 'Mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible.' Similarly, rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement, fear and anger. They even help each other out with no prospect of a reward, according to Washington State University. The rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling. Gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls.

The sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human. In an elaborate experiment, experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates . For example, when a trained pig showed it was stressed, a naïve pig acted in the same way, by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back. The behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained ‘happy’ pigs, with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails. To test that the animals were responding to each other’s behaviour and not simply the music, the scientists played the naïve pigs the tune. They showed no signs of changing their behaviour, indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals. The findings were published in the journal Animal Cognition.","Moritz the pig in Berlin, Germany has solved a complex puzzle .

"Four people, including a policewoman, have been arrested over links to the attacks that terrorised Paris earlier this year, French police and security officials have said. The two officials said one man who was detained had ties to Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed a policewoman on January 8 and then four more people at a kosher supermarket on January 9 before being killed by security forces. They added that the detained man's ex-girlfriend, a policewoman who was suspended after peeking into his criminal file, was also in custody. Scroll down for video . The two officials said one man who was detained had ties to Amedy Coulibaly (pictured) Coulibaly was responsible for the siege at the kosher deli (pictured) on January 9 where he killed four people . The siege ended when Coulibaly was shot dead by police as they raided the premises . The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, had no details about the two others. It has been claimed the policewoman worked at Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois, in north east Paris, which is the location of a police intelligence centre. Le Figaro reported that she was suspended from her duties in early February. Coulibaly shot dead an unarmed policewoman on January 8, before taking hostages at a Jewish supermarket in Paris the following day. That siege ended after he killed a further four people, before police stormed the building and killed him in a blaze of bullets. During the siege, Coulibaly had told French media that he had 'synchronized' the attacks with the Charlie Hebdo killers, but failed to provide any further details. Detectives also allegedly discovered that Coulibaly filmed his attack on his assault on the kosher supermarket with a high-tech GoPro camera attached to his chest. It is understood the footage was then sent via internet from the hostage scene, but it has not been posted since. No-one besides three dead gunmen have been linked directly to the January 7 - 9 attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and the market, which left 20 people dead, including the gunmen. Last month Islamic State published what it described as an interview with Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, claiming for the first time she was among extremist fighters. Boumeddiene is believed to have fled to Syria not long before her husband carried out the shocking attacks across Paris. Coulibaly's attacks coincided with the masscare at the Charlie Hebdo offices perpetrated by the Kouachi brothers Said and Cherif.

"He has already made abolishing the Affordable Care Act the centerpiece of his young presidential campaign, and once spoke for 21 hours straight on the floor of the U.S. Senate in a bid to block its funding. But now Ted Cruz says he and his family will be the latest to use the system, signing up for medical insurance coverage through the Obamacare law's government-run marketplaces. Cruz's wife Heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs to campaign with him – and lost her employer-funded plan in the process. As Democrats gleefully mocked the irony, though, Cruz insists he's just following the law. OBAMASCARE: Ted Cruz announced his presidential run on Monday, the same day his wife took a leave of absence from her job – forgoing the family's medical insurance . PEDIATRICS ON LINE ONE: The Cruz daughters, Catherine (left) and Caroline (right) need a health plan and for now the Obamacare system will have to do – while their father works to 'rip it out, root and branch' TRANSITION: Heidi Cruz left her Goldman Sachs 'Cadillac Plan' behind when she took a leave of absence to campaign for her husband . 'We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that,' Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, told The Des Moines Register on Tuesday. The exchanges, created by the Obamacare law, are designed to be state-specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage. Using them is mandatory for middle-income Americans who want to receive federal government subsidies to help pay their premiums. The Affordable Care Act originally left members of Congress alone, but Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley famously inserted a 'poison pill' amendment requiring them – and their staff members – to participate like other Americans if they lacked insurance from other sources. 'The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better,' Grassley said back then. Democrats didn't budge, and the provision now requires Cruz to join millions who have signed up for Obamacare-brokered coverage. He could get the last laught, however, using his experience to construct a first-hand testimonial about the law's shortcomings. Liberal lawmakers were mum Tuesday on the development, passing up an easy opportunity to call Cruz a hypocrite. Daily Mail Online asked five Senate offices and five House offices, all Democratic, for comment. None would offer one. Planned Parenthood, America's biggest abortion lobby, did use the 'H' word. It has defended the Obamacare law, largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage. 'Luckily for Sen. Ted Cruz, hypocrisy isn't a pre-existing condition,' the group tweeted. The Democratic National Committee weighed in, but offered only a half-swing at the softball question. 'The Affordable Care Act, by design, helps Americans who have gaps in employment get coverage, and it's working,' DNC National Press Secretary Holly Shulman told Daily Mail Online. 'We encourage others to follow presidential candidate Ted Cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered.' The Houston firebrand won't exactly get a grassroots experience when he enrolls, however. GLEE: The Democratic National Committee piled on, but never called Cruz a hypocrite . THe 'H' WORD: Abortion lobby Planned Parenthood heaped on the scorn at Cruz's predicament . The Washington, D.C. city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that's not part of the Affordable Care Act itself, allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city's Small Business Health Options Program. That system was designed for 'small businesses' with fewer than 50 employees. The United States Congress employs more than 20,000 people. It also makes medical insurance customers eligible for payments from their employers for most of the premiums. The Obama administration's Office of Personnel Management made the arrangement legal by quietly issuing a rule just before the Obamacare law took effect – and setting the typical reimbursement level at 75 per cent. Some customers, including well-paid senators, will get that benefit even though their income levels would be too high to qualify for subsidies if they had to buy coverage on the open exchanges like millions of others. Cruz told CNN on Tuesday that he has no choice but to 'follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with.' 'It's one of the real differences – if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change,' Cruz said. NOT TOO LATE, TED: Even though the Obamacare open-enrollment period is over, Americans can still sign up if they 'have certain life changes in 2015' He also took a verbal swing at Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has allowed professional staffers on Senate committees to exempt themselves. 'Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn't want to be under the same rules as the American people,' he sniped. But Cruz still believes the Obamacare law should be killed – 'ripped out, root and branch' is how he put it during an Iowa event in January. 'And I believe it will be,' he told the paper, the largest and most influential in the early presidential caucus state of Iowa. 'I believe in 2017 a new president, a Republican president will sign legislation repealing every word of it,' he insisted. 'There are a fair number of Republicans in Washington and elsewhere who have quietly and privatively given up on that fight and I have not.'","Presidential candidate launched campaign Monday on the promise of replacing the Affordable Care Act with something more GOP-friendly .

"Last summer, for a party at home in Devon, we thought it would be fun to make an earth oven where you dig a hole in the garden, light a fire and cook meat — in this case, lamb — in the ground. But by 7pm, it was clear the meat wasn’t cooking quickly enough. Already, the children were starting to go rogue. I had lots of mouths to feed, but nothing to put on plates. If my guests weren’t going to go home hungry, I’d have to do something quickly. I rushed to my larder and breathed a sigh of relief. There on the shelves were enough ingredients to feed the five thousand. Indeed, my sister Sofie always jokes that we could survive a nuclear winter with the contents of my larder. Kirstie Allsopp (pictured) says her well-stocked larder is the pride of her home, and even had a bespoke larder specially made after discovering her second home didn't come with one already built-in . I’m not saying it was something Jamie Oliver would have been proud to put his name to, but from a range of foods that included tomatoes, flour, milk, cheese, pine nuts and chilli oil, I made three types of sauces and served them with pasta. No one went hungry. My larder had saved the day. According to research, the larder has come back in from the cold. John Lewis say that half of their customers shopping for new kitchens want to integrate a larder into their design. Last week, David Cameron was photographed preparing a meal in his kitchen at Downing Street. Next to his super-huge fridge was a modest but perfectly formed larder, stocked with everything from Marmite to mango chutney. Some say the resurgence is thanks to Downton Abbey, with inspirational scenes of Mrs Patmore and assistant cook Daisy in their larder. Indeed, the very word ‘larder’ makes you think of the cavernous cold rooms found in stately homes such as Highclere Castle (where Downton is filmed), which traditionally were bursting with salted meat, pickles, preserves and fresh bread. But you’ve never had to be a lord to own a larder. In the Fifties, even the most modest new-build would have had a walk-in space at the back of the kitchen where food was stored. There was wall-to-floor shelving and often a marble shelf to keep food such as butter and cheese as chilled as possible. Kitchen suppliers and property agents have reported that more buyers are now looking for built-in larders like Kirstie's (pictured). 'A good larder can even add value to a property,' says the TV presenter . It was the arrival of the fridge in the mid-Fifties that dampened our ardour for the larder. Though the first ones cost the equivalent of £4,500 in today’s money, as prices came down and more people were able to afford one, larders went out of fashion. And that’s a shame. In the U.S., where summers are baking hot, I can see why the fridge is a necessity. But in our damp, cold climate, do we really need quite so much of our food kept at temperatures close to freezing? The simple answer is ‘No’. Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder. Eggs, for instance, should keep beautifully fresh for several weeks in a cool larder. Tomatoes taste infinitely better straight from the larder, as do avocados, bananas, apples and oranges. Some say the resurgence is thanks to Downton Abbey, with inspirational scenes of Mrs Patmore (right) and assistant cook Daisy (left) in their larder . I don’t keep any of my jams, pickles or sauces in the fridge: I don’t want chilled jam on my toast. I don’t even keep my cheese in the fridge, particularly runny French varieties. Health and safety would say I’m endangering the health of my family — but I haven’t poisoned anyone yet. To be honest, my larder is one of my favourite things in our home. There was already a larder in our house in Devon, so when we moved into our second house in West London nine years ago, I had one built into the kitchen. It’s 5ft by 6ft, with four deep shelves around three of the walls. It has a wine rack and spice rack, as well as a free-standing rack for veg. True to tradition, there’s a marble shelf and a small window, which we keep open. Kirstie (pictured) loves her larder so much, she chooses to use it more frequently than her fridge. 'Not only does food taste better, there’s also far less waste,' says the Location, Location star . My partner Ben hated it and wanted me to knock it down as soon as he saw it. I stood my ground, and he now admits it’s one of the great triumphs in the house. To start with, I confess, my use of the shelves was pretty chaotic. But a few years ago, while we were on holiday, our super-organised nanny Heather rearranged all the shelves. She bought dozens of containers and jars from Lakeland and transformed that little room. Now, I’m a slave to its military precision. Sometimes, I’ll go in and just stand there, admiring the neatly lined-up packets and jars. I took a picture of it at its tidiest and attached it to the door, with a note: ‘PLEASE KEEP THE LARDER THIS WAY!’ As we only have two cupboards in our entire kitchen, it’s not just food that we keep in the larder. Our medicines, alcohol, mixers, Tupperware, picnic stuff and Thermos flasks are stored there, too. Kirstie reveals that she now only has two storage cupboards in her kitchen (pictured), instead storing everything from spices and sauces to alcohol, medicines, Tupperwear and picnic sets in her beloved larder . The only things we don’t keep in it are chemicals for cleaning and washing. We do own a fridge. In fact, we recently got our first new fridge. (Ben is a property developer, so we’ve always had hand-me-down fridges.) But while most people’s fridges are bursting at the seams, if you open the door to ours, it looks as if we haven’t shopped for a month. So, why do I love my larder so much? Well, not only does food taste better, there’s also far less waste. We’re a shockingly profligate nation, throwing a third of the fresh food we buy. I wonder how much of this is due to our groceries getting ‘lost’ at the back of a crammed fridge? It’s so much more convenient to walk into a single small area and see exactly what items you have at a glance. 'Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder,' says Kirstie (pictured in her kitchen) My TV colleague Phil Spencer says he’s noticed an increase in buyers asking for a larder when searching for property. That doesn’t surprise me. There’s something about a larder that appeals to our emotions to do with providing for our family. Though I’m not a hoarder when it comes to things like clothes, there’s something reassuring about seeing enough pasta, rice and even medicines on the shelves to know that if the shops all shut tomorrow, and civilisation collapsed, I could feed my family for a while longer. A larder is more ecological, too. These awful American monolith fridges use an extortionate amount of energy, while even the average fridge uses two units of electric power per hour — enough to run a small TV for 20 hours. But a larder, well, apart from a light switch, it’s energy free. What’s more, it adds value to the house — though it’s hard to say precisely how much. But this isn’t about money. I’ve always said that a house only works if the kitchen works — and for me, the larder is the secret of a truly successful kitchen. I wouldn’t be without mine. Love It Or List It, presented by Kirstie Allsopp & Phil Spencer, starts on Channel 4 in April.","Kirstie Allsopp says she couldn't live without her well-stocked larder .

"Experts have abandoned an eight-day vigil for a wakeup call from the robot lander Philae, but remained hopeful the scout will revive as it rides on a comet nearing the Sun. Monitoring for the lander, which has been hibernating since November, will resume next month, the mission said. 'Perhaps it is still too cold for the Philae lander to wake up on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,' the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) said in a blog posted by the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p, shown in the illustration above . The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. 'Maybe its power resources are not yet sufficient to send a signal to the team at the DLR Lander Control Center.' There has been no news of Philae for more than four months. That was when the battery ran down on the 100-kilogram (220-pound) lab after it bumped down in a rugged, shadowed part of the comet. Philae had just enough juice to carry out a 54-hour roster of core experiments before going into shutdown mode. The hope is that as the comet races towards the Sun, more light will bathe the probe's solar panels, enabling it to power up again and resume work. Its mother ship Rosetta sent down Philae on November 12 after a 10-year trek around the Solar System. It began to listen out for signals on March 12 as it launched a schedule of orbital swoops around the spot where Philae is believed to have landed. But there was only silence, and at 0400 GMT on Friday, Rosetta's communication unit was switched off, the ESA blog said. 'It was a very early attempt,' said DLR Project Manager Stephan Ulamec. 'We will repeat this process until we receive a response from Philae. We have to be patient.' Engineers saw an early chance in March when comet and lander were about 300 million kilometers (187 million miles) from the Sun, and the amount of solar radiation had nearly doubled compared to November. The next chance to receive a signal is during the first half of April, the blog said. Philae needs an internal temperature of more than minus 45 degrees Celsius (minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit) and at least five watts of power to automatically turn on. Until it can generate 19 watts, it cannot send signals to Earth via the orbiter. Philae has 10 instruments, including a drill, chemistry sets and imaging tools. It is the crowning feat in a 1.3-billion-euro ($1.4-billion) mission to unlock the secrets of comets, which some astrophysicists believe may have 'seeded' Earth with some of the ingredients for life. The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice. It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground. Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air. Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far. It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site. The duck-shaped comet 67p/Churyumove-Geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . This image sent back by the Philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe. Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander. Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images. Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice. This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life. From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived. But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander's solar panels. This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board. The image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the Philea lander . Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander. Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up. It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up. Once awake, Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter. Koen Guerts, part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre, said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home. He said: 'Philae is designed so that, since November 2014, it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up.' 'At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power.' This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet's surface after failing to anchor itself . Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication. Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys. Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth. Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit, it will first send data about its 'health' to Earth. The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results. If sufficient energy cannot be stored in the battery, the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed. Currently, scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys. Mr Ulamec added: 'Once we can communicate with Philae again, the scientific work can begin.'","European Space Agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe .

"Tiny robots that can swim in the bloodstream and attack diseases may sound as if they belong in a sci-fi film. But these so-called nanorobots are set to be used to treat a person who is seriously ill with leukaemia. The lead researcher behind the innovation hopes the patient could be cured within a month - and has already successfully tested the machines in animals. Scroll down for videos . Nanorobots (pictured) which are made from a DNA 'cage' and hold a payload of drugs, could be used to treat a person who is seriously ill with leukaemia. The lead researcher behind the innovation hopes that the patient could be cured within a month, based upon successful tests in animals . Ido Bachelet, who was previously at Harvard’s Wyss Institute in Boston, Massachusetts and Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, intends to treat a patient who has been given six months to live. The patient is set to receive an injection of DNA nanorobots designed to interact with and destroy leukaemia cells without damaging healthy tissue. Speaking in December, he said: ‘Judging from what we saw [in tests], within a month that person is going to recover. Nanorobots can be programmed to independently recognise target cells and deliver payloads, such as cancer drugs, to these cells. The double helixes stay closed until specific molecules or proteins on the surface of cancer cells act like a 'key' to open the ‘barrel’ so the payload can be deployed. This diagram shows the nanorobot being 'unlocked' so the drugs (shown in purple) are released . Nanorobots are 'devices' made from DNA that are so small they can be injected into the bloodstream and carry a payload of drugs to specific cells. They are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape, which in this case looks a bit like an open-ended barrel. The robots have two halves linked together by flexible DNA hinges, which are held shut by latches that are DNA double helixes . A complementary piece of DNA is attached to a payload of drugs, which enables it to bind to the inside of the biological barrel. The double helixes stay closed until specific molecules or proteins on the surface of cancer cells act like a 'key' to open the ‘barrel’ so the payload can be deployed. Nanorobots can recognise a small population of target cells within a large population. George Church, who is involved in the research at the Wyss Institute explained the idea of the microscopic robots is to make a ‘cage’ that protects a fragile or toxic payload and ‘only releases it at the right moment.’ The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape, which in this case looks a little like a barrel. Dr Bachelet said: 'The nanorobot we designed actually looks like an open-ended barrel, or clamshell that has two halves linked together by flexible DNA hinges and the entire structure is held shut by latches that are DNA double helixes.’ A complementary piece of DNA is attached to a payload, which enables it to bind to the inside of the biological barrel. The double helixes stay closed until specific molecules or proteins on the surface of cancer cells act as a 'key' to open the ‘barrel’ so the payload can be deployed. 'The nanorobot is capable of recognising a small population of target cells within a large healthy population,’ Dr Bachelet continued. ‘While all cells share the same drug target that we want to attack, only those target cells that express the proper set of keys open the nanorobot and therefore only they will be attacked by the nanorobot and by the drug.’ The team has tested its technique in animals as well as cell cultures and said the ‘nanorobot attacked these [targets] with almost zero collateral damage.’ The method has many advantages over invasive surgery and blasts of drugs, which can be ‘as painful and damaging to the body as the disease itself,’ the team added. In the future, Dr Bachelet said people could  be injected with nanorobots at an annual doctor’s check-up (illustrated with a stock image). The nanorobots would screen ‘every cell’ in the body for cancerous or abnormal cells and destroy them before they spread . If Dr Bachelet's approach proves successful in humans, and is backed by more research in the coming years, the team’s work could signal a transformational moment in cancer treatment and could be used for many other diseases by delivering drugs more effectively without causing side effects. The field of DNA nanotechnology has been around for around 30 years. Pioneer Ned Seeman first came up with the idea of bending strands of DNA into shapes and since then 2D and 3D structures have been constructed. Dr Bachelet and his team have only been working on their innovation for three years but said the robots could be used to fix injured spinal cords in a couple of years’ time. Stronger drugs deemed too toxic using current techniques, could also be used to blitz cancer cells. 'This could revolutionise everything we know about drugs and medicine,’ he said. In the future, Dr Bachelet said people could even be injected with nanorobots at an annual doctor’s check-up. The nanorobots would screen ‘every cell’ in the body for cancerous or abnormal cells and destroy them before they spread. Currently, the technology can detect 12 types of tumour.

"Damian Ayles, from Twydall, Kent, was caught on camera defecating on his neighbours' doorstep as part of an unexplained vendetta against the family . A neighbour launched a revolting hate campaign against a 'tormented' family by defecating on their doorstep four times in the dead of the night. Damian Ayles carried out the twisted act before posting used tissues through the family's letterbox. The 23-year-old was only caught when his unnamed victims set up security cameras outside their home to catch the culprit. It came after Ayles, from Twydall, Kent,  smeared excrement across the family's car as part of the unexplained vendetta. The court heard how Ayles was too embarrassed to watch the footage of himself after being arrested by police. As the images were shown at Medways Magistrates' Court, Ayles also looked down at the floor with his hand over his mouth. His mother, who was sat in the public gallery, also looked away. Magistrates were told that Ayles first defecated outside the family's home in April last year, but that the victims did not go to the police. But the court heard how the same incident occurred again twice in September, prompting them to set up a security camera. The CCTV finally caught Ayles carrying out the act again in the middle of the night on September 29. Police then tracked Ayles down after finding traces of his DNA in the faeces, the court was told. Prosecutor Debbie Jones said: 'The defendant can be seen at 3.30am on September 29 pulling down his trousers, moving to the squat position and having a poo. 'He then wipes himself and puts it (the dirty tissue) in the letterbox and smears some of the faeces on their vehicle.' Ayles pleaded guilty to harassment without violence and was given a two-year restraining order preventing him from going near the family. He was also given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Ayles was also ordered to pay the family £350 in compensation and £85 in court costs. After the case a spokesman for the family said: 'I hope that the community service is cleaning up dog poo from children's playing parks.' Ayles, 23, pleaded guilty to harassment without violence and was given a two-year restraining order preventing him from going near the family . The court was told how the family, who have children, suffered stress and anxiety from the harassment and were left feeling unsafe in their home. They also told police they had been unable to sleep after being 'tormented' by Ayles's prolonged campaign. Chair of the bench Mandy Samrai said: 'This was a very serious matter.' Wayne Crowhurst, defending, said Ayles had autism and had the mental age of a 13 year-old. He said: 'He should not have done what he done and this is the end of the matter now, he wants to move on.'","Damian Ayles posted used tissues through family's postbox after the act .

"This is the heartstopping moment when a biker swerved within inches of a HGV during a high speed police chase which reached speeds of almost 150mph. Paul Roberts, 43, was seen weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic with a passenger on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike during the pursuit last September. The incredible footage, filmed by an unmarked police officer, shows Roberts come within inches of an HGV, then accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex. Incredible footage filmed by an unmarked police officer in pursuit shows Paul Roberts come within inches of an HGV, then accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph . His top speed is believed to be the highest ever recorded in the UK by a rider carrying a pillion passenger, the force said. When confronted over his potentially deadly driving, he replied: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.' Roberts, who runs a taxi firm in London, admitted dangerous driving at Chelmsford Crown Court and was banned from the road for 15 months. Recorder Colin Chandler said: 'Weaving in and out of traffic and undertaking, even within the speed limit, is what people would call 'hairy'. 'When it is done at speeds of up to and over 100mph - it can only be described as outrageous and nothing less. 'You are lucky that no one in this case was hurt or injured.' The court heard how Roberts had been speeding to work at around 7.30am on September 12 last year when he was seen by PC Paul Hills during a motorbike patrol to cut down on rush hour collisions. PC Hills pursued the reckless biker at speeds of up to 148mph but took four miles of road to catch Roberts. Geoffrey Porter, prosecuting, said: 'You will see the defendant weaving in between traffic and undertaking cars in lane three and two. 'When not doing that, he is accelerating. The dangerous motorcyclist had shot past the unmarked police car whop began the high speed chase of Roberts . After dodging between a HGV and car, the rider was filmed by officers in the unmarked police car in pursuit pulling in front of a car . 'He also is seen to pass between vehicles in heavy traffic. 'The officer describes it as 'making himself and his passenger the meat in a sandwich'. 'The highest speed recorded by PC Hills is up to 148mph. 'In his opinion, he was not making ground on the motorcycle being ridden by the defendant at this speed.' When spoken to about his speeding, he told the officer: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.' Roberts, from Harlow, Essex, pleaded guilty to one count of dangerous driving at an earlier hearing. He had been told he could face up to two years in prison before his sentencing today. The father-of-two claimed he had accelerated as he was carrying thousands of pounds in cash and cheques on his bike and feared he was being chased by the unmarked cop. The rider then accelerates to 148mph- the fastest speed recorded by police for a motorcyclist carrying a passenger . Roberts was later seen weaving in between two cars along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex . Kenneth Aylett, mitigating, said: 'The officer was not in a marked vehicle and was plain clothed. 'With an unmarked bike trailing him for a while he began to worry he was being trailed for the money.' Roberts was banned from driving for 15 months and will have to complete an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads. He was also fined £400 costs and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge as well as completing 120 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Outside court, Sgt Nick Edwards, who runs the Essex Police motorcycle unit, said: 'This is probably the highest speed recorded in Essex and is also the highest recorded in the UK with a pillion passenger. Roberts was recorded weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike . 'It is only through good fortune no injuries or deaths were caused by his driving that day. I'm satisfied with the severity of the sentence. 'The fact that imprisonment was considered as an option is welcomed.' Sergeant Nick Edwards, from the force's motorcycle unit, said: 'The levels of harm to which Paul Roberts subjected himself, his pillion passenger, the public and my officer are just beyond comprehension. 'These speeds are for race tracks not public roads. This riding behaviour will not be tolerated on Essex roads and the court have clearly recognised the consequences of the rider's actions in the punishment that has been awarded.'","Paul Roberts, 43, was filmed weaving wildly between rush-hour traffic .

"A bodybuilder threatened to kill is weightlifting ex-girlfriend after she posted pictures online with her new flame, court papers show. Shadie Assad, 29, was so enraged when he saw photos of bodybuilding former girlfriend Jill Livoti and her new beau Capriese Murray, that he contacted her with hostile text messages. 'Not once did you post pics of me and you,' Assad said to Livoti, 43, in a text message from September, court papers show. Scroll down for video . Shadie Assad (left), 29, sent his ex-girlfriend, Jill Livoti (right), 43, threatening text messages when he found out she was dating someone new . Livoti had posted pictures of herself and Capriese Murray online, and Assad was upset because she had never posted pictures of the two of them together . Livoti took out an order of protection against Assad in Manhattan Family Court when the couple, pictured here in May 2014, broke up . He threatened that the couple should 'enjoy it while it lasts' because he planned on 'ending it one way or another', according to the New York Post. 'I swear don't let me catch you in the street. I'll bust your face wide open!' Assad said in another text. 'Dead you and Capriese are dead,' he wrote. Assad left Murray a racist voice mail in addition to the messages, court papers show. He also 'stated that she better leave New York because the defendant was going to come for her and said if the cops are there, they're going to need the SWAT team,' according to court complaint records. Assad was arraigned on September 6 on felony criminal-contempt and other charges after being busted for the threatening messages. Capriese Murray, Livoti's new flame, also received a racist voicemail from Assad, court records show . Assad was given a no-jail plea deal in court on March 18 and agreed to take the New Start stalker program. The judge ordered a full order of protection against Livoti and Murray . His lawyer, however, argued that Assad was the real victim, because he had 'been subject to harassment on Facebook and other social media by the complaining witness'. All three involved are personal trainers in the body building world. Assad took first place in the Steve Stone Metropolitan Championships in 2013. Livoti won first place for Best Physique at the 2014 NPC Universe competition in New Jersey. When the couple broke up, Livoti took out an order of protection against the bodybuilder in Manhattan Family Court. Assad's top charge in the March 18 court appearance was reduced to a misdemeanor and he admitted to criminal contempt as a part of a no-jail plea deal. The judge ordered a full and final order of protection for Livoti and Murray and Assad agreed to complete the New Start stalker program.","When Shadie Assad, 29, and Jill Livoti, 43, broke up she took out an order of protection against him .

"A blundering Indian groom was dumped at the altar by his bride-to-be after he failed to solve a simple maths problem. The woman walked out of the ceremony after her would-be husband revealed his appalling arithmetic skills moments before they said 'I do.' She had asked him to add up 15 + 6 and he wrongly replied that the answer was 17. An Indian groom was dumped at the altar after he failed to solve a simple maths problem (file picture) 'The groom's family kept us in the dark about his poor education,' said Mohar Singh, the bride's father. 'Even a first grader can answer this.' Most marriages in India are arranged by the families of the bride and groom. Except for brief meetings, the couple rarely gets to know each other before the nuptials. The incident took place in the village of Rasoolabad village near the industrial town of Kanpur in northern Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday, local police officer Rakesh Kumar said. The groom's family tried persuading the woman to return, but she refused. She claimed the groom had misled them about his education. The woman's family said that a child could have solved the simple arithmetic (file picture) Local police were called in to mediate between the families and both sides returned all the gifts and jewelry that had been exchanged before the wedding, Kumar said. Last month, another bride in Uttar Pradesh married a wedding guest after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed at the wedding venue. Groom Jugal Kishore was just about to exchange vows when he collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital. Angry that she had not been informed of his condition, the 23-year-old bride, Indira, asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, Harpal Singh, to marry her instead. Mr Singh, who was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, was caught off guard, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding. After the ceremony, Mr Kishore returned to the venue after being treated in hospital to find that his fiancee had married someone else, it was reported by The Times of India.","Indian bride walks out of wedding after groom fails basic arithmetic test .

"Islamic State extremists have continued their attack on Iraq's cultural and historical heritage by bulldozing a second ancient site, officials say. Officials in the northern city of Mosul, which is under the control of the terror group, reported jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. Days earlier, the group targeted  a museum in Mosul, toppling statues, and using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts - as part of a wider plan to rid its territory of symbols they say promote idolatry. Scroll down for video . Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government is investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in northwestern Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . An official with the ministry of tourism and antiquities' archaeological division in Mosul, who spoke under anonymity for fear of reprisal, told the Associated Press that multiple residents living near Hatra heard two large explosions this morning. Residents then reported seeing bulldozers begin demolishing the site. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, told the AP that militants had begun carrying away artifacts from Hatra as early as Thursday. Today, they began to destroy the 2,000-year-old city. The extent of the damage at Hatra is unknown as the ministry has not yet received any pictures of the current state of the area, which was named a World Heritage Site in 1987. ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts . But one resident in the area told Reuters that he heard a powerful explosion early on Saturday. He added others nearby said Islamic State militants had destroyed some of the larger buildings in Hatra and were bulldozing other parts. Islamic State has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. A week ago, militants released a video showing them smashing statues and carvings in the Mosul's museum, which is home to priceless Assyrian and Hellenistic artefacts dating back 3,000 years. The majority of the artifacts destroyed were from Hatra. And on Friday, the group looted artefacts from Nimrud and bulldozed the ancient city, sparking global outrage. An ISIS fanatic uses a power tool to destroy a winged-bull Assyrian deity at a museum in Mosul last week . UNESCO condemned the actions as 'cultural cleansing' and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon branded the actions 'a war crime'. Iraqi Tourism and Antiquities Minister Adel Shirshab said that many feared Hatra would suffer the same fate as Nimrud. 'This is not unusual (behavior) for Daesh,' he said, using the derogatory Arabic acronym for the group. A statement on the ministry's Facebook page added the government is investigating reports of the attack on Hatra, adding that the global community should hasten its response to the crisis in Iraq in order to prevent these types of atrocities. Hatra is located 110 kilometers (68 miles) southwest of the city of Mosul. It dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site. It was a large fortified city during the Parthian Empire and capital of the first Arab kingdom. The ancient city, a UNESCO world heritage site, is said to have withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers. A temple to the Shamash sun god still stands more than 1,750 years after the Sassanian empire razed the Mesopotamian city. The ancient trading center in Hatra spanned 6 kilometers (4 miles) in circumference and was supported by more than 160 towers. At its heart are a series of temples with a grand temple at the center — a structure supported by columns that once rose to 100 feet. Saeed Mamuzini, a spokesman for the Mosul branch of the . Kurdish Democratic Party, said the militants had used explosives . to blow up buildings at Hatra and were also bulldozing it. The antiquities ministry said the lack of tough . international response to earlier Islamic State attacks on . Iraq's historic sites had encouraged the group to continue its . campaign. 'The delay in international support for Iraq has encouraged . terrorists to commit another crime of stealing and demolishing . the remains of the city of Hatra,' it said. Last year, the militants destroyed the mosque believed to be the burial place of the Prophet Younis, or Jonah, as well as the Mosque of the Prophet Jirjis — both revered ancient shrines in Mosul. They also threatened to destroy Mosul's 850-year old Crooked Minaret, but residents surrounded the structure, preventing the militants from approaching. Archaeologists compared the assault on Iraq's cultural history to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in 2001. But the relentless havoc wreaked by Islamic State, has not been limited to ancient monuments, but also extended to rival Muslim places of worship . Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in . parts of Iraq and Syria, promote a fiercely purist . interpretation of Sunni Islam, which draws its inspiration from . early Islamic history. They rejects religious shrines of any sort . and condemn Iraq's majority Shi'ite Muslims as heretics. Last July, militants destroyed the tomb of the prophet Jonah in . Mosul, the largest city under their control. Meanwhile, a US-led coalition has been striking Islamic State since August and is preparing a large-scale operation to retake the city of Mosul. But US and Iraqi officials have been cautious about setting a timeline for preparing Iraq's embattled military for the campaign.","Officials confirmed militants  begun destroying site of Hatra, northern Iraq .

"Year after year they trek across the globe, chasing those elusive few minutes when darkness falls within seconds as the moon comes between the earth and the sun. They are the eclipse chasers for whom no expense is too steep and no distance too great when it comes to pursuing their unusual hobby. Tomorrow's total eclipse will produce a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crosses the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Elsewhere only a partial eclipse will be seen at best and that is why there are only two places on the planet where the real junkies want to be tomorrow morning. Agnese Zalcmane, a 30-year-old IT consultant from Latvia who already has four eclipses under her belt, has joined seven friends to make the trip to Svalbard, which is 800 miles from the North Pole. Eclipse fan Agnese Zalcmane (second right) and fellow 'chasers' in Cairns, Australia, where they gathered for a total eclipse in 2012. Tomorrow will be the fifth time Agnese has stood in the shadow of the moon . Agnese saw this total eclipse in Kenya in 2013. Her family and friends think her unusual hobby 'pretty crazy' Dr Kate Russo is an Australian eclipse chaser living in Belfast who has authored the book Total Addiction: The Life of an Eclipse Chaser. She is in the Faroe Islands for tomorrow's eclipse . She has spent upwards of 8,000 Euros (nearly £6,000) travelling to Russia, China, Australia and Kenya to capture total eclipses since her first in 2008. Agnese told MailOnline: 'The feeling of the eclipse when it happens, you can't describe it, it's like magic. 'One minute the sun is shining then it starts getting darker but it doesn't get dark like it does in the evening or at dusk - it goes dark very, very fast. 'Within half a minute it's completely black and it is something that is very strange to experience. 'It doesn't feel natural and completely understand the ancient civilizations who thought it was some sort of omen. I find it thrilling. 'When you see it you're so happy that it was shown to you because there are so many things which can disturb it, like clouds.' Though some of her friends and family may think she's mad, all the hassle and the expense is worth it for Agnese when the eclipse itself happens. She said: 'That moment alone alone you feel like, ""yes, we did it"". All the natural power comes together when you see it and even though it's short, I am never disappointed. 'My family and some of my friends think I'm a bit crazy but every person goes crazy in their own way. The moon begins to block out the sun as it approaches the point of total eclipse in Cairns in 2012 . This band of chasers enjoy a bit of downtime in Sydney, Australia, before heading to Cairns on their 2012 trip . Agnese has said of a total eclipse: 'The feeling when it happens, you can't describe it, it's like magic' Dr Russo took this photo of the majestic Faroe Islands - one of only two land masses in the world where tomorrow's total eclipse can be seen . 'For some people it's posh cars and for other people it's something else but for me it's eclipses. 'People pick their vacation spots for different reasons. I know a lady who goes to places where she can run marathons but I pick where to go on holiday by solar eclipses.' Another one of the 1,500 to 2,000 visitors who have descended on Svalbard for tomorrow's eclipse, set to begin at around 11.11am local time (1011 GMT), is Canadian Jay Anderson. The 67-year-old retired meteorologist will be present for his 28th eclipse, of which around 17 have been total, since he saw his first one in his native Winnipeg in 1979. On the hunt for eclipses for the past 36 years, he has witnessed the phenomena in Madagascar, Libya, Botswana, Mexico, Bolivia, India, Russia and China, helping to track weather patterns surrounding them for bodies including NASA. Agnese and her eclipse chasing party outside Kenyatta International Conference Centre during their 2013 trip . He told MailOnline: 'In terms of reward for my travels I have seen so many go down but what else are you going to do in life? 'You only go around once so you might as well have fun while you're doing it. 'I'm sitting here [in Svalbard] and it's -18C but it's a beautiful environment. It's cold and snowy but it's a lovely place to be.' Dr Russo says that seeing a total eclipse 'seems to ignite a fire that becomes a powerful driving force' Dr Kate Russo is an Australian eclipse chaser living in Belfast who has authored the book Total Addiction: The Life of an Eclipse Chaser. She is in the Faroe Islands for tomorrow's event, a Danish autonomous territory that is home to 50,000 people and is expecting a surge of more than 8,000 eclipse tourists, according to tourism officials. She has been to eight total eclipses, two annular - when the sun and moon are exactly in line, but the apparent size of the moon is smaller than that of the sun - and several partial. Dr Russo writes on her website:  'I will be chasing eclipses for the rest of my life. 'An eclipse chaser is someone who has made a life choice to give in to their insatiable desire to re-experience the thrill and excitement of totality. 'Once you have seen a total eclipse, it seems to ignite a fire that becomes a powerful driving force. Eclipse chasing is not just a hobby – eclipse chasing is a way of life. 'For me, it is like I do not have a choice about being an eclipse chaser. It has simply become something that I just do – I just am.

The 18-year-old victim was hit over the head 20 times and dragged into a garden to be brutally raped and left for dead in the Beeston area of Leeds last Friday. West Yorkshire Police have released CCTV footage of the man they believe is responsible for the attack with two others claiming he followed them in the hours before the attack. He is wanted for attempted murder and rape having left the woman for dead after the 'appalling' assault. Scroll down for videos . This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack . Police have also released CCTV footage of a man they believed to be her attacker. He is seen walking in the Burley area of Leeds in a green Puma sweatshirt, dark jacket and jeans in the hours before the incident . Wearing a distinctive green Puma hooded jumper and jeans, the man was filmed near a Tesco Express three miles from where the Beeston bus stop where he attacked his victim between 9 and 10pm. He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen of West Yorkshire Police urged members of the public to come forward if they recognised any details from the newly released footage. 'These are the most detailed images yet of the man involved in this terrible crime and they paint a very clear picture of him,' he said. 'We are urgently appealing for anyone who thinks they know who he is to contact us immediately. 'We are asking people to think very carefully about all these elements and put them together with the e-fit image we have released and the other CCTV footage showing his size, build and movements, particularly his distinctive walk that shows he possibly has a limp. West Yorkshire Police produced this computer generated image after taking a description of the suspect from his victim. He is described as of Pakistani or Middle Eastern background and in his early twenties . In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her . Police released the chilling footage in a bid to track down the suspect who is wanted for attempted murder . The woman was waiting at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds last Friday when she was targeted . 'I cannot stress enough how important it is that we trace and arrest this man at the very earliest opportunity.' His 18-year-old victim was left with serious head injuries and a broken hip after last week's attack. Earlier police released a video of the 'harrowing' moment she was dragged from the street into a garden to be raped. Alongside CCTV footage of the man, police have released photographs of the rock he used to beat her over the head. Investigators believe he may have brought the weapon with him in a premeditated assault. Speaking of the object, Det Supt Wallen said: 'It is quite distinctive as an object and we would ask people to let us know if they recognise it as something that has come from their garden or elsewhere, particularly if they live somewhere on his route towards the crime scene along Cemetery Road from the direction of Holbeck. 'The stone has been subject to extensive forensic examination and we are working with a specialist geologist to establish where it may have come from.'

"London’s British Museum remains the most popular tourist destination in the UK, welcoming nearly seven million visitors last year as the country’s tourism boom continued.

Alva members saw a 6.5 per cent increase in visits in 2014 compared with 2013, thanks in part to Great War centenary commemorations, including the celebrated poppy display at the Tower of London, and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. An estimated five million people viewed the display of 888,246 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London . The British Museum held on to its status as the UK's most popular attraction with nearly 6.7 million visits . Scottish attractions reported an increase of nearly 10 per cent, while the number of visitors to London sites increased by seven per cent. Attractions in Northern Ireland reported a five per cent increase, while sites in Wales had an overall rise of just under six per cent. One of the most popular attractions in London proved to be the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation at the Tower of London. Its moat was filled with 888,246 ceramic poppies – representing the number of British and Commonwealth casualties in World War I – drawing an estimated five million people who viewed the display from outside the walls. They contributed to a six per cent rise, to a little over three million, in annual visitors inside the Tower of London compared with 2013. The Library of Birmingham was the 10th most popular attraction in Britain, with 2.4 million visits in 2014 . Visits to the Imperial War Museum in Lambeth, London, which hosted new World War I galleries, soared 153 per cent to 914,774. Outside the capital, there was a 50.9 per cent increase, to 340,929, in visits to the National Trust’s Dunham Massey in Cheshire, which recreated its Great War role as a military hospital. In Scotland, the Commonwealth Games contributed to a four per cent increase, to more than 1.48 million, in visits to Edinburgh Castle, making it the most popular admission-paying attraction outside London. Glasgow's Riverside Museum had a 41.8 per cent rise in visitors, while the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh welcomed 39 per cent more compared with 2013. The British Museum held on to its status as the UK's most popular attraction with nearly 6.7 million visits, followed by the National Gallery in London, which was visited by nearly 6.42 million people, an increase of 6.4 per cent. Figures for London's Southbank Centre have been included for the first time in the Alva table, with the complex welcoming more than 6.25 million visitors, securing it third place in the overall list. The Library of Birmingham ranked 10th, with 2.4 million visitors. Edinburgh Castle, the most popular paid attraction outside London, benefited from the Commonwealth Games . The National Trust’s Dunham Massey in Cheshire recreated its Great War role as a military hospital . Museums and galleries enjoyed a 6.09 per cent increase last year, while the new visitor centre at Stonehenge helped the Wiltshire monument to an 8.4 per cent rise to more than 1.34 million visits. Alva director Bernard Donoghue said: ‘I am delighted that our members' figures are going from strength to strength. ‘Looking forward to our 2015 figures, we are confident that they will rise again with the anticipated increase in overseas visitors this year.’","British Museum ranked first by Association of Leading Visitor Attractions .

Slevin quotes her as saying: 'I was going through my cursing stage.' 'I didn't realize until my camp counselor at the end came up and said: ""You know, you would have been best camper in your age group, but you curse so much"".' 'And I thought I was being cool.' Mrs. Obama used to attend the camp regularly with her brother, Craig. She would have been ten years old at the camp held in 1974, while Craig would have been 11. Revelation: The anecdote about the young Michelle Obama (pictured right aged seven), emerged in the upcoming biography Michelle Obama: A Life by Peter Slevin, due out April 7 .

"The Associated Press filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the State Department to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from Hillary Rodham Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. The legal action comes after repeated requests filed under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act have gone unfulfilled. They include one request AP made five years ago and others pending since the summer of 2013. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, comes a day after Clinton broke her silence about her use of a private email account while secretary of state. The FOIA requests and lawsuit seek materials related to her public and private calendars, correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president, and Clinton-related emails about the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices. Scroll down for video . Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks to the reporters at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday about her private email system. The Associated Press filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the State Department to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from Clinton's tenure . 'After careful deliberation and exhausting our other options, The Associated Press is taking the necessary legal steps to gain access to these important documents, which will shed light on actions by the State Department and former Secretary Clinton, a presumptive 2016 presidential candidate, during some of the most significant issues of our time,' said Karen Kaiser, AP's general counsel. 'The press is a proxy for the people, and AP will continue its pursuit of vital information that's in the public interest through this action and future open records requests,' she said. State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach declined to comment. He had previously cited the department's heavy annual load of FOIA requests — 19,000 last year — in saying that the department 'does its best to meet its FOIA responsibilities.' He said the department takes requests 'first in, first out,' but noted that timing depends on 'the complexity of the request.' Michael Oreskes, a senior managing editor at AP, said the news agency was planning to file additional requests under FOIA following the disclosure last week that Clinton used a private email account run on a server on her property outside New York while working at the State Department. Clinton on Tuesday said she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state. She said roughly half were work-related, which she turned over to the State Department, while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature. The department says it will take several months to review the material Clinton turned over last year. Once the review is complete, the department said, the emails will be posted online. The AP had sought Clinton-related correspondence before her use of a personal email account was publicly known, although Wednesday's court filing alleges that the State Department is responsible for including emails from that account in any public records request. 'State's failure to ensure that Secretary Clinton's governmental emails were retained and preserved by the agency, and its failure timely to seek out and search those emails in response to AP's requests, indicate at the very least that State has not engaged in the diligent, good-faith search that FOIA requires,' says AP's legal filing. AP is seekin materials related to her public and private calendars, correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president, and Clinton-related emails about the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices . Clinton is pictured here later on Tuesday at the Step It Up For Gender Equality 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference On Women. Clinton said earlier in the day that she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years at State, roughly half were work-related, which she turned over to the State Department, while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature . Specifically, AP is seeking copies of Clinton's full schedules and calendars from her four years as secretary of state; documents related to her department's decision to grant a special position to longtime aide Huma Abedin; related correspondence from longtime advisers Philippe Reines and Cheryl Mills, who, like Abedin, are likely to play central roles in a Clinton presidential campaign; documents related to Clinton's and the agency's roles in the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices; and documents related to her role overseeing a major Defense Department contractor. The AP made most of its requests in the summer of 2013, although one was filed in March 2010. AP is also seeking attorney's fees related to the lawsuit. Other organizations have also sued the State Department recently after lengthy delays responding to public record requests. In December, the conservative political advocacy group Citizens United sued the State Department for failing to disclose flight records showing who accompanied Clinton on overseas trips. Last week, the National Security Archive, an organization that gathers declassified government records, filed a lawsuit after waiting more than seven years for the State Department to release of details of former secretary of state Henry Kissinger's telephone conversations. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, predicted the State Department would speed up its review facing legal action, particularly given that Clinton has said that her email correspondence doesn't include classified material. 'When the government is under a court deadline, or really wants to review, they can whip through thousands of pages in a matter of weeks, which they should do here,' Blanton said. The State Department generally takes about 450 days to turn over records it considers to be part of complex requests under the Freedom of Information Act. That is seven times longer than the Justice Department and CIA, and 30 times longer than the Treasury Department. An inspector general's report in 2012 criticized the State Department's practices as 'inefficient and ineffective,' citing a heavy workload, small staff and interagency problems.","Lawsuit comes a day after Clinton broke her silence about her use of a private email account while secretary of state .

"A Missouri man who weighs 570 pounds has vowed to run a 5K every month for the next nine months in an inspirational bid to change his life around before it's too late. Derek Mitchell, 34, of Kansas City learned five years ago he had a pituitary tumor contributing to his 625 weight at the time. However, removing the tumor wasn't enough to help Derek battle the bulge, so now he's fighting to turn his life around by kicking his soda addiction and adopting a vegan diet in order to get his life back and ensure he's got a healthy, hopeful future to look forward to. Took a good look: Derek Mitchell of Kansas City decided to turn his life around reaching 625 pounds . 'I just knew I had to do something if I had hope for a future or anything like that,' Mitchell told Fox4KC.com. After giving up soda as a New Year's resolution, he decided to take things a step further by putting one foot in front of the other as part of his nightly neighborhood walks. 'I started just walking around in my neighborhood, and I started at a mile and then worked my way up to a little over two miles a day,' Mitchell said this month after a month or so of his walks. Mitchell uses an app to post maps of his walks to Facebook and he's had a mob of supporters urging him on after every walk. Fight of his life: Derek learned 5 years ago that he had a pituitary tumor that was contributing to his obesity. Even with it removed, he knew he had to fight to get the weight off . Mitchell says he's planning to run another 5K next month and one every month thereafter for the rest of the year . He's since lost some 75 pounds. Mitchell did his first 5K on March 14. 'If I can walk a 5K, anyone can, and I'm living proof of that now,' he said. The 3.1 miles took home around an hour and a half, he said. It was his marathon enthusiast sister who suggested the 5K, reports BuzzFeed. 'I wanted to cross the finish line with my hands up, because that's how it felt! It was pretty awesome,' Mitchell told Fox4KC. So excited, in fact, that Mitchell says he's planning to run another 5K next month and one every month thereafter for the rest of the year. Big change: The 34-year-old has now made the switch from competing to eat giant pancakes (left) to competing against himself to stay vegan for a month . Still going: Seen here in 2013, Derek has since dropped his soda habit along with 75 pounds and he doesn't plan to stop losing it any time soon .","Derek Mitchell of Kansas City decided his life needed to change 5 years ago after he was told a tumor had contributed to his 625-pound frame .

Now eighty years later, more than 1 billion people in 114 countries have played the game designed by Charles Darrow. In 1933, Charles Darrow made a prototype of the new game using materials from around his home. He used a piece of oilcloth that had been a table covering for the game’s board, cut the houses and hotels out of scraps of wooden moulding and typed the deeds and cards. Now eighty years later, more than 1 billion people in 114 countries have played the game designed by Charles Darrow (pictured) Participants had until midnight on Wednesday 4 March to rally behind their favourite cities. During a special Wild Card Week  fans were able to request other locations, big or small to be placed in the infamous Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road slots .

To celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2005, Hasbro invited fans of the game to help update the board in their respective countries to reflect what the game board would look like if it were created today instead of in 1935.

Out of the 80 global destinations up for grabs in the World Edition, London and Sydney both made the cut . Since it was released, the world famous tycoon game has been played in 114 countries around the world . Subtitled 'The Fast-Dealing Property Trading Game', it is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity. It is produced by the US game and toy company Hasbro. Players move around the gameboard buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. The most expensive version of the game was produced by celebrated San Francisco jeweller Sidney Mobell. Valued at $2 million, the set features a 23-carat gold board and diamond-studded dice. More than six billion little green houses and 2.25 billion red hotels have been 'constructed' since 1935.

"They say money can corrupt even the most honest of people. Now one social psychologist has revealed a series of experiments that shows this adage to be true. Instead of transforming people into a charitable benefactors, Professor Paul Piff believes money causes people to break the rules at the expense of others. Professor Paul Piff from the University of California, Berkeley, has revealed several experiments in which the rich struggled with empathy and generosity towards others, compared with their poorer companions . 'It makes you more attuned to your own interests, your own desires, your own welfare,' the University of California, Berkeley, researcher told Lucy Hooker at the BBC. 'It isolates you in certain ways from other people psychologically and materially. You prioritise your own needs and your own goals and become less attuned to those around you. In one experiment, Professor Piff spent an afternoon going back and forth over a pedestrian crossing in Los Angeles. He found that none of the least expensive cars broke the law, while almost 50 per cent of the most expensive car drivers sped across the pedestrian crossing. In another recent study, Professor Piff brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab, and flipped a coin to assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged Monopoly game. The rich players collected twice the salary when they passed Go, and they were able to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board more. Money isolates people psychologically and materially, according to recent research. As a result they prioritise their own needs and goals and become less attuned to those around them . Hidden cameras revealed, over the course of 15 minutes, the rich player showing signs of dominance, smacking the board with their piece and talking loudly. The rich players also became ruder toward the other person, less sensitive to the plight of the poor players, and more demonstrative of their material success. The feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine. It increases the levels of testosterone and its by-product 3-androstanediol in both men and women. This in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine, the brain's reward system called the nucleus accumbens, which can be very addictive. Like cocaine, scientists now believe power can lead to too much dopamine causing more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience. 'When the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game,' Professor Piff said in a recent Ted talk. 'They became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation, including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. 'And that's a really, really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage.' Other scientists have conducted similar studies to back up the findings. Last year, after undergoing psychological testing to measure individual differences, including honesty, a group of volunteers in Switzerland played the 'dictator game'. In the game, they were given complete control over deciding pay outs to themselves and their followers. The leaders had the choice of making pro or anti-social decisions - the latter resulting in awarding less money to the group but more to the leader's own earnings. The findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour. But, over time, even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power, according to the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Professor Piff, however, says not all hope is lost for the wealthy. 'We've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. 'For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.' In one study, volunteers watched a brief video, 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them. 'After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor,' said Professor Piff.","This is according to Paul Piff from University of California, Berkeley .

In a rigged game of monopoly, richer players were rude and dominant .
Another study found people in better cars were more likely to break law ."
"Thanks to beautiful celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, who've perfected the use of Instagram and Twitter to share new images of their enviable faces and bodies, we're always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots. But for many of us, it isn't a case of 'I woke up like this', as a recent study revealed that women spend a total of 753 hours taking, deleting, retaking and touching up their selfies to look picture perfect - and it seems we may not be alone. Certain celebrities and their all-too-perfect social media snaps have come under fire, with fans accusing them of giving themselves a digital do-over. And now, one reality TV star has called for fellow stars to go filter-free on social media - and she's retouched her own snaps to show how pictures can be enhanced with the help of an app. Scroll down for video . Can you tell which image has been retouched? Ex On The Beach and Big Brother star Chloe Goodman has retouched her bikini shot, right, and pitted it against a natural one, left, to show how celebrities are digitally enhancing their social media snaps . Chloe Goodman, 22, who found fame on Ex On The Beach and Celebrity Big Brother, told FEMAIL: 'I am sick of people commenting on my images saying I have digitally enhanced them. I am guilty of putting a filter on, which changes the lighting of the image, but I have never changed my body shape or retouched out any imperfections.' Chloe downloaded Facetune,  an app that lets you retouch your skin, body shape, whiten your eyes and teeth, and had a play around on a few images of herself to see exactly what others are up to. 'I actually think I look weird in the after shots,' she said. 'I think I look better before but that could be because I haven't got the hang of the app yet. 'It is so sad that we are in a digital age where this is even possible as it makes us all insecure when we see these perfect women on Twitter and Instragram.' Chloe, pictured, left, naturally, and, right, after enhancing her snap, downloaded Facetune, an app where you can retouch your skin, body shape, whiten your eyes and teeth . Chloe says that Beyonce is a prime example of this. In November last year, Twitter fans slammed Beyonce for what they believed to be a round of Photoshopped images. The 33-year-old posted some racy selfies to her Tumblr while wearing a leotard printed with the words '99 problems but my a** ain't one'. Fans, however, called foul. According to Buzzfeed there was something fishy about how the curtains behind Beyonce's hips curve inward. Chloe, who thinks she looks worse in the after shot, right, said it is 'so sad' that we are in a digital age that makes us all insecure when we see seemingly perfect women on Twitter and Instragram . Chloe, pictured, left, before, and, right, after using the app, shows how skin can be smoothed using it . A month earlier, in September, the Halo singer was accused of Photoshopping a thigh gap into snaps of her on a yacht for her birthday celebrations. And in yet another instance she was accused of altering a photo of her playing golf in a bikini in April last year. Chloe said: 'Beyonce changes her body curves a lot in images. It's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world, who claims to be a feminist, bowing down to the pressures of trying to look perfect in every single picture.' Chloe says that Beyonce changes her body curves a lot in images and says it's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world doing it . She continued: 'There is too much pressure on young girls growing up in today's society with a fake impression of how they should look as they grow into a women. 'The celebrities of our age who are on Instagram and Twitter are editing their images into better versions of themselves. This makes other women feel inferior and unattractive. This can lead to all sorts of problems for others including eating disorders, drastic plastic surgery and non-surgical enhancements.' Now, Chloe is pledging to hashtag all of her  images with #filterfreebyCG - and she's asking others with a big social media following, as well as celebrities, to do the same. 'That way,' she adds. 'We aren’t fooling our followers. On top of that it would be great to see all women embracing their looks and hash tagging their images with the same.'

"A new online calculator aims to predict the age at which a person is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke. The tool compares a person's actual age with their heart age, after considering simple lifestyle information, including height and weight. While those behind the new test argue it is designed to arm people with the knowledge they need to make changes to improve their lifestyles, critics have questioned how effective it will be. GPs will be encouraged to tell patients about the test, to help empower them to live healthier lives. But one expert warned the test may scare people into taking medication, including statins, to lower their cholesterol. CLICK HERE TO TAKE THE TEST . The NHS Heart Age Calculator test predicts a person's heart age as well as the age at which they are likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke . As well as predicting how long a person can expect to live before suffering a heart attack or stroke, the calculator offers a free NHS health check, giving advice on how to enjoy a healthier lifestyle . The test asks people to enter basic details, including their age, height and weight and postcode. Blood pressure, cholesterol level and whether a person has ever received treatment for their blood pressure is also requested. Then the test asks a series of questions to build a picture of a person's medical history. Whether a person smokes, if they are diabetic, suffering rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney failure or atrial fibrillation - an irregular heartbeat - is considered. Finally, it asks if a person has a family history of cardiovascular disease in relatives under the age of 60. Using the information, the calculator generates a heart age, as well as predicting how long a person can expect to live before they are likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke. In addition, it estimates the risk of a person suffering a heart attack or stroke in the next decade. As well as the results, the test provides advice about blood pressure, cholesterol and weight, calculating a person's body mass index to judge if they are a normal weight, overweight or obese. It means a woman aged 40, who is of a healthy weight, smokes less than 10 cigarettes a day, has diabetes and has a family history of cardiovascular disease could be warned her heart age is actually that of a 53-year-old. She could be warned she is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke by the age of 71, and given a three per cent chance of it happening in the next decade. The test asks people their age, weight and height as well as basic information about their blood pressure, cholesterol and medical history . Another woman of the same age, weight and height, but who does not smoke or suffer diabetes and has no family history of heart disease could be told she is likely to live until the age of 81 without suffering the same fate. In addition, her percentage risk of a heart attack or stroke would be just 0.9 per cent over the next decade. A 55-year-old diabetic man who smokes more than 20 cigarettes a day, and has a family history of heart disease, could be told he risks a heart attack or stroke at the age of 67, and has a 30 per cent chance of it happening within 10 years. In contrast, a man of the same age but who does not smoke or have other health problems, could expect to live to 80 years old without any risk of heart problems. The test is most accurate if a person can provide their cholesterol and blood pressure readings. However, if not, the test uses the national averages to determine risk. It is available on the NHS Choices and British Heart Foundation websites, as part of a collaboration between Public Health England and the charity. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: 'Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and there is clear evidence that factors like smoking and high blood pressure play a major role in this. 'The heart age tool shows that it is never too late to make healthy lifestyle changes, giving people a chance to see the direct impact these changes can have on their heart's health.' Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Knowing your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease is crucial to taking control of your health. It means a woman aged 40, who is of a healthy weight, smokes less than 10 cigarettes a day, has diabetes and has a family history of cardiovascular disease could be warned her heart age is actually that of a 53-year-old, and that she could expect to suffer a heart attack or stroke at the age of 71 . Another woman of the same age, weight and height, but who does not smoke or suffer diabetes and has no family history could be told she is likely to live until the age of 81 without suffering the same fate . 'Armed with this knowledge you can start to make lifestyle changes to help protect yourself against heart attacks and strokes.' But other experts have urged caution, warning it could push more people to take statins and other medication, putting people at risk of side-effects. Cardiovascular disease kills more people across the world than any other illness. The World Health Organisation estimate 17.5 million people were killed by cardiovascular disease - of the heart and circulatory system - in 2012. That is three deaths in every 10. Of those, 7.4 million died of coronary heart disease, and another 6.7 million died from stroke. In the UK cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for more than a quarter of all deaths, or around 73,000 deaths each year - an average of 200 people each day or one every seven minutes. The British Heart Foundation estimates around seven million people are living with CVD in the UK. The total cost of premature death, lost productivity, hospital treatment and prescriptions is estimated at £19 billion every year. Source: British Heart Foundation . Dr Assem Malhotra, honorary consultant cardiologist, at Frimley Park Hospital, told the Telegraph he is concerned the test does not account for basic lifestyle factors, including exercise levels. He said: 'It is important to help identify those at risk of heart disease, but I really hope this has been properly evaluated; we don't want to make the same mistakes we have seen in the US, where calculators enormously exaggerated the risks. 'It is a pretty crude evaluation to only use weight as a proxy for lifestyle.' As well as estimating heart age and a person's risk of heart attack and stroke, the free NHS Health Check that accompanies it, gives people an opportunity to take action to improve their lifestyle. It offers advice about how to develop serious but preventable conditions including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and some types of dementia. In 2013, more than 18,000 people died prematurely from coronary heart disease. Dawn Bail from Bury, had her NHS Health Check in 2013 and was shocked by the results. She said; 'I knew I wasn't the healthiest person but being told I was obese and at risk of serious health problems was a real wake-up call. 'Since then I have completely changed both mine and my husband's lifestyles, going to the gym regularly and having homemade meals. 'In fact I was actually looking forward to my last check which showed my BMI to be normal and a fantastic low risk of cardiovascular disease.'","NHS Heart Age Calculator predicts when you'll suffer heart attack or stroke .

"A double murderer and two other convicted killers have been granted clemency by Indonesian President Joko Widodo, while two of the Bali Nine ringleaders remain on death row and could be executed within weeks. Soon after Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were denied clemency, Dwi Trisna Firmansyah had his death sentence reduced to life. The 28-year-old was one of three killers involved in the robbery and planned murder of a shop owner and his son in April 2012, The Jakarta Post reported. This week, a senior source from the Indonesian presidential palace told ABC an additional two murderers had had their death sentences overturned by Mr Joko. Scroll down for video . Dwi Trisna Firmansyah has had his death sentence for murder reduced after Indonesian President Joko Widodo showed mercy . A 'sadistic' murderer and two other men have been granted clemency in Indonesia, while Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myuran Sukumaran (left) remain on death row . The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said the granting of clemency was the prerogative of the president, and that drugs had a wider impact than people may realise. 'Indonesia as nation is not taking pleasure in punishing anyone with the death penalty,' he said. On April 16, 2012, Firmansyah and two other men broke into a man's shop and hit him over the head with a wooden bat while he was taking part in his morning prayer. When the man's son tried to come to his father's aid he was also killed, News Corp reported. They stole a car, two motorcycles, 12 mobile phones, phone vouchers and cash. The three men were sentenced to death in September 2012, but on Friday Firmansyah's lawyer Asep Ruhiat was notified of Mr Joko's decision to grant him clemency. Their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this year failed, but Firmansyah was then shown mercy amid the Indonesian President's tirade against convicted drug smugglers. President Widodo (left) has adopted a hardline approach to drug smugglers but has spared murderer Firmansyah mercy, reducing his death sentence to life behind bars . This comes after it was revealed Chan and Sukumaran could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. It has been revealed by the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo that the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously' Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . This means Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad. Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death. 'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row. Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy. Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island' President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop has offered to cover the costs of life imprisonment for the condemned men, if their lives are spared . Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response. The families of the convicted drug offenders have been allowed to visit twice since their transfer to Nusakambangan island last Wednesday, with their next visit scheduled for Monday. This news comes as a prisoner art exhibition and auction featuring Mr Sukumaran's work was dramatically cancelled after Kerobokan prison authorities said they didn't want to associate with the prisoners pending execution. The Kerobokan Jail governor Sudjonggo ordered all 92 prisoner paintings to be removed before the exhibition commenced. He claims that authorities we unaware the event was advertised as a tribute to Mr Sukumaran, a former art teacher at the prison. A chilling self portrait of Mr Sukumaran that would have been displayed alongside other prisoner art at the Kuta exhibition . The exhibition featuring Mr Sukumaran's most recent work was cancelled as prison officials say they didn't want to get caught up in the politicised executions . 'It is cancelled because we do not want to be involved in any matters relating to Myuran. I have conveyed to the organisers about that and they promised that none of Myuran's paintings will be at the exhibition,' Sydjonggo said. 'It doesn't mean that we are forgetting Myuran. No. But we just don't want to be involved in the discourse about the execution which is now already politicised,' he added. The money raised by auctioning off the prisoners artwork was to be used to continue funding the art program at the Kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by Mr Sukumaran. Mr Sukumaran has been unable to paint since his transfer to 'Death Island' however prison authorities say Mr Sukumaran will eventually be allowed to have his art materials. Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison .","Three convicted killers have been granted clemency by Indonesia .

"Triple police killer Harry Roberts has been enjoying his new life of freedom with a new identity and a state-funded bungalow. The 78-year-old, who was jailed for life for shooting dead three unarmed officers in 1966, was released on licence from Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, in November last year. After serving 48 years behind bars, the murderer has reportedly taken his new found freedom in his stride - getting the bus to the supermarket, walking in the park and visiting the gym daily. Harry Roberts (pictured left in 2009 and right in police mugshot in 1966) has changed his name and is living in a state-funded bungalow following his release from prison in November last year . The pensioner has to check in with authorities twice a day but is otherwise free to come and go as he pleases, The Sun reports. He has been seen out and about wearing a pair of sunglasses and using his pension to buy bacon and tinned peaches. A local who recognised him told the paper: 'Nobody has a clue who he is - but he looks like the cat who got the cream. 'He is wandering around completely unchecked, joking with locals who would be horrified if they knew his real identity.' They also claim that his three neighbours at the bungalow - where he has his own living area - have no idea who he is. Harry Fletcher, a former senior official in the probation officers’ union NAPO, said it costs taxpayers about £25,000 a year to keep Roberts at the hostel, which is staffed 24 hours a day. Roberts, 78, pictured on a previous day release from Sudbury prison in Derby . He is also entitled to draw the basic state pension – £113 per week – taking the overall bill to the taxpayer to around £31,000. Mr Fletcher said: 'Because of his notoriety, risk and age, they have put him in an ""approved premise"" - pretty much a bail hostel. 'He wasn't deemed a risk to the public or to himself but the risk is that people in the community would recognise him, although that risk was deemed low as he hasn't really been photographed recently. 'However given these recent revelations the chances are he will now have to be moved to another accommodation.' He explained that the typical stay in one of these hostels is between three and six months and after that the authorities would ensure he gets another form of sheltered accommodation. 'During the day he will be unrestricted. He will be subject to some form of curfew - probably about 9pm and then he will stay in the hostel until around 7ish the next morning. 'He will report to the probation service weekly and there will be staff in the hostel he will see daily. If he is deemed to be coping okay this will be reduced to fortnightly and then monthly. He is on a life licence so he will need to do that for the rest of his life.' He added: 'Someone that has been in prison that long will be institutionalised and so they would have considered keeping him in an open prison but as he didn't pose a risk to the public he was put in a bail hostel.' Roberts was jailed for life for the murders of Det Sgt Christopher Head, 30, Det Con David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, in West London in 1966. Despite the heinous nature of his crime, for which he has never expressed any remorse, Roberts was allowed out on temporary release back in 2001. Roberts had lost his bid to be granted parole in 2009 after he threatened and intimidated Joan Cartwright, her husband Peter and her son James, who had given Roberts work at their animal sanctuary while he was on day release. Unarmed victims (from left): PC Geoffrey Fox, DC David Wombwell and DS Christopher Head were all shot dead . Investigation: Police officers search the murderers' car following the killings on August 12, 1966 . He had threatened to kill the couple after she complained about his behaviour, and he rang her from prison up to five times a week after learning she had given evidence against him. Several attacks were also carried out on her animals at the East Midlands sanctuary. Before their relationship broke down in July 2001, around his 65th birthday, staff at the sanctuary arranged a secret birthday party and even arranged for a birthday cake and champagne. Roberts, Duddy and Witney were sitting in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison on August 12, 1966, planning an armed robbery with a Luger pistol. They were approached by the three plain clothes unarmed police officers who had suspected there had been a jail escape. Roberts shot at the policemen in Braybrook Street while children were playing nearby. He killed Det Con Wombell and chased and shot Sergeant Head. One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox. Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison. His two accomplices are now both dead. Duddy died in Parkhurst prison in 1981 and Witney was released in 1991 but was beaten to death with a hammer by his flatmate in Bristol in 1999. He also received presents of aftershave and socks reportedly made a toast saying 'Here's to freedom... I cannot believe the Home Secretary let me out'. Around that time he was also treated to a night out 10-pin bowling at the Hollywood Bowl centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Mrs Cartwright, 71, is said to be 'sickened' by the revelations. Roberts was found guilty of three murders after a trial for what the judge described as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more'. He had been sitting with his accomplices John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London. The trio had been preparing for an armed robbery when they were approached by the officers and Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on the three unarmed officers. Roberts shot dead two of the policemen, DS Head and DC Wombwell, and DC Fox was killed by Duddy. His accomplices were caught but Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days relying on his training as a soldier to survive. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. He was later found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. On November 15, 1966, Roberts was given three life sentences with a 30 year minimum tariff. He went on to become on of Britain's longest serving prisoners.","Harry Roberts was released from prison on licence in November last year .

"Spencer Robinson, 36 was arrested after he allegedly damaged more than 30 headstones because 'he wanted to help the dead resurrect' A Utah man was arrested after allegedly damaging more than 30 headstones because he wanted to help the dead come back to life on Easter. Spencer Robinson, 36, told officers he  believed the tombstones would interfere with the deceased's chance to resurrect, according to police. When police arrived at the Payson City Cemetery on Monday they found that dozens of tombstones had been moved or smashed into pieces. Some had  been thrown over a fence. Payson Police Lt. Bill Wright estimated the damage to be around $50,000. He said some of the tombstones were more than 100 years old and were probably irreparable, according to the Associated Press. Officers were notified that Robinson had been removed from the cemetery only days earlier when workers spotted him moving headstones. Police went to Robinson's house after they found his cell phone at the graveyard. A family member told them Robinson said he was going back to the cemetery to 'finish the job', according to Fox 13 Now. Robinson had told the relative he believed many of his friends would be freed for the Easter resurrection, according to police. Police then tried to arrest Robinson in his backyard, but he ran into the house and locked them out. Officers forced their way into the home and handcuffed Robinson after wrestling him to the ground. According to officials, Robinson has a possible mental health condition. Wright said Robinson told police the tombstones were 'unfair and inconvenient', and that he was 'trying to help the deceased'.

"Tierney Hinde, pictured with son Presley, suffered a nightmare Pontins holiday . A young mother has told how her first holiday away with her son was ruined after she discovered blood splattered on her chalet windows and mould throughout. Tierney Hinde, 28, from Dartford, Kent, was disgusted with the state of her Pontins apartment, with the nightmare starting when she discovered the dirty bed linen. Things got worse when she was offered a different room on a higher floor with blood-spattered windows at the resort in Camber, East Sussex. 'It was supposed to be the first trip with my son but it was a farce that's all I can say,' said Ms Hinde. 'I nearly cried. I don't really get like that but it was just a complete waste of time.' She chose Pontins over other resorts because the locks on the doors would provide security for autistic son Presley, four, who has a tendency to wander off. The windows were cleaned off but Tierney was still unhappy because being higher up meant more danger for Presley. As she predicted the youngster, who has poor co-ordination, fell down the landing steps, although no fault has been attributed to Pontins for this. Tierney was also disappointed by the lack of activities available for Presley. She said: 'Pontins should be getting involved with all of the kids and it wasn't like that at all. 'All he wanted to do was go towards the arcades because there was nothing else for him. 'I went there when I was 15 and nothing had changed since then and they were supposed to have had a rebirth in 2011.' Tierney Hinde became upset after discovering the bed linen was filthy in her Pontins chalet . The mould in the bathroom added to the young mum's worry, and she requested to move rooms . Tierney was so upset that she gave up on her week-long trip, which cost £500, after three days. She has since been offered 50 per cent off vouchers and VIP treatment on her next stay, but refuses to step foot in the resort again. MailOnline Travel has contacted Pontins, and is awaiting comment.

In an instant the Sydney photo journalist's childhood was gone and his whole life changed forever.

'From the moment that mum died it was just get on with it get on with life,' Trent told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would sit there and think about from that point on: Why are we here? Where are we going? What is life? and ever since then I've been continually searching and looking for the answers to life and the camera always helped me do that.'

He and his wife, photographer Narelle Autio, picked up their two boys and set off on the journey of a lifetime, taking seven years to embark on a path of discovering, which cumulated in The Black Rose exhibition. The items in the exhibition, his largest ever, have been hand-picked from more than 7,000 reels of film, 15,000 words scribbled in diaries, and 14 published books. Fever, Dash,Adelaide, 2014 . Parke used his camera like therapy on his trip and he admits it got him through the tough experience of losing a parent. The Black Rose symbolises his long journey, his mother's funeral and the fact that she is not alive any more. While on his way around Australia, Parke came across a black rose and took a cutting of it, planting it in his garden so he and his father and brothers can use it as place where they can remember their mum.

"At least 40 passengers have suffered injuries after an Amtrak train crashed into a tractor-trailer that had become stuck on railroad tracks in North Carolina and toppled onto its side. Startling images from the scene show the truck, which was carrying a mobile home beneath a blue tarp, smashed to pieces across the tracks in Halifax and two derailed train cars lying nearby. Halifax County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Bruce Temple said the accident happened around noon and that the train's first two cars were derailed in the incident, although the second car that derailed was holding baggage. The North Carolina Department of Transportation reported that 25 passengers were taken to Halifax Memorial Hospital by bus and 15 passengers taken to Halifax hospital by ambulance for treatment. No deaths were reported and that none of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, authorities said. Crash: An Amtrak passenger train toppled over after striking a stalled truck in Halifax County, North Carolina on Monday around noon . Terrifying: According to Halifax County Sheriff Wes Tripp, none of the injuries sustained in the crash appeared to be life-threatening . Wreck: The 55mph train smashed into the tractor trailer, which was carrying a mobile home beneath blue tarp, pictured . Destroyed: The truck belonged to Guy M. Turner Inc., an industrial transport specialist, and the company said it is investigating . A witness driving behind the truck told WRAL that the vehicle had been trying to navigate a left-hand turn across the tracks for around 15 minutes before the crash and was getting help from a state trooper. They saw the train come into view and witnesses recalled seeing one person climb out of the truck. 'There was a massive jerk and we were kind of thrown forward a little bit, and the train came to a sudden stop,' passenger Charlotte Story told WRAL-TV. 'I couldn't tell you if it was trying to slow down or not. There was no whistle. It came completely out of the blue.' Photos taken by RRSPIN show the overturned truck and wrecked mobile home on its side as investigators swarm the scene. Witnesses helped state Highway Patrol troopers pull the conductor from the wreckage, RRSPIN reported. Sheriff's Major Scott Hall said from the crash scene that some passengers were taken to a local hospital by ambulance, but others were able to climb aboard a shuttle bus to be taken for examination. Other passengers were taken to a nearby government center where they would meet with American Red Cross officials and investigators. Of the passengers on the train, around 170 were unhurt, authorities told WRAL. 'There were 212 passengers and eight crew members on board and initial reports are that several passengers have been injured and taken to local medical facilities for treatment,' an Amtrak spokesperson said. 'At this time, none of the injuries have been reported as life threatening.' Accident: The driver had been trying to navigate a turn across the track for 15 minutes with the help of a trooper when it was struck . Overturned: Witnesses said the driver of the truck managed to get out of the vehicle before the train approached . Heading to safety: Family gather their belongings and head to safety as investigators check the train cars on Monday afternoon . The Amtrak train was the Carolinian, which runs between Charlotte, North Carolina, and New York each day. It was headed north to New York City at the time of the crash. Authorities said there are active warning devices at the crossing. The truck belonged to Guy M. Turner Inc., an industrial transport specialist based in Greensboro. The company said they are investigating. The North Carolina Department of Transportation is also investigating. 'We are relieved that there are no fatalities reported at this time, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured,' Transportation Secretary Tony Tata said in a statement. 'Safety is always our top priority, and we continue to urge everyone to use extreme caution and stay alert when crossing our railroad tracks.' Authorities have closed nearby roads as they clear up the scene. Halifax is about 80 miles northeast of Raleigh. Lucky: Authorities said none of the injured passengers on the derailed train had life-threatening injuries but no deaths were reported . Smash: Of the two cars that derailed after the train smashed into the stalled vehicle, one was a luggage car, authorities said . Taken to safety: Around 40 people were transported to nearby hospitals for treatment and 170 more were taken away by buses .","As many as 40 passengers were hurt when a New York-bound Amtrak train smashed into a truck that was struggling to make a turn in Halifax around noon on Monday .

"An asteroid so large it has the potential to cause widespread devastation is on its way towards Earth. But despite   being called a ‘Potentially Hazardous Asteroid’ (PHA) by Nasa, experts are telling people not to be worried. The huge rock, called 2014 YB35, will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it it is 11.7 times further than the distance between Earth and the moon. Scroll down for video . Asteroid 2014 YB35 will pass 2.8 million miles from Earth tomorrow (artist's impression shown). It was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona. The asteroid is estimated to be 1,640ft-wider (500 metres) which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit Earth . And while this event will occur without incident, the experts added it is a reminder of how many dangerous space rocks there are in our planet’s vicinity. The asteroid is estimated to be about 1,640ft (500 metres) wide which, if it hit Earth, would be large enough to cause widespread devastation - although there is no chance of this happening. However, it is estimated that there are about 25,000 near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 460ft (140 metres), bodies that come close to Earth but don't necessarily hit our planet. And there are also an estimated 1,000 NEOs larger than 3,280ft (one kilometre), highlighting the need to keep track of these space rocks. On average, Earth is hit by a football pitch-sized rock every 5,000 years, and a civilisation-ending asteroid every one million years, according to Nasa's Near-Earth Object Program. Last year, the privately-funded B612 Foundation discovered that Earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought. While the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the danger was still ever-present. The findings were based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations. But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale. Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts. Relative to Earth, asteroid 2014 YB35 is travelling at 23,000 mph (37,000 km/h), and its closest approach tomorrow will be 2,779,956 miles (4,473,907km). It was first discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona in December 2014, and will make an even closer, but still safe, approach in 2033 - 2,069,166 miles (3,330,000km). Nasa lists 2014 YB35 as a ‘Potentially Hazardous Asteroid’ (PHA) but, as yet, there is no chance of an impact scheduled for any point in future. ‘This “potential” to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact the Earth,’ said Nasa. ‘It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. 'By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits as new observations become available, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat.’ But speaking to the Express, Dr Bill Napier, professor of astronomy at the University of Buckinghamshire, warned there was a ‘very real risk’ of an object hitting Earth at some point in the future. ‘With something like YB35, we are looking at a scale of global destruction, something that would pose a risk to the continuation of the planet,’ he said. ‘These events are however very rare, it is the smaller yet still very damaging impacts which are a very real threat.’ Shown is the path of asteroid 2014 YB35 tomorrow. A;though it looks like it will come extremely close to Earth, it will actually pass very safely at a distance of 0.03 AU. A single Astronomical Unit - AU - is the distance from Earth to the sun Credit: Nasa . Last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids, as one could cause widespread damage to the planet. Most notably, in February 2013, hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century . In the past year, a host of famous science names have joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to Earth by asteroids. In December, more than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from Dr Brian May to Chris Hadfield signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on Earth. The experts called for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so-called near Earth objects (NEOs). It is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on Earth, we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent. This means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction, without any prior knowledge. The possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky. Yesterday Nasa released details of its Asteroid Redirect Mission (illustrated), which will see astronauts study an asteroid in space next decade. The mission is estimated to cost about £840 million ($1.25 billion), not including launch costs, and is targeted for liftoff in December 2020 . Most notably, in February 2013 hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. And in 1908, a comet exploded over the upper atmosphere in the sparse region of Tunguska, Siberia, devastating an area about the size of a major metropolitan region – 800 square miles (2,000 square km). ‘The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time,’ Dr Brian May said in a statement in December. ‘We are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at Tunguska, and nobody knows when the next big one will hit. ‘It takes just one.’","Asteroid 2014 YB35 will pass 2.8 million miles from Earth tomorrow .

"Retired commander: Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level . Russia has deployed a fleet of spy trawlers off the British coast to intercept military communications, one of Britain’s most senior retired commanders said yesterday. Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level as president Vladimir Putin ordered more acts of ‘provocation’. Equipped with hi-tech surveillance, the converted fishing boats have been seen in the international waters of the North Sea by Nato aircraft. Lord West, a former First Sea Lord, said the Cold War tactic was designed to gain intelligence on Britain’s nuclear missiles and warships. He said: ‘It was quite a tense business during the Cold War and now it is winding up again and it is very worrying. They seem to have... increased espionage, which raises tension.’ Lord West spoke out as Moscow mobilised the country’s entire Northern Fleet to full combat readiness. In a show of strength, Putin deployed 45,000 troops, more than 56 warships and submarines, and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the Barents Sea – dwarfing Nato military drills which will be held off Scotland next month. Lord West, a military grandee, said the five-day drills were a ‘knee jerk’ reaction to a similar Nato operation announced by Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday. Britain and 11 other Nato countries will contribute to the Joint Warrior exercise designed to send a signal to Moscow in the face of continued aggression – but with a force strength of less than a third. The operation – which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe – will feature just 12,000 military personnel. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how ‘powerful’ Nato was. Lord West said of Putin’s mobilisation: ‘It is clearly a knee jerk reaction to the fact we are about to do that exercise… and it raises escalation. Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level as president Vladimir Putin (pictured) ordered more acts of ‘provocation’ In a show of strength, Putin deployed 45,000 troops, more than 56 warships and submarines, and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the Barents Sea . 'Their conventional forces were incapable of mobilising quickly a few years ago and that has changed. ‘It is all very worrying as Putin is very unpredictable and is not obeying the norms of international order. ‘Russia has nuclear weapons and they believe they can be used for war fighting and that is hugely dangerous and means we are just a step away from the destruction of the globe.’ The spook ships sent by Moscow can intercept ‘voice transmissions’ up to 200 miles, with RAF Lossiemouth and Coningsby understood to be two of their targets as Russian Bear bombers fly close to UK airspace. The ships, known within Nato as AGIs, or Auxiliary Intelligence Gathering ships, eavesdrop on UK air bases and alert Soviet aircrews by secure communications so they know when the Typhoon crews from the Air Reaction Alert force are taking off. A senior military source said: ‘It would appear from our intelligence that they are working in support of Soviet bombers which have been seen off the east coast and as far south as Cornwall and simply record our reaction to these events.’ The spook ships sent by Moscow can intercept ‘voice transmissions’ up to 200 miles, with RAF Lossiemouth (pictured) and Coningsby understood to be two of their targets . At least one vessel has been spotted off the west coast of Scotland where Nato will hold their major exercise next month. The Russians tried to monitor amphibious war games in the past and will sit in international waters monitoring communications traffic. In the past three weeks, Nato P3 Orion spy planes from the United States and Norway have reported six AGIs, adding to concerns that the Soviet activity is part of a planned maritime and air operation against the UK. The source said: ‘While they look like fishing vessels they are packed with ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) and make no secret of their presence, all they want is to sit and test our reaction times and collate communications. ‘The problem is that while we managed to deal with them in the 1980s by jamming their electronic ‘listening’ field, they had updated their systems with much greater capability and as long as they sit in international waters we can do nothing.’ Scrambled: A Typhoon jet seen taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire at 4.30pm, shortly before Russian planes were intercepted last month . Lord West added: ‘They are very capable trawlers. There are lots of things the Russians want to know and they do go to try and find it out. ‘There is much more provocation from Russia. Putin does like to watch what Nato are doing as he is worried about it and sees it as an offensive alliance.’ The Russian move is the latest in a series of military ‘cat and mouse’ incidents as tension with the West soars to the highest level since the Cold War stand off in the 1980s, when Soviet spy ships sat off the UK coastline. Britain’s decision to scrap the Nimrod maritime spy plane has left the RAF with little capability to monitor Soviet maritime movements and has instead relied on Nato allies to help. The source added: ‘The sighting of a periscope was very concerning and highlighted our lack of capability. ‘Next month we will have support from Nato aircraft that will mount anti-submarine patrols as we launch a major exercise off the west coast of Scotland. ‘It will test our amphibious capability while the RAF fast jets will protect the landings and the Army will mount helicopter air assaults across south west Scotland, but we know the Soviet spy trawlers are already sat off the north west coast.’","Russia deployed trawlers off the British coast to intercept communications .

"An Illinois man who spent nearly two decades in prison for a 1992 rape and murder of a girl, 11, he did not commit has received a $20million settlement. Juan Rivera, 42, was awarded the money in the highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in U.S. history, his attorneys said on Friday at press conference in Chicago. Rivera was tried three times, the first time when he was 19 years old, and was finally cleared in 2012 when his 2009 conviction was reversed for the rape and murder of Holly Staker of Waukegan. Attorney Jon Loevy said there has never been a wrongful conviction case where the defendants agreed without a trial to pay compensation in such a large amount, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . An Illinois man who spent nearly two decades in prison for a 1992 rape and murder of a girl, 11, he did not commit has received a $20million settlement (above Juan Rivera, center, stands with attorneys Jon Loevy, left, and Locke Bowman, during a news conference Friday, March 20, 2015, in Chicago) Juan Rivera (left), 42, was awarded the money in the highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in U.S. history, his attorneys said on Friday . One of the critical factors in his successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved the semend found in Staker's body did not belong to him, according to the Chicago Tribune. Rivera was coerced into a false confession and his conviction was not an accident or a mistake, said his attorney Locke Bowman. 'This was a deliberate frame-up,' said Bowman. 'This is a terrible travesty.' Prosecutors claimed that Rivera had worn a pair of shoes stained with the girls' blood, according to his attorneys. Rivera was tried three times, the first time when he was 19 years old, and was finally cleared in 2012 when his 2009 conviction was reversed for the rape and murder of Holly Staker of Waukegan (above, Rivera hugging his family after being awarded $20million) Rivera, who now works at a medical research facility at Northwestern, said he was not angry, but 'hurt, resentful, disappointed and upset' for what he had to go through in prison . Rivera was coerced into a false confession and his conviction was not an accident or a mistake, said his attorney Locke Bowman (left). As he looks forward to a new future, Rivera (right) plans to go to college and study business management and accounting, and help pay for his mother's medical bills . However, it was later revealed that the shoes were not available for purchase at the time of the murder, and his lawyers said police had tampered with them. It was also discovered that a knife found near the steps of the crime was destroyed by Waukegan police. Rivera was released from prison on January 6, 2012, a day he has declared as his new birthday, according to NBC. One of the critical factors in Rivera's successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in Staker's body (above Holly Staker, 11, who was raped and murdered in 1992) Last year, cops linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000. Failure to identify and arrest Staker’s real killer allowed the real killer commit a second murder, according to Rivera's lawyers. 'While Mr. Rivera fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison, the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime,' said Steven Art, one of Rivera’s attorneys. The law enforcement officers who were sued in the federal case are being dismissed as defendants, and will not have to pay damages, according to the Chicago Tribune. Rivera, who now works at a medical research facility at Northwestern, said he was not angry, but 'hurt, resentful, disappointed and upset' for what he had to go through in prison. He also said that while $20million is great, he would have preferred 20 years spent with his family. Rivera said: 'To say that $20 million is a wonderful thing, of course I can live more comfortably now, my family can, I can go to college and get my education the way I've always wanted, but I still would prefer my 20 years with my family.' As he looks forward to the future, Rivera plans to go to college, study business management and accounting, and help pay for his mother's medical bills. He thanked his attorneys, and noted that other unjustly accused people are still incarcerated in Illinois and around the world. Rivera was released from prison on January 6, 2012, a day he has declared as his new birthday (above Rivera is greeted after exiting Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois on January 2012 after spending 20 years in prison) Rivera said: 'I just want to say thank you and live life with my family as best as we can and look forward to a beautiful future.' Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown. Authorities have entered the genetic profile into DNA databanks but have not obtained a match with a known suspect. Last year, cops linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000. Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown (above a map of where Staker and Foxworths' murders took place)","Juan Rivera, 42, was awarded money in highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in U.S. history, his attorneys said on Friday .

"A Native American language school for grades 6-12 will open in North Carolina in a bid to keep Cherokee culture alive. According to locals, Cherokee is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 300 native speakers left in the state. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the new division of New Kituwah Academy in January. The school has been operating since 2004 but up until now only taken students from early childhood through fifth grade. Continuing studies: A Native American language school for grades 6-12 will open in North Carolina in a bid to keep Cherokee culture alive - the New Kituwah Academy has only been open to young students up until now . From their earliest years, children learn only in Cherokee at the facility. Only in the higher grades is English introduced, mostly as a bow to parents concerned about what happens after their children leave the school. Cherokee had no writing system until the early 1800s, when the renowned silversmith Sequoyah wrote a syllabary to put its sounds on paper. While English has one symbol for every letter, Cherokee has one symbol for each of its 80-plus syllables. Unlike many other languages, which focus on nouns and adjectives, Cherokee focuses on verbs. One verb can reveal how many people are talking, what they're doing and how near they are. The near demise of the language came largely thanks to the U.S. government. Written words: This chart shows the Cherokee alphabet - there are now fewer than 300 native Cherokee speakers remaining in North Carolina . Learning process: Cherokee tribe member Haley Smith, 11, works on an English assignment at New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee . Most Cherokee were forced to make a brutal march from the Southeast to Oklahoma in the 1830s. A few stayed behind, keeping a desperate grip on their way of life. Then, beginning in the late 1800s, officials set up boarding schools to eradicate the American Indian languages. Teachers punished students for speaking their native tongues. Without New Kituwah or something like it, 'the Cherokee language will for sure die,' said Walt Wolfram, director of the North Carolina Language and Life Project at N.C. State University. 'Lots of people remain skeptical about whether languages can be revived. But the [other] option is certain death. In that sense, Kituwah Academy is the only antidote for what will be inevitable.' New Kituwah is one part of the Eastern Band's effort to preserve the language, said Annette Clapsaddle, director of the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, which has given almost $2 million to the school. Heritage: In this February 10, 2015 photo, a statue of Sequoya, creator of the Cherokee alphabet, stands in front of the New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee, North Carolina . Other initiatives include Cherokee language programs at public schools and a Cherokee studies program at Western Carolina University, she said. Throughout the U.S., Native American tribes in recent years have launched efforts to preserve their languages. The Cherokee nation in Oklahoma opened the Cherokee Immersion Charter School in 2002, said Julie Hubbard, a spokeswoman for Cherokees there. Students start at age three and go through eighth grade, when they can transfer to a public school or to Sequoyah High School, where the Cherokee immersion students study together, she said. New Kituwah - which has about 90 students - has had problems finding teachers fluent in Cherokee. Most native speakers are in their 60s and 70s and struggle with health issues, school administrators said.","The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the new division of New Kituwah Academy in January .

The moment her son Philip (pictured left) and Mrs Heywood (right) are evicted from the Southampton home . Nationwide have said they offered numerous times to come to an arrangement with the family living at the property when they began struggling with mortgage repayments. Mrs Heywood and her son Philip, 54, got behind on payments when Mr Heywood got into financial difficulties. Mrs Heywood bought the house with her late husband Ernest in 1969. Mrs Heywood bought the house (pictured) with her late husband Ernest in 1969 . Their only son Philip, a self employed computer programmer, took charge of the mortgage payments from his elderly father in 2004. But he cut back his working hours when his father was hospitalised and eventually died in 2011, aged 84. Mr Heywood said he struggled to cope with the loss of his father, and work began to dry up as the debts rose to tens of thousands of pounds. He said the eviction was the climax of a legacy of huge debts racked up following the death of his father. He said: 'It's my fault that it's got to this point, I've handled things badly and perhaps I've made some bad decisions. 'I just wish that I could turn back time. I've lived here almost all my life so it's part of my life.' Building society Nationwide said it took action after serving its fourth and final eviction notice and making continued attempts to forge a deal. Nationwide reclaimed the house after Mr Heywood failed to find the money, a new job or alternative employment. A spokeswoman for Nationwide said the organisation had shown 'significant forbearance' over a long period of time. They said: 'This is a case where we have gone above and beyond what would be expected of a reasonable lender and have made numerous attempts to help Mr Heywood find a solution which works for him and for the society. 'We do, though, owe it to our wider membership to ensure that we do not sustain losses from such situations as, over time, this will affect the viability and sustainability of their building society.' It is unclear where Mr Heywood and his mother are staying. A spokesman for Southampton City Council urged the elderly woman to get in touch with them. She said: 'We will do our best to help a resident in such a situation and urgently encourage them to contact our homelessness unit as soon as possible for an assessment.'

"Bosses at trendy clothing firm American Apparel have been rapped for a 'too sexy' advert showing a female model wearing a 'thong bodysuit'. The firm, which has more than 270 stores across the world, regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). In 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts, showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns. This American Apparel advert featuring an underage-looking model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority . And this week, the ASA again banned an advert showing a flame-haired model wearing a £30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints. One person had complained to the ASA saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was 'irresponsible and offensive' as it 'sexualised a model' who appeared to be underage. Bosses at the ASA said that despite American Apparel saying the model was 20 years old, she looked 'youthful' and that the ad was irresponsible. It stated: 'We considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age. 'The model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible. The campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to '[depict] the thong from various angles' 'We considered that readers were likely to interpret the model's expression and pose as being sexual in nature. 'In conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model, we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child. 'We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence.' It added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. 'We told American Apparel (UK) Ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence.' Bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad 'depicted the thong from various angles'. This isn't  the first time that American Apparel has been in trouble for their adverts. Last September, a  campaign for the fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’. Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display. In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’. It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt. The brand launched its Back-to-School range with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ Last year, the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a 'schoolgirl' leaning over a car door . The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show. The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Last January,the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. A storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines.","American Apparel has been told off by the Advertising Standards Authority .

"A highly successful businessman 'not willing to pay a penny' to his wife in a multimillion-pound divorce battle has been slammed by a judge and told he must hand over around £80m. Randy Work, a former key executive in Texas-based private equity company Lone Star, had argued in court that his wife was only entitled to £5m. The 47-year-old said that 'unfortunately' the mother of his two teenage children, Mandy Gray, 45, had failed to abide by a post-nuptial agreement. Highly successful businessman Randy Work (right), who was 'not willing to pay a penny' to his wife Mandy Gray (left) in a multimillion-pound divorce battle, has been told by a judge that he must hand over around £80m . She was therefore prevented from receiving a more substantial sum - and would be given little over £3m when bills were paid. But Mr Justice Holman, sitting in London, disagreed and told Mr Work: 'Having offered to pay her nothing you now have to pay her tens of millions of US dollars.' He had told the businessman previously: 'I am not sure you and I are on the same planet.' The judge, sitting in the Family Division of London's High Court, said the couple had been equal partners in a relationship of more than 20 years. They married 'without a bean' and the husband made his £150m fortune during the course of their marriage while supported by his wife, he added. Mr Work's lawyers suggested he was entitled to a greater share of money because he made a 'special contribution' through his skills at wealth-creating. Ms Gray arrives at the Royal Courts of Justice with her lawyer Fiona Shackleton (right in both pictures). Mr Work had argued the mother-of-two was only entitled to £5m after breaking a post-nuptial agreement . In the witness box, the tycoon described how he had gone to Japan and made billions of dollars for Lone Star, buying up real estate, including troubled golf courses, after the Japanese economy became stuck in a sharp downturn. Mr Work was 'the breadwinner' and Ms Gray 'the homemaker', the court was told. He added that Ms Gray had been 'a good wife' over 20 years and 'a good mother' and would have been entitled to at least £70 million, the 'total sum payable' under the post-nup agreement they signed in October 2000. But he argued that she was not entitled to any of his money, or any of his property, after coming to court to seek a better settlement. The judge disagreed and said: 'It would, in my view, be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award.' Mr Work (above) must now pay £39m to Ms Gray within 28 days and the whole sum within 90 days . He urged the couple to compromise and agree on a fair division of assets, including antique furniture and modern art, to achieve equal shares and 'to stop this terrible conflict'. The first tranche of £39m must now be paid to Ms Gray within 28 days of his ruling and the whole sum within 90 days. Earlier, the judge described the two-week 'who-gets-what' hearing as 'unedifying and destructive pugilism'. He told them as they sat on opposite sides of the courtroom there was 'plenty of money to go round', there were no difficulties and it 'should be so easy'. Mr Work and Ms Gray began living together in 1992 and married in California in 1995. They separated in 2013 and have two children, now aged 15 and 12. Mr Justice Holman (above) disagreed with Mr Work and said: 'It would, in my view, be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award' In 1997 he was offered a job with Lone Star in Dallas, Texas, and soon afterwards he was offered a post in Tokyo, where the couple lived from 1998 until 2005. They moved to the UK in 2008 and their matrimonial home has been in London ever since. The marriage broke down in 2013 when Ms Gray began an affair with the couple's physiotherapist, referred to as 'Mr H', and moved to a flat in Kensington to live with her lover, the court heard. The judge said Mr Work was 'very shocked and very hurt by his wife's infidelity and affair' and it also caused considerable upset to the couple's two children. But the judge said yesterday that Ms Gray had won the key arguments. She argued when she gave evidence that a clause in the addendum agreement to the post-nup gave her 'the unfettered right' to seek from the court 'any form of financial provision the court has power to order'. She argued that the family wealth was generated during the marriage and there should now be an equal division of the current total net assets. During the hearing the judge repeatedly told Charles Howard QC, appearing for Mr Work, that he was 'really concerned' about the husband's 'open' position that he was 'not going to pay her a penny'. The court heard that both Mr Work and Ms Gray were born in the US but had 'expatriated' and both are now resident in London. Ms Gray told the court that the post-nup was part of the move to separate their assets when her husband first decided to give up his US citizenship to save tax in America. Mr Work, described in court as a world-class triathlete, denied that was true.","American Randy Work slammed by judge at High Court in London .

"More than 100 bodies have been found in a mass grave in northeast Nigeria after a town was reclaimed from Boko Haram terrorists. The bodies - many with their throats slit and heads cut off - were found underneath a bridge in the town of Damasak, after it was retaken earlier this month by troops from Chad and Niger. It is believed the victims may have been killed more than two months ago, due to the fact the bodies were severely decomposed. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Abubakar Shekau,  leader of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, preaching his messages of hate. The insurgents have lost ground to army forces in recent weeks . Victory: Chadian soldiers celebrate after reclaiming the town of Damasak. They were later horrified to find a mass grave outside of the town where more than 100 bodies had been dumped . Colonel Azem Bermandoa Agouna said several of the victims had been decapitated, while others had been shot. He said: 'There are about 100 bodies spread around under the bridge just outside the town. 'There are heads here and bodies there, the mass grave has become like a termite mound.' He claimed the massacre probably occurred about two months ago and added: 'This is the work of Boko Haram.' The Islamist uprising, which initially began as a campaign against Western education, has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2009. In a recent chilling development, the sinister group recently allied themselves with the Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Pledge: A Boko Haram flag flutters from an abandoned command post in the town of Gamboru. The terror group recently pledged allegiance to the Islamic State . Chad and Niger launched an intensive ground and air offensive against Boko Haram in the area earlier this month, quickly reclaiming Damasak from the terrorists. According to army source, the militants suffered heavy losses in the push, with an estimated 200 killed in fighting last Sunday. Boko Haram had held the town since last November, when they killed around 50 people and forced another 3,000 to flee, according to the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees. The Nigerian military has been struggling for years to stamp out the movement and President Goodluck Jonathan, who is facing an election next weekend, has faced fierce criticism over his government's failure to contain the violence.

"This is the adorable moment a sea lion pup climbed onto a surfer's board off the coast of San Diego in Southern California, before cuddling up to him and riding the waves with him for more than an hour. The small marine creature reportedly approached longtime surfer and father-of-one, Dan Murphy, as he was taking to the water at Cardiff-by-the-Sea, off the shore of San Elijo Campground, on Sunday. It leaped onto the back of Mr Murphy's board and 'hugged' him from behind, leading him to think he was being attacked. But when the surfer whirled around, he saw it was only the 'scared-looking' pup. The sea lion pup jumped onto surfer Dan Murphy's board while he was in the water off of the San Diego coast . Pup hopped onto the back of Mr Murphy's board and 'hugged' him, leading him to think he was being attacked . The sea lion eventually crawled into Mr Murphy's lap and spend more than an hour riding the waves with him . For the next 20 minutes, the animal apparently held on tightly to Mr Murphy, before crawling into his lap 'like a puppy'. It then floated on the board and rode the waves with the surfer for a further hour. However, eventually, Mr Murphy, who has a seven-month-old baby son, had to nudge the pup off his board, and encourage it to swim off, because he needed to go home. He told NBC that the farewell was a tearful one, saying: 'I was literally in tears... I waved to him.' Speaking of the experience overall, he added: 'He spent well over an hour on my board... you see those pups around this time of year, [but] I’ve never seen them interact with people like that.' While Mr Murphy was frolicking in the ocean with the sea lion pup, his friend, Eileen Quinetela, was snapping photos of the incredible encounter. One picture shows the pup sunbathing on the board. Others depict the animal cuddling up to Mr Murphy, 'hugging' him from behind, and another surfer riding past sporting an amazed expression. They were met by an array of stunned and envious responses from Mr Murphy's friends, with one Facebook user writing: 'OMG that's incredible!! A seal is hugging you!!!', and another saying: 'That's awesome.' Mr Murphy said: 'He spent well over an hour on my board... you see those pups around this time of year' Nearly 2,000 seas lions have washed up on shores in California in sick and starving conditions so far this year . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups . It comes as California remains in the midst of a sea lion pup crisis, with nearly 2,000 of the animals having washed up on the state's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups, saying there has been 'an unusually large increase' in sea lion strandings. In January and February, strandings were 20 times the average rate for the time of year. In a conference call with reporters, an NOAA official said that up to March 15, more than 1,800 sea lions had been recorded, 750 of which were brought into the group's facilities, to be fed back up. The pups were also treated for any health problems before being released back into the ocean. Other pups have been cared for - and eventually returned to the wild - by SeaWorld trainers in the region. While Mr Murphy was with the pup, his friend Eileen Quinetela was snapping photos of the unique encounter . Experts believe warming ocean temperatures are partly responsible for the enormous rise in sea lion strandings . Speaking to NBC, Mr Murphy said the pup that jumped on to his board  on Sunday morning did not appear malnourished and was comfortable around him, so may have been a rehabilitated sea lion. Experts believe warming sea temperatures are at least, in part, responsible for the enormous rise in sea lion strandings, changing the availability of fish and other organisms on which sea lions prey. Female sea lions, which weigh some 100 kilos (against some 400 kg for males), have to swim further to find food, leading them to become prematurely separated from their pups. The next two months are likely to see an even greater surge in strandings, along the lines of a 2013 Unusual Mortality Event (UME), experts say, before hopefully the numbers will start to fall. Nate Mantua of NOAA said one piece of good news was signs of northerly winds which would help bring colder waters more rich in nutrients, at least in northern California. This could ease the food crisis which is driving the strandings, he said. Mr Murphy said the little sea lion that jumped on to his board on Sunday morning did not appear malnourished .","Sea lion pup jumped onto surfer Dan Murphy's board off San Diego coast .

"Can't choose between a bike, scooter or a skateboard for the commute to work? Now you don't have to, as inventors have come up with a contraption that combines all three into one. The device, called a Sbyke, offers riders young and old the ability to enjoy the three modes of transport simulataneously in a bizarre contraption that has cherry-picked features from each. It has a set of handlebars and a big front wheel like a bike, but the back section looks more like a skateboard. The rider propels themselves as if they were on a scooter. Scroll down for video . Two Californian inventors have come up with a new type of transport. The Sbyke (shown) is a mix of a bike, scooter and a skateboard. It has handlebars and a big front wheel, but the back has a flat section . Its makers say riding a Sbyke feels nothing like a conventional scooter - instead it is more like 'skiing on a pavement'. Ford may be known for its cars, but at this year’s Mobile World Congress the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes. Both prototypes are powered by 200-watt motors, fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car, and with pedal assist, help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph (25km/h). The bikes are part of an experiment by Ford called Handle on Mobility, which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient. The bikes, called MoDe:Me and MoDe:Pro, are based on designs by Ford employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars. For example, both bikes are fitted with rear-facing ultrasonic sensors. These sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations. The Sbyke is the brainchild of racing drivers Bart and Steve Wilson from San Clemente California who came up with the design as a way to get around the pit lanes at a race track quickly. The Wilson brothers then teamed up with designer Brad Wernli and together they built the first prototype in Brad's garage before launching the product worldwide. The Sbyke comes in two main models - a mini one for children under seven and a bigger version for older kids and adults. The smaller one costs £99.95 ($149) and the bigger is £159.95 ($249) from sbykeuk.co.uk. Shaun Turner from Hertfordshire, director of Sbyke UK, said: 'The Sbyke is the evolution of the kick scooter - a brand new revolutionary hybrid scooter which takes the best elements from scootering, skateboarding and cycling and rolls them all into one. 'Although it looks a little like a bike, a skateboard and a scooter all mixed together, it rides unlike any of them. 'Sbyke takes the best attributes of each and combines them into something totally unique. 'Imagine skiing and surfing but on the pavement. That's the sensation Sbyke can give you.' The rider, young or old, propels themselves like a scooter. The inventors say using it is like 'skiing on a pavement'. A smaller version costs £99.95 and a bigger version is £159.95 . The large front wheel supposedly helps propel the Sbyke up to five times further per push than a conventional scooter (left), while a patented rear wheel steer system apparently allows for 'amazingly tight turns' (right). Ahandbrake can also be used to keep it at a standstill .

"A charity fundraiser was left in tears after the manager of a supermarket asked him to leave the store because of his St Trinian's inspired outfit. Roger Cousin said he had dressed up in girl's school uniform in order to get more attention and collect more money for charity Children with Cancer. But the 63-year-old said he was ordered to leave Morrisons in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, after just one customer complained about his 'inappropriate' costume. Roger Cousins, from Penistone, South Yorkshire, was fundraising in a St Trinian's costume at Morrisons in Barnsley when he claims the manager of the store told him to leave . Mr Cousins,  from Penistone, South Yorkshire, said: 'I could not believe what was happening. 'It just a normal St Trinian's outfit and the majority of people have had good laugh at it but one person complained saying they would go to the 'radio' if I was still there when they had finished shopping. 'In the end I was told to leave and to change the outfit. I could feel the tears begin to roll down my face and just sat in my car feeling drained of all my confidence.' The 63-year-old was dressed as a St Trinian's pupil in a bid to collect for charity Children with Cancer ahead of his 12th London Marathon . Mr Cousins, who has been fundraising in the same store for over five years, has raised over £28,000 for a number of charities through his efforts in the marathon. Every year her wears a different outfit, which has included a naughty nurse and last year's ballet dancer costume complete with a pink tutu. The incident was the first time he has ever had a complaint made against him and been asked to leave a store. Mr Cousins said: 'I have been fundraising for a different charity for over 12 years all over Barnsley and in many different stores. I have been given permission to collect in that same Morrisons branch by the same manger, who told me to leave, for around five years. 'Even while I have been collecting this week, the manager has seen and spoken to me. They know me very well there and so do the regular customers do as well. Even the people around me said don't make him leave. 'I just wish the manager had stuck up for me and tried to explain to the customer how long I have been fundraising.' In a statement regarding Mr Cousins, Morrisons said: 'We received a number of complaints from customers who felt the collector's costume was in bad taste and therefore politely requested that he change it. 'However, Mr Cousins decided to leave the store rather than dress more appropriately. We would happily welcome him back in a different costume.' Since the incident, Mr Cousins was feeling low on confidence and was tempted not to do any fundraising today. Morrisons said they had received a number of complaints from customers who felt the collector's costume was 'in bad taste' However, due to the level of support from his family and backing on social media, he was back collecting for Children with Cancer at the Barnsley branch of supermarket rivals Tesco. Mr Cousins, who only started his fundraising efforts this week, collected almost £500 at the Morrisons store and hopes to break the £30,000 mark this year. Children with Cancer UK is the leading national charity dedicated to the fight against childhood cancer.

"Emails Hillary . Clinton turned over to a House committee investigating the 2012 . attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show her aides . sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with . her through her own private account. Clinton said during a March 10 press conference that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.' That, she claimed then, 'meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department' for archiving, where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. But The New York Times reported on Monday that some of the approximately 300 Clinton emails examined by a congressional committee  suggest otherwise. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if 'email-gate' gets deeper. She spoke at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress on Monday . LOST TO HISTORY? Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) was one of her closest aides, and emailed Clinton in a conversation where both women used personal accounts . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . The emails from Clinton, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, do not prove the former . secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces . from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported,  citing four senior . government officials. But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history. Federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side-stepping Clinton is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the State Department. Congress subpoenaed email records last week from 'close to a dozen' people who worked for Hillary Clinton at State. The Times report is the latest revelation in the saga over . Clinton and her use of a personal email address to conduct . government business, as well as a private computer server to . store that correspondence. PROBLEMS: Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department – and from public records requesters – by keeping all her emails on a private server . Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Times that Clinton's . aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her . about government matters, adding that 'only the tiniest fraction . of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved . their personal accounts.' According to the Times, she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was . at the State Department, including her foreign policy adviser, . Jake Sullivan; chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser, . Philippe Reines; and her personal aide, Huma Abedin. Abedin used an email address on Clinton's private server in addition to her official 'dot-gov' address. Mills reportedly did the same. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience.' In one email exchange cited by the Times, she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top State official before Congress. 'Did we survive the day?' she wrote. 'Survive, yes,' the adviser responded. DAMAGE CONTROL? It's not clear what Clinton's inner circle said to her about her turn before the US Senate – the infamous 'What difference does it make?' moment – because the former secretary's emails were outside the State Department's archive system . In separate exchanges weeks later, Sullivan wrote Clinton to reassure her that she wouldn't be held to account in the same way as then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in Benghazi was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control. 'She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved,' he wrote to Clinton at one point, seeming to reinforce the idea that the Obama administration planned to stick with that assessment.. Later, when the White House began referring to Benghazi as a 'terror attack,' Sullivan told Clinton that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared Rice. 'You never said ‘spontaneous’ or characterized their motivations,' he wrote, according to the Times. Details on conversations like these are sketchy: The Times wasn't permitted to look at the emails, but relied on descriptions from four different sources. COULD IT BE? Housing secretary Julian Castro (right) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if Hillary Clinton's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes . PROBE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides . Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators .

"Britain is prepared to take its sanctions against Russia to a ‘whole different level’ if Vladimir Putin ramps up his aggression, David Cameron has said. The Prime Minister said the Russian president has ‘ripped up’ the rule book and could not expect still to have access to international markets and finance. He said the West must be prepared to ‘settle in for a long and determined position’ against the Moscow government and that further incursions into Ukraine should be punished. David Cameron, pictured left, has said Britain is prepared to take its sanctions against Russia to a ‘whole different level’ if Vladimir Putin, pictured right,  ramps up his aggression . Mr Cameron told the Wall Street Journal: ‘If Russia is going to rip up the rule book of the 21st century and destabilise a sovereign country, then the rest of the world should be prepared to say to Russia, well you can’t rip up one part of the international rule book while still having access to international markets, international finance, international systems.’ On continuing tensions in Ukraine, Mr Cameron said leaders had agreed to implement tougher sanctions against Russia if the ceasefire fails. Despite last month’s ceasefire, violence has continued to flare up across the region. Mr Cameron also reiterated his commitment to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union in 2017. While he believes the ‘right answer’ is for Britain to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron said he accepted that the country might vote to leave. He added: ‘You can’t stay in an organisation if your employer, the British public, doesn’t consent to it.’ Cameron, pictured left, said Putin, pictured right, had 'ripped up' the rule book and could not expect access to international markets and finance . The conflict in the east of Ukraine has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War-era lows as Kiev, along with the US and the EU, say they have evidence that Moscow is arming the rebels and boosting their ranks with regular army soldiers. Russia has denied the accusations. The threat of an immediate cut to the gas supply from Russia to Ukraine was averted yesterday. Russian gas exporter Gazprom said it had received a prepayment that was enough to cover about five days of supply.","David Cameron says Russian president has 'ripped up' the rule book .

"Oxbridge has been branded ‘institutionally racist’ and a ‘finishing school for the private school system’ by one of its own academics. The devastating criticism was delivered by Professor Diane Reay, who accused the universities of ‘accentuating elitism’ among the privileged. She added that black and white working class students were still small in number and marginalized, despite drives to attract more youngsters from poorer backgrounds. Oxbridge has been branded ‘institutionally racist’ and a ‘finishing school for the private school system’ by a Cambridge University (pictured) academic . The professor of education at Cambridge University called for further measures to ensure more students from disadvantaged backgrounds were admitted. In a report by the race relations think tank the Runnymede Trust, Professor Reay said working class students at Cambridge saw the university as a ‘a white, middle class bubble’. She said her research suggested that ‘positive discrimination’ was at work in Oxbridge, bestowing advantage on the already advantaged. Figures released last year showed Oxford has the lowest proportion of state school pupil entrants – 57.4 per cent – of any university in England, once small and specialist higher education institutions are excluded. At Cambridge, 63 per cent of undergraduates admitted were from state schools. In the Runnymede report, Aiming Higher: Race, Inequality and Diversity in the Academy, Professor Reay suggested varying success rates of different applicant groups demonstrated ‘institutional racism’. Policies such as rarely accepting candidates with less traditional qualifications, not catering for part-time students and not allowing undergraduates to work during term time effectively rule out the majority of working class and particularly black and ethnic minority candidates, she said. In 2013, 25.4 per cent of white students applying to Oxford won a place. The success rate of Bangladeshi and Pakistani students was under seven per cent, while black Caribbean students had a 14.3 per cent conversion rate and Black African students a 13 per cent success rate. The devastating criticism was delivered by Professor Diane Reay, who accused the universities of ‘accentuating elitism’ among the privileged (file picture of Oxford University) At Cambridge, black Caribbean applicants had a 24.3 per cent chance of success compared to 29 per cent for White applicants. The figure for black African students was 9.2 per cent, and Bangladeshi and Pakistani students 13.8 and 13.6 per cent respectively. She said: ‘Oxbridge remains the equivalent of a finishing school for the private school system, polishing, refining and accentuating the elitism and sense of superiority acquired in earlier schooling.’ The academic suggested that affirmative action, such as quotas for certain groups, were needed to counteract ‘the growing class and race inequalities that are pervasive across the higher education sector’. Both universities said they ‘strongly rejected’ the professor’s allegations and outlined the millions of pounds they spend on encouraging students from poor and ethnic backgrounds to apply and on supporting them once they were there. A Cambridge University spokesman said extensive efforts were made to encourage more applications from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and that such students represented 16 per cent of the intake, which is in line with national population trends. ‘Success rates are influenced by prior school attainment, our entry requirements and the combinations of subjects studied by applicants,’ he said. ‘Data shows that ethnic minority admissions to Cambridge reflect national trends once prior school attainment has been factored in. Choices relating to subject of study and location of university also have a substantial bearing on entry rates by ethnic group. Our commitment to improving access to the University is longstanding and unwavering.’ A spokesman for Oxford University said: ‘We reject in the strongest terms any allegations of institutional bias or discrimination. Such claims are unsubstantiated, and we are concerned that unfounded allegations could undermine our efforts to attract and admit black and minority ethnic students. Just under a quarter of all Oxford students of known ethnicity are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.’","Oxbridge branded 'institutionally racist' by one of its own academics .

"A father is finally welcoming all four of his newborn quadruplets home - but sadly not his wife. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital this week. This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Scroll down for video . Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him . Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them . 'Look at these beautiful blessings,' Morales told People. 'Even when they scream their heads off I want to give them the biggest kiss.' He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.' And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss. Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms. Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through. 'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.' In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met. 'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.' He then gave her his phone number, only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out. Loving father: The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later . However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away. They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high. Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said 'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.' 'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up. A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead. Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone. 'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.' The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. Heartbreaking: Mr Morales and his wife (pictured during pregnancy) started discussing names before she went into labor. She then told they would decide after they were born . During his visits he is taking classes to make sure he gives his children the best care possible. He told the magazine 'I'm learning everything from how to give them a bath, CPR, feeding, and how to manage their sleep schedule. I need to be prepared.' When he was looking on his wife's iPad, Mr Morales found a note she had written. It described how she wanted her children to go to college, speak both Spanish and English, and get good jobs. Since Mrs Morales' death, family, friends and strangers have clubbed together to support the widower, who faces bringing the children up on his own. A GoFundMe page set up by Nicole Todman as raised almost $350,000. Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90. On that day she wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late. 'He will keep me and he ordered some labs. 'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. 'He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure. I'm sure I won't but he looking at how to finish things.' After explaining that it would definitely be a premature birth, Mrs Morales added: 'I always want more but sometimes you just have to sit back and thank God for blessing up to this point and put it fully in his hands. Thanks for the prayers and everything else.' To donate to the Morales family click here .

"Parents have criticised a school where 20 pupils fell ill after using a Nicotine spray prescribed to a 12-year-old – in an incident dismissed as a 'prank' by the headmaster. The children, aged between 11 and 13, suffered vomiting, dizziness and headaches, with one apparently needing hospital treatment. Incredibly, the Nicorette mouth spray had been brought to class by the 12-year-old after she was prescribed it by NHS anti-smoking staff who visited the school. Manufacturers say the anti-addiction product is safe for ages 12 and up – but experts claim it can cause acute poisoning in non-smokers. Parents have criticised Wolstanton High School (pictured) in Newcastle-under-Lyme where 20 pupils fell ill after using a Nicotine spray prescribed to a 12-year-old . Frantic parents were called to Wolstanton High School in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, last Wednesday after 20 pupils became ill during lunchtime. One father, whose daughter suffered vomiting and dizziness, expressed his disbelief that a child had been given the spray in the first place. He said: 'It is ridiculous that the school are allowing a girl so young to be prescribed something this dangerous. I agree they should be giving them advice, but she is only 12. 'It could have been a lot more serious, one of them could have been seriously poisoned.' A mother, who also asked not to be named, said her 12-year-old son tried the spray, adding: 'When he was collected he was extremely pale, holding on to the rail outside and some of the others had been sick. He's suffered a toxic overdose.' It is understood one pupil even attended the Royal Stoke University Hospital's A&E for a heart check-up. But despite parents' concerns, the school's headmaster Alan Aston appeared to downplay the 'regrettable' incident as a practical joke. He said: 'The spray was shared with other pupils and they became nauseous. We have dealt with the pupil involved using our own sanctions ... unfortunately this was a prank that went wrong.' Manufacturers say the anti-addiction product (pictured) is safe for ages 12 and up – but experts claim it can cause acute poisoning in non-smokers . The girl was prescribed the nicotine spray by Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Partnership NHS Trust, which ran an anti-smoking course called 'Time to Quit' at the comprehensive school. Ian Saberton, the scheme's service manager, said his staff had followed the proper procedures. He added: 'All pupils who request support receive an appointment, after which they are required to do some preparation for a quit attempt. Medication is only recommended at the following appointment.' Mr Aston defended the course, saying that as most of the school's pupils are underage, 'smoking is illegal, which we take very seriously'. Johnson & Johnson, which makes the spray, says it is safe for adults and children over 12. But the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC), whose information is vetted by regulators, warns: 'Products containing nicotine should not be left where they may be misused, handled or ingested by children.' Although the spray's 1mg dose is small – a lethal dose for an adult who doesn't smoke is 40 to 60mg – the eMC says those who are not used to nicotine can suffer poisoning symptoms such as vomiting and dizziness.","The incident occurred at Wolstanton High School in Newcastle-under-Lyme .

"This is the 12-sided £1 coin that will replace the version that’s been in circulation for more than 30 years in 2017. Experts say the new, bi-metallic coin, which will be in two colours, will be the most secure coin in circulation in the world. The striking design featuring a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock emerging from a Royal Coronet was created by 15-year-old schoolboy David Pearce, who won a Royal Mint competition. Scroll down for video . The new 12-sided £1 coin design that will replace the current version, designed by 15-year-old David Pearce . The current £1 coin has been in circulation since 1983 - much longer than the normal life cycle of a modern British coin. Its technology is said to be no longer suitable for a coin of its value, leaving it vulnerable to ever more sophisticated counterfeiters. More than 6,000 people entered the competition to design the new coin. David Pearce, of Queen Mary’s Grammar School in Walsall, was surprised by a phone call from the Chancellor this week telling him he had won. His design features the four well-known symbols of the UK emerging from a Royal Coronet. The Royal Mint estimates that about three per cent of all £1 coins - or a staggering 45 million - are now forgeries. In some parts of the UK, the figure is as high as six per cent. Over the past few years, around two million counterfeit £1 coins have been removed from circulation each year. George Osborne meeting with children who entered the competition at Number 11 Downing Street yesterday . In a nod to Britain’s heritage, it is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny or thrupenny bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971 and was in the first group of coins ever to feature the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The threepenny bit was the first British coin to use a 12-sided shape, which was popular during the Second World War since its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during the blackout. The new £1 coin will affect many aspects of daily life, including vending machines, parking meters and shopping trolleys. Ministers admit there will be costs for some businesses, but say the increasing number of forged £1 coins in circulation mean action has become urgently needed. The current £1 coin has been in circulation since 1983. Pictured, annealed coins at the Royal Mint . Many business leaders agree that such significant sums are now being lost through counterfeits that a new coin that is harder to forge is needed. Mr Osborne said: ‘Designing the new £1 coin was a brilliant opportunity to leave a lasting legacy on what will be the most secure coin in circulation anywhere. ‘The competition captured the imagination of thousands of people and David Pearce’s winning design will be recognised by millions in the years ahead. 'It was fantastic to congratulate him and other young entrants in person in Downing Street.’ David said: ‘I was really excited to hear that I had won the competition to design the new £1 coin but hugely shocked as well. ‘I heard about the competition through my design teacher at school and I thought I had nothing to lose so I decided to enter. 'I spent a lot of time researching what coin designs looked like and what sort of designs would represent all parts of the UK before submitting my idea and I honestly cannot believe I have won.’ Adam Lawrence, chief executive of The Royal Mint said: ‘We are delighted to have the opportunity to support Her Majesty’s Treasury in modernising the iconic £1 coin and helping to re-define the world of coinage. 'Made from two different metals and including ground-breaking technology developed at The Royal Mint, this new 12-sided coin will be the most secure circulating coin in the world. ‘As an organisation we have been established for over 1,000 years, but we are constantly looking to the future, so it’s fantastic to see the work of a talented young artist like David Pearce being replicated on a coin, that will be used by millions of people in Britain and recognised world-wide for years to come.’","David Pearce, from Walsall, beat more than 6,000 entrants in competition .

"Just three drinks a day can be enough to cause liver cancer, according to an extensive review of global research. The increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed – around one alcoholic drink – is about 4 per cent, says the World Cancer Research Fund. As a result three or more drinks pose a significant cancer risk, it adds. The review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer, as well as evidence that drinking coffee can protect against the disease. The risk of liver cancer is increased by 4 per cent for every 10g of alcohol consumed, meaning three or more drinks a day pose a significant cancer risk, a research review has claimed . The WCRF's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet, weight and physical activity, and liver cancer. In all, 34 studies were analysed covering 8.2million people of whom more than 24,500 had liver cancer. Previous research by the project has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers, including liver. The WCRF recommends women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day and men to two. Amanda McLean, director of WCRF UK, said: 'Around three or more drinks per day can be enough to cause liver cancer. Until now we were uncertain about the amount of alcohol likely to lead to liver cancer. But the research reviewed in this report is strong enough to be more specific.' In 2012, there were 4,703 cases of liver cancer in the UK. The report estimates that nearly a quarter of cases could be prevented if people kept a healthy weight and did not drink. World Cancer Research Fund reviewed 34 studies involving more than 8.2million people in order to reach its findings on alcohol, weight, physical activity and liver cancer . Although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease, the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said: 'The findings from this study further demonstrate the urgent need for mandatory health warnings on alcohol products.' Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser for alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said the research revealed a worrying link with obesity, but some people had a 'blind spot' when it comes to the calories in alcohol. She added: 'To help reduce the risk of getting alcohol-related liver cancer, it is best to drink within the lower-risk guidelines of 2-3 units a day for women, that's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine, or 3-4 units a day for men, a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer.' Sir David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor of the public understanding of risk, University of Cambridge, said that while the increase in risk of liver cancer per 10g of alcohol consumed was about 4 per cent, that level of alcohol was 'extremely unlikely to cause cancer', especially as the report says the increase in risk only starts at levels above 5.5 units a day. He added: 'Liver cancer is rare: about one in 100 men and one in 200 women get it. So if you already drink a lot, and then drink even more, your risk goes up a small amount.' Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology, University of Cambridge, said the evidence appeared to show three drinks a day led to 'a very small' absolute increase in risk from ten in 1,000 to 12 in 1,000 for men and 5 in 1,000 to 5.6 in 1,000 for women. He added: 'Even though the data specifically related to primary liver cancer do not support the recommendation to limit alcohol intake to one drink a day for women and two for men, there are plenty of other reasons to support the recommendations.'","Just three alcoholic drinks a day could be enough to cause liver cancer .

"A man has been jailed for one year after stuffing his girlfriend in a suitcase and covering her mouth with a cloth when she dumped him, according to the People's Daily Online. The man, known only as Wang, tied up girlfriend Mu when she broke up with him at a hotel in the city of Xi'an in central China last June. He then bundled her into a wheelie black suitcase, before paying drivers to take him back to his home in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning province. But he was caught when the driver heard Mu's muffled cries from inside the suitcase and contacted the police. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage showed Wang wheeling his girlfriend, stuffed in this black suitcase, out of the hotel in Xi'an . Wang promised his girlfriend he would 'treat her nicely' when they returned to his home city of Shenyang . Wang had been dating his girlfriend for more than two years when he asked her to relocate to his home town of Shenyang. He had promised his girlfriend he would 'treat her nicely' when they arrived and that he would hire a housekeeper. But when she rejected his advances, he hatched a plan to force her back to his home city. Wang said: 'When I tied her up, I told her ""I don't want to do this but after this small discomfort, when we arrive back home, I will use the rest of my life to treat you well. I will employ a helper so you can live happily."" It was on June 15 last year when Wang tied up his girlfriend and crammed her 5ft 3in frame into the suitcase. When he had wheeled her to the front of the hotel, he told the driver to head to his home city after paying him 5,000 yuan (£542). But he was exposed when the driver heard his girlfriend's cries inside the case. Wang was arrested and taken into custody when the car reached Shenyang later that day. Wang was seen entering the hotel with Mu around 10am - five hours later he crammed her in a suitcase . Wang was filmed looking nervous as he exited the hotel trailing the heavy black suitcase behind him . Following his arrest, police discovered CCTV footage showing him and his girlfriend walking upstairs in the hotel following their alleged argument. The pair, who were walking metres apart from each other, could then be seen entering their hotel room just after 10am. But around 3pm, Wang was filmed looking nervous as he left their hotel room carrying a small bag, as well as a suitcase containing his girlfriend. He could then be seen straining as he dragged the suitcase down the corridor and out of the hotel's front doors. In an interview with police, Wang said he and Mu were a couple, but confirmed that Mu had wanted to break up. The Xi'an New District People's Court said Wang had committed a serious crime of illegal detention, but after he confessed to his crime he was handed a one-year sentence.","Wang jailed for a year after gagging girlfriend and stuffing her in a case .

"A talented horsewoman killed herself hours after her beloved mare was put to sleep, an inquest heard. Stephanie Lees, 42, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found clutching a lock of her horse's mane after taking her own life when the animal had to be put down. The equestrian had devoted ten years to caring for her horse Jake, who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village, and had become even more attached to him when her other horse, Elliot, died three years ago. Stephanie Lees, 42, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found clutching a lock of her horse's mane after taking her own life when the animal had to be put down following illness in November last year, inquest told . The equestrian had devoted ten years to caring for her horse Jake (pictured together in 2008), who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village, and had became 'very distressed' when he became unwell . The animal, which had been lame for a few months, had to be put to sleep in November last year, due to an illness called colic, which manifested following an operation on its leg. However, Ms Lees – a chartered surveyor for Barnsley Council - was unable to cope with the animal's death and took her own life just hours after the horse was put down. Ms Lees, who was single and had no children, had been unable to ride Jake for more than a year due to his ill health and had struggled to cope as she watched the animal deteriorate. At an inquest into her death in Sheffield today, her friend Jane Taylor told of her utter shock at finding her on Remembrance Day last November. She said: 'That day I went up to the stables to go for a ride with my friend Helen. 'We passed a gateway that gives access to a parking area. I heard Helen say 'Oh my God', then I heard the words 'Steph'. The inquest heard how Ms Taylor 'knew Steph was dead' after touching her shoulders and the pair called the emergency services. Ms Lees, a chartered surveyor who was single, became even more attached to Jake when her other horse Elliot (pictured in 2000) died three years ago . She added: 'She had a lock of her horse's hair in her hands'. Another close friend of Ms Lees, Joanne Weatherall, said: 'Stephanie remained with Jake right up until the point the vet administered the injection. She was very upset.' Police officer Stephen Taylor, from South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing that following the equestrian's body being found, a search of her house uncovered a note. He said: 'It was basically saying that she lived for her horses and because the horse had been put to sleep she couldn't cope anymore. 'There was also a list of a dozen friends giving an amount of money to each person on the list.' Recording a verdict of suicide, assistant coroner Julian Fox said: 'She had been a great lover of horses in particular her horse Jake, who had been ill with a bad leg. She hadn't been able to ride him for 18 months or so. 'It was concluded that sadly Jake needed to be put down. Steph was not able to watch Jake die and was clearly very, very distressed when that took place. 'Despite having a good circle of friends it seems clear to me that she felt she could live no longer. 'Having heard the circumstances relating to Jake and in relation to the way her body was found and a note saying goodbye I have no doubt at all that Steph did intend to take her own life.' Mr Fox expressed his sympathy to Miss Lees' parents John and Josephine, saying: 'Perhaps in her mind at last she is now with the horse she loved. 'It is an extremely unexpected event, this lady was very talented and capable and barely in the prime of her life.' Following her death last year, Ms Lees' mother Josephine said she and her husband John were 'devastated and heartbroken'. Ms Lees, 42, (pictured riding her horse Jake in 2008) took her own life just hours after the mare had to be put down in November last year. She was found dead by friends near her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire . Ms Lees cared for Jake for ten years and would visit him morning and night at these stables near her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Her parents said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' over her death . Floral tributes were placed near the stables where Ms Lees kept her horses following her death last year . The 74-year-old said: 'Steph couldn't bear to be parted from Jake and made a decision to join him. 'It was really the loss of Jake which broke her heart. He had gone lame about 18 months ago and had to be put down the day before. 'She hadn't been able to ride him and devoted most of her spare time to looking after him. She absolutely adored him.' 'She just wanted to join him, which is in some ways a happy thing, but also very sad. 'She was very much loved. We've had about 200 cards from people.' At her funeral, friends followed her coffin on horseback and recalled a 'wonderful, caring and patient' woman. One friend paid tribute online, writing: 'Steph was a sunbeam. The prettiest smile in the village and a fine horsewoman. Unbearably sad to think she's gone from us.'

"Pop duo Hall and Oates are suing a cereal company over the name of its maple syrup and oat granola. The two musicians have accused the Brooklyn-based firm of infringing on their trademark with the packet of cereal - called Haulin' Oats. Early Bird Foods & Co, who make the cereal, deliberately created a phonetic play on the band's well-known name, the duo claim. The lawsuit suggests the company must hand over any profits made from the granola  as it has traded off the band's 'fame and notoriety'. Pop duo Hall and Oates (left) are suing a cereal company over their maple syrup and oat granola - named Haulin' Oats (right) It adds that others have previously tried 'to make a connection between the artists' names and oats-related products'. The cereal - which costs $27 for three packets - is described as 'wholesome old-fashioned goodness' on the company's website. It is sold in 38 states, as well as Europe and Japan. Nekisia Davis, owner of Early Birds Food, said she had no comment. But in an apparent reference to one of the duo's 1983 hits she added: 'Except say it isn't so.' Daryl Hall (left) and John Oates (right) pose together before a performance in July 2004. They claim that the cereal company should hand over any profits made from the granola . Hall and Oates started working together in the early 1970s and have sold more albums than any other duo in music history. Their 1972 debut album and corporate company are called Whole Oats. Hits include Maneater, Rich Girl, Private Eyes, I Can't Go for That (No Can Do), Sara Smile and She's Gone. The case was filed in Brooklyn federal court.","Daryl Hall and John Oates claim the cereal infringes on their trademark .

"A size 26 jealous girlfriend who was dumped by her boyfriend for being too paranoid about him cheating has got back together with him after losing 10 stone. Mother-of-one Vicci Fish, 32, piled on the pounds by gorging on takeaways and chocolate while pregnant with her first son. She tipped the scales at 24st 8lbs and became so insecure that she would accuse her boyfriend, Chris Evans, 34, of cheating every time he went out - eventually causing the pair to split. Unrecognisable: Vicci Fish lost ten stone. The mother-of-one piled on the weight whilst pregnant with her first child and subsequently became paranoid that her partner, Chris Evans, would leave her for another woman . Back together: Vicci's boyfriend Chris left her because of her jealousy but the couple rekindled their relationship after she lost ten stone and regained her confidence . Miss Fish, from Nantgarw, near Cardiff, vowed to change after the break up and vowed to lose weight, swapping fatty foods for fruit and vegetables. The police control room team leader, who used to eat McDonald's for breakfast, followed by a cheese sandwich, a chocolate bar and crisps for lunch, and a Chinese takeaway with curry and chips for dinner, also took up running – and saw her lose 10 stone. As Miss Fish's weight fell, her confidence soared, and a year later she won back her man. She said: 'I was paranoid about Chris cheating because I was insecure about my own body. Splitting with Chris was heartbreaking but it's what I needed to change. I'm so glad I lost the weight to win back my man.' Miss Fish first started struggling with her weight after giving birth to her son Noah, now three. Before and after: Vicci felt so uncomfortable in herself that she would accuse her partner Chris of wanted to be with other women, now she feels great about the way she looks . Unhappy: At her biggest Vicci weighed a whooping 24st 8lbs thanks to her diet of Macdonalds and take-aways . Soon she tipped the scales at a whopping 24st 8lbs and hid her enormous frame under size 26 clothes. She said: 'I would sit around eating throughout the day - I just didn't think about eating healthily. I would always have a biscuit in my hands or a packet of crisps. 'If I walked past McDonald's I would always pop in for a burger. Everything was difficult - I had to stop at least twice when going up the stair.' As her weight increased Miss Fish's confidence hit rock bottom, and Green-eyed, she soon became convinced her boyfriend of ten years Mr Evans would leave her for another, thinner woman. She said: 'I couldn't shake the feeling that Chris was looking for someone else as I slobbed out with a takeaway. 'Chris is gym-mad and loves going out, but I hated it. I was a complete couch potato. It was easier for me to stay in, I felt too insecure about my body to go out and I had nothing to wear. 'He would always ask me to come out with, but I always said no. Eventually he stopped asking me and started to go out by himself. 'I let my imagination run away with me - my insecurities placed a constant strain on our relationship.' Breakfast: . Bacon and egg McMuffin . Lunch: . Cheese and onion sandwich, crisps, a chocolate bar and a fizzy drink . Dinner: . A chinese takeaway with special chow mein, special fried rice, sweet and sour chicken balls, crispy shredded beef, chicken curry, and chips and biscuits and crisps as snacks throughout the day . Breakfast: . Slimming World sausage, bacon, fried tomato, eggs and mushrooms . Lunch: . Lasagne made with lean mince and yoghurt . Dinner: . A steak and salad with a jacket potato . Snacks: . Throughout the day Vicci will snack on fresh fruit . Eventually Mr Evans, a tree surgeon, decided he could not cope with Miss Fish's paranoia anymore and in October 2013 he moved out. She said: 'He moved back in with his parents and I only saw him at weekends when he came to pick up our son. 'When he moved out I was heartbroken - my paranoia had finally pushed him away. It was the wake-up call I needed and I decided to make a change.' Miss Fish started watching what she ate and going on extended runs. Soon she had lost four stone. After her initial weight loss she joined her local Slimming World. She swapped greasy takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. She joined the gym and started going four times a week. She also started running. Within a year Miss Fish had dropped to a healthier 14st 7lbs. No social life: As Vicci's weight began to rise she wanted to go out less and less and she no longer felt confident enough to be around her friends . Compliments: After she began to lose the weight Vicci was met with lots of compliments from her friends on her new figure and glamorous new wardrobe . She said: 'I began to accept invitations to go out with friends. My new figure and glamorous wardrobe attracted lots of compliments - but there was only one person I wanted to notice, and that was Chris.' In October 2014 Miss Fish and Mr Evans went out for dinner and rekindled their relationship. They moved back in with other shortly afterwards. Miss Fish says that today the couple are stronger than ever. She said: 'He told me I looked amazing, and we fell back in love. Losing weight was fantastic, I feel fitter healthier and happier. 'Most importantly I feel confident and that has allowed myself and Chris to build a stable relationship.' Baby weight: It was when Vicci was pregnant with her son, Noah, who is now three that she first started to put on a lot of weight . Active: Vicci is now more active which has helped her to shift the ten stone and win back her boyfriend, Chris . Mr Evans said: 'Life with Vicci had become hard work because she was overweight and never wanted to go out anywhere. She didn't have any confidence and was really paranoid about who I was with. 'I couldn't do anything without her being paranoid about what I was up to. I ended up moving out into my old bedroom at my mum's. I missed the family unit and coming home to my son at the end of the day. 'When Vicci started losing more and more weight she changed. Not only did she look incredible but she had more of a life. 'She was going out and had a lot more confidence. I really missed her, so we got back together. These days, she looks so good that it's me who gets paranoid. 'I'm really proud of her. It's great being back with her, even though if I want sausages I have to eat Slimming World ones. But it is great to be able to go down the pub with my mates without her worrying.'","After Vicci Fish piled on the pounds she turned into a paranoid mess .

"Almost 40 years ago, the 20th century's most influential sub-culture was born. Today, hip hop is a way of life that dominates fashion, music, art, dance and advertizing. It is a far cry from the humble beginnings of experimental rap, graffiti, and break-dancing in the run-down areas of 1970s New York City, which sparked a revolution. Watching from the sidelines were photographers Janette Beckman, Joe Conzo and Martha Cooper. And now, their glimpses inside the seminal years between 1977 and 1990 will be put on show at the Museum Of The City Of New York. Revolutionary: This image of The Almight Kay Gee, of the Cold Crush Brothers in 1981, is one of 80 documenting the start of hip hop .

Other key figures are seen posing for their first photo shoots, including the members of Boogie Down Productions, a hip hop group from the Bronx which masterminded a fusion of dancehall and reggae. Big Daddy Kane, one of the most revered rappers in history who found fame with the Juice Crew in 1986, exhibits the archetypal haircut for hip hop fans during his hey day of 1988. Afrika Bambaataa, who pioneered electro funk, poses for London-born photographer Janette Beckman in front of a graffiti-strewn brick wall in 1983, in a nod to the street roots of the movement. And Queen Latifah, who made waves by rapping about domestic violence in 1990, also makes an appearance. Later photos show the colorful album covers produced for girl band Salt N Pepa and Busta Rhymes. The exhibition will run from April 1 to September 15.

"The Brownsville, Texas federal judge who blocked President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration has ordered the Justice Department to answer allegations that the government misled him about part of the plan. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen on Monday denied the Obama administration's request to lift a time-out he enforced on Feb. 16, when he ruled that a lawsuit filed by 26 states might succeed. His order was designed, he said, to prevent a situation that couldn't be undone if it were declared unconstitutional. It also seemed to fire a shot across the White House's bow, blaming the administration for failing to keep illegal immigrants out of the country. HOT SEAT: President Barack Obama, seen Tuesday signing the 'Student Aid Bill of Rights' law in the Oval Office, faces the possibility that his immigration plans will die in federal court . HERE COMES THE JUDGE: Federal jurist Andrew Hanen is calling the Obama administration on the carpet about the president's immigration plan . 'The court finds that the government's failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country,' Hanen ruled in February, saying that states were being financially 'drained by the constant influx of illegal immigrants.' His stay will remain in place for at least another 10 days, pending a March 19 hearing where the Justice Department will have tough questions to answer. Last week the government's lawyers admitted in a paper filing that the Obama administration had already granted three-year deportation reprieves to 100,000 people, and granted them work permits, as part of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That program's guidelines provided only for two-year reprieves, unlike Obama's latest executive actions. PLAINTIFF: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors . Justice Department attorneys had previously told Hanen that the federal government wouldn't accept DACA requests with longer timeframes until Feb. 18. The judge's order came on the 16th, legally prohibiting them from issuing any three-year permits. The president's more recent attempt to mainstream illegal immigrants, announced in November, will cover 5 million or more people and will ultimately go into force unless the judiciary blocks it. The group of 26 states suing to stop Obama's immigration plan argue in their legal complaint that the government falsely claimed it hadn't implemented any part of the November plan before Hanen blocked it. Hanen's injunction had no effect on the DACA program, but his demand for a new hearing suggest he's looking at that program in addition to Obama's more recent executive actions, which concern illegal immigrant parents of American citizens born in the U.S., and other permanent residents who have been in the country for years. The government has asked him to lift the stay completely while they appeal it to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, or at least to limit the impact of his decisions to Texas. With Monday's ruling, that won't happen until at least March 19. ANGER: Conservatives have bristled at the idea of the White House tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay . DEMANDS: More than 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States, including millions who were brought to America as children and many born here to illegal immigrant mothers . Advocates on both sides of the immigration fight told The New York Times on Tuesday that Hanen is seen as a fairminded jurist. 'That gentleman is constantly hearing the prosecution of drug cartel violence in his courtroom,' Democratic state Rep. Eddie Lucio III told the Times. 'When he says we need to have proper border enforcement, it’s because he sees the worst of it.' And a Houston trial lawyer who was among Hanen's law school classmates said that he supports the White House's position '100 percent.' But still, he said, 'I would disagree with anyone who would say Andy Hanen has any prejudice. His decisions will always be based on sound legal grounds.' Another classmate, U.S. Court of Appeals judge Priscilla Owen, sits on the 5th Circuit panel that will likely hear the case next.","Obama administration told Judge Andrew Hanen that it hadn't moved past implementing Obama's 2012 'DACA' immigration plan .

"Organisers of an electronic music festival in country Victoria last weekend were disgusted to find mountains of trash left behind by party-goers. The Maitreya festival, a weekend of 'psytrance', techno and art, attracted thousands of revellers to the picturesque Wooroonooka Lakes camping ground, 245 km north-west of Melbourne. But festival-goers left much more than their dancing shoes behind. ""We're all here cleaning this up because a percentage of you have made a hell of a mess and left it all behind - and you really obviously don't give a toss,' says Tim, a member of the Charlton football club and one of the clean-up volunteers in a video of the aftermath. 'Fair's fair - you wouldn't do this at your mum and dad's place, don't do it at our lake.' Scroll down for video . 'We know you've have come here for a good time, and not a long time ... but you obviously don't give a toss!' says Tim, who volunteered to clean-up after the festival . 'Disgusting it's left up to the local community that was kind enough to let us on their beautiful land,' wrote one festival-goer on social media . The video, posted to You Tube by the Maitreya festival organisers, pans an area of bushland littered with old couches and trashed tents, water bottles, discarded costumes, hoola hoops and beer cartons. 'If they're organised enough to bring couches, surely they can be organised enough to take them home, it's just simple courtesy,' says Tim as he loads a truck with garbage bags and old cushions. 'Fair's fair - you wouldn't do this at your mum and dad's place, don't do it at our lake,' says Tim, one of the volunteers with the Charlton Football club . The Maitreya event prides itself on being environmentally conscious and before the party, urged festival goers, as 'friends of the eartth,' to leave no trace. 'If we can become responsible caretakers of the land, as is our heritage, we can continue to gather here for many moons to come….If we can't ... sadly with the indictment on our shoulders we will have to leave…,' stated the festival website. The Maitreya festival was held here on the Wooroonooka Lakes, near Charlton in country Victoria . The picturesque camp site before the Maitreya music festival last weekend . The beautiful Wooroonooka Lake is a popular camping spot for nature lovers and recreational fishers . According to the Charlton Football Club, it took four solid days and a team of fifty plus volunteers to get the site back to how it was. A bush doof is an outdoor dance party, usually held in a remote area, or in bush or rainforests outside big cities in Australia or New Zealand. 'Doof doof' is an Australian term for loud, heavy bass electronic music. In most cases, bush doofs are small and secret, promoted by word-of-mouth or social media. Sometimes they last for days. Last year, a central coast teenager survived an 80-metre cliff fall after trying to avoid the cover charge for a 'bush doof' in the Watagan State Forest, north of Sydney. Another 21-year-old man went missing for more than 48 hours in forest south-east of Perth after attending a remote rave. Bush doofs usually involve live techno or trance DJs and are notorious for illicit drug use. 'People were disappointed by the rubbish, but I was out there yesterday and I'd say 90 per cent of the camp ground was restored to it's natural state,' Charlton Football Club secretary, Martin McGeown, told Daily Mail Australia. Some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options in comments to social media. 'Unlike Rainbow and others where you are provided with a garbage bag at the gate they did not even mention to us anything about rubbish disposal,' wrote one You Tube user who attended the festival. 'We were never told that there were any bins on site and did not even see one until we drove out the gate on the last day. Perhaps if they want people to be more responsible they need to take responsibility for informing festival patrons about how to properly dispose of their rubbish and provide adequate bins!' But Maitreya organisers have scolded festival goers on their official Facebook page, posting 'Maitreya festival patrons got a lot to learn! Take some RESPONSIBILTY! 'Take some RESPONSIBILTY:' Festival organisers say Maitreya patrons have a lot to learn . 'You obviously don't give a toss': Volunteers were frustrated at cleaning up the mess . Taking out the trash: It took volunteers more than four days to clean up the campsite . McGeown says the Charlton club provided bins and a rubbish crew for the event and its members were out in force for the clean-up afterwards. 'You've got to remember this is a huge area and a lot of people, so it was a big job, but not a mammoth one considering,' McGeown said. 'Overall it was a positive event and the town and local businesses have been extremely supportive.' McGeown doesn't believe the trash will spell the end of the Maitreya festival but says to future revellers: 'Enjoy yourselves, respect the environment.' Leave no trace: 'There is nothing I hate more than walking around and seeing thousands of those empty Nos bulbs scattered around what was originally a beautiful clean space', says one Instagram user who found a better use for the rubbish. Some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options .

"Guan Quanzi was bitten by a panicked wild panda that had been chased onto his land in China by officials when they found it was roaming free in a village and may still need his leg amputated . A man may lose his leg after he was attacked by a wild panda as it was chased by locals after it wandered into a village in China. Guan Quanzhi was set upon by the panda, which sunk its teeth into his leg, as officials chased it into his land in Liziba village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. A quick thinking villager threw a coat over the animal's head which made it let go of Mr Quanzhi who was left severely injured. He had to have a seven hour operation to try and repair the damage. In the last year Mr Quanzhi has spent months in hospital and had a total of eight operations. He has recently been told he may have to have his leg amputated, according to the People's Daily online. 'When the giant panda sunk its teeth into my leg the pain was indescribable. Blood was everywhere,' said Mr Quanzhi. Pandas have a 'cuddly' reputation but can be territorial. They have strong jaws which enable them to strip bamboo but this also means they can deliver a powerful bite. The incident took place on March 1 last year when the panda wandered into a village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. Locals attempted to capture the animal only for it to flee them and run into Mr Quanzhi's land. Mr Quanzhi, who is in his 60s, added: 'I was working at home and saw many people running in my direction, looking closer I could see a mud-covered panda being chased.' As the animal saw Mr Quanzhi was blocking its path he sunk its teeth into its leg until someone threw a coat over it. The panda fled and disappeared after being seen wandering around in the mountains for more than half an hour. Locals realised Mr Quanzhi was seriously injured and he was taken to Qingchuan County People's hospital, which was more than 10km away, for emergency treatment. The next day Mr Quanzhi had to endure a seven hour operation to repair the broken bone in his leg and stem a ruptured vein. He was in hospital for two months. Because of his family's financial circumstances the village council and the Forestry Bureau  borrowed 70,000 yuan (£7,500) and 30,000 yuan (£3,000) respectively. The panda was seen roaming around the village and attacked Mr Quanzi, sinking its teeth into his leg . The panda, normally a docile animal, was chased and is believed to have panicked when it bit Mr Quanzi . Officials had been chasing the panda after they realised the wild animal was roaming around the village . Mr Quanzi has been forced to endure eight operations and weeks in hospital since he was bitten by the panda . His son said: 'My father stayed in hospital for 57 days, during this time he had skin grafts as well as various operations. 'After so much suffering and over such a long period of time part of his leg muscles have slowly shrunk and this has led to him not being able to walk on his leg and no longer being able to look after himself.' Mr Quanzhi was told that because his recovery has been unsatisfactory he is likely to need further surgery and may need to have his leg amputated. He took the Provincial Forestry Department, Longnan City's County Forestry Bureau and the Whitewater River National Nature Reserve Administration, home to around 100 wild pandas, to court. The animal had wandered into the village and is believed to have been looking for food when it was spotted . Experts have warned that while pandas have a 'cute and cuddly' reputation they do have strong jaws . The panda (centre) was seen wandering around Liziba Village and was spotted by locals who reported it . He was recently awarded 520,000 yuan (£56,000) in compensation from the three parties. 'Although giant panda's are generally docile, they are still wild animals, and are territorial,' Director of the Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre of China, Zhang Hemin. 'Pandas rarely ever attack people, but if people enter their territory they will attack in self-defense as a warning.' The animals are an important draw for tourists in China, and several are rented out to zoos. They have also been known to attack people in the past. In 2008 a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who scaled a 6ft tall barrier to climb into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. The panda was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man on his arms and legs.","A wild panda wandered into Liziba village  in Gansu Province in China .

"Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when the governor signed a law on Monday approving the method when no lethal injection drugs were available, even though he called it 'a little bit gruesome'. Utah is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists, Republican Governor Gary Herbert said. 'We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty, and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued,' the governor's spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah in June 2010. Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when Governor Gary Herbert signed a law Monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available . However, enforcing death sentences is 'the obligation of the executive branch'. The governor's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection. In Washington state, inmates can request hanging. In New Hampshire, hangings are fallback if lethal injections can't be given. Ronnie Lee Gardner, pictured above, was the last person killed by firing squad in the U.S. after choosing this method of execution. Gardner, 49, was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12.15am at Utah State Prison in Draper. In 1984, Gardner had killed Melvyn John Otterstrom, shooting him in the face during a robbery in Salt Lake City and leaving his body to be found by his wife. In April 1985, he shot dead attorney Michael Burdell at a court hearing as he tried to escape. He was given a life sentence for the first murder and condemned to die for the second. The firing squad was made up of police officers who had volunteered. One gun was loaded with non-lethal wax bullets so it would not be known who fired the kill shot. And an Oklahoma law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional. Utah's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off-limits to prisons. Death by firing squad requires detailed preparations. The prisoner is strapped into a chair at the ankles and by the arms and chest in front of a wood panel with sandbags piled high on either side to prevent the bullets ricocheting. A target is pinned to the prisoner's heart with the intention that shots be fired into the heart rather than the head and the individual will bleed out quickly. The shooters are picked from volunteer police officers. The inmate has two minutes to say any final words before five shooters line up behind a slot in the wall, 25 feet from the chair. The shots are fired from .30 caliber Winchester rifles until the prisoner is declared dead. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn-out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned. Though Utah's next execution is probably a few years away, Ray said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on. Ray didn't return messages seeking comment Monday. Opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah saying the bill makes the state 'look backward and backwoods.' Utah lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims. The last person executed by firing squad was Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. He was executed on the metal chair at the right side of this chamber in Utah State Prison.  Narrow rifle ports can be seen on the left . Utah is the only state in the past 40 years to carry out such a death sentence, with three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The last was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was put to death by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in an event that generated international interest and elicited condemnation from many. Gardner killed a bartender and later shot a lawyer to death and wounded a bailiff during a 1985 courthouse escape attempt. The bailiff's widow, VelDean Kirk, who witnessed Gardner's execution, said she supports the new law. 'I don't think it's barbaric,' she said. 'I think that's the best way to do it.' Gardner's brother recently has spoken out against the method. Randy Gardner of Salt Lake City said Monday that he doesn't condone his brother's actions, but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad. 'My god, we're the only ones that are shooting people in the heart,' he said. One person nearing a possible execution date is Ron Lafferty, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, who claimed God directed him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Lafferty has already requested the firing squad — an option available to him even before this new law was passed because he, like Gardner, was convicted prior to 2004, when lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad. The other Utah death row inmate who could be next up for execution, Doug Carter, has chosen lethal injection. Under this new law, Carter would get the firing squad if the state can't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before. The state doesn't currently have lethal injection drugs on hand.

"A vitriolic letter written by the future King Edward VIII in which he branded the French Canadians 'rotten' and 'the completest passengers' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later. The Prince of Wales - the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary - could not hide his resentment towards the French Canadians in the private letter he penned on a visit to Quebec. In the letter written a few months after World War One to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the British Empire. Resentment: The Prince of Wales, pictured in November 1919 during his tour of Canada, criticised the French Canadians in a private letter calling them 'shirkers in everything particularly in war' Contempt: The future King Edward VIII scoffed at the French Canadians during his royal tour (pictured here) Stinging: In the letters, Edward describes the French Canadians as 'mostly a rotten priest-ridden community' In the recently unearthed letter, he says: ''These bloody French Canadians. 'The whole thing is a very delicate, imperial and political question which I don't attempt to understand though I do know they are mostly a rotten priest-ridden community, who are the completest passengers and who won't do their bit in anything and of course the war!!' After catching a train for Toronto he wrote of how he was relieved to be leaving the French Canadians. He added: 'They really aren't worth all the trouble I've taken to be out of the way polite to them, as they are shirkers in everything particularly in war as they all voted against conscription.' The First World War divided Canada, with the French-speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the Germans. Later on in the letter to the married socialite, the Prince of Wales derided the attractiveness of the local women. He described one of his hostesses as 'pompous and interfering'. Detailing a formal dinner he had attended, he quipped: 'Few of the women are worth dancing with and far less are in any way attractive.' At another party at a yacht club, he complained how there were '100 very plain women' there. Disgust: Edward said the French Canadians 'really aren't worth all the trouble' as they are 'shirkers, particularly war as they all voted against conscription' - he is pictured here in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1919 . French Canadians are a major North American ethnic group and Canadian citizens derived from the descendants of colonists from France who arrived in New France (Canada) in the 17th and 18th centuries. When war was declared in 1914, Canada automatically entered as it was part of the British Empire. But by 1917 French Canadians only made up 21,000 out of 432,000 men, despite making up one third of the Canadian population. The French Canadians opposed conscription as they felt that they had no real loyalty to either Britain or France. The six-page letter was written by the future King to married mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward, years before he gave up the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Then 23, the socialite was married to Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair. The letter is due to be sold tomorrow by International Autograph Auctions (IAA) at Nottingham Racecourse. It is expected to fetch £1,200 when it goes under the hammer. Richard Davie, of IAA, said: 'The Prince of Wales was a very patriotic gentleman and was known for wearing his heart on his sleeve. 'He obviously would have attended lots of dinners and events in Canada and gave very polite and diplomatic speeches but this letter to someone he trusted very much reveals his real innermost thoughts. 'He still clearly felt troubled by the role played by the French Canadians in the Great War, feeling they shirked their responsibilities. 'I am quite sure he intended these thoughts to remain private and never expected them to become public at any time.' Edward abdicated in 1936 (pictured addressing the nation) so he could marry American Wallis Simpson . Edward was an army officer during the First World War. Although as heir to the throne he was prevented from fighting, he made a number of moral-boosting trips to the Western Front and was very popular with the troops. Edward was the Prince of Wales from 1911 until 1936 when he became King, a reign that only lasted 11 months when he abdicated so he could marry American  Wallis Simpson. The Prime Minster and many others opposed the union because Wallis had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband, so the King chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover. His younger brother George, who served in the Royal Navy during the war, succeeded Edward as King in 1936, the details of which are popularised in the film 'The King's Speech' starring Colin Firth.","Future King Edward VIII called French Canadians 'rotten' in private letter .

"It was only after Ronald Read's death last June that his talent for picking successful stocks became public knowledge when he left $6 million to his local library and hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont . A former gas station employee and janitor in Vermont who died last June aged 92 had secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million thanks to a hidden talent for picking successful stocks. Ronald Read's fortune only became public knowledge after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital. During his lifetime Read was known to friends and neighbors as a man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood. Read, who worked for almost 25 years at Haviland's service station in Brattleboro, was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap. His most expensive possession was a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000, which gave no hint of the size of his  fortune. 'If he could save a penny, he would,' Bridget Bokum, a senior associate at his local Wells Fargo Advisors office told WSJ. Bokum together with Claire Johns, the executor of Read's will, is currently going through a five-inch-thick stack of stock certificates to determine his exact worth. 'We all knew he was into the stock market, but not to this extent,' said Johns. The secret to Read's financial success was that a well as being a shrewd stock picker, he also displayed remarkable frugality and patience with his shares. At the time of his death Read owned at least 95 stocks, many of which he had held for decades. The secret to Read's success was that a well as being a good stock picker, he displayed remarkable frugality and patience with stocks including Procter & Gamble . He had invested across a variety of sectors, including railroads, utility companies, banks, health care, telecom and consumer products but had avoided technology stocks. When Read received dividend checks in the mail he plowed the money back into more shares, said Bokum. Among his longtime holdings were Procter & Gamble, J.P. Morgan Chase, General Electric and Dow Chemical. At the time of his death, Read also had large stakes in J.M. Smucker, CVS Health and Johnson & Johnson. His portfolio also included some notable failures including Lehman Brothers Holdings, which famously collapsed during the financial crisis in 2008. One of the keys for Read's success was that he was prepared to stick with his picks for long periods of time. In 1959 he bought 39 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric for about $2,380 and  they are now worth about $10,735. At the time of his death, he owned 578 shares in PG&E, worth just over $26,500. When Read died last year he also had large stakes in companies including Johnson & Johnson . Secret millionaire in their midst: Ronald Read, (left, in his trademark baseball cap), pictured eating Christmas Dinner at the American Legion in Vermont a few years before his death . Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer that the only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal. 'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.' Read relied on subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's for his investment knowledge, although he also made good use of his local library to which he has  bequeathed $1.2 million. He also donated $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and made a number of smaller bequests. 'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison. Gas station employee: Ronald  Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970 . This Google street view shows Ronald Read's modest home and that may even be him pictured in the right corner near his Toyota parked outside . Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney. In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970.","Ronald Read who died last June age 92 had secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million .

"The heckler who was kicked out of Bill Cosby's show at the Lyric in Baltimore on Friday has revealed why he stood up to the legendary comedian. About 15 minutes into Cosby's set, Michael M. Crook shouted: '38 women called you a rapist!'' Audience members told him to quiet down and Cosby urged the crowd to be calm, but Crook was eventually escorted from the venue by security. Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby's performance in Baltimore, Maryland, was filled with protesters and Michael Crook heckled him . Many people have been protesting Cosby's shows since the accusations surfaced (Denver protest pictured) The heckling happened on the same day two more women (seen above with Gloria Allred) made allegations . Before he got the boot, Crook added: 'Tell the one about how to get away with rape', the City Paper reported. It was not difficult for security to find Crook as most of the 2,500 seats in the venue were empty. Crook discussed why he did what he did: 'I stood up to Bill Cosby tonight because I believe the 38 women who have come forward so far to accuse him of raping them. 'I can't speak for those women, but I am determined to stand up with them and tell Mr Cosby that he cannot simply avoid answering for those crimes.' Before the show, over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the venue. Crook was not part of that protest effort. He added: 'I wanted [Cosby] to have to face, even if only for a moment, that reality before security escorted me out and allowed him to retreat to the comfort and embrace of audience willing to ignore those women.'

"Lib Dem attempts to distance themselves from deep Tory cuts descended into farce today when two thirds of Nick Clegg's MPs stayed away from the Commons debate on their rival Yellow Budget. In an unprecedented move, Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander used a statement from the government Despatch Box to spell out how he disagreed with Conservative plans for spending cuts. But despite the extraordinary stunt - which signals the death of the coalition - being central to Lib Dem hopes of survival at the next election, only 17 MPs, including Mr Alexander, bothered to turned up. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander used a statement from the government Despatch Box to spell out how he disagreed with Conservative plans for spending cuts . On the government frontbench, only Deputy PM Nick Clegg, Lib Dem chief whip Don Foster, Business Secretary Vince Cable and deputy Commons leader Tom Brake had turned up . Nick Clegg (circled) leaves the near-empty Commons as Labour's Chris Leslie (centre) responds to Mr Alexander (seated, sipping water). Behind Mr Leslie, an MP waves an ironic goodbye . Mr Alexander later posed with a specially-made yellow Budget box to promote his rival fiscal plan . Danny Alexander set out the alternative Lib Dem Budget, which includes: . Before Mr Alexander's statement even got underway, Commons Speaker John Bercow cast doubt on the exercise, insisting statements 'have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the Government'. The Lib Dem minister carried on regardless, with just a handful of backbenchers looking on. On the government frontbench, only Deputy PM Nick Clegg, Lib Dem chief whip Don Foster, Business Secretary Vince Cable and deputy Commons leader Tom Brake had turned up. After a slow start, a few more Lib Dems eventually filed in, taking the total to 17, less than a third of the 56 the party currently boasts. Asked why so few colleagues had found the time to support Mr Alexander, a party insider said organising Lib Dem MPs was like 'herding cats'. Mr Clegg himself got up and walked out while Mr Alexander was under attack from his Labour opponents. To much mockery from Labour, Mr Alexander ploughed on, claiming he was setting out Lib Dem plans for those 'left cold' by George Osborne's Budget. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie blasted: Don't you realise how two-faced you look? You [the Lib Dems] want to have your cake and eat it, to be in Government but not in Government. 'It's too late for this. The Liberal Democrats have backed the Tories all the way, working families have paid the price and now it is time for you to pay the ultimate price for your behaviour.' Despite confirming that the Budget was agreed by the Tories and the Lib Dems, Mr Alexander criticised the plans contained in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - 'the era of Cathy Come Home'. As he tried to set out his Lib Dem plan that 'borrows less than Labour' and 'cuts less than the Conservatives', he was met with a volley of heckling from Labour backbenchers. Shouts of 'this is an abuse of office' and 'this is ridiculous' could be heard as Opposition MPs and others waved the coalition Budget document. In a further sign of chaos, Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of Mr Alexander. Just 17 Lib Dem MPs were in the Commons to hear Mr Alexander's statement, with 40 choosing to stay awa . Undeterred, Mr Alexander detailed the Lib Dems' 'better economic plan for Britain'. He said: 'Yesterday the Chancellor set out the final coalition Budget of this parliament. 'The policy measures contained in the Budget document were all agreed between us. 'I secured key Liberal Democrat commitments, including a significant increase in the income tax personal allowance, support for mental health, tax measures to support motorists, scotch whisky and the oil and gas sector because together they make our society fairer and our economy stronger. 'Yet I know that millions of people watching yesterday's exchanges between the Chancellor and the Opposition leader were left wondering 'Isn't there another way to do this?'. 'Because, of course, people want a stronger economy based on a credible plan. But people also want a fairer society based on modern public services.' Mr Alexander was repeatedly heckled and mocked by Labour over his attempts to distance himself from the Tories who he has shared power with for five years . Mr Alexander said Tory spending plans would take government consumption back to the levels seen in 1964, adding: 'The era of Cathy Come Home is not my vision for the future of Britain' Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of Mr Alexander . Mr Alexander went on: 'So to all those people left cold by yesterday's exchanges, to all those asking themselves is there another way, today I say yes there is, there is a better way. 'Today I set out a better economic plan for Britain - a plan that is based on values of fairness as well as strength, a plan that delivers on our commitment to balance the books in a fair way. 'A plan that borrows less than Labour, cuts less than the Conservatives and enables our country to see light at the end of the tunnel, not a rollercoaster ride but a steady path back to prosperity. 'This sticks to the path that we have chosen in this Government, not lurching away from it by cutting too much or borrowing too much. 'The fiscal forecast published by the Chancellor yesterday would, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, return government consumption, the effective spending power of the state, back to the level last seen in 1964. 'But the era of Cathy Come Home is not my vision for the future of Britain.' Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie blasted: 'Don't you realise how two-faced you look? Mr Bercow had said he would be put in a difficult position if Mr Alexander used 'the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes' but he took a back seat for much of the speech. Before the statement, Mr Bercow said: 'The content of ministerial statements is by a longstanding practice not a matter for the chair, nor is my permission required for such a statement to be made. 'But these statements have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or a party capacity but on behalf of the Government. 'While some latitude is, of course, permitted, there does come a point at which using the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes would be unfair to the House and put the chair in a very difficult position.

"A slaughterhouse worker who stabbed his ex-girlfriend's male friend to death after wrongly believing the pair were dating has been jailed for 25 years after being convicted of murder. Jason Taylor, 21, shared an eight-month relationship with Jodie Emery, 26, but after the pair broke up he became jealous, often going to her house in Preston, Lancashire, to spy on her. Convinced she was seeing another man he sent the mother-of-two a text on September 22 last year which said: 'Last chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there'. He then went to Miss Emery's home and kicked in the front door. With her two young daughters asleep upstairs he began fighting with friend Adam Wilson, 25, who she said had been invited over for drinks. Jason Taylor, 21 (left), is facing life in jail today after he was found guilty of murdering Adam Wilson, 25, after becoming convinced he was dating his ex-girlfriend Jodie Emery, 26 (right) During the struggle he used a knife he had bough on a previous holiday with Miss Emery to fatally stab Mr Wilson in the thigh. During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor tried to claim that that there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson being in the house, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury took just an hour and a half to decide he was lying. Today he was handed down a life sentence and told he cannot apply for parole until at least 2040. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Taylor: 'The victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of Jody Emery. 'This was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance Adam Wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with Jody Emery was finished. 'People have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end. You were not prepared to accept that. Taylor kicked down Miss Emery's front door on September 22 last year, and began fighting with Mr WIlson (pictured), fatally stabbing him in the thigh . 'You persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance. 'You were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy. She was perfectly entitled to see other people, it was none of your business if she did so. 'You murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be. He had done no wrong.' The court earlier heard that Taylor, a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses, had been in an eight-month relationship with Miss Emery. The pair had shared a caravan holiday together in Scarborough, but after they returned home Miss Emery secretly terminated a pregnancy. When Taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split. Unable to accept the break-up Taylor began texting and calling Miss Emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together, and often went to her house to watch her, often coming up to look through the windows. Two days before the murder took place Taylor was at pub the Tardy Gate. When he spotted one of Miss Emery's former boyfriends he became angry, smashed a window and tried to punch the man. Louise Blackwell QC said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery saying: 'I miss you. Maybe in time you'll want to try again'. She asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying: 'Can I come for cuddles?' Miss Emery responded, 'you being weird then', to which he said: 'I'm not my head is just f..ked' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with Miss Emery. The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She texted back, 'on my own I keep telling you' at which point Taylor said: 'last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance'. Emery replied 'wtf' and tried to call him three times with no response. Miss Blackwell added: 'The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. 'Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. 'Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop. 'All three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room. Adam Wilson was on the bottom, Jodie had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to Adam Wilson. During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor (pictured right) had tried to claim there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson to be with Miss Emery, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury ruled otherwise . The court heard that after Miss Emery split from Taylor following an eight-month relationship he became jealous, constantly texting and calling her, and often going to her house (pictured) to spy on her . 'She did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being reigned down, the defendant then stood up. 'At that stage she saw he was armed with that knife, a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in Scarborough.' Taylor fled the scene and dumped the knife as Miss Emery rang for ambulance. Mr Wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm long and 7.5cm deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh. Doctors also found cuts on his back, buttocks and legs, and abrasions on the rest of his body that were consistent with a struggle. On the night of the killing Taylor text Miss Emery saying ''ast chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there' before kicking in her front door while her two young daughters were asleep upstairs . When Taylor was arrested he said: 'No you are not serious are you, you are joking, he is dead? He attacked me I have done nothing wrong'. Shortly afterward police recovered the black-handled and blood-stained knife. In a video interview Miss Emery said Wilson was 'just a friend' whom she had known for a couple of months. She said Taylor would turn up at her home and she she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages. She said: 'Jason had been constantly texting all the time. I made sure I was answering and replying to the phone calls. I didn't tell him that I was with anyone because I knew he would not like it.' In a statement Wilson's mother Diane said: 'Adam would have been frightened at time of his death. I'm so angry at the compete irrationality to understand how someone could do that to my son.'","Jason Taylor, 21, shared eight-month relationship with Jodie Emery, 26 .

"The documentary is presented by Ian Dunn (pictured) one of the founders of the reviled Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) BBC bosses have sparked outrage by broadcasting a historic film presented by a notorious child sex campaigner – and have refused requests to remove it from the internet. The documentary is presented by Ian Dunn, one of the founders of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It is one of 30 archive films on the BBC’s website telling the history of the gay rights movement. The 30-minute documentary – Glad To Be Gay? – portrays Dunn as a legitimate gay rights activist and makes no reference to his role in setting up the reviled group. Victims of child abuse described as ‘horrifying’ the decision to upload the film. When The Mail on Sunday contacted the BBC to point out the documentary was causing offence, the broadcaster refused to take it down – on the grounds that it is a ‘significant’ work on the history of gay rights. The documentary, first shown on the BBC in 1976, shows the lives of gay people at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland, and featured interviews with future Foreign Secretaries Robin Cook and Malcolm Rifkind. It was an episode of a public access TV series called Open Door, and the BBC website states it was made by the Scottish Minorities Group and credits Ian Dunn as a presenter. Dunn, who died in 1998, is shown describing the work of the group in Edinburgh, while Mr Cook and Mr Rifkind were interviewed about their opinions on gay rights. The footage includes Dunn calling for the age of consent to be lowered, stating: ‘We think a boy considered old enough to take responsibility of bringing up a family is surely old enough to make up his own mind.’ But there is no mention in either the original documentary or on the BBC website of Dunn’s role in campaigning for adults to be allowed to have sex with children. When MoS contacted the BBC (headquarters pictured) to point out the documentary was causing offence, the broadcaster refused to take it down – on the grounds that it is a ‘significant’ work on the history of gay rights . In October 1974, Dunn had co-founded PIE as an offshoot of SMG, and wrote that its goals were to campaign ‘for the legal and social acceptance of paedophilic love’. Last night representatives of victims of child abuse said the BBC’s decision was at odds with refusing to show repeats of Top Of The Pops featuring disgraced DJs Jimmy Savile and Dave Lee Travis. Catherine Allen, of sexual abuse victims’ charity One In Four, said: ‘This is horrifying and shows complete contempt for those who suffered at the hands of Ian Dunn and other members of PIE. ‘I believed the BBC had learned lessons from the Savile saga but they still aren’t taking sexual abuse seriously.’ Dr Jon Bird, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, called on the BBC to remove the film or amend it to make viewers aware of Dunn’s warped views. The BBC said: ‘This video – which doesn’t involve or discuss any children – was considered a significant programme on gay rights and has been online for many years.’","BBC bosses have sparked outrage by broadcasting documentary film .

"For what could be his last appearance at the Dispatch Box today as Prime Minister, David Cameron will have been coached for hours by his officials. But for his fateful ‘at home’ BBC interview, broadcast on Monday, in which he dropped the bombshell that he did not intend to run for a third term as PM, Cameron doesn’t seem to have bothered to do his homework properly at all. He had at least watched a recording, on the Downing Street TV, of Ed Miliband’s own domestic disaster last week with BBC deputy political editor James Landale, after which the Labour leader was mocked for having two kitchens. But Cameron, a former political apparatchik-turned-PR man, never bothered to rehearse questions that might come up. He may have assumed he would not walk into any bear traps – but he could not have been more wrong. Scroll down for video . During an ‘at home’ interview in Oxfordshire, which aired on Monday, David Cameron (pictured with the BBC's James Landale) dropped the bombshell that he did not intend to run for a third term as Prime Minister . Cameron (pictured above with his wife Samantha) spent an hour in the kitchen of his home in Witney, Oxfordshire with the BBC journalist and the TV crew. The Camerons prepared lunch while being interviewed . The interview, when it was fixed months ago, was due to be conducted with the BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson. But Landale stepped in, as he did with Miliband and Nick Clegg because Robinson, 51, is at home recovering from an operation to remove a tumour from his lung. It was clear on screen that Cameron felt instinctively at ease with Landale, a fellow Old Etonian. They didn’t know each other at school as Cameron was two years above Landale. But they are both from wealthy families. Landale was brought up in rural Worcestershire, while Cameron had a similar upbringing in Berkshire. And Landale went to university in Bristol, the same city where Samantha Cameron studied. The BBC programme, which was designed to show a softer, more homely side of Cameron, had been going to plan, with footage of the PM on the touchline at his son Arthur Elwen’s football match. Then there was a trip to the butcher’s in his Oxfordshire town, where he made a rather tortured joke about fellow Chipping Norton set member Jeremy Clarkson also being a customer. And then he allowed the cameras into his constituency home. The BBC, who had already spent 30 minutes with Cameron, were given an hour in the kitchen in Witney, where Cameron visibly relaxed. Perhaps if his spin machine had exerted ruthless control of events, as Alastair Campbell once did for Tony Blair, it could have been a different story. But so confident was Downing Street that the interview would go off without a hitch that Craig Oliver, the No 10 communications secretary – himself an ex-BBC man – didn’t even bother to make the trip to Oxfordshire. Cameron was accompanied instead by Michael Salter, the Downing Street broadcasting officer, who is a relatively junior adviser in his team. The agreement which was thrashed out with the BBC before the interview concentrated on dress code, of all things. Both men were to be in casual weekend attire with no ties. There were to be limited clips of the Prime Minister’s children, too, showing only the back of their heads. There was also an agreement to ensure there were no clips of the toys lying around the house. Samantha was also, as agreed with the BBC, a frequent presence in the kitchen, looking suitably fragrant and glamorous. Crucially Landale, who has been with the BBC for 12 years after a decade at The Times, was not asked for a list of questions he might ask, or even subject areas in advance of the interview. Samantha Cameron made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the 'right man' for PM . David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . Landale, whose gentle manner belies an acute political brain, knows that Cameron has form for putting his foot it in when he’s relaxed. Remember his unguarded comments in America about the Queen ‘purring’ down the telephone to him over the nationalists failing to win the Scottish referendum? Perhaps the BBC man sensed that the kitchen would be the most fertile place to ask tricky questions, while the PM was surrounded by his family. Yet the question over whether Cameron intended to serve a third term was hardly a bombshell: Cameron could have easily dismissed it. The fact that he answered it calmly and directly triggered suspicion in some quarters that it was agreed in advance. But Landale says he was taken aback by the response, so much so that he hoped the surprise didn’t show on his face. The meltdown that followed in Downing Street as the gravity of the political story became evident supports Landale’s version of events. In his BBC blog, Landale denies it was a set-up. ‘It was not something that a helpful Downing Street official had suggested I might ask – with a heavy hint I might get an interesting answer. It was just one of many speculative questions that political journalists like me ask in the hope that occasionally they might get an answer. And this time I did. Earlier this week, Cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in May's General Election. He has since insisted he is taking 'nothing for granted' and his focus is on beating 'Ed Miliband' ‘But by answering my question, he has potentially opened a Pandora’s Box. He has invited Westminster and the country to contemplate a time when he is no longer prime minister, a dangerous gamble to make so close to an election.’ Cameron’s supporters know that for some time he has been trying to squash speculation that if the Tories win, he will stand down as PM after the planned 2017 EU referendum. Now, his reply to Landale is naturally being portrayed by his political opponents as an arrogant assumption he will win the election. As the political fallout continues, Downing Street surely has only itself to blame. The film was completed at lunchtime on Saturday, giving Downing Street 48 hours to decide how to handle the story and try to control it to best advantage. Officials could have leaked it in advance to try to ensure a positive spin on the revelation. Or does the absence of any damage limitation strategy suggest that the PM got out exactly the message he wanted – even if he hadn’t worked out its explosive implications?","David Cameron said earlier this week that he would not bid for a third term .

"A mound of spaghetti sits in a bowl with a heaping of tomatoes. Exactly nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy perch rather inelegantly atop the pile. On the side tiny serving of mustard, some slices of gherkin and a wodge of waxed cheese. To wash it down is a cup of pink-strained tea. As last meals go, it's not the most glamorous of repasts. This is what Doomsday Prepper Kellene Bishop, a resident in Utah, US, will eat on the day the world ends. Texan Wayne Martin's last meal is a bowl of Campbell’s chicken and spaghetti soup and a side serving of gourmet cat food. He washes it down with a glass of his homemade white wine which he will use as barter in lieu of money once the apocalypse begins . Wilma Bryant from Missouri will feast on thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans. Ms Bryant lives with her daughter and the pair are both diabetic and dependent on insulin. Her meal is juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia . This stark photograph as well as six others were capured by Brooklyn-based photographer Henry Hargreaves. Mr Hargreaves, who is a self-confessed food obsessive explained: 'In the US alone there are over 3 million people preparing for the end of time, this sub-culture is known as Doomsday Preppers.' He is most famous for his No Seconds series, immortalising the Death Row choices of inmates. The photographer visited the preppers to discuss their menus with them before he created their last meals. 'I connected with some of them to discuss their Armageddon Menu's,' he said. 'They are designed around their religious beliefs, lifestyles, location, health and what they think will work on the heels of the disaster they predict.' He confesses that he expected the series to be more dramatic than the final results he captured, and admits that the preppers might be on to something. 'Initially I expected this to be a rather sensational series but as I spoke to some of the subjects I actually was surprised by the brilliance in their approach. 'They have been able to stand back and see the whole food system from afar and realize in any kind of disaster the food distribution chain is the first thing to break and they don't want to be left vulnerable, if and when it does.' Each photograph is accompanied by text which explains a little bit more about the individual Doomsday Prepper. Using the ingredients the preppers had stocked up on Mr Hargreaves concocted meals he envisioned they would be eating if our current social system collapses. A tumble of insects – crickets, meal worms and grasshoppers – is served with a measly shaving of Parmesan. On the side a salad of sprouting seeds. This Spartan offering is destined to be the last meal of John Major of Idaho, US . Doomsday Prepper Kellene Bishop's last meal: A mound of spaghetti with a spoonful of tomatoes, nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy. On the side tiny serving of mustard, some slices of gherkin and waxed cheese . Ms Bishop, whose meal opens the series, is referred to as a self-sufficiency and self-defence educator. A foodie with a vast pantry, her Mormon faith endorses prepping. She doesn't want the experience to change her diet and constantly rotates her food stored, which includes waxed cheese, pickled vegetables, vacuum sealed meats, freeze-dried foods and pasta. The next meal, of thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans is shown juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia. Mr Hargreaves created this dish for Wilma Bryant from Missouri, US. The diabetic mother who is insulin-dependent lives with her daughter who who suffers from the same condition. Their low-carb high protein diet is more out of necessity than choice as they have to avoid raising their blood sugar. The duo, who believe the world will end in a fury of tornadoes, keep live chickens to butcher and store their insulin in a nearby stream to keep cold so it will not turn bad as it only lasts six months. As well as the live chickens, their food stores include beans, nuts, soup and pickled goods. 'I created dishes that they will potentially be eating once the system breaks and they have become self sufficient. Through their choices of these foods I think their personal story comes to life,' he continued. The last meal of New York firefighter Jason Charles who has a huge store of ready-to-eat meals or MRE. He is also stocked up on water in a waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods . But some meals are not so elaborate. New York firefighter Jason Charles was an emergency responder in the 9/11 attacks and worries that air pollution will kill us all. His apartment in New York City can he sealed off like a bunker and he uses a Waterbob (emergency drinking water storage) as a bathtub. This prepper's last meal is one of the most basic in the series and consists of a ready-to-eat meal or MRE. The firefighters stocks are more MREs, his waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods. Pennsylvania City Council Candidate Josh Wander is an Orthodox Jew who admitted to Mr Hargreaves that due to his kosher diet his 'food choices are uninspiring.' He mainly stocks kosher MREs and his last meal consists of matzo crackers with rice and a food ration bar. In his accompanying text, Mr Wander states that the 'Torah states breaking kosher is acceptable if your life depends on it' and so he keeps a flock of rabbits in case times become desperate. His children are not allowed to name the rabbits as 'they are raised for dinner, not pets'. He believes that terrorist attacks will end the world. A tumble of insects – crickets, meal worms and grasshoppers – is served with a measly shaving of Parmesan. On the side a salad of sprouting seeds. This Spartan offering is destined to be the last meal of John Major of Idaho, US. He is concerned radioactive dirty bombs will be denoted around the US, ending all life. 'Soil is one of the best defences against radioactivity,' the accompanying text states. And so Mr Major buries a bank of over 1.5m sprouting seeds. He also forages and collects insects which form his primary intake of protein, and keep bees for honey and medicine. Rick Austin, a sustainable homesteader and author who lives in the Appalachian Mountains has a last meal of well-cooked steak served with buttered corn on the cob, and a salad .

Rick Austin, a sustainable homesteader and author who lives in the Appalachian Mountains in the US, told Mr Hargreaves that his 'health has greatly improved since adopting the prepping lifestyle.' 'Plant once, harvest for a lifetime,' is his motto and the prepper is totally self-sufficient from his land. A combination of fresh and preserved foods make up his stores and alongside fruit, vegetables, beef (from his own lifestock), milk and cheese, honey, nuts and smoked meats, he also keeps bees for honey and medicine, alongside. His last meal is a well-cooked steak served with buttered corn on the cob, and a salad of leaves. The final photograph in the series is the only to feature any alcohol. Texan Wayne Martin stores all his canned goods in buckets of cat litter to increase the life expectancy of the products. He also keeps cat food – which he says can be consumed if needed - on reserve as they won't be stolen by those of us who are unprepared. The consultant engineer has homemade Wayne's World wine which he plans to use as barter in lieu of money. His meal, composed from his stored food, is a bowl of Campbell's chicken and spaghetti soup and a side serving of gourmet cat food.

"Waking up one morning, Leesa Barrell was alarmed to find that everything seemed very different. ‘It felt like somebody had put a brick wall up against my right side,’ she says. ‘I called out to my husband Lee and when he replied I could only hear his voice in my left ear.’ Leesa Barrell (pictured) woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear . Initially, Leesa, 45, who lives in Norwich with Lee, 49, a school caretaker, and their son Ashlee, 12, thought the problem was probably caused by a wax blockage and would correct itself within a few days. But when it didn’t, a week after her first symptoms she went to see her GP and was referred to an ear, nose and throat consultant. The specialist dropped a bombshell — she had lost the hearing in her right ear, possibly for good. ‘At that point I became very tearful. I was so worried my hearing would never return,’ she says. Leesa, a finance assistant, was even more overwhelmed when doctors could not explain why it had happened. Leesa is one of up to 6,000 adults a year estimated to develop idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, or unexplained hearing loss, that usually develops suddenly, or within three days, usually in one ear. Often, sudden hearing loss can be attributed to infections, certain medications, head injuries and meningitis, because these can all affect the inner ear. But in some cases, such as Leesa’s, there is no clear explanation. The hearing organ, the cochlea, is found deep in the inner ear. It is filled with fluid — when soundwaves enter it, the fluid moves and tiny hair cells then trigger signals to the auditory nerve, which passes the signals to the brain. These are recognised as sounds, allowing us to hear. Sensorineural hearing loss is down to problems in the inner ear or with the auditory nerve. The other type — conductive hearing loss — occurs when something has physically blocked transmissions of sound, such as wax. ‘Eighty-five per cent of the time no one ever knows why sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurs because we can’t get to the inner ear to examine it without risking damaging it, or damaging the brain,’ says John Phillips, the consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust who treated Leesa. The most popular theory is that it’s caused by a virus damaging the nerve in the inner ear. Another is that a blood clot blocks a blood vessel that leads to the inner ear. A benign tumour on an inner ear nerve may also cause sudden hearing loss — but this is rare. Whatever the cause, losing your hearing suddenly can be ‘very traumatic’ says Mr Phillips. ‘Hearing loss usually occurs in one ear so people get scared it will happen in the other ear, too. They often get balance problems because the inner ear contains the balance organ, the labyrinth, too. Leesa (pictured) initially assumed that the problem was caused by a wax blockage and that it would correct itself within a few days . ‘Losing balance function on one side can make someone feel disorientated before the brain eventually adapts.’ And the damage is often permanent. One year after sudden hearing loss, a third of patients don’t recover any hearing, a third recover fully and the remainder have some hearing loss. Waking up one morning having suddenly lost your hearing is considered a medical emergency and, if this happens, you should see a doctor that day, advises Mr Phillips. It may be hard for patients to distinguish a genuine emergency from the muffled hearing that comes with a cold, so see a GP if in doubt. Steroids are currently the only treatment option to help patients regain some hearing — they can improve the outcome, in some cases, if taken within two weeks and are thought to help by calming inflammation. They used to be given orally, but the latest thinking is to inject steroids directly into the eardrum. The number of people in Britain with hearing aids. ‘If someone loses all their hearing, cochlear implants can cost up to £40,000, so prevention of permanent deafness is key,’ says Mr Phillips. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found there is ‘less recovery of hearing when treatment is delayed’. It’s also less likely to return in under-15s and over-65s, although it’s not known why, as well as in people who suffer from vertigo or who had poor hearing beforehand. Thankfully, Leesa’s hearing has partially returned — which is likely to be down to her seeking medical help quickly. When she saw Mr Phillips, a week after her symptoms appeared, he prescribed a three-week course of steroid tablets. ‘On the fifth day of the course I started to hear a muffled, squeaky noise through my right ear,’ she says. ‘I had a couple of side-effects — shakes and tiredness — from the drugs, but it was worth it. Without them I could have been deaf in that ear my whole life.’ A couple of weeks after finishing the course she regained 50 per cent of her hearing in her right ear, but nonetheless needed to have a hearing aid fitted. Leesa (pictured) was given a three week course of steroid tablets and she eventually regained 50 per cent of the hearing in her right ear although she still needed to have a hearing aid fitted . This has helped ‘a lot’, she says, though she admits: ‘I feel much too young for one.’ A nasty consequence of her hearing loss has been severe tinnitus (in which a phantom ringing or buzzing is heard) in her right ear. ‘It’s the worst part of the whole experience, like a constant waterfall in my ear.’ People with hearing loss often develop tinnitus, explains Mr Phillips. ‘Because the brain isn’t receiving sound from the ear it tries to strain to hear more and so picks up sounds that don’t have a genuine source.’ Hearing aids are usually the first option. People with severe or profound hearing loss, especially in both ears, may find hearing aids don’t help. One option is a cochlear implant — an electronic device that is surgically implanted that does the work of the damaged section of the ear. Helena Martins had one fitted in October 2013. The 41-year-old marketing manager, from South-West London, suddenly lost hearing in one ear in 2009 and the other in 2010, both overnight. This happened after she was diagnosed with Meniere’s disease, which is caused by pressure within the inner ear and causes vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss. ‘I was in complete panic when I woke up one day in 2010 and everything was awfully quiet. I saw my partner’s lips move, but I couldn’t hear any words coming out. I knew that my hearing had completely gone.’ People with Meniere’s often develop total hearing loss. Helena tried hearing aids, but they became ineffective after a few months and so a cochlear implant became her only option. ‘After it was turned on I could hear people’s voices again — I was so happy,’ she says. As for Leesa, she has learned to live with her hearing loss. ‘Without my husband and son’s support this would have been much worse,’ she says.

"Guilty: Colin Andrews, 59, has been jailed for a year . A 'Jekyll and Hyde' police chief who stalked and harassed two women after retiring from the force has been jailed for a year. Former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Andrews, 59, pursued two women despite their protests. He also abused his power to convince them that nobody would believe their words against his. The former officer who worked for Humberside Police for more than 30 years was said to have 'sociopathic tendencies' and was described as a 'controlling, manipulative bully'. After a six-week trial at Manchester Crown Court, he was convicted of witness intimidation, aggravated stalking, harassment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm but was cleared of rape and two other assault charges. The now-disgraced officer from Hessle, East Yorkshire, led a distinguished career solving high-profile murder cases and once tackled a gunman to the ground - but Andrew led a bullying life outside of the force, the court heard. After retiring in 2012, Andrews took up a civilian role as Humberside Police's criminal justice unit manager but struggled to deal with the loss of power resulting from his new position. Both female victims - who can't be named for legal reasons - were pestered by Andrews when they requested he leave them alone. One described how he sat outside her home and phoned her 89 times after bombarding her with over 100 text messages and unwanted presents. He was arrested on August 20 last year after assaulting a man who tried to intervene when he saw Andrews behaving aggressively towards a woman near a park. As Owen Phillips called 999, the former detective slapped him in the face and called him an 'unemployed k******d' even though he was heading to work. When Andrews became aware of the investigation against him, he threatened to expose aspects of one of the women's private life to the media if she went to the police. Prosecutor Owen Edwards read an impact statement from one of Andrews' harassment victims. He said: 'Within the same context of talking about her own struggles, she has always struggled to understand how he could behave in the way he did but continue to hold a senior position in the police and not show signs at work. 'Even now she struggles to have faith and trust in the police and criminal justice system as a result. She believes he has an issue with women and he has certain sociopathic tendencies.' Reading the second victim's impact statement, he said: 'He was motivated by the need to control and bully as he asserted his power and influence over her. 'She has lost sleep and still finds it difficult to come to terms with it. She just wants to live her life in peace, free from harassment, bullying, threats and intimidation.' Disgraced: When Andrews (pictured) became aware of the investigation against him, he threatened to expose aspects of one of the women's private life to the media if she went to the police . Mr Edwards added: 'The most obvious aggravating feature is that throughout all of this the defendant was a senior police officer or senior manager employed by the police and circumstances in which he used that position to add to the distress and concern caused to both complainants by his acts of harassment and stalking. 'In both cases he was to imply and expressly state that they would never be believed and that he had the power to affect an investigation taking place and he had knowledge which allowed him to ensure that if any complaints were made they would never be believed.' His defence team said that being imprisoned would 'break him' following the convictions from offences committed between 2012 and last year. In an earlier plea for mercy at Manchester Crown Court, Andrews said his personal difficulties stemmed from his childhood in an orphanage which left him 'needy' and 'attention-seeking'. In mitigation, Tania Griffiths QC called a psychiatrist to give evidence following an assessment of Andrews. Dr John Frazer said: 'He was finding it hard because when he was in the police force in a senior position, he got a lot of emotional support and help and he lost that and that was bereavement for him. The lack of structure suddenly had an effect on him.' Mrs Griffiths added: 'Financially, this case has ruined him. This man has saved many lives. Not everyone can say that. 'Needy': In an earlier plea for mercy at Manchester Crown Court, Andrews (pictured) said his personal difficulties stemmed from his childhood in an orphanage . 'He has put his own life on the line in order to do that. He has tackled an armed gunman. He didn't need to do that. There are givers and takers in life and Mr Andrews is absolutely a giver.' Sentencing, Mrs Justice Francis Patterson said that because of the offences she had no choice but to send Andrews to prison. She said: 'You knew there was an investigation proceeding and these texts were clear attempts by you to exert control to stop her co-operation with the ongoing police investigation. 'You knew perfectly well from your great experience as a police officer what was happening and you were desperate to stop it. 'You acted deliberately in a manner to intimidate her - a manner that was as arrogant as it was ill-judged. 'You thought not only that you were above the law but you could manipulate the course of justice to your own ends. 'In your favour, from a difficult beginning where you were rejected by your father and your mother died and he took you to an orphanage you made a real success of yourself. 'You have risen through the ranks to the highest echelons of the police force and made valuable contributions to society. 'Before these events you were a man of outstanding good character. You were at a time of life when you should have been enjoying the fruits of your endeavours and all of those endeavours you, and you alone, have thrown away.'","Former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Andrews imprisoned for one year .

"It's not rare for angry hotel guests to create a scene during their stay. But what is less common is when the aggravated customer - is a badger. The stressed-out animal caused a luxury Swedish hotel to lock down on Friday morning after it started running around inside. Angry: The badger is seen outside the entrance to the Radisson Blu hotel in Stockholm . Bizarre: The stand-off with hotel staff lasted 40 minutes and meant guests could not enter or leave . Officials said the 'ill-tempered' badger somehow got in to the Radisson Blu in Stockholm, and prevented guests and employees from going in or out for 40 minutes. The city's police were quickly alerted and prepared to deal with the standoff. They also called in a game warden to help deal with the situation, but the badger fled the scene before they arrived. A statement from the Swedish capital's police website read: 'A crazy or stressed-out badger is preventing the staff and clients at a major hotel from leaving their cars and from picking up their bags.' The Swedish newspaper DN stated the badger may have been angry after waking up early from hibernation. Staff told the publication that they called police as a last resort because it was 'impossible' to chase the creature away. It is also suggested that the animal could have been looking for some food.

"Husbands who refuse to pay the divorce settlements they owe their ex-wives should be banned from driving, travelling abroad and even given court-enforced curfews, Government legal advisers said yesterday. Specially-appointed judges should also have the power to order banks and HM Revenue and Customs to tell the courts how much money reluctant ex-husbands really earn, they recommended. Curfews on men who won't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day – and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags. Driving bans could last as long as a year. Around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in England and Wales every year, and they feature in three out of four divorce cases . The sweeping sanctions were put forward by the Law Commission, a body led by an Appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms. In a paper yesterday it said that it was time 'to bring pressure to bear on those who refuse to meet their obligations under a family financial order.' It added that making husbands pay would save the state many millions of pounds in welfare payments. Single-parent families left behind after divorce often rely on benefits and other welfare services. Around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in England and Wales every year, and they feature in three out of four divorce cases. The orders set out what the wealthier former spouse or civil partner – most often the husband – must pay to support his former wife to meet her needs and maintain her living standards. The orders also regularly include support for children. But, the Commission said, husbands frequently fail to comply with the orders either because they can't pay or they won't pay. Making them pay is complicated, bewildering and expensive, and often efforts to do so do not work. The only punishment the courts can impose is prison – but sending a husband to jail for as long as six months requires criminal standards of proof that are hard to establish, the consultation paper said. The sweeping sanctions were put forward by the Law Commission, a body led by an Appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms (headquarters pictured) The Commission said the solution was to force men to pay by using 'sanctions that are designed to be coercive and not punitive – the threat of these sanctions ought to be enough in many cases to encourage compliance.' It called for a new power for courts to impose 'disqualification from foreign travel' orders which would stop an errant husband from taking a foreign holiday or going abroad on business for 12 months. Unpaid wives should also be able to apply for their former husband to be banned from driving, the Commission said. The paper said: 'It would not be used in a way that would unduly impact on the debtor's ability to earn a living as that would defeat the whole point of the order. However, we think that used appropriately, it could be an effective method of influencing 'won't pay' debtors.' Curfews, the document suggested, would keep an individual who failed to pay in one place specified by a court for between two and 12 hours a day. 'There would have to be arrangements for electronic tagging,' it said. To tell the difference between what the Commission termed 'can't pay' and 'won' t pay' debtors, the paper said the courts should be able to apply to HM Revenue and Customs for information about employment and earnings. Similar orders would force banks and building societies to give up information about accounts. Such powers are already on the statute book to make people pay court and tribunal compensation awards. But they have never been put into use. The information gathered could be passed on to wives who are owed money, the Commission said. 'On the one hand, this intrudes on the privacy of the debtor and offends the idea of the parties moving on and living separate lives, which is an aspiration of the law in this area,' it said. 'On the other hand, it may be the most effective use of the information and family law creditors are likely to already have some knowledge of the debtor's personal circumstances.' The paper also said that specially-trained judges should be appointed in every family court to make and supervise the enforcement procedures. Curfews on men who won't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day – and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags . The Law Commissioner who produced the paper, Professor Elizabeth Cooke, said: 'The law governing the enforcement of family financial orders is hard to understand and difficult to use. 'When the courts cannot enforce family financial orders, it can lead to real hardship for former partners and children and place a huge burden on the state. 'We need to understand whether existing mechanisms for enforcement are working as well as they might, what other powers the courts might use to tackle non-payment, and how we can find better solutions for couples when one partner is able to pay but refuses to do so.' Some family lawyers were doubtful that driving and travel bans and curfews would work. James Brown, a family lawyer with JMW solicitors, said: 'Were these measures to be adopted, this would demonstrate that the courts are not afraid to flex their muscles. 'However, it is worth remembering that even though this would be a robust initiative, these measures would still only be deterrents designed to intimidate but lacking redress. Clients pursuing outstanding sums don't really care whether their ex has to be in bed early, can't drive or travel abroad. What they really want is the prospect of financial relief and that is what is missing here.' The use of curfews and electronic tagging to discipline former husbands and wives was first proposed by Tony Blair's government a decade ago. The plan was to penalise thousands of mothers who refuse to let divorced or separated fathers see their children in defiance of court orders. But the idea was dropped amid fears of a backlash if many thousands of single mothers were tagged.","Legal advisers want tough punishments for husbands who refuse divorce .

"The Church of England yesterday published a prayer for the General Election that called on its congregations to vote for ‘policies that sustain the poor’. In a move likely to plunge its relations with Tory leaders to a new low, the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’. In the wake of controversial election advice put out by CofE bishops earlier this year that urged support for the European Union, the prayer also asked churchgoers to ‘work for unity and co-operation throughout the world’.the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’. The Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’ It was published in a ‘study guide’ to the ‘pastoral letter’ on the election produced by bishops in February. The letter was taken by Tories as a campaign against the market economy, consumerism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. The new study guide from the Church’s Mission and Public Affairs Division underlined the call for consideration of ‘relationships among the nations of Europe who share a long history moulded by the Christian faith’. It repeated demands for ‘a fresh debate’ on nuclear weapons, and said those who care about tackling debt should also care ‘about the burdens borne by the most vulnerable in society’. Two prayers were offered: in one worshippers were asked to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest and to support policies that sustain the poor, the vulnerable and the frightened people of this world’. A second prayer calls for protection ‘from the sins of despair and cynicism’ and ‘the idols of false utopias’. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It is truly bizarre that they are praying to sustain people in poverty. Surely the aim should be to support people to lift themselves out of poverty? Which is exactly what we have been doing through our welfare reforms: giving everyone who is able to work the skills and the opportunities to do so.’ Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘The Church of England needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the Labour Party, whose language this slightly mirrors.’ Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘The Church of England needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the Labour Party, whose language this slightly mirrors’","Church of England published a prayer for the General Election yesterday .

"Green electric-powered cars are much more dangerous to pedestrians than traditional vehicles with petrol engines, a charity report said yesterday. It found that walkers are 40 per cent more likely to be run over by a quiet hybrid or electric car than by one with a petrol or diesel engine. And as the number of green vehicles grows because of Government tax breaks for eco-friendly cars, the number of injuries they cause has been rising fast, it said. Scroll down for video . Cars with electric or hybrid engines, which are much quieter than regular petrol cars, are driving a huge rise in accidents among pedestrians who do not hear them coming . The report from the Guide Dogs charity found a 54 per cent increase in pedestrian injuries in accidents involving quiet cars between 2012 and 2013. The charity – which says that guide dog owners and their animals are particularly at risk from vehicles that they cannot hear coming – called for laws to make noise generating systems compulsory on all hybrids. Guide Dogs manager James White said: ‘Quiet vehicles put pedestrians at risk outside schools, in residential areas and in our towns and cities. 'The Government is spending hundreds of millions of pounds to increase the numbers of quiet cars on the roads, and while we support the development of environmentally friendly vehicles, more needs to be done to protect pedestrian safety.’ The call for legislation was backed with a survey carried out  by YouGov which found more than three quarters thought hybrids make the roads less safe for blind or partially-sighted pedestrians. Similar proportions thought quiet green cars are a threat to older people and to children. Electric cars and hybrids running under electric power move silently and are likely to surprise people on foot who expect to hear the approach of a vehicle. The visually impaired are among the worst affected by the switch to electric as guide dogs also struggle to identify the threat, with campaigners calling for noise generators to be made compulsory . Car builders and independent companies have been working on a range of artificial sound generators that would lessen the risk of accidents. Most involve speakers fixed to the car, which work in the direction the car is moving to reduce nuisance to people who are not in the way. Sounds promoted vary from a reproduction of the whine of an old electric motor through computerised squawks to a rumble reminiscent of a diesel or petrol combustion engine. EU rules say such generators must be fitted to quiet cars by 2021, but Guide Dogs said that before then there will be thousands more potentially dangerous green cars on the road. It said that car makers should ‘do the right thing and fit sound generating systems to quiet vehicles before it becomes compulsory.’ Legislation in Britain should also insist that noise-making equipment is not only fitted to a car but always switched on, Guide Dogs said. The charity’s campaign was supported by Paralympic sprinter Libby Clegg. Miss Clegg, who has only peripheral vision, said: ‘I rely on being able to hear cars to judge when it is safe to cross the road. ‘It is terrifying to cross when you are unable to hear quiet hybrid and electric vehicles. Ensuring all quiet vehicles have sound generating systems installed and switched on would ensure that millions of people, like me, who are living with sight loss, would be protected from the growing safety hazard.’","Was a 54 per cent jump in accidents involving the cars from 2012 to 2013 .

"'DIY king': Philip Dickens, pictured, admitted his company, Baumhaus, supplied an unsafe item . A furniture boss is facing jail after his company produced a cot that nearly caused the death of two young children. Philip Dickens admitted his company, Baumhaus, supplied an unsafe item at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire, today. The firm produced the Nutkin cot bed which was blamed for incidents where two children 'came very close to very serious harm or death,' the court heard. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, could now face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000. The site says the solid hardwood Nutkin cot, a modified version of which is still being sold, is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it 'transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed.' It says the cot is 'extremely versatile' and can be set to three different heights. In 2013, Baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot, explaining that parts of the bed, particularly the gaps at the top, had been identified as a potential trap-hazard. A notice published online by consumer watchdog Which? said there is a 'risk of children trapping their head and neck in the gaps at the top.' It added: 'A child's legs or arms could become trapped between the end slat of the drop-down side of some products sold.' The company, which produces a number of ranges of furniture, has since modified the design and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500. The company, which produces a number of ranges of furniture, has since modified the design of the cot and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500. Above, the three-drawer Nutkin cot . Appearing in court today on behalf of Baumhaus, Dickens was told he could face up to 12 months behind bars or a fine of up to £20,000 for the offences. Baumhaus recalled the cot bed in December 2013. At the time, consumer watchdog Which? released a notice detailing the risks presented by the bed, advising readers to stop using the cot immediately. The risks included: . Alex Greenwood, prosecuting the case on behalf of the Trading Standards Institute, told the court, sitting at Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that Baumhaus and its director had been neglectful. Mr Greenwood said: 'As a result, three individuals received that product and used it. In the case of two children they came very close to very serious harm and/or death. 'They placed it on the market and it was subsequently supplied and the incidents occurred.' Entering pleas on the company's behalf, Dickens pleaded guilty to two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. Dickens was referred to personally in one of the charges. Mr Greenwood said: 'This is a small company. He is the director. Anything that has been done is attributable to his neglect.' Judge Karen Holt told Dickens they were 'serious' offences. She said: 'You know what happened to those two young children. All options ought to be considered.' Dickens, from Burnley, Lancashire, was released on bail to return for sentencing on April 13.","Philip Dickens admitted his company, Baumhaus, produced unsafe item .

"Mrs Doubtfire star Lisa Jakub has revealed the words of wisdom that the late actor Robin Williams imparted to her during their time together on the set of the 1993 hit movie. Lisa, 36, was just 14-years-old when she starred in the big screen comedy and went on to retire at age 22 - however she says that the advice and knowledge Robin shared with her during filming for the movie has stayed with her ever since. 'Robin would go off onto one of his brilliant tangents and I would stand there looking panicked,' she told Today.com. 'I learned pretty quickly that wasn't going to work and I needed to go with the flow and not just wait for my turn to talk. Scroll down for video . Throwback: Lisa Jakub, pictured in 1993 at the premiere of Mrs Doubtfire, was discovered in a farmer's market at age 4, but decided to leave acting behind as an adult, choosing to retire at the age of 22 . Family ties: During their time on set together Lisa (L) and her young co-stars formed a close bond with comedian Robin Williams, who played the title role of Mrs Doubtfire . 'Those things are helpful for an actor and in real life - you can assume you know exactly how it's always going to go, and you find that's not what always happens.' But even with his amazing ability to improvise, Lisa still says Robin had a quiet side. She admits that she was often asked if it was 'exhausting' to be around the comedy star all the time, because of his seemingly over-the-top personality, however she insists that, behind the scenes, he was actually 'a little shy'. 'As a massive introvert, I found that so reassuring, that it was OK to be a little quiet and just listen sometimes,' she added. Defining role: Many young people still see Mrs Doubtfire (pictured) as being one of Robin's most iconic performances . Growing up in Hollywood: The actress, pictured with her co-stars in 1993, also appeared in 1991 hit Rambling Rose with Robert Duvall, 1993's Matinee with John Goodman, and 1997's The Beautician and the Beast . Robin also showed her that not everyone who works in Hollywood was as self-centered as she thought. When  the actress was upset about being expelled from high school due to frequent absences during the filming of Mrs Doubtfire, Robin immediately jumped to her defense - and went out of his way in order to help her rectify the situation. Revealing that the star 'showed up at her trailer' with a letter he had written to the principal, Lisa explained that Robin was unlike so many other people she had met in the industry, adding that he always 'had her back' and made her feel as though she had his support. The former actress-turned-writer mentioned that same heart-warming incident in a personal blog post she penned shortly after the actor's death in August last year, noting how his actions had helped her to change her already-cynical view of Hollywood - and people working within the industry. Sorely missed: In a post written on her personal blog shortly after Robin's death in August 2014, Lisa paid tribute to the star's kind nature . All grown up: Lisa's first book, You Look Like That Girl, comes out June 15 . 'I was only 14, but I had already seen that I was in an industry that was full of back-stabbing. And it was entirely clear that Robin had my back,' she said in the blog post. Lisa added during her Today interview that Robin ensured she knew that he cared about her future, too, and warned her and her young castmates about making the same mistakes with drugs that he did. 'I remember thinking that was so impressive, that he was so honest and he was making himself so vulnerable and that was so brave to me, that he was able to talk to us about these things in an attempt to save us from making the same mistakes,' she explained. Since retiring from the acting industry almost 15 years ago, Lisa has gone on to pen a memoir, titled You Look Like That Girl, which is due out on June 15, about what life was like growing up in the spotlight.","Lisa Jakub, who played Lydia in the 1993 movie, says she is now 'at the place where I don't cry every time I talk about him'

"Several business owners in Austin were horrified this week to find large stickers bearing the message 'Exclusively for white people' affixed to their storefronts. As thousands partied and pitched new technologies at the SXSW festival, staff at an East Austin bakery were wondering who would want to announce to their customers 'Maximum of 5 colored customers/colored BOH staff accepted.' 'As a multiracial family with a multiracial staff, there's nothing funny about this … It's sick,' Olivia Guerra O'Neal, owner of Sugar Mama's Bakeshop, told KXAN.

"'Speak out': Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder - told a congressional committee in Washington that American must take the lead . European Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s', the World Jewish Congress leader has warned as he called on the U.S. to speak out against the rise of anti-Semitism across the continent. Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder -  told a congressional committee in Washington that America must take the lead against the surge in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe in order to 'defeat the new flame of Islamic terror'. He pointed to the strong line taken by European leaders in the wake of attacks like those seen in Paris, Toulouse and Copenhagen earlier this year, and urged the U.S. to follow in their footsteps. 'Once again, like the 1930s, European Jews live in fear,' said Lauder. 'The United States can and must speak loudly and clearly to condemn this evil for what it is - the radical Islamic hatred of Jews.' Mr Lauder, who has led the World Jewish Congress since 2007, pointed to the fact Jews make up just one per cent of France's population, yet were victim to half the country's racist attacks. He also noted that anti-Semitic attacks have not only doubled in France in the past year, but also in the UK and Austria. He stressed: 'To defeat this new flame of radical Islamic terror and survive... the United States must lead.' Mr Lauder also revealed a recent meeting with Jewish leaders in Rome had revealed they believed the Italian capital would have no Jewish community within 25 years. According to Forbes, Mr Lauder claimed they say their children and grandchildren will look for more welcoming countries in which to make their homes in in the future. 'There is a hatred growing throughout Europe that is causing Jews to wonder if they should leave. They are asking if there is a future for Jews on that continent,' he told the committee. Terror: The recent attacks in Paris (pictured), Toulouse and Copenhagen have left many in fear . Fear: Lauder says Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s' after incidents like the Copenhagen attack (pictured) Mr Lauder was joined by two other members of the WJC, which represents Jewish communities in 100 countries, who echoed his fears. Dan Asmussen, a Danish Jewish leader, noted Danish society 'itself is not and has never been anti-Semitic and many of the threats facing Danish Jewry - like in the rest of Europe - come from marginalized and radicalized Muslims, and these form a small minority of all Muslims in Denmark.' Roger Cukierman, a French Jewish leader, added: 'This is a war against Western modern civilization. And the Jews are seen by these Jihadists as a privileged target. 'We Jews are the sentinels at the forefront of this war. But we are not the only victims. 'Military forces, policemen and women, journalists were also targeted and killed.'","Ronald Lauder told congressional committee U.S. needs to take the lead .

"Walking dictionary: Li Yanzhi has memorised the meaning of every word from the English-Chinese dictionary . A Chinese mother has become a walking dictionary by memorising the English-Chinese Dictionary from cover to cover, reported the People’s Daily. Li Yanzhi, 51, from Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, is able to explain the meaning of every single word in the 2,458-page book, which consists of 220,000 entries. Ms Li, who divorced more than 20 years ago, undertook the mission in order to receive more translating work. This helps her support her 26-year-old son who suffers from autism and is not able to take care of himself. Ms Li is a lecturer in Financial English at Xian Transport University’s Economic and Banking School. Since August 2013, she has been reading the dictionary six hours every day from 3am. Within 19 days, she finished the memorisation for the first time. According to People’s Daily, to succeed in the College English Test Band 6, which most university students in China are required to pass, the candidates need to understand 6,000 words. In comparison, Ms Li's vocabulary is extraordinary. To help her memorising, Ms Li borrowed 465 English language magazines from the university library. 'My biggest dream is to enter The Brain to challenge myself,' said Ms Li. The Brain is a popular reality TV show in China which uses a series of games, such as memorisation, to test the contestants' brainpower. Ms Li said that son is autistic and cannot look after himself. Since her divorce more than 20 years ago, she and her son have been reliant on each other. As a single mother, Ms Li had to lock her son in the house whenever she went out for work. She said when she returned the house was always a complete mess. Learning English in China: Chinese students need to understand around 6,000 in order to pass College English Test Band 6. In comparison, Ms Li's vocabulary is extraordinary . But she said she never gave up. 'If I can fly I will fly, if I cant fly I will run, if I cannot run I will crawl,' she said.'No matter what you must move forward.' In order to improve their lives, Ms Li does translation work as a freelancer on top of her regular teaching. Through this, she has earned enough to buy herself a new apartment. Apart from English, Ms Li has learned to speak more than 10 different languages, including French, Russian, German, Japanese and Polish. She hopes that by memorising the 220,000 words from the dictionary, she can encourage students to learn English and increase their vocabulary. 'Lecturer Li really is a living English-Chinese Dictionary,' says Zhang Xinjie, one of her students.","The dictionary has 2,458 pages and 220,000 entries .

"Decorated: Andrew Seif was named Marine of the Year in 2013 and was awarded the Silver Star Medal at a ceremony last week . The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in dense fog during a training mission in Florida was carrying seven Marines from Special Operations Command forces based in North Carolina, and four National Guard soldiers from Louisiana. All are presumed dead. More bad weather Thursday prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from wreckage 25 feet deep. At least three Marines from Michigan could be among the 11 who were killed. While the military has not officially released any names, local sources and family members have told local news outlets about loved ones that were on the doomed copter. Marine Andrew Seif was one of the eleven who lost his life. He's credited with risking his life to save a wounded team member while both faced heavy enemy fire during a 2012 deployment to Afghanistan. Seif, 27, is a critical skills operator with 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command. He was named Marine of the Year in 2013 and was awarded the Silver Star Medal at a ceremony last week. Seif was recognized for aiding a wounded team member while coming under enemy fire in Afghanistan in 2012. The best: Sgt Andrew Seif, 27, was a critical skills operator with 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command. He is pictured right with his wife Dawn . Dreams dashed: Bawol was set to get married to Erika Lynn Hipple in October. Another Marine, Andrew Seif was to be his best man. He was also killed in the crash . Killed: Marcus Bawol, 27, lived in Warren, Michigan. His family confirmed he's among the dead . Marcus Bawol, of Warren was also on the helicopter. Bawol 'loved everything about the military,' said his sister, Brandy Peek. 'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be.' The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois. Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said. On Thursday, Warren Mayor Jim Fouts ordered flags in the city, just north of Detroit, flown at half-staff. Kerry Kemp was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday and loved horsing around with his nephews. 'He would wrestle with them. He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a 'proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,' she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean - he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Lost: Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted 'best smile' by his senior class . Marine Trevor Blaylock of Orion Township, Michigan also perished. Blaylock's friend, Chris Lagona, told Click on Detroit that he was the ultimate family man. He had a wife and two daughters, 'Once (Trevor) joined the Marines, that became his life, besides his wife and daughters. They were all he ever talked about. Nothing meant more to him than those three,' said Lagona. Hearts are heavy at the Lake Orion United Methodist Church where his family worshipped. 'He was very imaginative and adventuresome,' said Donna Waite, the Director of Children's Ministries at the church. 'I remember him riding his skateboard through the halls of the church.' Donna Waite said Blaylock talked about how he found meaning and pride in his service. 'It was a quiet pride, because being in that special unit he could not talk about what he was doing, so most people at the church did not know. We knew he was in a special ops unit, but that was it,' said Donna to WXYZ. Perished: 30-year-old Trevor Blaylock from Lake Orion, Michigan was also killed. He leaves behind a wife and two little girls . Prayers: Retired Army Lt. Col. Rachel Coggins takes part in a  candlelight memorial service honoring the victims of the helicopter crash in an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crash is held Wednesday evening . Remembering: Associated pastor Trey Rose holds up his hand as a candlelight memorial service honoring the victims of the crash. 11 members of the Louisiana National Guard were on a routine nighttime training mission . The National Guard soldiers, from Hammond, Louisiana, each did two tours in Iraq, and joined in humanitarian missions after Gulf Coast hurricanes and the BP oil spill, their commanders said. All the Marines were 'seasoned combat veterans' who did tours in Iraq before joining the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion in Afghanistan, where they were training local military and police, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. These 'unconventional warriors' train constantly to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory. Their practice Tuesday involved 'insertion and extraction missions,' using small boats and helicopters to move in and out of a target site. Debris: Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed and that the mission is now one of search and recover. Above, a door or window and wheel from the helicopter . Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. Washed up: Parts thought to be from the helicopter have continued to land on the beach, including this wheel . The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.","Sgt.

"HAVE I SAID TOO MUCH? by Carole White . (Century £20) Does Carole White’s name sound vaguely familiar? It is probably because you saw her in The Model Agency, Channel 4’s 2011 fly-on-the-wall documentary series about Premier, which she founded in 1981. Her colleagues’ affectionate nickname for her was ‘The Witch’. Fag in hand, with a voice like a corncrake, a vocabulary that would make a navvy blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a Prada handbag, she made Ab Fab’s Patsy and Edina look like maiden aunts. And her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any TV drama. Supermodel, Linda Evangelista (pictured), was one of the internationally renowned models on Premier's books in the Eighties . As a teenager in the Swinging Sixties, Carol had a brief career as a Lucie Clayton model, but gave it up because she felt self-conscious in front of the camera. At 19, she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend (she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys) and became pregnant with her daughter Simone. Having met a more suitable chap, she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency, Lucie Clayton. The marriage didn’t last, but the job did. Leaving her daughter in Kent with her parents (‘I didn’t get to see much of my poor little Simone at that time’), Carole flung herself into a bohemian world of models, rock stars and endless wild parties. Just before Christmas 1981, Bobtons, the King’s Road agency where she had been working, went bust, leaving ‘about 20 worry-faced models currently without representation’. Ten days later, with £10,000 loaned by her brothers, Carole signed up the Bobtons girls and Premier was born. A week after that, Eileen Ford, the tough doyennne of the New York modelling world, swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency, and suggested they do business. ‘It was like meeting Maggie Thatcher’, Carole recalls. ‘Her hair was honey-blonde and stiff and she was very straight-talking . . . We were officially on our way.’ The Eighties saw the rise of the supermodel, and, with Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell on its books, Premier was ‘really rocking’. In 1990, after Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz appeared together on the cover of British Vogue, Premier brokered the deal for the models to appear in George Michael’s ‘Freedom’ video, in which they lip-synched the lyrics. It wasn’t all glamour, though. ‘Those top girls could be difficult’, Carole recalls. ‘They liked to test people to see if they could magic up whatever crazy request they might have that day/hour/second . . . I saw it as a challenge.’ The list of ‘challenges’ posed by her supermodels ranged from the truly bizarre, including peremptory demands for sex toys, llama curry and an urgent supply of ‘special green candles from Tibet that were something to do with a witch doctor that had special energy’, to the mundane: persuading them to get out of bed, or trying to ensure they were no more than three hours late for their auditions. The more you read, the more nightmarish the task of dealing with these highly-strung freaks of beauty sounds. But even after so many years, Carole still seems captivated by the excitement of finding the next new face. ‘When they’re really special . . . they’re like thoroughbred horses,’ she writes. ‘They sort of quiver.’ She claims not to believe in regret: ‘But I’d say turning down Kate Moss was probably the closest I came to one.’ The future supermodel came to the Premier offices ‘and I stupidly said: “No, she’s too short for me,” and off she trotted . . . I know, shoot me now!’ She is unrepentant about the hedonistic excesses of the Nineties when, as she puts it, ‘the industry was full of nutters’, remarking cheerily that ‘it’s a very good job camera-phones weren’t around’. And her views on the size zero debate are trenchant: . ‘Why does modelling have such a bad rep? I think . . . it’s probably because there are so many overweight people in this country. It’s like we want to mollycoddle anyone who isn’t thin.’ Have I Said Too Much? isn’t an easy read — and not just because of Carole’s abrasive views and attention-deficit prose style, which reads as though she had dictated her book in 30-second bursts between phone calls. Still, in a world of elaborate artifice, there is something rather refreshing about someone who simply doesn’t care that her nickname is ‘The Witch’. You might not like her by the end of this book, but you can’t help admiring her — just a bit.","Carol White is the co-founder of Premier Model Management .

"Fire tore through a Brooklyn home early Saturday, killing seven siblings and leaving their mother, Gayle Sassoon, and their sister Tzipara in critical condition. The  boys were identified as Yakob, 5, Moshe, 8, Yeshua, 10, and David, 12 while the girls were Sarah, 6, Rivkah, 11, and Elian, 15. The father Gabi Sassoon was at a religious retreat in Manhattan when the fire ripped through his home. The funerals will be held later today before the children's bodies are flown to Jerusalem tonight, where they will be buried. Scroll down for video . A Brooklyn blaze killed seven siblings, ages 5 to 14, and critically injured their sister, 15, and mother . The blaze began in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on, likely to keep food warm during the Sabbath without using the oven, caught fire . The victims include four boys ages 5, 6, 7 and 11, and three girls ages 8, 12, and 15 . Authorities have been unable to reach the father to tell him about the fire as he is out of the city at a conference . Hatzolah volunteers, known for their incredibly quick response time, arrived on the scene and helped treat the mother and her daughter . 'This is an unbelievable tragedy,' said Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) as he visited the scene . Fire investigators believe the blaze was caused by a hot plate that was left on to keep food warm for the Sabbath. 'This is the largest tragedy by fire that the city has had in seven years,' New York Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said during a Saturday morning news conference. 'It’s a tragedy for this family, it’s a tragedy for this community, it’s a tragedy for the city.' What's more, a neighbor said the children could be heard screaming 'Mommy, mommy help me' as the blaze took over the home. Firefighters received a call at 12:23am about the blaze at a single-family home in Midwood, a section of Brooklyn known for its low crime and large Orthodox Jewish population. More than 100 firefighters responded and brought the blaze under control at around 1:30am. Nigro said the blaze started in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on caught fire. He added that the plate was likely kept on as it is a way to keep food warm during the Jewish Sabbath without using the oven. During the Sabbath, most Orthodox families will not light fires. He then added; 'There was no evidence of smoke detectors on either the first or the second floor that may have alerted this family to the fire.' A smoke detector was found in the home's basement. The mother and eldest sister jumped out windows at the front of the house as soon as they saw the flames, which raced up the stairs to the second floor where the entire family was asleep, while the other children were trapped in their rooms in the rear. The mother tried to get the children but the blaze was too fierce, and after suffering serious injuries realized her only choice was to jump out the window to find help. 'My kids are in there, get them out! Get them out,' she screamed according to neighbors who spoke with the New York Post.

'Firefighters forced their way in, extinguished fire on the first floor, which had started in the kitchen, then pushed upstairs and found the children in their bedrooms,' said Nigro. 'It’s difficult to find one child in a room during a search. To find a houseful of seven children that can’t be revived, I’m sure this will take a toll on our members for quite some time.' Neighbor Nate Weber said that he saw children being wheeled away on stretchers. 'I just turned away. I didn't even want to look,' he said. 'I heard a woman yelling: ""My kids are in there.

"The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is fighting back against claims that racism is stitched into the fabric of the fraternity - by mandating that all members of the organization undergo 'diversity training.' One of the University of Oklahoma students who took part in the infamous racist chant wrote that 'the song was taught to us,' passed down through an unknown number of generations at the Oklahoma chapter before finally being exposed. On Wednesday, the fraternity's executive director Blaine Ayers announced changes aimed at making SAE more inclusive, including diversity training and a review of every chapter's behavior. Pained: Sigma Alpha Epsilon executive director Blaine Ayers apologized and announced changes Wednesday aimed at making SAE more inclusive, including diversity training . 'The chant in the video is ugly. It is demoralizing and absolutely counter to the values of SAE,' Ayers said at a press conference in Chicago, describing his own disgust at the video. Though the fraternity is currently headquartered in Evanston, Illinois, it was founded at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, five years before the beginning of the Civil War. The University of Oklahoma expelled two members and suspended the fraternity last week, though the chapter has retained a lawyer, Stephen Jones, who defended Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh. Ayers laid out several steps the fraternity would take nationwide in order to 'ensure that this never happens again.' 'We are focused on trying to determine the root of this song or this chant, where it came from, that's our primary focus,' said Ayers, who stated he had never heard the chant. Diversity training program will be mandated for SAE members, and the fraternity has set up a hotline that will allow people to confidentially report inappropriate conduct, he added. Bad light: The recording showed a bus driving to an SAE function as two members led the chant, which mentioned lynching black people and declared there would 'never be a n***** in SAE' Bad boys: The Los Angeles Times reported that SAE's chapters have faced numerous disciplinary sanctions for their actions, including the drinking death of a pledge  in 2008 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo . In addition to new programs in the fraternity, Ayers said the fraternity will appoint a director and national advisory committee for diversity and inclusion. The fraternity will also conduct and investigation of all 237 of its chapters to identify bigoted behaviors and prepare a report, the executive director added. 3 percent of SAE members identify as African-American, and 20 percent as non-white, according to data the fraternity began collecting in 2013. That 20 percent 'is a number we would like to increase,' Ayers said, though the target number was not given. It remains to be seen whether minority students have been turned off SAE for good after the video of the racist chant surfaced. The second-ever black member of the Oklahoma chapter, William Bruce James II, expressed the heartbreak he felt after seeing the video. 'There will never be another black SAE,' he wrote in Quartz. 'I wish there had been one less.' 'Counting heads isn't going to tell you much about cultural change,' said Ben Reese, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. 'It strikes me as a response to crisis,' said Reese, who reviewed the SAE plan. 'I hope the crisis response will evolve into a thoughtful process that brings in a number of stakeholders on campus.' SAE has followed recent scandals with nationwide change in its chapters, becoming the first fraternity of its size to eliminate the pledging process, after reports surfaced of hazing. On Wednesday night, a call to the fraternity's hotline rang several times before returning a recording asking the caller to leave a message.","University of Oklahoma suspended Sigma Alpha Epsilon after a video of members singing about lynching surfaced online .
