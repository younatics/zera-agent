"Stoke, under the management of Tony Pulis, became the team everyone hated and everyone hated to play against. But if there is something worse than being hated, it is being ignored and that is where we are with Mark Hughes’ Stoke side now. While the physical nature of the team Pulis built brought incendiary headlines, critical comment and damning statistics – I was the captain of his team in the Championship from 2004-2007 – the progress made by Hughes has been overlooked. Stoke stars Mame Diouf, Jon Walters and Steven Nzonzi celebrate during the Potters' 2-0 win over Everton in the Barclays Premier League on Wednesday which lifted them to eighth in the table . Stoke have collected 23 points from a possible 33 since Boxing Day. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more, so why isn’t there more attention to their achievements? When Stoke beat Everton this week to rise to eighth place in the Barclays Premier League, the aftermath wasn’t about how well Stoke are doing but instead about the struggling Roberto Martinez and Everton. Stoke are the team who are above Garry Monk’s Swansea – recently championed after their defeat of Manchester United – West Ham, Newcastle and the rest of the bottom ten. Southampton have exceeded everyone’s expectations this season and receive weekly reviews as the nation’s romance story; neutrals want them to do well, to upset the normal order of the top four. But what is it about Stoke City Football Club, who are as high as they can probably ever wish to be, that generates such little media attention or positive write ups? Stoke, as a city, finds itself situated between the bigger and more glamorous cities of Manchester and Birmingham, but it has a lot to offer. Stoke's Michael Duberry tracks Wigan striker Nathan Ellington during a Championship match at the Britannia Stadium in November 2004, which was the defender's first season at the club . Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson tries to take evasive action as Duberry jumps across to make a tackle during Stoke's 3-1 home defeat by the Eagles in March 2006 . Duberry stands all smiles at the Britannia Stadium during his time as a Stoke player. It was a period in the defender's career where he admits he felt wanted by the club in his three-year spell which ended in 2007 . When I moved to Stoke from Leeds, the city didn’t have a Harvey Nichols or some of the swanky restaurants I left in Leeds, but it didn’t matter. The club gave me a home and a place. I felt wanted - I didn’t want anything else. I moved near the training ground in nearby Newcastle Under Lyme and was very happy. I had Trentham Gardens, Hanley Shopping centre and Alton Towers was on my doorstep too. Back when I was a Stoke player the club always seemed to have a power struggle going on upstairs. There was a lack of a clear vision as to who was in charge and the direction in which they wanted to take the club. Then Peter Coates took over in 2006 and the vision became clear. A Stoke boy and self-made millionaire, Mr Coates has the club at heart and never hides that love. He has made some wise appointments to manage the football team. Stoke were promoted to the Premier League under the management of Tony Pulis, with Duberry playing under the now West Brom boss while at the Potters in the Championship . Pulis arranges a training drill at Stoke's training ground in 2012. Duberry described the sessions as regimented and boring, but admits it made the team play better on match days . Since Mark Hughes has taken over, the club have only spent £10m in the transfer market, which is a tremendous job in the current climate of spending. Stoke have become quite successful in finding players to fit the mold, with Hughes and his staff working with head of recruitment Mark Cartwright. They don’t overspend and yet they have created and established a Premier League team. Finishing 12th,11th, 14th and 13th twice since coming into the Premier League, last season was their highest-ever. with a 9th place finish. But now they are one place higher and playing a more attractive passing style. During my first spell under Tony Pulis, we were very direct, often going back to front in less than two passes. Training was regimented, often just walking through team shape and then doing set pieces. I didn’t like it and found it boring but it made us better on match days and I loved the feeling of a clean sheet. Stoke attracted criticism for their direct style of play after being promoted to the Premier League in 2008, with teams forced into having to form defensive tactics against long Rory Delap throw ins . Mark Hughes gives advice to Stoke's Glenn Whelan during a league game against Liverpool, and Duberry claims the Potters have improved their style of play having spent little money under the Welshman . The next season under Johan Boskamp, everything was totally different. The Dutch manager had a pure footballing philosophy and every training session was 100 per cent football. I loved everything from the training, to the games and to the way he spoke football . When Pulis came back the following season, it reverted back to the old regime of pattern of play and set pieces in training. It was very frustrating . It’s a different club now with a different manager and a different footballing ethos. You never see Mark Hughes in the technical area signaling to his players to pass from back to front, but instead he is gesturing to pass the ball and it looks as if the players are enjoying the experience. I believe they deserve more credit and exposure. But if that doesn’t happen, then I’m sure the loud choruses of ‘Delilah’ from the fans will drown out any negative, stereotypical opinions outside.","Stoke City were hated by everyone under management of Tony Pulis .

"Nemanja Vidic's agent has quashed speculation that the defender will leave Inter Milan at the end of the season. The former Manchester United captain has been strongly linked with a return to England after joining the Nerazzurri as a free agent last summer. Asked if Vidic would stay at Inter, his agent Silvano Martina told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'I think he should, yes, because he has another two years left on his contract. In fact, I want to reveal something. Nemanja Vidic will stay at Inter Milan next season despite speculation linking him with a move back to England . Vidic's agent Silvano Martina said he made a specific decision to come to Milan and that had not changed . 'Last year he (Vidic) made a specific choice to come to Milan, even though Manchester United wanted to keep him and kept calling up to December.' The Serbian defender has played in 16 of Inter's 28 league games and Martina said he has a good rapport with coach Roberto Mancini, who took over from Walter Mazzari in November. Manchester United tried to convince Vidic to stay at Old Trafford before his Italy move, said Martina . 'Vidic is a great professional and never had problems with anyone, not Mancini or Inter,' he said. Vidic, 33, has a contract with Inter until June 2017. The 18-time league champions are struggling this season, however, and sit 10th in Serie A, in increasing danger on missing out on European football next season as they have suffered through a six-game winless run in all competitions. Vidic has a contract with Inter until 2017 and has not problem with manager Roberto Mancini, says his agent .","Nemanja Vidic will stay at Inter Milan this summer, according to his agent .

"A shocking video has emerged of a football supporter being savagely beaten by a rival fan after the League Cup final. The footage shows a row between Tottenham and Chelsea fans at Wembley Park tube station after the two teams met at the national stadium in London on Sunday. One the men, who appears to be a Tottenham fan then attacks another man, raining punches on him after pinning him against a wall. A shocking video has emerged of a football fan savaging a rival after supporters clashed at the weekend . The attack, in which a man was repeatedly punched in the face and chest, took place after Chelsea played Tottenham in the league cup final on Sunday . The row appears to start when a female Chelsea fan's scarf is thrown onto the railway track at the tube station by a rival supporter. She then challenges another fan and the argument develops into an ugly melee, with a number of men throwing punches at each other. As the group are broken up, one man emerges shouting 'f****** Chelsea c****' before hitting one man then repeatedly punching another to the face and chest. The man then holds his arms aloft in apparent celebration as fellow supporters on the opposite platform cheer his actions. Police then appear  and lead the man away, as other supporters sing chants. A Tottenham club spokesman said today: 'We are absolutely appalled by this video footage and will take the strongest possible action against any of our supporters who are identifiable including banning orders. We have no wish to be associated with any individual who behaves in this manner.' A spokesman for Chelsea said the club was  leaving the matter in the hands of the police. Although a Chelsea fan appears to be a victim in the incident filmed in the footage, it the latest incident of hooliganism to involve the London club's supporters in recent weeks. The incident happened after a Chelsea fan's scarf was thrown on the track at Wembley Park tube station . The woman then confronts a man before a scuffle ensues between Tottenham and Chelsea supporters . A man was filmed being led away by police in the footage, which was shot by a bystander on the station . Yesterday, another video emerged appearing to show Chelsea fans chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train. Filmed on the same day as the latest incident, it showed a man  heard to say on the London to Manchester train: 'Paris, Paris, Paris, that's the way we like it, a n***** on the door'. It was a reference to another incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game. A 40-year-old from Brighton has been arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and bailed in relation to the latest incident. A second man, aged 35, also from Brighton, was arrested on suspicion of common assault. He has also been bailed until Monday, 23 March. A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'The vast majority of football fans use trains and stations without problem. 'However, a mindless minority whose intention is to cause trouble make journeys unpleasant for law-abiding fans and other rail passengers and rail staff.' It comes just the day after another video emerged of Chelsea fans apparently chanting racist words on a train, which was filmed on the same day as the fighting incident . Images of Chelsea supporters refusing to allow a black man onto an underground train in Paris last month shocked the world . The spokesman added: 'We work closely with other police forces, the rail industry and those in football to identify offenders and bring them to justice. 'We support banning orders, where appropriate, that can prohibit trouble-makers from specific areas, including parts of the rail network, at certain times around matches. 'Our officers can, and do, intercept trains to remove anyone causing anti-social behaviour. 'Law-abiding supporters and other passengers and rail staff are our eyes and ears, and we will investigate any incidents reported to us. We particularly welcome any footage from mobile phones that can be sent to us, to help our investigations.' Chelsea won 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in north-west London on Sunday, with the goals scored by John Terry and Diego Costa.

"Those who have skied will have experienced the nerve-racking moment a ski lift temporarily stops mid-journey to dangle in the wind above jutting rocks below. But imagine if your lift hadn't stopped because someone was having momentary trouble disembarking at the other end. Imagine if it stopped because a tree had fallen on its cable. Well for a group of skiers enjoying the slopes on a windy day in Val Gardena, Italy that terrifying image came true. Videoed in the cabin suspended some distance above the ground below, the skiers huddle around as they wait to be rescued. A man, who appears to be attached to the top of the cabin via a harness, prises open the door from the outside before climbing inside himself. The video maker captures himself in the frame along with the other skiers waiting to be rescued from the ski lift . Attaching a woman to another harness, the rescuer sends her out of the door and watches over her, feeding the rope through his hands, as she abseils down to safety. A pair of rescuers at the bottom wait with hands outstretched for the woman as she descends. According to one of the people in the cabin, the group were required to wait an hour and a half before they were rescued. After making his way inside the cabin, the rescuer attaches a woman to a harness and begins lowering her safely to the ground . A Helicopter,  an ambulance and firefighters were all apparently called to the scene to help with the evacuation. Val Gardena is a valley in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, northern Italy. It is best known for its skiing, woodcarving and rock climbing and was the site of the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 1970.

"These are the amazing scenes when a woman opens up her front door to discover a baby owl standing on her porch. The young bird is not afraid of the woman and looks up towards her. The owl gently rocks from side to side during the minute-long video in an undetermined location in the United States. In the video clip, the two women are clearly captivated by the sight of the owl. One gushes: 'I just can't believe it. I thought it was a puppy dog, bug it's got claws.' She adds: 'I have never been this close to an owl before', to which her equally excited friend replies: 'Me neither'. The baby owl, pictured, appeared on the porch of the house and stood on the mat for more than a minute .

"The age-old proverb states that slow and steady wins the race, and a tortoise proved that to be true once again when it beat a  rabbit which one would expect to come out on top. Filmed at the Paws and Claws Pet Store in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, the video presents the two competitors lined up against each other as a woman shouts ‘go’. Moving from their mark, the Russian tortoise named Herbert immediately gets its head down and begins walking in the correct direction. The animals line up alongside each other and it initially appears to be no contest for the quicker rabbit . The dwarf bunny named Sven on the other hand becomes instantly distracted and hops off to the right. Giving the rabbit a helping hand, a woman redirects it back onto the correct path and actually puts it into the lead. Checking out the tortoise, the rabbit begins sniffing at its shell and the surrounding women can be heard laughing. The rabbit gets distracted and heads off to the right as the tortoise surges forward into the lead . Undeterred by the tactics of its competitor, Herbert continues to storm forward and regains the lead as the rabbit once again tails off to the right. Momentarily retaking the lead after a number of hops, the rabbit appears to finally have the upper-hand. But after getting distracted once more, the tortoise regains its advantage. The distracted rabbit sniffs the tortoise and attempts to put it off its stride but Herbert is undeterred . Sven the rabbit is given a helping hand at the end of the race (left) but the tortoise is first to cross the line . Going in the wrong direction, the rabbit well and truly surrenders any hope it had of winning. And even with another helping hand from one of the women watching the race, the tortoise surges forward. The video concludes with the rabbit disappearing from the shot as the relenting tortoise reaches the door and the women cheer in excitement.","The Russian tortoise called Herbert makes an immediate run for success .

"A zoo in Australia claims it is home to the biggest and oldest common wombat in captivity. Patrick the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs (36kg) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs (15kg). At 30 years old Patrick has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat. Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, said: ‘We believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity. ‘To live that long is pretty good going. In the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years. ‘But you know, he has got a happy home, good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving.’ A resident at the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video. Peek-a-boo! When Patrick the wombat first features in the video he appears to be an average size . But once it is picked up by its handler, the sheer size of the mammal is striking. However, according to Ms Leonard, the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be. ‘Well he was 40kg in his heyday. Of course, as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now,' said Ms Leonard. According to Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, in its 'heyday' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg . Quite a handful! At 79lbs, Patrick is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs . Patrick has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the Ballarat Wildlife Park as – rather surprisingly – he couldn’t defend himself against other wombats in the wild. Hand-raised after being orphaned as a baby, the wombat is famous in the park for greeting visitors while being pushed around in a wheelbarrow – as seen in the video. With hundreds of thousands of fans, Patrick also has his own Facebook page and he was named the 3rd best 'city mascot' in the world back in 2014.

"A weasel proved that it is more of a handful than a mouse when it prevented its owner from playing on his computer. Recording the encounter at home, the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named Ozzy watches. After flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel’s attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker. The intrigued weasel comes over to its owner after he twiddles his thumb in the hope of getting its attention . Diving at his thumb, the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball. Before retreating, looking around and repeating the process – this time clinging on to the thumb. Spinning onto its back, Ozzy casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man’s hand once more. Seconds out, round one! The weasel feels out its opponent's thumb before springing into action . Retreating behind the computer’s speaker, the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough-and-tumble. Before momentarily choosing to ignore the thumb and come right up to the camera to stare down its lens curiously. After more of the same, Ozzy runs off behind the keyboard and the video maker is left twiddling his fingers. The cute and cuddly attacker rolls onto its back while enjoying some rough-and-tumble with its owner . According to the owner, the weasel is fully grown and always in the mood for fun and games. But, writing on his YouTube channel, he also noted that weasel’s should not be considered pets. He wrote: ‘They hate being locked up, they're not friendly when hungry. Don't get one. Seriously. Ozzy is a special case rescue baby. Cute, but deadly.’ Rolling onto its back, the weasel takes a break from fighting to look down the camera and bare its teeth . The least weasel, as Ozzy's type is known, is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, though it has been introduced elsewhere. Despite the mammal’s small size, it has the capability of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight. And a mouse (and a thumb) is clearly no match for it either. The adorable animal has become so popular on YouTube, its owner has even set up a Facebook page in honour of Ozzy The Weasel, complete with videos, pictures and updates. The weasel called Ozzy latches onto its owner's thumb and begins giving it a little nibble .","The weasel named Ozzy runs at the man's thumb and begins nibbling .

"It’s no secret that most young boys are fascinated by trains.

The young boy sits on his mother's lap and waits in anticipation for the oncoming train . As the train comes into view the mother waves at the cabin and the camera pans around to capture it. Tooting the horn, the father can be seen waving from the window of the train as it drives past pulling numerous carriages carrying freight. Showing the young boy again, the camera picks up his immediate reaction to spotting his father at the controls.

"Some  say that certain people can’t see the forest for the trees. But a skier in Kiroro, Japan proved that you can’t always see the trees for the ski slope either after one appeared to come out of nowhere and wipe him out on a mountain. Videoed skiing towards a slight lip in the piste, the skier gets a remarkable amount of air as he propels himself into a forward flip. But as quickly as the footage begins looking impressive, it begins looking painful as he ploughs straight into a tree upon landing. The failed stunt is repeated twice more in slow motion, which shows in greater detail the moment the man spots the tree and braces for impact. Crashing into it, the tree’s branches sway violently and its entire dusting of snow disappears into the atmosphere. The skier approaches a slight gradient in the slope before he jumps up into the air to attempt a foward flip . A close up shot of the man in the tree shows how tangled within it he is as one of his skis looks genuinely stuck. He looks relatively okay however considering the force in which he collides with it. The clip concludes with a doctor at the hospital utilising a rather ingenious app that translates his Japanese into English. Hurtling through the air the skier gains a surprising amount of height and initially appears to be pulling off an impressive flip . He asks the man: ‘Are you dizzy?’ to which he replies with a nod, circling his face with his hand as if to indicate where he is feeling pain. The doctor, now sitting in front of what seem to be X-rays of the man’s skull, then appears to say: ‘Three days’. Perhaps suggesting the amount of time the man should refrain from skiing for. The man realises his mistake while hurtling through the air and braces himself for the impact of the crash . While not an obvious place to ski, Japan has some 600 ski resorts and some impressive sites including Niseko, known for its international clientele. Japanese slopes are not as steep as some of the better known places to ski, but they are generally much cheaper to enjoy. And because of the lack of tourism to the skiing areas, they are sometimes occupied by only a handful of people. Watch out for that...

"A warrior beetle lived up to its name when it was recorded dispatching a devil scorpion with little effort. A man placed the two creatures into a container to show what happens they face off, warning viewers that the invertebrate would feed on its natural prey. After feeling out their environment, the combatants lock horns in battle to the death. The competitors begin by feeling out their environments before they approach each other and lock horns . Sensing its predator the scorpion turns and tries to make a run for it. But the beetle steamrolls forward and is undeterred by its competitor’s sting. It dives at the scorpion's tail and clamps on with its powerful pincers. After coming face-to-face with the beetle, the scorpion tries to get away but its competitor clamps down on its tail . The scorpion attempts to get away by running over the piece of wood but the beetle holds it in place with its huge pincers . Chasing the scorpion around the container, the beetle maintains its grip on the tail and hangs from it as its competitor attempts to make a getaway. Despite the scorpion turning and attempting to fend off the beetle on a number of occasions, the outcome is inevitable and eventually it starts to slow down. Releasing the tail – now bent and crooked – the beetle jumps on the scorpion’s right pincer before returning to the tail and chopping it in half. Dispatched: The beetle leaves the scene of the crime after chopping the scorpion in half with its pincers . According to the video's creator, warrior beetles, known scientifically as Pasimachus californicus, eat devil scorpions in the wild. Both are inhabitants of the Sonora Desert of the American Southwest, and the devil scorpion is considered a pest species in Arizona as it often enters homes and stings the occupants. Despite its nasty sting however, the beetle’s strong armour is impervious to it.","The one-sided battle took place in a plastic container .

Pacquiao must do without legendary trainer Roach until next week as the 54-year-old is preparing for Zou Shiming's first world title fight  against Amnat Ruenroeng in Macao on Saturday. But when he returns, Roach will shut down his gym to work on the game plan he has devised. 'I won't tell you what the game plan is because that will be very silent,' he told the South China Morning Post. 'The whole Wildcard Gym [in Los Angeles, where Pacquiao is training] will be shut down and we will work out Manny's best strategy and nobody will watch it.' Mayweather will work with his father and uncle and has already booked the services of former opponent DeMarcus Corley as a sparring partner, according to Fight Hype. Corley troubled Mayweather in their 2004 fight but was knocked down twice before losing a unanimous decision. Mayweather and Pacquiao had not met before they went to the same basketball match in Miami earlier this year. Having exchanged numbers, they later met in Pacquiao's hotel suite to thrash out the details but an official announcement was not made for several weeks.

"Manny Pacquiao's preparations for the biggest fight of his career against Floyd Mayweather Jnr have been disrupted by his opponent's manager/adviser, claims trainer Freddie Roach. Pacquiao took to Instagram on Thursday to post the latest video of him at work from his Los Angeles training camp, as his $300million bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas draws closer on May 2. However, Roach has accused Al Haymon - who works with Mayweather - as attempting to sabotage their sparring selections ahead of the fight. VIDEO Scroll down to see Manny Pacquiao training ahead of Floyd Mayweather bout . Manny Pacquiao uploaded an Instagram post on Thursday undergoing some shadow boxing . Pacquiao's welterweight unification bout against Floyd Mayweather is expected to total $300million . Al Haymon is an adviser, manager and/or promoter to many top boxers in the United States. The Cleveland-born Haymon initially made his fortune in music by promoting such acts as MC Hammer, Whitney Houston and The O’Jays before venturing into boxing. A business administration graduate, his biggest client is Floyd Mayweather Jnr - who he helped leave Top Rank promotions. As well as Mayweather his elite 150-fighter stable also includes Britain's Amir Khan, Deontay Wilder and Julio Cesar Chavez - a man Carl Froch is keen to fight. The 55-year-old claims that they have had several chosen sparring partners, who have a similar fighting style to Mayweather, decline their offer to train with their camp because Haymon's team have offered them more more money to stay at home - in attempt to derail their preparations. 'I'm hiring sparring partners, Al Haymon's people calls them up and offers more money for them not to come. [But] I'm not worried about those guys,' Roach told ABS-CBN News. 'We got four really good sparring partners for Manny for this fight, Mayweather look-alikes. 'We started our game plan five years ago but we changed it a little bit. Definitely there will be some adjustments. I'm confident that we'll win the fight and this will be the biggest fight night of all our lives. 'The guy is undefeated, he's a very good boxer and he's the most talented fighter we'll ever face. He's tricky also... he's intelligent as a fighter. I believe we need to fight the perfect fight.'

Roach (right) believes Haymon has paid fighters to stay at home - in a bid to derail Pacquiao's preparations . The eagerly-anticipated bout on May 2 pits Mayweather's WBA and WBC welterweight world titles against Pacquiao's WBO crown in a unification fight. The two camps have had an acrimonious relationship at times in the past and that appears to have continued following Roach's latest comments. Despite the apparent setbacks, Pacquiao looked in good shape judging by his most recent social media upload which demonstrated his hand-speed. The Philippine star's trait, combined with his punching-power, has proved a destructive combination that has yielded 57 wins from a 64-fight professional career - with 38 of those via knockout. And these skills were on show as he he engaged in some shadow boxing in the ring. Accompanied with the caption: 'Day 3 of my gym work out i feel slow but i'm not worried because i still have a lot of time. Thank you Lord for strengthening me day by day.

"Carl Frampton delivered big-time and now he hopes ITV will do the same, along with great British rival Scott Quigg and his pound-wise promoter Eddie Hearn. World championship boxing’s return to mainstream terrestrial television could hardly have been more dynamic than Frampton’s five-round demolition of Chris Avalos on another wild Saturday night of The Jackal in Belfast. As they count the ratings ITV are being challenged to bid against Sky Sports for this summer’s Battle of Britain against Quigg, which is expected to fill the Manchester Arena, London’s O2 or a mid-size football ground near you. Carl Frampton lands a powerful right hand on his way to stopping Chris Avalos in the fifth round . Frampton was joined by fellow world champion Scott Quigg (right) in the ring as they build towards a fight . Both Quigg and Frampton are confident they will finally meet in a super-bantamweight unification clash . Frampton and his folk-hero Svengali Barry McGuigan are willing to help make that happen by modifying their financial demands for a fight brought closer to fruition by Quigg’s watchful presence in the aptly named Odyssey Arena. Frampton is on a journey to potential greatness and his message to his rival from Bury as they posed for photographs in the ring was this: ‘Don’t be greedy and we can share an audience of millions.’ McGuigan, whose own world championship exploits printed the road-map for his protegee’s rise to the IBF super-bantamweight title, understands the long-term benefits of the exposure which galvanised viewers on the UK mainland and around the world as Frampton put on a performance against Avalos which smacked of greatness in the making. McGuigan said: ‘Although I believe Carl will beat him, Quigg is also a very good fighter and a nice lad. If we can put this on free-to-air TV we will bring another Benn-Eubank bonanza to British boxing. ‘We are prepared to be reasonable to make this happen and I hope Scott and his promoter Eddie Hearn will see the long-term value of doing that rather than us taking this fight to pay-per-view. Frampton is prepared to smooth that process by leaving the cauldron of his Jackal’s den in his home city: ‘I’ll fight anywhere, against anybody. It’s no problem for me to meet Scott in England.’ McGuigan regards that as desirable: ‘It’s time for the Quigg fight and it’s time for Carl to go on show to the rest of Britain and then America.’ Frampton delivered an impressive performance as he made short work of his mandatory challenger . Frampton ships a rare shot as Avalos was overwhelmed in front of a sell-out crowd in Belfast . Frampton broke Avalos down until referee Howard Foster had no choice but to step in and stop the contest . Frampton can’t wait. Although his mentor wants to build solidly towards a potentially epic title-unifying clash with Guillermo Rigondeaux in the US, his fighter wants to meet the brilliant Cuban sooner rather than later. ‘I feel ready for anyone after what I’ve just done to Avalos,’ he says. ‘This man is the No 1 contender in most of the rankings and it felt easy for me in there.’ So quickly is Frampton becoming the complete package that he will be a knockout threat to Rigondeaux who, for all his genius, has been floored more frequently of late. Frampton has now developed the punching power to complement his speed, skills and intelligence in the ring and Avalos, for all his Mexican-American warrior pedigree, could not cope. Avalos came to fight but found himself on the wrong end of a war. Not even the head butt – one of many – with which he inflicted a cut beside Frampton’s right eye could deter the ensuing onslaught from the IBF champion. Frampton’s response was like-for-like, landing a hefty blow to the jaw as the referee told them to break. He was more than his challenger’s equal in the nitty-gritty and massively superior in every legal aspect of his ring-craft. Foster steps in to put Avalos out of his misery after the challenger had taken several unanswered flurries . Frampton is lifted off the ground by his trainer Shane McGuigan after his latest impressive performance . Frampton's manager Barry McGuigan shows his delight after his charge's scintillating showing . Referee Howard Foster – a fine referee in no way unnerved by criticism of his quick stoppage of George Groves in the first fight against Carl Froch – rightly intervened as Avalos stood concussed and defenceless on the ropes after one minute and 33 seconds of the fifth round. Despite the spats and the spitting from the Avalos camp at the weigh-in Frampton was calm, icy-cold even, in weighing up his man, then taking him apart with high-focus accuracy and laser intensity. When Avalos tried to turn it into a gutter brawl all he succeeded in doing was giving Frampton the opportunity to demonstrate how he has added punishing close-quarter in-fighting ability to his impressive repertoire. The Belfast boy has accepted that crowd-appeal has to be a factor in his ascent to stardom, saying: ‘I took some stick for one fight in which I thought I boxed really well to win virtually every round with hardly being hit. But I was accused of being boring so I know I have to be exciting.’ That he is now. There was nothing tedious about this performance of many talents. If McGuigan can keep him in front of the wider television audience Frampton will become a legend beyond the Irish shores all the sooner. And with boxing about to receive a massive modern boost from the fight of the century between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, he and Quigg can play their part in giving the hard old game a thoroughly modern makeover.

"Keith Thurman and Robert Guerrero gave a prime-time television audience something to watch Saturday night. Thurman won a piece of the welterweight title with a bruising decision win over Guerrero in the debut of a new boxing series on network television. And he did it with the kind of fight that had the crowd on its feet and gave a much needed boost to boxing in the first prime-time fights on NBC in 30 years. 'That's kind of performance that wins the hearts of fans even when you don't win the fight,' Guerrero said. 'The fans love that and that's what boxing is all about.' Keith Thurman (left) lands a left jab on Robert Guerrero during their WBA welterweight title bout . The fight was the highlight of a card that also included a win by Adrien Broner over John Molina in a super lightweight bout. But while fans booed that fight for lack of action, they cheered from the opening bell as Thurman took apart Guerrero in a fight that had a little bit of something for every fan - except a knockout. 'I know I was hurting him each and every round,' Thurman said. 'But he's a veteran and knew how to pace himself and stay a little out of my range.' Thurman knocked Guerrero down in the ninth round and won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. But Guerrero fought hard and wasn't afraid to trade punches even while bleeding from a cut over his left eye late in the bout. A bloodied Guerrero rises to his feet after he was knocked down by Thurman in the ninth round . Thurman is sent to the neutral corner by referee Kenny Bayless as Guerrero recovers on the canvas . Thurman landed 211 of 598 punches to 104 of 497 for Guerrero, but that didn't tell the whole story. Thurman's punches were much harder and seemed to shake Guerrero on several occasions, though they didn't deter him from pressing the fight even after being knocked down and nearly knocked out in the ninth round. 'I keep fighting my heart out and that's what the fans like about me,' Guerrero said . Thurman won every round on one ringside scorecard and 10 rounds on the other two, using thudding punches to keep Guerrero away. Still, he was never able to put him away and Guerrero came back in the 10th round to land some big punches of his own while Thurman was on the ropes. 'Robert Guerrero was a tremendous warrior,' Thurman said. 'He was there the whole way.' Thurman won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown . It was a signature win for Thurman, and not only because he was showcased on the top of the television card. He beat a fighter who fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2012, lasting all 12 rounds though dropping a lopsided decision. And he remained unbeaten in 25 fights with a performance that could put him in a big pay-per-view fight his next time out. The fight was the first of 20 cards scheduled this year for the Premier Boxing Champions series put together by manager Al Haymon and featuring his fighters. It was also the first of five scheduled Saturday prime-time bouts on NBC. And while it was created for television with an all-star cast of announcers that included Al Michaels, Marv Albert and Laila Ali, it also gave the crowd of 10,106 at the MGM Grand something different, too. Adrien Broner (right) hits John Molina with a right jab during their super lightweight bout in Las Vegas . Boxers were introduced on a stage at one end of the arena, and there were new high definition monitors above the ring to show the action. Unlike most boxing events, the fights also went off on time to accommodate television. In the first fight, Broner boxed his way to an easy win over Molina, using his left jab to pile up points. Despite winning every round on two of the three scorecards, though, Broner was booed by many in the crowd at the MGM Grand for not trying for a knockout in the super lightweight bout. Broner, trying to re-establish himself after a loss in 2012 to Marcos Maidana, used his superior speed to keep Molina off balance, rarely allowing him to land more than a single punch at a time. The former three-time champion was so far ahead in the final round that he did little but dance away from Molina, finally raising his hands in triumph with 10 seconds still left in the fight. Broner celebrates his victory after finishing his fight with a scorecard of 120-108, 120-108 and 118-110 . 'I know I lived up to the hype,' Broner said. 'He was swinging for the fences and I stayed dangerous. I felt like I beat all odds tonight.' Ringside punch stats reflected both Broner's dominance and the ineffectiveness of Molina's attack. Broner threw twice as many punches (502-249), and landed four times as many (219-54) in winning a decision that was never in doubt after the early rounds. Broner said he was not concerned about the boos, something commonplace early in his career. 'I knew walking into the arena 85 percent of the fans were against me,' he said. 'But I know I made some new fans around the world.' Broner, who improved to 30-1, was paid $1.2 million (£800,000), while Molina (27-6) earned $450,000 (£300,000).","Keith Thurman defeated Robert Guerrero to retain the WBA title .

"Former Crystal Palace and Norwich forward Leon McKenzie has exclusively spoken to Sportsmail ahead of his super-middleweight bout with Croatian Ivan Stupalo for the International Masters title. Undefeated McKenzie has been training at the East Dulwich gym owned by his father - the former British and European light-welterweight champion Clinton - for the biggest fight of his life so far, and the 36-year-old wants to win on March 14 for his dad. The man nicknamed Big McK discusses juggling work as a deliveryman, looking after five children and training every day as the former Barclays Premier League player likens himself to Rocky Balboa. Former footballer Leon McKenzie has been training at the East Dulwich gym owned by his father, Clinton . McKenzie has exclusively spoken to Sportsmail ahead of the biggest fight of his life so far on March 14 . Ex-Crystal Palace forward  McKenzie faces  Ivan Stupalo for the super-middleweight International Masters title . 'I've got five beautiful children to try and support the best I can. Working and fighting I'm no better than no other man that's doing the same as me,' McKenzie tells Sportsmail. 'Just because I've played Premier League football it does not mean that I'm too good to work. 'I work for DPD. I'm delivering parcels. It's challenging. I'm delivering 60-odd, 70 parcels a day. You're lifting boxes, you're in and out of the van. That's probably a little bit of training in itself. 'I sometimes jog in between because we're on a timer. It's kind of like a Rocky thing going on.' The best moment of McKenzie's football career came  in April 2005, scoring in a 2-0 win against a Manchester United team boasting Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. Almost 10 years on he is looking for a new accomplishment, and beating Stupalo in the 10-round fight would make him the mandatory for the Southern Area title. McKenzie is preparing for his title bout and the 36-year-old wants to win on March 14 for his father . McKenzie discusses juggling work as a deliveryman, looking after five children and training every day . That is the main objective on Saturday, and delivering parcels does not compare to how his father has been working him in the gym. 'In training dad pushes me to my max,' McKenzie continues. 'I'm used to dying in training and coming back. It will be the same principle in fights. When it gets hard I have to grit my teeth. 'I know where I've been before so it will be the same principle. I can die and I come back, I can die and I come back. We're going to win the fight, and I want to win it for my dad as well. 'After training I'll just have a little time by myself. Dad says that's normal when you just go within yourself, and have little flashbacks of life and everything else. 'Anything can happen. One punch changes everything.' McKenzie (right) pictured during his super-middleweight win against John Mason in June 2013 . 'This means everything to me because since a child I always knew I was going to be something. Obviously football took off and we always had another little dream in the background. I always used to love watching dad fight. 'I've started very carefully. For this to be happening, I'm 37 this year, it is a really big deal. All the years that we've been training, day in, day out. I've always been an athlete so this to me is massive. It opens up a lot of doors as well, boxing wise, to go on to bigger and better things, which is another thing. 'Winning this puts me in mandatory position for a Southern Area shot at some point, which is another big deal. 'I have to work. I've got five beautiful children to try and support the best I can. Working and fighting I'm no better than no other man that's doing the same as me.

"Sebastian Vettel, tears in his eyes, a smile wide on his face, waved the Ferrari flag high, his joy unconfined. Millions around the world shared his moment of triumph, be they Scuderia fans or not.

Vettel was right when he said he won the race ‘fair and square’, Ferrari having outpaced the previously impregnable Mercedes machines over 56 absorbing laps. Now a sport that has developed an impressive aptitude for navel-gazing, especially after the procession at Melbourne a fortnight earlier when a Mercedes one-two was expected to presage a period of total Silver Arrows dominance, can rest from its self-loathing criticism, at least for a while. The victors’ joy and the losers’ pain were equally piquant in the circumstances. For Vettel, it was the fulfilment of the dream of a lifetime. He had won in the shiny red car of Ferrari, the team he grew up worshipping. As a boy, he watched over the fence as Michael Schumacher drove around Fiorano, the test track at the team headquarters in Maranello, an industrial town in northern Italy as blandly functional as Detroit, Michigan. But it houses the spiritual legacy of Enzo Ferrari and all that is poetic about the world’s most famous car. ‘I remember when the gate opened in Maranello and it was like a dream coming true,’ said Vettel. ‘I am speechless.’ You would have needed a heart as hard as flint not to be swept along as he screamed over the team radio: ‘Thank you, thank you. Forza Ferrari.’ This was the 40th win of Vettel’s career, but his first for the Scuderia in only his second race for the team since leaving Red Bull. F1 stats provided by F1 Stat Blog .

It was ironic, of course, that Vettel should be the man to blow the apathy away, given how he and Red Bull were so good that they were boring during four, often pulverising years of success. Nine victories in succession in 2013 was Vettel’s most one-sided stretch. Before yesterday, Mercedes had won the previous eight races straddling this season and last. And the losers’ pain? Yes, it was pleasant for a change to see Mercedes panic, if only because it showed they are human. It provides hope for the rest. Hamilton was involved in tetchy radio exchanges with his engineers. So was Nico Rosberg. That is what pressure, especially when it is unaccustomed, can do to even brilliant minds. ‘You’ve put the wrong tyres on,’ exclaimed Hamilton after his third and final stop. The team then accidentally tuned him into a private exchange on the pit wall. They apologised for the mistake. Then, annoyed by the confusion, he said: ‘Once again I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing.’ In growing exasperation, he instructed them not to talk to him going through corners. ‘I almost just went off,’ he added. Finally, they told him he could catch Vettel in the dying laps. No chance. It was a crazy, false hope to express and Vettel won by 8.5sec. Rosberg, who is out of form, was third, a place ahead of Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, who fought from 11th on the grid and an early puncture. Hamilton was gracious in defeat and loyal to his team. The fact was that Ferrari, who were able to run a two-stop strategy, just had too much pace on the day. Hamilton powers his car during the race (left), and then looks on from the podium after finishing in second place (right) Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson, of Sweden, spins off the circuit as he crashes out of the race . The heat — 60 degrees Celsius on the track — played to their strengths in a way the colder Shanghai circuit a fortnight hence will probably not. The ghost of the day was Ross Brawn. He established the Mercedes super-team before being rashly pushed out at the end of 2013. The question of long-term importance is whether Mercedes can continue on a clear-headed path of success without him. That burden falls to Toto Wolff, the team principal, and Paddy Lowe, the technical director. Wolff said: ‘There is no panic, but we were in a new situation. We were not in control of things today. ‘We had new information which was different from what we had assessed over the weekend. ‘It was clear the winning streak was not going to go on forever. It is not the end of an era, but maybe the start of a new era, of a good battle, a battle we would like to take on. It’s about staying calm and trying to come back with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races.’ Brawn’s name also cropped up at Ferrari, where he masterminded the Schumacher years of unbroken glory. His old job there as technical director has been taken by the highly-rated, Cambridge-educated James Allison, a tall and slightly awkward-looking British engineer. Ferrari's Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen makes his way back to the pits with a blown out tyre . Toro Rosso driver Max Verstappen, the 17-year-old from the Netherlands, on his way to an impressive seventh-place finis . ‘Ross has about a billion championships under his belt as a technical director and I have precisely zero,’ he said. ‘Come and talk to me in a few years’ time when, if I am lucky, I hopefully might have half of what he has won. It would be premature to say anything different.’ Allison started to oversee the development of Vettel’s car in January, 2013. Since then two Ferrari team principals have been sacked. The third, Maurizio Arrivabene, belted out the Italian national anthem that greeted Vettel’s win. Allison, the subject of more interviews than in any other one-hour period of his life, summed up the mood of the day: ‘It’s good to win in anything but there is something absolutely fantastic about this team. At Ferrari, they work especially hard but we also have the history and tradition of the team bearing down on our shoulders. ‘Everywhere you go in the factory, there is the evidence of their massive success and anyone who works there when it is not successful is cowed by that. ‘But there is also the weight of expectation of an entire nation. Those things are pressures that we soak up and when the pressure is released by a day like this, boy, does that feel good.

"Formula One driver Giedo van der Garde's fight for a race seat for the 2015 season should move a step nearer to a conclusion on Wednesday. Van der Garde, who was axed as test driver by Sauber at the end of last season, claims he was promised a full-time race seat for the forthcoming campaign that begins in Australia this weekend. Sauber eventually hired Sweden's Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr, but Van der Garde has already seen an arbitration panel in Switzerland rule in his favour and is now looking for that decision to be enforced ahead of the season-opener. Giedo van Der Garde, pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for Sauber last season . Dutch driver  claims he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but Sauber reneged on deal . The Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, announced on Monday via its official Twitter account that a judgement in Van der Garde's case would be reserved until 10am Wednesday local time (11pm Tuesday night UK time). The Swiss tribunal recently ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny Van der Garde one of the two race seats, but Sauber are determined to fight their corner.

"Adorable footage of a puppy Husky talking back to its owner has appeared online and it’s making quite a stir. The clip features  baby Ramsey whining while attempting to speak, much to the delight of Texan owner Kayla Cagnola, who holds the puppy in her arms. Trying to perfect what appears to be either a howl or her skills in conversation, the dog looks down on the room and begins yapping while struggling to break free. Ramsey appears to be attempting to perfect her skills in conversation by howling  in a frenetic manner . Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say. According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food. There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years. Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free . Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves. While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative. As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting. The dog's owner Kayla Cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy Ramsey is trying to say . Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance. Whether these apply to Ramsey – who appears to just like making high-pitched noise – however remains to be seen. So far the original video has been viewed over three million times on YouTube.

"Rangers fans have demanded the club's remaining board members follow chairman David Somers out of the Ibrox exit. The club confirmed on Monday morning that Somers had resigned following 16 months turbulent months in charge. The 66-year-old was a deeply unpopular figure with fans but walked before he was pushed out of the club by Dave King at a general meeting this Friday. David Somers (left) resigned from Rangers on Monday and fans want Derek Llambias (right) to go too . He even sold his 61,000-share stake in the Light Blues just two hours after his departure was confirmed. Somers' exit leaves the Ibrox club with just two directors, chief executive Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach. Both can now expect to be swept out of the club when shareholders meet at Ibrox to vote. James Easdale resigned his directorship last week in the face of growing fan opposition and the signs are now clear that King is on the verge of grabbing control of the Glasgow giants. Now the Rangers Supporters Trust have told Llambias and Leach to accept defeat. In a statement containing derogatory comments about Somers, Leach and Llambias, the fans group said: 'We are delighted that David Somers has finally resigned as chairman of Rangers. We note that his parting comments are entirely in keeping with his behaviour during his time at the club. Somers, pictured here in the stands at Ibrox, was a deeply divisive figure amongst supporters . 'He will be remembered as one of the most inept and embarrassing chairmen of our wonderful sporting institution. 'Our focus now turns to the remaining directors. They should do the right thing, appoint the nominee directors and then follow Mr Somers out of the door. Mr Leach should have resigned when he made disparaging comments about major shareholders in a meeting with fans. He should be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting.' The statement also criticised the process which led to Llambias' appointment as chief executive and the board's threats of legal action against the outgoing representatives of the Rangers Fans Board. The statement described Llambias' position as 'untenable'. Somers sits on a number of company boards - including Zenith Bank, Europe Arab Bank and the Fujitsu Technologies International Pension Plan - and it is understood he did not want to risk his reputation by being forcibly removed from the Ibrox boardroom. Supporters want fiace director Barry Leach (second from the right) to resign as well . In his resignation statement, he said: 'I have resigned as chairman of Rangers International Football club plc. I have worked in the City of London, the world's greatest financial centre for decades and enjoyed considerable success. 'When I was approached about the chairmanship of Rangers, friends warned me that the world of football has different rules and codes of behaviour. I now know that is a gross understatement. 'I am a non-confrontational man and have always tried to bring harmony to boardrooms and with stakeholders. 'At the risk of antagonising my army of critics I would point out that Rangers managed to pay its bills and avoid going under during my tenure. 'These critics might not agree with how we achieved this. I look forward to alternative solutions from whoever is running the club in the future. 'Despite the personal attacks on me from various sources I genuinely wish the club the very best in the future and I am confident that with such a passionate and vociferous fan base they will be restored to their former glories.' The chartered accountant was appointed to his Light Blues role just weeks ahead of the club's Annual General Meeting in December 2013. But it was his performance in front of last year's shareholder summit which saw him heckled by furious shareholders. Dave King has won his battle for control of Rangers and wants to rid the club of Llambias and Barry Leach . Responding to the flak coming from the Ibrox stands, he said: 'When you are chairman of Rangers, you can do it your way.' Somers also took over executive duties for a short spell at the end of October after Graham Wallace quit as chief executive in protest at Mike Ashley's growing influence at the club. But he caused further outrage when a leaked email appeared to show him threatening to sink the Newcastle owner's planned loan deal if his place on the board was put in jeopardy by a rival £16million bid lodged by King. The South Africa-based former oldco director was rebuffed at that point but the stage has now been set for him to return to Glasgow and claim the chairmanship from Somers. He needs to win a majority vote on Friday to oust Ashley's boardroom appointments Llambias and Leach from the club, and if successful plans to replace them with former Blue Knight Paul Murray, ex-Glasgow brewery boss John Gilligan and himself. The Castlemilk-born millionaire already holds 14.57 per cent of the club's shares, while the Three Bears - Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - are in control of another combined 19.49 per cent. The RST has been collecting shares and proxies from minor shareholders - with former manager Walter Smith the latest to gift control of his stake - along with fellow fans group Rangers First but with Somers and Easdale both making a run for it, victory appears inevitable.

"Carl Froch is challenging Andre Ward to cross the Atlantic for the first time in his career and face him at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground. Ward earned recognition as the world’s supreme super-middleweight when he defeated Froch in the final of the Super Six tournament in Atlantic City. But the American has fought only twice in the three years and three months since that points victory and the WBA are now ordering a mega rematch between him and Froch with both their belts on the line. Carl Froch wants a fight with Andre Ward to take place at the home of Nottingham Forest . Froch was last in the ring when he defeated George Groves at Wembley last summer . Ward is that organisation’s ‘super’ champion, Froch the holder of their ‘regular’ world title. The Nottingham Cobra is daring the man who calls himself Son Of God to nerve himself for a first fight outside the Americas. ‘I fought him in the US,’ Froch says. ‘Now it’s only right that he comes over here. To be a truly great champion you have to box overseas. ‘Ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone. ‘I dare him. He will discover that I’m a very different animal here than I was that night on the Boardwalk.’ Froch would love the fight with Ward to take place at the City Ground where his team Forest play . Froch clearly hasn't been slacking off since last summer as this picture posted on Twitter shows . Ward (left) signed with Jay Z's Roc Nation Sports promotional company earlier this year . That evening of December 17, 2011 represented Ward’s only fight in more than six years outside his native California, where the overwhelming majority of his bouts have taken place. The closest he has come to risking his unbeaten record abroad has been in two relatively insignificant fights in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Froch suspects Ward believes he will relinquish the WBA belt, as he did his IBF world championship last month. But he warns: ‘I vacated the IBF title so as not to delay James DeGale from getting his chance any longer. But I’m not giving up the WBA title. No way.’ Froch is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr to go ahead with a fight in Las Vegas, which is one of the Cobra’s two remaining ambitions. Froch lost to Ward on points back in December 2011 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . That defeat for the Cobra was one of only two in his career as a professional . The other is to box at the ground of his beloved Forest, which was the potential venue for a clash with America’s veteran idol Bernard Hopkins. Froch accepts that the WBA mandatory ruling means Ward must now take the place of Hopkins in those talks. The WBA are giving them until the end of this month to negotiate terms, before putting the fight out to purse bids. Froch expects that to happen, which might necessitate a change of dates. Promoter Eddie Hearn, with whom he meets this week to discuss strategy for the negotiations, is provisionally holding the City Ground for May 30. That is the night of the FA Cup final and there would be a sizeable over-carry of TV viewers from Wembley on to pay-per-view with Sky. But Froch says: ‘That is already short notice for me and if we have to wait for purse bids there won’t be time for proper training camps for either of us. I would hope we can find another date in middle to late June.’ He has been pondering retirement since his brutal KO of George Groves at Wembley. That remains an option, even though he has kept working in the gym to maintain an impressive physique, as a recent picture posted on Twitter reveals. Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) but was forced out with an injury . Froch is also keen to fight ring legend Bernard Hopkins (left) who lost to Sergey Kovalev last year . ‘I will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat,’ says Froch. ‘And when you think about it, beating Ward in Nottingham would be a fantastic way to end my career.’ Highly regarded though Ward is, such a triumph is not beyond the realm of possibility. In fact, the timing would offer Froch his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record – as well as inflicting a first defeat on Ward. Embroiled in promotional disputes and plagued by injuries, Ward has fought only once in two-and-a-half years. And that was a full year and four months ago in a points victory over Edwin Rodriguez, who had failed to make the weight and mostly went through the motions of a non-title bout. Froch says: ‘The nine months since I knocked out George is the longest I’ve been out but Ward has to be really rusty. ‘Also, a lot went wrong for me in that Super Six final. I was looking forward to appearing in Madison Square Garden but it was moved to Atlantic City .Out on the shore in the cold of mid-winter. Disappointing. The date was pushed back so I had to hang around in America a lot longer than planned. It ended up a week before Christmas and my mind was on getting home to the family instead of the fight. ‘It’ll be very different in the English summer.’ And what more pleasant time could there be to re-float the boat?","Carl Froch has been ordered to face Andre Ward by the WBA .

"Former Italy forward Antonio Cassano, who ripped up his contract with Serie A's bottom club Parma in January, says he is desperately missing football. 'I feel sick without football,' the 32-year-old told the weekly Italian magazine 'Chi'. 'I miss it to death. 'I miss the atmosphere in the locker room, practice, messing with my team mates. But, most of all, I miss the adrenaline rush (of the matches).' Antonio Cassano (right) says he is desperately missing football after quitting Parma in January . The former AS Roma, Real Madrid, Sampdoria, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Bari player appeared in 19 games for Parma this season, scoring five goals. 'I'd still like to play but I see myself as a sporting director in the future, someone who deals directly with the players,' said Cassano. 'I know they couldn't trick me as I know all the tricks.' Cassano's indiscipline held him back and he failed to achieve the results most experts predicted after breaking on the scene as a 17-year-old by helping Bari defeat Inter with a brilliant goal in the closing minutes of a Serie A game. Cassano (left) describes playing alongside  Francesco Totti (right) as the most enjoyable time in his career . His best years were spent with Roma, the team he scored 18 goals for during season 2003-04. 'I never had as much fun playing football as with Francesco (Totti),' Cassano said of the Roma great. As was often the case during his playing days, constant conflict with management forced Roma to sell him to Real in 2009. 'I don't think there will be another Cassano in the future,' said the forward who won 39 caps for Italy, scoring 10 goals.

"You wait half a lifetime to see the Terminator, and then two come along at once. Standing on the top step of the podium was the indestructible human-looking phenomenon of legend, and next to him stood Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lewis Hamilton, of course, was the second terminator, the crushing victor of the Australian Grand Prix that gave him the perfect start in his attempt to become the first British driver to successfully defend the Formula One world championship. He has hung about with stars of the screen, fashion and music through a winter of a paparazzo’s dream, but here he was after 58 laps he had rendered as interesting as counting sheep, the supreme driver of the moment. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel who completed the podium . World champion Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Hamilton flew off the start-line and never looked back as he cruised to victory in the first race of the 2015 campaign .

Although his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg put in some fastest laps, Hamilton seemed to be holding back, doing all he needed with measure and control. But for his one and only pit stop, he led throughout after effectively winning the race with a dominant pole position on Saturday. Rosberg was second, with Sebastian Vettel third on his Ferrari debut. ‘Lewis made no mistakes,’ said Rosberg. ‘I wasn’t able to get close to him, let alone try to overtake.’ If there was any downside to Hamilton’s victory it was the possibility it raised of a one-sided season, or at least, if Rosberg can find form, an internal duel. For these Mercedes are so invulnerable they could take you to all four corners of the Earth and back without so much as a splutter. Vettel was 34 seconds behind Hamilton, who, on this track, put Stevenage on the map with a breathtaking first few corners of daring and precision in his debut Formula One race eight years ago. The TV cameras barely focused on the Mercedes because routine genius can be boring to behold. Pastor Maldonado crashed into the wall on the first lap of the race after he was clipped by the Sauber of Felipe Nasr . Vettel and  Kimi Raikkonen bang wheels on the run down to Turn 1. It causes a concertina effect which ends in Maldonado crashing out . Jenson Button finished last, but it was a sterling effort to get his McLaren to the finish line following the British team's miserable winter . Hamilton was clearly delighted with his win in Melbourne. He shared a joke with Arnold Schwarzenegger who conducted the interviews . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . Not only that but damaging to the sport, according to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. He is one of the most intelligent and garlanded figures in the sport but he might be considered something of a hostile witness for Formula One given his vested interest in the revival of his struggling team. But he deserves a hearing. ‘When we were winning — and we were never winning with an advantage that Mercedes have — double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was banned, engine mapping was changed mid-season,’ said Horner. ‘Anything was done to pull us back. That was not just us; it was done to McLaren and Williams in other years. Hamilton and Rosberg (right) shake hands after the race. The Briton out-classed his team-mate at the season-opening race . Hamilton holds alfot the winners' trophy after seeing off the challenge from Rosberg to claim his sixth victory in the last seven races . Schwarzenegger conducted the podium interview, which caught Hamilton off guard as he said: 'Hey man! Wow... I thought you were taller'. ‘Is it healthy to have a situation like this? Take nothing from Mercedes, they have done a super job. The problem is that the gap is so big that you end up with three-tier racing and that is not healthy for Formula One. ‘The FIA can see the power output that every engine is producing. They have the facts and they could quite easily come up with a way of a form of equalisation.’ Yes, but is the pursuit of, and reward for, perfection not Formula One’s raison d’etre? Any late risers among the insomniac petrol-heads watching the race live early in Sunday’s British morning would have missed the greatest excitements of the day: the pre-race rate of withdrawal. The 30-year-old Briton crosses the line to claim his first win of the season and start the season where he left off in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career . Kevin Magnussen, driving for the tardy McLaren team, did not even manage to make it on to the grid. His Honda-powered engine gave up on him soon after he left the garage, sending smoke into the warm air. Within seconds of that, Daniil Kvyat’s Red Bull gearbox packed in. This was a another blow for a team already angered by engine supplier Renault’s failure to improve on last year’s power unit. With Manor not even having taken part in qualifying, and Williams’ Valtteri Bottas having pulled out with a bad back, only 15 cars started the grand prix. Although Hamilton safely negotiated the opening lap, Kimi Raikkonen’s Ferrari caught Felipe Nasr’s Sauber, which then clipped Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. It clunked into the wall, ending the Venezuelan’s participation. We were down to 14 cars. Maldonado’s team-mate Romain Grosjean was then wheeled into the garage after suffering power failure. Make that 13. Max Verstappen, the history-making Toro Rosso man, was next to go. ‘Smoke in the car,’ said the 17-year-old, anxiously. We were down to 12 . Raikkonen’s afternoon ended when a second shoddy pit stop left him with a barely fitted left rear wheel. Now there were merely 11. Lo and behold, this meant Jenson Button was in contention for points having started at the very back of the grid. But he could do no more than finish 11th and last in a McLaren-Honda that remains in a lamentably early stage of development. But he believes, to borrow a phrase, they will be back.","Lewis Hamilton dominated the first race of the campaign to open up his championship defence with a win .

"Jurgen Klinsmann has lavished praise on Nicklas Bendtner after the Denmark striker netted his first international hat-trick in the 3-2 win over USA. Despite being on the receiving end of the former Arsenal striker's treble, the USA manager paid compliment to the Dane who scored in the 33rd, 84th and 90th minute to help Denmark claim victory in the friendly. 'When you score three goals in a game you deserve all the compliments in the world. Bendtner deserves them,' Klinsmann said. Nicklas Bendtner scored a hat-trick, including two in the last seven minutes, as Denmark beat USA 3-2 . Bendtner celebrates with his team-mates after firing the home side level during the first half . 'Sometimes it goes well and you score and gain confidence, and three goals is the right medicine for Bendtner. I wish him the best in the future.' Denmark boss Morten Olsen was also quick to acknowledge Bendtner's performance, even claiming the Dane could have grabbed five goals. 'Nicklas might have scored four or five goals. On the other hand, though, we can not demand that he should score all of his chances. 'It is clear to see that the training efforts have been good for Nicklas recently. I have spoken with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking and he has been very pleased with the effort Nicklas has put in. Jurgen Klinsmann watched his side fall to a 3-2 defeat in Denmark but was quick to praise Bendtner . Jozy Altidore is congratulated by his team-mates after giving the visitors the lead after 19 minutes . 'It has been difficult for him to get playing time because his competitor [Wolfsburg team-mate], Bas Dost, has scored every time he has hit the ball. Nicklas has kept his mouth shut and just kept on training.' Bendtner admitted that the hat-trick was a defining moment in his career. 'Of course it was very special for me to score hat-trick for the national team, and it is something I will never forget,' Bendtner said. On an evening when Tottenham's Christian Eriksen became the youngest Dane to win 50 international caps, Jozy Altidore, who could only muster a single goal in the English top flight during an 18-month spell at Sunderland, put the USA ahead after 19 minutes in Aarhus. But the Danes were soon level through Bendtner. Aron Johannsson restored the vicitors' lead before Bendtner scored twice in the final seven minutes to seal his hat-trick and earn victory for Olsen's side.","Nicklas Bendtner scored his first international hat-trick in win over USA .

"Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix . It seems incredible to think Sepang has been hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix since 1999, but it appears one of Herman Tilke's circuit designs has actually become part of the furniture on the F1 calendar. Sepang's sweeping nature can be a challenge to the drivers, but the biggest factor that can have an outcome on the race is the highly unpredictable weather which can leave plans and strategy in absolute ruins. In the past, race day always threw up a challenge whatever the conditions. If it wasn't the flash storm catching out the drivers, it was the hot and extremely humid sun which sapped the energy from the drivers. A later start time since 2009 has limited the factor played by the sun, but race day tends to be an exciting affair as Sportsmail looks back at the archive and memories from the Malaysian Grand Prix. For Albert Park memories I included a quiz half-way down the page but this week we will start with one. The Sepang Circuit hasn't changed its layout since the first race in 1999 but in which year was this overhead shot of the track taken? (Answer at the bottom of the page) 'Not only is Michael the best No 1 driver - he is also the best No 2.' Eddie Irvine (right) knew exactly who to thank after he won the first ever Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999. Michael Schumacher dominated the race after returning from a mid-season leg break, and allowed Irvine to win to aid his title bid. Mika Hakkinen (bottom left) finished third but would go on to win the 1999 world championship . Leading the pack under the safety car and heading into the final corner is Michael Schumacher ahead of Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello in 2000. Schumacher would go on to win the race with Barrichello finishing third behind the McLaren of David Coulthard . Schumacher had already been crowned world champion in 2000, but the double Ferrari podium allowed the team to clinch the constructors' championship. Here both drivers (with THAT red hair) celebrate with test driver Luca Badoer (right) and team boss Jean Todt (bottom right) The 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix was a joyous occasion for Ferrari, but it was the end of the road for Johnny Herbert who driving for Jaguar competed in his final race. The Brit's sad eyes appear to reflect that an 11-year career as an F1 driver was about to come to an end . Legend has it that the 2001 Minardi was so slow that Fernando Alonso needed a push up the hill from a track marshall to make it round the circuit during qualifying. Giancarlo Fisichella passes in his Benetton Renault which fared little better performance wise over the season . Race day in 2001 was hit by a flash storm, and clever tactics by Ferrari saw them change tyres at the right time before claiming a one-two with Schumacher (front) leading home Barrichello. It was the first year where the race took place in its now traditional early-season slot . Juan Pablo Montoya (complete with a Ferrari nosecone for company) runs his Williams off the circuit in 2002 after a collision with Michael Schumacher. Despite the Colombian not being at fault for the clash, it was he who would pick up a controversial drive-through penalty . A quick glance in his mirror at the first corner and Giancarlo Fisichella will be stunned to find his team-mate Takuma Sato climbing all over the back of his Jordan in 2002. This was just one lap after Schumacher and Montoya collided . Benefiting most from the Montoya-Schumacher incident was Ralf Schumacher who led home a Williams one-two in 2002. It proved a false dawn for the team as Ferrari went on to win 14 of the following 15 races during the campaign . Heinz-Harald Frentzen appears to be a little distracted as Miss India of 2001, Celina Jaitley, sits on the front tyre of his Sauber in 2003 . Antonio Pizzonia had clearly learned nothing from Takuma Sato's first-corner antics in 2002 when he took to the air a year later in his Jaguar. Unfortunately it was the Williams of Juan Pablo Montoya who was again the innocent victim as his rear wing takes the full force of the impact . Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello waves hello to the future of Formula One after McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen celebrates his first ever grand prix win in 2003. Joining the pair is Renault's Fernando Alonso (who started from pole position) and was also celebrating his first podium in the sport . Drink up, Jenson! The 2004 season was all about Michel Schumacher's dominance but a sub-plot from it was the emergence of Button who here celebrates his first Formula One podium with second-placed Montoya (left) and race winner Schumacher . Another Malaysian Grand Prix, and another Williams taking a battering. This time it is in the final corner heading into the pit-straight as Mark Webber collides with Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault - putting both out of the race - which was won by the Italian's team-mate, Fernando Alonso . Having been at fault the previous year for the crash with Webber, Fisichella (left) stormed back in 2006 to take his final career win. The Italian led home Alonso in a Renault one-two with the duo celebrating with team boss Flavio Briatore . Fernando Alonso will mark his McLaren return by making his second debut with the team this weekend, but he's already driven at Sepang for the outfit back in 2007. Here the Spaniard tackles a fast double right hander with the iconic start-finish stadium section in the background . It wasn't often that you found Alonso and Hamilton looking happy in the same picture during 2007 but here they are all smiles for McLaren following a one-two led home by the double world champion. Hamilton's second place finish came after a third on his debut in Melbourne . Kimi Raikkonen was world champion, but here it's Felipe Massa leading the Ferrari cars round the first corner of the 2008 grand prix. Raikkonen would win the race with his team-mate retiring, but it was the Brazilian who would lead Ferrari's title charge during the season . The track is dry for now but not for long as dark clouds loom over Sepang during the 2009 race. Here Nico Rosberg pilots his Williams around the first corner in front of Jarno Trulli's Toyota and the Brawn of Jenson Button . As a monsoon hit the track, Button took advantage to storm to the front ahead of Toyota's Timo Glock (who would finish third). As conditions became too severe, the race was halted after just 31 laps with Button pronounced the winner and all drivers receiving half-points . Michael Schumacher retired after just nine laps with a wheel fault for Mercedes in 2010 and there appears to be no shortage of marshalls offering a lift back to the paddock for the seven-time world champion following his return to the sport after three seasons away . It's usually a one-finger salute from Sebastian Vettel after he wins a race, but he isn't celebrating second place here. The world champion has just recorded two straight wins at the start of 2011 in a season he would go on to dominate before claiming his second world title . All eyes were on Sergio Perez in 2012 after the Sauber driver narrowly missed out on a famous win having made a late error in trying to catch and pass Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton congratulates the Mexican on a fine drive to finish second. At the end of the season, it would be Perez replacing the Brit at the Woking outfit following Hamilton's departure to Mercedes . Well this isn't the happiest podium you will ever see. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton is sensing the tension in the air after race winner Sebastian Vettel (centre) controversially ignored team orders by passing team-mate Mark Webber during the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix . Vettel and Hamilton look on at Webber during the champagne 'celebration' as the furious Australian hit-out at his team-mate for ignoring the now infamous 'multi-21' order - a team call that indicated the Red Bull drivers held position with Webber in front of Vettel . It was easier for Hamilton to celebrate on the podium in 2014 as he stormed to his first victory of the season ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg . 1999: Eddie Irvine (Ferrari) 2000: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2001: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2002: Ralf Schumacher (Williams) 2003: Kimi Raikkonen (McLaren) 2004: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2005: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 2006: Giancarlo Fisichella (Renault) 2007: Fernando Alonso (McLaren) 2008: Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 2009: Jenson Button (Brawn) 2010: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2011: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2012: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 2013: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2014: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Bold indicates driver still active on Formula One grid .

"I do not have a problem with giving second chances to disgraced athletes. Redemption stories can provide some of the most uplifting moments in sport and in the past few years I have come to admire Dwain Chambers, a man who will always be known as a drugs cheat, for the way he responded to his downfall. Third chances are a little more difficult to wrestle with. Recidivism suggests a predilection for cheating the public and one’s fellow competitors that is harder to forgive and which makes it more troublesome to believe that the athlete has reformed. Sprinter Justin Gatlin signed a lucrative sponsorship contract with Nike this week . Gatlin has twice been convicted of using performance enhancing drugs . Gatlin's deal with Nike has been met with some unfavourable responses from key figures in athletics . What I really have a problem with, though, is rewarding an athlete who has cheated twice with a big, fat sponsorship deal. What I really have a problem with is somehow legitimising the taking of performance-enhancing drugs in sport by making a cheat look cool. That’s what Nike have done. That’s the message they have sent out by giving a new sportswear deal to twice-convicted drugs cheat Justin Gatlin in the build-up to this year’s World Championships in Beijing. Nike don’t do shame. They just do shock. But they should be ashamed of themselves for this. They should be ashamed of the message they are sending out at a time when athletics desperately needs its stance on PEDs to be unequivocal. Nike are cool. They make it their business to make their athletes appear cool, too. They turn them into people their youth-orientated customers want to emulate. And now they are going to do that with USA sprinter Gatlin who, in the absence of Usain Bolt, ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the world last year. Cheats do prosper after all then. Let’s remind ourselves about Gatlin. He was first banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs in 2001 after testing positive for amphetamines. Gatlin claimed he had been taking medication for Attention Deficit Disorder. His two-year ban was reduced. He won gold in the 100m at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Then, in 2006, he tested positive again. He never admitted guilt. His then coach, Trevor Graham, blamed a massage therapist for rubbing cream laced with testosterone into Gatlin’s buttocks without his knowledge. It was ‘the-dog-ate-my-homework’ stuff. Gatlin was banned for eight years this time, a punishment subsequently cut in half. Gatlin won gold in the 100m at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece . Gatlin is now 32 but despite his age, is posting some of the fastest times on his career . That should have been enough to put him out of the range of endorsement deals for the rest of his career. But it’s not enough for Nike, apparently, even though they did drop Gatlin after his second positive test. They seem unconcerned. They even seem a little surprised that anyone’s bothered. ‘Earlier in his career,’ Charlie Brooks, Nike’s vice president of communications for North America told Reuters, ‘Justin served the ban that was imposed on him and has been competing again for almost five years.’ Here’s another thing. Here’s the thing that Nike don’t say. Here’s the thing that makes what they are doing even more cynical, even more pathetic. Gatlin is 32 now, a little old for a sprinter, but for some reason, he is managing to run even faster than he was when he was taking performance-enhancing drugs in his prime. Nike still seem to think it’s worth making Gatlin one of the faces of their brand. They’re desperate, I suppose. Usain Bolt, the man seen as the saviour of athletics, runs with a Puma on his chest. Nike are taking a hell of a beating so they’re gambling on a two-times drug cheat to get them back in the game. Even Paula Radcliffe, a fellow Nike athlete, sounded appalled. ‘I am very disappointed to hear this news,’ wrote Radcliffe. ‘I don’t believe it truly reflects the core values of the Nike I am proud to represent, nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that I work with on a daily basis.’ Paula Radcliffe, who is also sponsored by Nike, revealed her dismay at the news of Gatlin's deal . Last year, Gatlin ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the absence of Usain Bolt . To talk about Nike’s integrity and ideals is rather generous. The deal with Gatlin reinforces the idea that Nike’s integrity begins and ends with making money. Their ideals? Please, don’t make me laugh. If Nike really had any ideals that extended beyond maximising market share, they would not have gone anywhere near Gatlin. It would have known that in the wake of the Russian doping scandal that afflicted athletics last year and added to the cumulative effect of so many previous scandals, the most powerful groups in the sport needed to take a strong stance. Nike have done the opposite of that. They have caved in to commercial pressure. They have bowed to greed. In the grim struggle against drugs in athletics, this is Nike’s contribution: Just Blew It. Ten days ago, rookie linebacker Chris Borland quit the San Francisco 49ers at the age of 24 and turned his back on a multi-million dollar contract. He had started thinking about leaving the NFL after getting his ‘bell rung’ and suffering another minor concussion. He did some research, read about the NFL veterans suffering from dementia, and decided it was time to get out. ‘I just honestly want to do what’s best for my health,’ Borland told ESPN. ‘From what I’ve researched and what I’ve experienced, I don’t think it’s worth the risk... I’m concerned that if you wait until you have symptoms, it’s too late.’ Chris Borland quit the San Francisco 49ers at the age of 24, believing it was best for his health . George North was knocked out for the third time in six weeks playing for Northampton on Friday . North (third right) lies motionless after being knocked out as Wales lost to England in the Six Nations . I thought about Borland yesterday morning when I read that George North had been knocked out again following a blow to the head during Northampton’s victory over Wasps on Friday. Six weeks ago, North appeared to be knocked out twice in the course of Wales’ Six Nations defeat to England at the Millennium Stadium. That’s some serious damage to his head in a very short space of time. I wonder if he knows Chris Borland’s story and if he ever thinks about getting out before it’s too late? Some of Lionel Messi’s most enthusiastic and dedicated followers have become so desperate to proclaim him the best there has ever been that they have started to claim triumphs for him where they do not exist. The little genius of Barcelona has won the Champions League twice but say that to some and they become disproportionately outraged by what they interpret as a vicious calumny. This kind of disproportionate outrage, of course, is the lingua franca of social media but it does not change my opinion that you are not entitled to say you have won the Champions League or the European Cup unless you played in the final. Lionel Messi has played in and won two Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011 for Barcelona . Messi (left) scored a header for Barcelona in the 2009 final against Manchester United . Messi won the competition with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 but missed the 2006 quarters, semis and final through injury. That means he has won it twice. His furious supporters claim that because he played in previous rounds, he is counted as a winner in 2006, too. Because we live in inclusive times, the Barcelona and UEFA websites back up that up. However, Roy Keane does not feel he deserved to be called a Champions League winner when he missed the final in 1999. I understand Paul Scholes feels the same. Gary Neville played in the final when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich that year but also appeared in a quarter-final the season United beat Chelsea in Moscow. Messi is not considered a three-time Champions League winner as he missed Barcelona's 2006 final . Messi (left) celebrates winning the Champions League in 2011 for Barcelona at Wembley . He travelled in the squad to Moscow but did not make the final 18. Neville does not consider that he has won the Champions League twice. Perhaps the final word should go to Messi. ‘I feel a champion of Spain much more than I feel a champion of Europe,’ he told Graham Hunter in his book, Barca, at the end of the 2005-06 season. Case close .","Sprinter Justin Gatlin signed a big sponsorship deal with Nike this week .

"The money keeps growing but the odds are shortening as the richest fight of all time looks set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier. Both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are impressing video-watchers and hand-picked visitors to their gyms in Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively with their dedication and work rate. But a dramatic improvement in the speed and power of the PacMan’s sparring and pad-hitting in the ring have caught the eye of the so-called ‘smart money’ gamblers. Floyd Mayweather's fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier . Pacquiao, who was a 3/1 shot when betting opened, is now down to 2/1 at best. Mayweather, a red-hot odds-on favourite at 2/7 at the start has cooled to 2/3. Some Vegas casinos are predicting what they call a ‘pick ‘em’ even money fight come the big night on May 2. Our best tip at the moment: If you fancy Mayweather get someone to place your bet in Manilla. If you want to back Pacquiao, try Vegas. An improvement in Pacquiao's sparring in the ring has seen 'smart money' gamblers backing him . Carl Froch – who was disgracefully accused of running scared of James DeGale – has added the most feared pound-for-pound puncher in the world to his list of potential opponents. Gennady Golovkin, the killer Kazakh who knocks out opponents for fun, is in the Cobra’s line of fire if a fight cannot be made with Andre Ward at Nottingham Forest's football ground or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas . Carl Froch has added Gennady Golovkin, the killer Kazakh, to his list of potential opponents . Golovkin has made it clear he is willing to venture to Nottingham while also stepping up a division . And just in case DeGale’s loose-tongued advisors would like to know, if all goes well for both of them this summer Froch would be open to fighting his fellow Brit thereafter. DeGale meets Andre Dirrell in Chicago in May for the IBF title vacated by Froch, who beat the American in Nottingham. Froch says: ‘James has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat Dirrell it would become more interesting for me to face him. But not before a big name fight this summer.’ James DeGale fights Andre Dirrell - who Froch beat in Nottingham - for the IBF title in Chicago in May . While Amir Khan and Kell Brook are talking about fighting any and every name in the welterweight division – except each other as far as Khan is concerned - world super-middleweight champion Froch holds an additional option not yet open to these of his countrymen. Retirement. That possibility may be a little more tempting following the offer of a bit part ‘as a villain or a tough guy’ in a gangster movie. But he will not exercise the glove-hanging alternative – at 37 – if he can find ‘a fight which floats my boat.’ Kell Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan on Saturday, has spoken of fighting names in the welterweight division . Ward has come into that category after the WBA ordered their two super-middleweight belt holders to meet for a second time to decide which of them is the real champion. The American who calls himself Son of God became one of only two men to have beaten Froch when he won the final of the Super Six tournament – and the only one against whom the Cobra has not avenged a defeat. Having been outpointed in that fight in the US, Froch is challenging Ward to come to the City Ground in Nottingham, saying: ‘We’ve boxed once in America so it’s his turn to come over here, where he will find I’m a different animal.’ Ward, a notoriously reluctant traveller, is making baulking noises about crossing the Atlantic even as Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn says: ‘We are in negotiations with his people.’ Andre Ward, pictured left with Jay Z earlier this year, is a notoriously reluctant traveller . Chavez is committed to an interim fight next month, after which talks will resume for a fight in Las Vegas, the other venue which would realise a life-long ambition for Froch. If neither Ward nor Chavez take the bait, world middleweight champion Golovkin has made clear his willingness to venture into Nottingham while also stepping up a division to super-middle. Golovkin’s punching power has become fabled, while the eagerness of other top middleweights to duck him has become shameful. Our own Martin Murray bravely met the challenge in Monaco last month. He was stopped for the first time in his career, victim of the 29th KO inflicted by Golovkin in a perfect record of 32 wins. Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, pictured against Brian Vera, is committed to an interim fight next month . Golovkin defeated Martin Murray (left), victim of the Kazakh's 29th KO, to maintain his perfect win record . To which Froch has said to Hearn: ‘Everyone says he’s a big puncher. Do you think he hits hard enough to hurt me? Maybe we should find out.’ Froch is back in training and already only seven pounds over his 12-stone fighting weight. Hearn says: ‘Carl’s crazy like that. Almost everyone else avoids Golovkin like poison but it’s the kind of challenge which excites Carl. Wow what a tough fight and I’m glad it wouldn’t be me getting in the ring with him. But we’re still talking with Ward and Chavez. Froch is back in training and facing Golovkin would excite the 37-year-old, according to Eddie Hearn . ‘Carl would consider DeGale if he wins the world title but that’s not an easy fight for James.’ Hearn adds: ‘Of course Carl could retire now. He’s worked hard and ducked no-one to get into this position. So he’s earned every right to make whatever decision he wants.’ That he most certainly has.","Manny Pacquiao has caught the eye of 'smart money' gamblers... he was a 3/1 shot when betting opened, but now he is down to 2/1 .

"The need to anoint Lionel Messi the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious. Yes, Messi is a genius. Every time I see him play live, it is a privilege. I try to make sure the memories are burned into my consciousness. He is the kind of player who lifts the spirit with everything he does. He is a quite prodigious goalscorer, a wizard of a dribbler and a provider for others. And yes, he was mesmerising against Manchester City at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night. The way he nutmegged James Milner, the way he turned Bacary Sagna before Joe Hart saved from him at point-blank range, the caressed curling ball to Ivan Rakitic for the Barcelona winner. It was all magical. It is normal for people to want to believe that what they are witnessing has never been matched before. ‘Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home,’ said Arsene Wenger once, and now everybody believes there has never been a footballer as pretty as Messi. Lionel Messi showcases his magnificent ball control with an audacious nutmeg of James Milner . Messi renders Bacary Sagna to the status of an open-mouthed ball-watcher during another masterclass . Messi awaits the ball as he inspired the Catalan club to reach another Champions Leauge last eight . Messi forces his way past Aleksandar Kolarov and Fernandinho during Barcelona's cruise against City . What saddens me about the relentless championing of Messi, though, is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy. Any dissent is met with untrammelled scorn and dismissive disbelief. It is as though Messi has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege. As a football fan, I worship Messi, too, but I don’t think he’s the best there’s ever been. It’s too early for that. He’s only 27 but he has not yet achieved what many of the other greats of the game achieved, either for club or country. A graphic circulated on social media recently that showed all the records Messi had broken. La Liga top goal-scorer, Barcelona top goalscorer, Champions League top goalscorer. The list goes on. It’s breathtaking. But individual stats are not everything. Sport, ultimately, is about winning things. If you are a great individual player, there is a wider test of greatness in inspiring your team to win trophies. In the argument about football’s best ever, Messi is vulnerable here. Pele, for instance, scored 1,000 goals in his career. But the test of his greatness was that he won the World Cup three times with Brazil. Three times over a 12-year span. It might have been four if he had not been hacked out of the 1966 tournament. Messi has never been able to lift Argentina to a World Cup victory as Diego Maradona, another rival for the ‘best ever’, did in 1986. At last year’s tournament in Brazil, where Argentina made the final, Messi produced some wonderful moments but he was not even his team’s best player. Javier Mascherano and Angel di Maria shared that honour. Pele is hoisted aloft after winning his third World Cup in 1970 with that peerless Brazil side . Diego Maradona lifted Argentina to their second World Cup in eight years with his tour de force in Mexico . Messi reached the World Cup final with Argentina but was unable to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . Messi and Pep Guardiola embrace after winning the Champions League in Rome against Manchester United . Messi’s zealous champions point out, with some justification, that international football is not as prestigious or as important as it was a few decades ago. That ignores the fact that most players would still consider winning the World Cup the pinnacle of their careers. But it is true that the club game has risen in influence and players’ priorities have changed. Messi is vulnerable in this regard, too, though. He has played for Barcelona, the team almost universally regarded as the outstanding side of the last decade and yet, remind me, how many Champions League titles has he won? That’s right. Two. The Champions League is now seen as the ultimate test of a player’s greatness and Messi has only won it twice. It is still a fantastic achievement but it seems like an anomaly for someone who is supposed to be the best ever, especially when you consider the achievements of others. Paolo Maldini won it five times, Raul won it three times, Clarence Seedorf won it four times with three different clubs. In its incarnation as the European Cup, other greats like Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff won it three times. Ferenc Puskas and Alfredo di Stefano, two more players that some old fuddy-duddies think were the best they ever saw, won the European Cup eight times between them. Real Madrid's Raymond Kopa (left) holds the European Cup as team-mate Alfredo Di Stefano looks on . Johan Cruyff, Barry Hulshoff and Johan Neeskens are in jubilant form after Ajax's 1973 win over Juventus .

Clarence Seedorf flashes a trademark grin as he celebrates his second Champions League win with AC Milan . Carlo Ancelotti's side arrive back in Milan with Paolo Maldini (right) getting his hands on a fifth European Cup . We all have our own ideas of what constitutes beauty in football and Messi fits all of mine. But if I had to single out the most beautiful thing I have seen in the game, it would be Brazil’s fourth goal in the 1970 World Cup final. In particular, it would be Pele’s part in it. The way he stops the ball from Jairzinho, waits and then strokes it into the path of Carlos Alberto. It was the stunning simplicity of it. It epitomised the way a man who was also a genius was ready to subvert himself to the team ethic. Pele’s the best for me but I won’t pour scorn on you if you stick with Messi. Just remember that in the same way English football did actually exist before the Premier League, great players populated our game long before Lionel Messi walked this earth. Red Bull should stop moaning and build a better car . When McLaren won 15 of the 16 races in the 1988 Formula One season, I don’t remember Frank Williams bleating about how unfair it was. I don’t remember Williams demanding instant redress when Alain Prost won the first race for McLaren at Jacarepaguá in Brazil. I don’t remember Williams saying that because McLaren’s Honda engine was so powerful, it should be hobbled in some way. I don’t remember him demanding that the FIA do something about it because he hadn’t done as good a job as McLaren had. The preponderant McLaren team celebrate Ayrton Senna's title in 1988 after an utterly dominant season . Williams was always a bit of a stoic like that. He usually worked on the basis that he didn’t get mad, he got even. How outdated that kind of attitude seems in the sport now after Red Bull’s astonishing reaction to Lewis Hamilton’s victory for Mercedes at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne last weekend. We have grown used to Premier League managers throwing their toys out of their prams after a defeat, but what happened in Australia really was a spectacular tantrum. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is an intelligent man but his suggestion that the Mercedes’ engine should be ‘equalised’ in some way did him few favours. And the threat of Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz that he might quit the sport was laughably petulant. This is a team, don’t forget, who exerted their own stranglehold on F1 for four years. They won 13 of 19 races two seasons ago. Christian Horner (left) and Dietrich Mateschitz were not so stony-faced when Red Bull were won every race . Now they have discovered they do not have a monopoly on winning, they want to walk away. It’s pathetic. Fortunes fluctuate in sport. Look at McLaren Honda now. The days of Prost and Ayrton Senna sweeping all before them are a distant memory. So good luck to Mercedes. They have done a brilliant job and now they are reaping the rewards. Good luck to Hamilton, too. F1 has always been about the battle to get in the best car and after years of watching Sebastian Vettel winning in the Red Bull, now it’s Hamilton’s turn. I’m with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff on this one. The others should stop moaning and try to get better. Generally, that’s supposed to be what sport is about. Rory McIlroy is the face of golf now but the sport in the US still has a little work to do when it comes to name recognition. As McIlroy and his group walked up the 18th fairway at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Thursday afternoon, the officials put his name up on a board on the far side of the green. Rory McIlroy's name wreaked havoc with the scoreboard operators at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . First, it read ‘McElroy’. After a couple of minutes, they realised the mistake. There was a hasty rearrangement of letters until it read ‘McLlroy’. They got it right the third time and the crowd in the stand overlooking the green serenaded them with ironic cheers.","Yes, Messi is a genius. Every time I see him play live, it is a privilege .

"The worry for England is that things could get worse before they get better. The cricket itself is bad enough. But we're thinking of events off the field: if they were handed the keys to ECB headquarters, the Borgias and the Chuckle Brothers would probably bicker less and command more gravitas than the current lot. One of the side-effects of England's horrible performance at the World Cup was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself. While they were still in the tournament, there was always the promise of a horizon to cross, an itch to scratch, a wrong to right. No longer. The most alarming development of another improbable week was Alastair Cook's outburst in Abu Dhabi. It was no coincidence that the most heartfelt press conference of his career took place beyond the grasp of the ECB (perhaps beginning the county season in the Middle East does have something to recommend it after all). England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after their World Cup exit . England's exit at the World Cup was humiliating as they went out in Adelaide, Australia . England coach Peter Moores (left) at the end of the World Cup match between England and Bangladesh . But Cook was unhappy. More to the point, he hasn't got his head round his sacking as one-day captain. Neither fact reflects well on the English game. His cri de coeur came not long after coach Peter Moores had assured us that Cook had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the World Cup. Thoughts returned to the days before that axing, when Moores stressed his support for Cook's leadership; once the leadership was over, Moores said it was 'the right thing to do'. Something is clearly being lost in translation. And it had better be reinterpreted fast: England are about to embark on 17 Tests in 10 months. It is a period that will define both captain and coach, assuming they emerge unscathed. Yet Cook also needs to be frank with himself. The reason he shouldn't have been sacked so soon before a World Cup was that he should have been sacked well in advance, and allowed to focus on what – until two years ago – he was good at: churning out Test runs. Instead, he has now been critical not just of the decision to sack him, but also – by implication – of Eoin Morgan's leadership. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi . Alastair Cook trudges off the field in Abu Dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings . For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . Team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way. But had they been uttered by Kevin Pietersen, they would have brought howls of 'insubordination'. And Pietersen, lapping up the limelight once more, has loved every minute. Ever since Colin Graves appeared to suggest there was a way back, he has taken every opportunity to stay in the headlines. This is his prerogative, and it has at least served to expose the ECB's continued mismanagement of the saga. To hear the national selector James Whitaker dead-bat questions from the BBC last week was to wonder at the task awaiting the ECB's new head of communications, Chris Haynes. Meanwhile, confusion continues over what exactly Graves said to Pietersen. Reports vary: he's offered an olive branch, no he hasn't; he's assured Cook that Pietersen won't play for England again, no he hasn't; he's told Pietersen there are no guarantees, no he… you get the picture. And all this, remember, before Graves has even replaced Giles Clarke as chairman. In some ways, Graves deserves our sympathy: he has inherited a mess which he presumably didn't envisage while he was operating under the radar as Clarke's deputy. And his statement on Pietersen – play county cricket or there really is no hope – had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors . He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes . But the latest bout of confused messages, simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that English cricket should be careful when it next mocks, say, the Pakistanis or the West Indians for presiding over complete chaos. It's over a year now since Pietersen was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag. Yet, in the eyes of the public, the ECB are no closer to moving on. On the contrary: the crowd watching the sideshow is threatening to outnumber those who can still be bothered with the cricket. Pietersen has played the media game with his customary flair, befriending those he once disdained. But it's up to the ECB to take charge. If they imagine they can win his silence while planning not to pick him – and that, by the way, is their plan – then Cook's meltdown may not be the last. There's nothing like the pricking of officialdom's bubble to soothe the soul. When the ICC posted what they thought was a congratulatory tweet to the Ireland team on a 'memorable and inspiring' World Cup, they enthused: 'See what Captain @purdy34 had to say HERE…' 'Captain @purdy34', aka Will Porterfield, saved Twitter users the bother of clicking on the ICC's link by responding directly with a tweet of his own: ‪'@ICC so memorable and inspiring that you have decided to cut the next WC to 10 teams. What is your vision for the game of cricket?' Funnily enough, the many replies did not include one from the ICC. William Porterfield saved Twitter users the bother of clicking on the ICC's link by responding directly . It's hardly unprecedented for politicians to thump a few tubs in an attempt to rally their constituents. So, as Bangladesh fumed over the No-Ball That Wasn't during their quarter-final defeat by India – fondly imagining that a semi-final place had been wrenched from their grasp – their head cricket honcho Mustafa Kamal cheerfully fumed: 'It seems the ICC has become the Indian Cricket Council.' The joke was lost on the ICC, which was hardly surprising: Kamal is their president. Worse, he reportedly threatened to resign if the ICC – his ICC – didn't investigate the umpiring. In the circumstances, ICC chief executive David Richardson might have been lost for words. Instead he managed a faintly splenetic: 'As an ICC president, he should have been more considerate in his criticism of ICC match officials, whose integrity cannot be questioned.' Needless to say, Kamal later dismissed reports of his threat to quit as 'rumours'. Pesky media… . Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Mustafa Kamal  (right) pictured during a press conference . SCRAP THE QUARTERS . It's not the ICC's fault that the World Cup quarter-finals were mainly one-sided, memorable only for individual feats – Rohit Sharma, Wahab Riaz, Martin Guptill. But, as I wrote in the 2012 Wisden, the tournament would benefit from losing the quarter-finals altogether. The quarters are a nice conceit: they ensure seven knockout matches rather than three, and create the illusion that there are eight teams who can actually lift the trophy. But their presence continues to make a turkey of the group stage, which stretches over a month and is grateful for whatever storylines are tossed its way. So here's the plan: allow 12 teams to take part in 2019 (not 10, as per the ICC's plan), stage two groups of six (all play all), and scrap the quarter-finals altogether. With only two teams progressing from each group, all the early matches would be meaningful, which would more than compensate for the loss of the quarters. And the Associates would get their chance without being accused of contributing to a meaningless first phase. The problem? Only 33 matches, compared with the 49 we have now. TV wouldn't like it, even if many fans would accept the shortfall in return for the prolonged tension. And even one game a day would still allow the tournament to last a month. ICC, over to you.","England were embarrassingly knocked out of the 2015 World Cup .
Alastair Cook blasted England for sacking him as captain .

"Australia: they’ve done it again. That’s five World Cups now, their aura disseminated on five different continents – Asia (1987), Europe (1999), Africa (2003), North America (2007), and Australasia (2015). If they ever stage the tournament in Antarctica, the rest of the world may as well save themselves the air fare. Their story is a remarkable one – of swift, ruthless renewal and of the belief inherent in Australian cricket that their natural position is up there, not down here. To watch them against New Zealand was to watch expectation thrash hope. Australia’s self-belief cannot simply be transplanted into other cricketing cultures. But their refusal to tolerate failing systems can. Michael Clarke was the impressive leader of Australia's equally impressive World Cup triumph . No team could stop the Aussies claiming yet another World Cup, this time on home soil . Less than two years ago everyone was having a good chuckle at Homeworkgate and David Warner. Australia lost 4-0 in India, Warner swung for Joe Root, and Mickey Arthur was put out to pasture a fortnight before the Ashes. While England creaked their way through a flattering 3-0 win that summer, convincing themselves that all was well with the world, Australia’s new coach Darren Lehmann was thanking God for a schedule that would give his side a crack at instant revenge. The rest is history. Australia’s nadirs are as low as anyone’s – they just last less long. It is inconceivable that they would tolerate, as England are in the process of doing, a period of failure that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of ‘transition’. For that, as much as anything, their latest World Cup win deserves an admiring nod. Australia generally know when and how to peak. But their behaviour during Sunday’s final means this admiration stretches only so far. Not for the first time, we were reminded of a curious contradiction at the heart of Australian cricket: while they have always been engagingly good losers (better, in fact, than most), they are also deeply unlovable winners. Brad Haddin, who claimed he felt uncomfortable about New Zealand’s niceness during the build-up to the group game at Auckland, was at the centre of things, as he often is. After Martin Guptill was bowled by Glenn Maxwell, Haddin felt the need to clap his gloves in Guptill’s face. Then, after the dismissal of Grant Elliott, Haddin and James Faulkner sent him packing with various snarls and grimaces. Brad Haddin clapped in Martin Guptill's face after the New Zealand batsman was bowled during the final . Grant Elliott (left) was also given a less-than-sporting send-off by Haddin and James Faulkner (second right) A meme doing the rounds used both this image and one of Brendon McCullum shaking Michael Clarke’s hand at the end of his match-clinching 74 to compare and contrast the teams’ attitudes. Even while they’re basking in glory, it should make Cricket Australia squirm. Mind you, it wasn’t much of a surprise. The immediate postscript of New Zealand’s win over South Africa in the semi-final was the sight of Elliott comforting the stricken Dale Steyn, like Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee all over again. Australia, on the other hand, gurned their way through victory over India in Sydney, with Mitchell Starc harrying Suresh Raina, and Warner applauding from the balcony after his fellow wallflower Virat Kohli dropped Haddin. For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . The ICC ignored all this – presumably because they didn’t want to be seen to sully the tournament’s blue-riband matches. But they had already punished Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz for his crude goading of Shane Watson in the quarter-finals – a set-to which at least had the merit of forming part of a stirring head-to-head. But sledging without context is even worse: the Guptill and Elliott send-offs just looked crass and cruel. Sledging, we are told with wearying certainty, is part of the game. But when did it become de rigueur to cackle at a batsman who is already dealing with the disappointment of heading back to the pavilion? Merv Hughes used to do it all the time, not least to Graeme Hick. His rationale was that he was getting inside Hick’s head before the next battle. In a six-Test series, it made a sick kind of sense. Haddin has no such excuse. David Warner, (left) spraying beer at the MCG after Sunday's victory, is well known for his brash attitude . The Australians' behaviour harks back to the example set by the likes of Merv Hughes (second right) No Australian cricket-lover I know enjoys this sort of thing, though some on Twitter claim with some justification that the Poms are in no position to talk: see the life and crimes of Jimmy Anderson. But England fans are also aware that Anderson’s sledging contributed to their team’s unpopularity during the years when Andy Flower’s side was doing well. When England’s wheel turned, there was precious little sympathy waiting for them on the other side. The same applies to Australia. If there were neutrals out there who didn’t want New Zealand to win the final, they didn’t immediately advertise the fact. And this had more to do with the fact that sports fans love an underdog. They also dislike arrogance, nastiness and sneering. You can admire the Australian cricket team. But it’s a little harder to warm to them. A CHANGE OF PLAN .

If you aren’t already a subscriber, please click here to make sure it is emailed to you, free of charge. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Thanks boss! Regular readers will know of the ICC’s Bangladeshi president Mustafa Kamal, who recently endeared himself to his own organisation by referring to them – not unreasonably – as the ‘Indian Cricket Council’. That followed Bangladesh’s quarter-final loss to India, when Kamal was convinced the umpires had it in for his team. Now, he appears to be at it again, this time after he was denied the chance to hand over the World Cup to the Australian team on the podium at the MCG on Sunday. Instead the honour befell ICC chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan, prompting Kamal to huff about his ‘constitutional right’, duly ‘dishonoured’. Mustafa Kemal (left) is threatening to reveal ICC 'mischief', despite being its president . Ominously, Kamal is reported to have said: ‘After I go back home, I will let the whole world know what’s happening in ICC. I will let the whole world know about those guys who are doing these mischievous things.’ As president of the organisation he is threatening to rat on, Kamal may like to ask himself why he hasn’t considered spilling the beans before. You could not, as they say, make it up. Revolving doors . Kevin Pietersen’s decision to pull out of his IPL deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad could have a curious knock-on effect for England. It means an extra slot in the Sunrisers team for both a middle-order batsman and an overseas player – and that could be good news for Eoin Morgan. But it also lessens the chance of Morgan being released for a few days to captain England in their one-day international against Ireland at Malahide on May 8. Look out for the very short-term appointment of yet another England captain… . Kevin Pietersen (left) celebrated Australia's World Cup win with pal James Faulkner . Best bib and tucker . It’s easy to forget there were two Australian captains at the World Cup: Michael Clarke… and George Bailey, who played one game, scored 55 against England, and ceded both the armband and his place in the side when Clarke returned from injury. He evidently made peace with his role. Spies in Australia tell us that, 18 hours after the World Cup final, a bleary-eyed Bailey appeared at a civic reception still wearing the fluorescent bib that appeared affixed to him for most of the tournament.

"Luke Campbell scored an emotional third-round knockout in his home city of Hull on Saturday as he beat Levis Morales. Olympic champion Campbell initially pulled out of the fight because of the ill health of his father, but with the blessing of his family he made a late decision to return to the bill.

That was enough for referee Howard Foster, whose decision to call the fight off came at the same time a white towel appeared from Morales' corner.

'It was a family decision to fight, to give everyone something to look forward to. There's nothing better for me than boxing in Hull, the love I get is priceless. 'It was very difficult.

"Among the stream of letdowns to flow from England’s World Cup perhaps the most poignant poured from the lips of Eoin Morgan on Sunday. Morgan is the most inventive England batsman of his generation, and that includes Kevin Pietersen. He is resolutely his own man – a Dubliner who crossed the Irish Sea, an advocate of the IPL in a country which often disdains it, and a thoughtful presence around the traps, alert with a hint of aloof. But the system can drag down the best. And so, reflecting on the horrific nine-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in Wellington after England had scored 309 for 6, Morgan sought comfort in stats. England captain Eoin Morgan found solace in statistics following the heavy defeat by Sri Lanka . First this: ‘We were 25 above par, and the stats backed that up. Par here is about 275-280.’ Then this: ‘We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we’ll get the Hawk-Eye stuff, and the proof will be in that.’ Stats have always been a hallmark of Peter Moores’s England. Famously, he introduced Andy Flower to Moneyball, Michael Lewis’s classic account of sabermetrics (the statistical analysis of baseball); infamously, he allowed stats to encourage the selection of Darren Pattinson against South Africa in 2008. Stats work – and they don’t. At their best, they confirm hunches. At their worst, they become a usefully faceless scapegoat: don’t blame us, we were only following the stats! We exaggerate, but not by much. What, after all, is the relevance of stats when the change in fielding restrictions has made 300 the norm? And why defer to Hawk-Eye when Naked-Eye told you England bowled like drains? Jos Buttler needs to be cut loose at the top of the batting order when the situation merits his promotion . Gary Ballance (left) is suffering from poor form and England's insistence on using him as a No 3 . The system isn’t working. If it were working – or even close to working – England would not have lost to Australia by 111 runs, to New Zealand with more than 37 overs to spare, and to Sri Lanka by nine wickets while defending over 300. The Associate nations are making a better fist of things. So if not the system, then what? Poor Morgan, by nature a free spirit, has inherited a job weighed down by English caution. Roundheads are better at Tests; cavaliers prefer one-dayers. And England are playing a form of 50-over cricket more suited to Oliver Cromwell and 1645. Conservatism continues to bedevil them. When Jos Buttler hit the fastest one-day hundred by an England batsman, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, Alastair Cook told us he wasn’t ready for Test cricket. Alex Hales has not been trusted in the one-day side, despite producing the innings of the World Twenty20 last March. James Taylor has been shunted to No 6, after prospering at No 3. The free-hitting Alex Hales has not been trusted to form a regular part of their 50-over batting order . James Taylor leaps to take a catch against Sri Lanka - and his position in the order has also dived to No 6 . England have inverted one of the first rules of international sport, which is to do what the opposition least wants you to do. After Moeen Ali and Ian Bell put on 172 in 30 overs against Scotland, in came Gary Ballance, a talented batsman whose confidence is being undermined by being asked to slot straight into a demanding role on the biggest stage of all. Why not Buttler, armed with a licence to do something violent? Instead, Ballance scratched around for 10 in 18 balls, England slowed down, and a near-certain score of 350-plus became 303 for 8. Beggars with terrible net run-rates cannot be choosers. The total proved well beyond Scotland – but, funnily enough, not beyond Sri Lanka, whose 2-3-4-5 (Dilshan, Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Mathews) is as classy as anything in the tournament. Yet, after Moeen and Bell had again provided a useful platform (62 in nine overs), England proceeded to potter around before the final assault, safe in the knowledge that the 300 was ‘25 above par’. For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . The lunacy is that, for perhaps the first time ever, this England team contains batsmen capable of casting off the straitjacket: Moeen, Taylor, Morgan and Buttler. And if AB de Villiers had played the lofted reverse-sweep for six produced by Joe Root during a Thisara Perera over costing 25, we’d never have heard the end of it. There is talent in that dressing-room. There will be more to come: look at Sam Billings, Jason Roy and James Vince. But it is weighed down by the notion that one-day teams can rationalise their way to victory. Here, England seemed to have borrowed not so much from Moneyball as from Annie Hall. In one scene from Woody Allen’s film a movie producer is overheard at a party: ‘Right now it’s only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept and later turn it into an idea.’ England coach Peter Moores has been left to reflect on an embarrassing start to the World Cup . Moores is a fan of Moneyball (left) but his regime has more in common with Annie Hall . England seem to believe that stats will ease them all the way through from notion to concept to idea to… World Cup success! This may work in Test cricket. It sure as hell doesn’t work in the 50-over game. It may be too late to salvage anything from the wreckage of this tournament. But if England accept that stats-driven prudence is no way to win one-day internationals, they can yet challenge for the 2019 World Cup. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . New-ball nightmare . England’s over-planned batting is only part of their problem. After the weekend matches, they had claimed only 22 wickets in four games, a lower ratio than anyone except Zimbabwe and the UAE. And they had leaked 6.33 an over, more than anyone except West Indies. The point has been made that England’s battery of right-arm seamers have become distinguishable only by height and hair colour. This is true. But it wouldn’t matter if their two biggest guns – Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, with over 1,000 international wickets between them – were at their best. Instead, they are suffering almost identical nightmares: both have two wickets and have gone at 6.27 an over, with Anderson averaging 91 to Broad’s 92. During England’s tour of Sri Lanka, it was regularly assumed the attack would be stronger for their return from injury. We’ll keep holding our breath. The bowling of Stuart Broad (left) and James Anderson (right) has been smashed at the World Cup so far . Shifting the goalposts . There’s nothing like a(nother) World Cup fiasco to skew the debate. But: KP or not KP? – that is the question. Once this World Cup is over, it’s all about Test cricket: 17 matches in 10 months, including yet another Ashes. Yet the Test line-up looks settled, apart from an opening slot, where Pietersen wouldn’t bat anyway. Which of Ballance, Root, Bell or Moeen Ali are you going to drop? And if Pietersen is to be brought back for the one-day team, you’d have to ask a fresh batch of questions about how seriously England are about winning the 2019 World Cup: Pietersen will turn 39 that June. No-one can doubt his brilliance at the height of his one-day international career. But he drifted away from the 50-over format in his final year as an England player, and didn’t do especially well when he was picked. Yes, he’d put bums on seats and get people talking about cricket. But let’s not pretend he’d be the saviour of the English game. Kevin Pietersen (right) has had the door opened on a potential return to the England set-up . Someone else’s problem . MS Dhoni earned a few pats on the back for saying, after India had thrashed the UAE, that the Associate nations needed more exposure at the highest level. But the devil was in the detail: that exposure, Dhoni intimated, could not come against India, who already have their hands full. And there’s the rub. The big boys profess their support in theory, but with one crucial caveat: not on my patch. Cricket’s closed shop remains open all hours. MS Dhoni insists the Associate nations should get more game time... so long as it's not against India .","England are suffering a miserable Cricket World Cup .

No, not the enormity of the money. This is a fortune which just keeps on growing and will carry on doing so all the way to the desert night of May 2 – and beyond as the pay-TV returns pour in. This is the latest picture Floyd Mayweather posted on shots.com as he trains for the Manny Pacquiao fight . And Pacquiao has also updated his Instagram account with this picture from Monday . Las Vegas was the only realistic option for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao mega-fight . The $300million fight will be held at the MGM Grand which has hosted Mayweather's last 10 bouts . The latest dose of reality comes from promoter Bob Arum as he explains why, despite all the speculation to the contrary, Floyd Mayweather Jnr vs Manny Pacquiao was never going anywhere except Las Vegas. Not to New York, the preceding spiritual home of boxing. Not to the Philippines, where the national adoration of Pacquiao could have generated a second Thrilla in Manilla to follow in the immortal footsteps of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Not to the space odyssey of a stadium which is the new home of the Dallas Cowboys, even though it would have accommodated more than five times the number of spectators lucky and wealthy enough to acquire tickets at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Arum was glibly cited as the proponent of alternative venues. Not least because he took his PacMan to the house which Cowboys owner Jerry Jones built in Dallas for two fights each of which pulled in 50,000 plus crowds . Pacquiao's promoter was cited as the proponent of alternative venues including Dallas and New York . Arum hosted two of Pacquaio's fights to the Dallas Cowboy's stadium in front of 50,000 fans . ‘Not me,’ said Arum as soon as Mayweather put pen to contract and he no longer had to muzzle himself for fear of jeopardising what may well become The Half-Billion-Dollar boxing match. ‘Don’t forget that I live here. ‘All the workers in the entertainment and gaming industries, every restaurant and bar owner and all their waiters, every hotel executive and their employees, all the cab drivers and every maintenance man... they’re all my neighbours. ‘Ask yourselves. Am I going to let them down? Am I going to disappoint or upset the folks next door? ‘That would have made life very difficult for me. But on top of that, this fight truly belongs in Las Vegas.’ That is not just sentiment. Arum is a man who deals in hard economic reality. NFL star Tim Tebow visits Manny Pacquiao at training camp at the Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles . Pacquiao talks to trainer Freddie Roach as he continues his training at the Wild Card . He sees the numbers outside the arena – where 16,000 seats priced from $1,500 to $7,500 will treble boxing’s gate record in Nevada to $60 million. He see past the pay-per-view TV returns which alone could generate upwards of $400 million. He sees this single event completing the recovery of the place where he lives from the economic recession which at one point threatened the future of the gaming as well as the boxing capital of the world. Las Vegas has still not managed to attract a US major league sports franchise but Arum says: ‘This fight is three Super Bowls rolled in one.’ He knows it is not only jobs in the short term which the richest fight of all time can secure but the medium term future of the entire city. Every big name in show business has played the Strip – from Frank Sinatra to Elton John, from Barbra Streisand to Celine Dion. So too the great names in boxing – from Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson, from Sugar Ray Robinson to Sugar Ray Leonard, . Mayweather poses at home as he takes a break from his rigorous training regime . Mayweather is training at his Las Vegas gym as he bids to maintain his unbeaten record . But Arum says: ‘What we have here now is the biggest event in the history of Las Vegas. There will be a hundred thousand or more visitors. Some with tickets for the fight. Another 30,000 watching on closed circuit screens. Others just for the experience and so they can say they were here that night. ‘Hotel rooms are a thousand bucks a night. With all the high rollers you are looking at a casino drop at the tables of hundreds and hundreds of millions.’ Arum has also scotched the rumour of a re-match clause being secretly inserted into the contract,. But if Mayweather-Pacquaio lives up to all the hype, none of those high rollers from all over the world will bet against all concerned grasping the chance to make another half-a-billion.

"When Nick Knight asked Eoin Morgan, moments after the defeat by Bangladesh, whether England were obsessed with stats, you half-expected Morgan to hit back with: 'Yes, but only 23.54 per cent of the time!' Not long after, a shattered-looking Peter Moores told Nasser Hussain: ‘We’ve got to have a look at the data’. And, hey presto, England’s latest World Cup fiasco had its epitaph. The raw data of this World Cup – four humiliations sandwiching a win against Scotland – confirm what most non-ECB observers worked out a long time ago: England are not naturally inclined towards the one-day game, and make things worse by talking about a ‘brand’ of cricket that bears no relation to the one they play or to the players they select. A solemn-looking England captain Eoin Morgan arrives at Sydney airport on Tuesday morning . The Australian press has predictably stuck the boot in hard on England's World Cup flops . Ian Bell wears a sorry look as the batsman arrives in Sydney ahead of the game against Afghanistan . James Anderson walks onto the team bus after flying from Adelaide, scene of England's latest humiliation . Mike Atherton said that England were not as reliant on stats as some claim. This may be so. But even if the truth lies somewhere between Morgan’s denial and Moores’s unwitting revelation, it seems clear that no other team talks numbers with as much pseudo-religious relish. And if it is true that England encourage the players to trust their gut instinct, why then do they bat as if they’ve been told it’s OK to score at 4.5 for 20 overs? If Moores can’t see that this is a team frightened by their own shadow (and, no doubt, by their own shadow’s bowling average), then things are going to get worse before they get better. Moores insisted he was still keen on the job, and Paul Downton – the man who once called him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ – later declared ‘I’ve got every faith in Peter Moores’, as if the chairmanship of a football club was the job that got away. But will the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves and chief executive Tom Harrison share Downton’s faith – or even have any faith in Downton himself? Peter Moores (left) was ridiculed for saying 'we'll have to look at the data' following defeat by Bangladesh . Morgan shows the strain after England were dumped out of the World Cup before the quarter-finals . Bangladesh bowler Rubel Hossain (centre) celebrates during his team's 15-run victory on Monday . The case for Moores’s defence revolves around the fact that England have been mainly hopeless at one-day cricket since the 1992 World Cup. And one-day cricket is all England have been playing since they won three Tests in a row against India in July and August. His advocates also argue that he inherited a shambles born of an Ashes whitewash, just as he did when he first got the job in 2007. Unlike Andy Flower, he did not have Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen or Graeme Swann at his disposal. It was, his supporters argue, never going to turn around overnight. All this is true. But Moores is nearly a year into his second stint, and England are going backwards. In all formats they have won 13 games out of 36 (forgive the stat), including two victories against Scotland. Their one notable success – a 3-1 Test win – lost much of its lustre because of India’s hopelessness. For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . Moores is a genuine and decent man, as ego-free as any coach on the international circuit. It is not his fault that county teams only recently reintroduced the 50-over format. He didn’t write the ECB’s strategic plan, which cited winning this World Cup as one of its ‘key measures’. And we hope he has been tearing his hair out at the failure of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to impose themselves on this competition. But Ashley Giles’s coaching ambitions paid the price for a single result – the World Twenty20 defeat by Holland. For Moores, the results are beginning to look as wasteful as an EU butter mountain. And there are some crucial areas in which he must surely be accountable. Moores was one of the selectors who last summer backed Alastair Cook as one-day captain, robbing Eoin Morgan of the chance to acquaint himself with the job during the home series against India and the trip to Sri Lanka. That stubbornness meant Morgan was learning on the job. Is it any surprise that his batting has disintegrated? Then there was the tinkering for England’s tournament opener against Australia. What possessed Moores and Co to demote James Taylor from No 3, and replace him with Gary Ballance, who had just returned from injury, rather than with Alex Hales, a proven match-winner in limited-overs internationals? Moores is due to rouse the likes of Stuart Broad for The Ashes in the summer - but will he still be in a job? Joe Root was one of five top-order batsmen caught behind against Bagladesh in Test-style dismissals . Old foe Mitchell Johnson (centre) and the mighty Australians await England again in The Ashes . And what of the tendency to err on the side of caution? Against Bangladesh, five of the top seven were out caught in the slip cordon, as if they were playing Test cricket. If these things are not Moores’s department, what are? Graves must now decide whether England can risk giving the Downton/Moores ticket a crack at the Ashes – victory in which, by the way, also forms part of the ECB’s strategic plan. Waiting in the wings is Jason Gillespie, a figure Graves admires from their time together at Yorkshire, where Gillespie also worked with Paul Farbrace, Moores’s No 2. Graves may be unimpressed with England’s out-of-date tactics in Australia, and equally concerned to hear Downton tell Sky Sports: ‘What has struck me has been how much influence T20 is having on one-day cricket, and a lot of our players don't play much T20 cricket, so that is clearly something we have to look at.’ Well, who’d have thought it! The sadness is that no non-England fans will lament their absence from the World Cup quarter-finals. They played dull, fearful cricket, stuck between a rock and a time warp. Even factoring in the global schadenfreude that usually accompanies an England defeat, they have re-entered the realms of laughing stock. If Colin Graves is happy with that, then God help English cricket. Watch this space. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . KP on the money . Kevin Pietersen’s views may not be welcome at High Command, but he had a pertinent point to make after England’s 15-run defeat by Bangladesh. ‘DO NOT SAY WE HAVENT PRIORITISED ODI CRICKET!’ he tweet-screamed. ‘We played a back to back Ashes to make sure England played 6 months of ODI's before this WC!’ And he’s right. Far from helping England in either event, the rejigged schedule has, in successive winters, produced the joint-worst Ashes defeat in history and their most miserable exit yet from a World Cup. A home loss to Australia this summer and the ECB will have presided over quite the hat-trick. Outspoken England critic Kevin Pietersen (centre) watches QPR vs Tottenham last Saturday . Respectfully yours, the BCCI . Speaking of laughing stocks, the BCCI press release that followed Virat Kohli’s invective-laden outburst against an Indian journalist (the wrong one, as it turned out) was a classic of its genre. Having already issued a peremptory – and entirely wrong – statement, in which it was claimed Kohli hadn’t sworn and had apologised to the journalist in person, the Indian board then issued another. The takeaway line was this: ‘The BCCI respects the role played by the media in covering and popularising the game of cricket, and acknowledges the support of the media, in its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in India.’ So respectful are the BCCI of the media that press releases on tour routinely read: ‘Monday: no media activity. Tuesday: no media activity. Wednesday: no media activity.’ Thank goodness for the respect… . Virat Kohli enjoys a kickabout in training with India - but his team are not playing ball with the media . Reporters, not supporters . Then again, perhaps it’s just a misunderstanding. As the Indian board sought to manage the damage, they wheeled out Ravichandran Ashwin, the thoughtful off-spinner. ‘Media here are here to support us,’ he said. ‘It’s very heartening to see the media turn up in huge numbers and try to support us.’ It’s not known whether Ashwin handed out pom-poms and tutu skirts to the assembled hacks, but then he clearly thought he didn’t need to.

"One man alone is not going to save English cricket. The Kevin Pietersen storyline is a good'un, full of rage, intrigue and hypocrisy. But the longer it goes on, the less we will be inclined to analyse what really ails our game. England will not win or lose the Ashes on the basis of whether Pietersen returns. There aren't, after all, many examples of Test series being won by a single player: Harold Larwood needed Bill Voce during Bodyline, Ian Botham needed Bob Willis in 1981, Mitchell Johnson needed Brad Haddin in 2013-14. And a 35-year-old Pietersen is unlikely to be in any of those categories. If he does return, we may – briefly – get more people talking about cricket; he may produce some magic to belie his age; critics of Paul Downton may feel vindicated; it will almost certainly be a whole lot of fun. Kevin Pietersen shows off his latest flamboyant hairstyle on his way to the Fox Sports studio on Tuesday . That's the best-case scenario. But let's not pretend it would solve much. English cricket has always presided over a deeply imperfect system, one hampered by a fear of revolution. Occasionally we commission a serious report, which makes us feel progress is being made. But entertaining diversions are just as crucial to the psyche of the English cricket lover: they mean we can go easy on the self-analysis. From WG’s gamesmanship via Compton’s knee through to Botham’s extra-curriculars and KP’s tweets, our game has always quietly welcomed the glamorous, scurrilous sideshow, the tabloid tittle-tattle to balance out broadsheet sobriety. Yet if the game is reduced over the coming months to a string of will-he-won’t-he bulletins about the future of a player who has, at best, two years left at the highest level, then we will be doing the game a disservice. (I hope Pietersen proves me wrong. If he returns to international cricket, I hope he scores lots more Test hundreds and gives us all something to cheer about. The point of this article is not to pick on Pietersen.) Pietersen is gunning for an England recall after his exile from the side, but turns 35 in the summer . The batsman has enjoyed some stellar achievements with England, such as here after the 2005 Ashes win . Pietersen's antics entertain the public just as Ian Botham's extra-curricular activities once did. Here the all-rounder was pictured dressed as a rabbit next to team-mate Phil deFreitas in Melbourne in 1986 . What should concern English cricket right now is how one of the best-resourced teams in the world spent the World Cup looking like one of the worst; how an air of fatalism about their chances became a self-fulfilling prophecy; and how Downton appeared so intensely relaxed about the fact that England were miles off the pace. In fact, batting was not even the half of their problems – another reason why the Pietersen debate risks straying into red-herring territory. Five members of the top seven averaged over 35, with strike-rates ranging from Jos Buttler’s 135 to Ian Bell’s 77. These are not figures to win you a World Cup, but neither are they out-and-out disasters. Far worse was the bowling, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad taking nine wickets between them at an average of 55. Not until Chris Jordan was given a game against Bangladesh did anyone nail a yorker. Steven Finn went for nearly seven an over, which was expensive even by the standards of this World Cup. And the refusal to look at James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara until it was too late was plain stubborn. VIDEO We take responsibility for exit - Morgan . Stuart Broad was a key member of England's struggling bowling attack during the World Cup . Steven Finn (right) has gone backwards in both pace and achievement as a bowler . Chris Woakes has added pace but England's bowling stocks pale in comparison with the likes of Australia . These are all questions that should concern Colin Graves and Tom Harrison in the short term. But the long term is even more worrying: where are England’s fast bowlers going to come from? This is the area that has always been most poorly served by an overcrowded domestic schedule played on tired pitches. Even Anderson has always relied on craftsmanship rather than speed, while Broad keeps breaking down and Finn has slowed. How long before satisfaction over the extra yard of pace added by Chris Woakes gives way to another sense of anti-climax? For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . English fast bowlers emerge in spite of the system, not because of it. Pudding-like pitches help medium-pacers. Why waste all the effort of tearing in at 92mph when you can put it there or thereabouts – three words that get to the heart of English cricket – at 78mph and watch the grass do the rest? We can't simply blame the climate. A decade ago, Old Trafford would cause Steve Harmison to lick his lips. The Oval has had its moments too. Taunton makes bowlers work hard for their wickets. More damaging, we're left to conclude, is a domestic set-up which encourages fast bowlers to throttle back if they're to stand any chance of making it through the season. It shouldn't be the case that England feel the need to take promising young quicks out of the domestic game, away from the coaches who know them best. A glance at Australia's list of fast bowlers provides an unnerving glimpse of the future. If England are able to come up with an attack that regularly takes 20 wickets, then the inclusion or otherwise of one batsman will feel like an irrelevance. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Then again… . Michael Vaughan believes Kevin Pietersen has a 10 per cent chance of playing for England again. The mystery is why Pietersen isn't doing his best to increase the odds. Speaking on Fox Sports last week, he had some fair things to say about the way Peter Moores had handled England's World Cup campaign – but basic psychology tells you they were the kind of points better made by an out-and-out pundit, not a man hoping to resurrect his international career by working with… Moores! Peter Moores (left) will hardly be encouraged by his previous with Pietersen... and KP's latest comments . 'I heard the coach come out and say: ""We don’t have a settled side"",' said Pietersen. 'Well mate, you played six months of one-day cricket before that game. Even if you don’t think you've got a settled squad, you don’t go and tell the whole world you don’t have a settled squad."" Later: 'I've played under Andy Flower and I had a worse relationship with Flower than I did with Moores.' It's fine to have these views. We all have thoughts we realise it's best to keep to ourselves. But, not for the first time, you do wonder: who, if anyone, is advising Kevin Pietersen? Eoin Morgan has conflicting IPL and England duties . Double standards? That said, it would be intriguing to know what Pietersen makes of Eoin Morgan's decision to place his IPL deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of England's trip to Dublin in May for a one-day international that has taken on an extra dimension following the World Cup farce. Pietersen has been criticised in the past – including by this writer – for seeking to place IPL commitments ahead of national duty. Yet the ECB's more relaxed approach to the IPL sheds a more sympathetic light on Pietersen's wishes. He has not always helped himself, but his contention that English cricket is riven with double standards is boosted by Morgan's position. And Morgan, don't forget, is England's one-day captain. A proud tradition . There was uproar last week when Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper published a nasty piece headlined 'Alcoholic dumps Zim out of WC' – a reference to a crucial catch held by Ireland's John Mooney to dismiss Sean Williams, with replays suggesting Mooney's foot made contact with the boundary as he held on. Mooney has previously admitted problems with drink and depression, though quite what this had to do with the incident in question was anyone's guess. Ireland's John Mooney was the subject of a cruel piece by Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper . Mooney helped Ireland eliminate Zimbabawe from the World Cup by catching out Sean Williams . TV replays suggested Mooney's foot touched the boundary rope, meaning the catch should not have stood . A South African colleague, however, suggested we were all misplacing our energy. So absurd, she said, was the Herald that it recently ran an editorial berating journalists for their coverage of Robert Mugabe's comedy stumble on a carpet at Harare airport. The Herald was so keen to prove that Mugabe's accident had nothing to do with his age (he is 91), and everything to do with a 'poorly laid-out carpet', that it solemnly listed other moments of high-society slapstick. The clinching proof that Bob was still fit as a fiddle?

"Not quite as famous as ‘one-nil to the Arsenal’ was in its day, granted. But one-nil is ‘the Spain Scoreline’. It’s the margin via which, according to the scorer Andrés Iniesta, Spain regained self-esteem and belief by winning at Old Trafford in 2007. Beating England, to those who were charged by Luis Aragonés with installing a ‘new’ form of play, put La Roja on the map again, Iniesta told me. Italy and France both followed months later — old foes, bogey teams. One-nil, one-nil. Spain on the march. Alvaro Morata capped his Spain debut with the winner against Ukraine on Friday night . One-nil, the scoreline, against the USA which saw Spain booed out of the country before Euro 2008. One-nil, the scoreline which gave them a technical knockout against Germany in the Final a couple of weeks later — narrow margin, total control. Champions. Portugal, Paraguay, Germany, Holland — four games, four goals, four clean sheets. One-nil to La Roja, world champions 2010. They had it within their repertoire to hit threes, fours, fives. But the single-goal win was a trademark. Own the ball, own the midfield, get the advantage, never look like conceding. But, Friday night in Seville at the beginning of Semana Santa (Holy Week) was something different. One-nil over Ukraine. A record 97th international match without conceding for ‘Saint’ Iker Casillas. A debut goal, after only 38 competitive minutes, for Álvaro Morata. In touch with Group C leaders Slovakia, who are the next home opponents — in Oviedo in September. The bare bones look good. The full X-ray much less so. Morata has all the hallmarks of an old style centre-forward who finishes . On another night, one of those ‘accident nights’ which hit every team every so often, Spain would have lost this one. On another night, Ruslan Rotan would have had a hat-trick. On this night, there was the sight of the Marquis del Bosque, for whom the game left ‘a bad taste in the mouth’, throwing his hands up in the air at the naivety and imprecision of the second half and roaring at his team: ‘What are you playing at lads?’ Transition. It can be a glorious, strategic, rewarding process — or an unmanaged, inglorious, frustrating decline. Quite where Spain are in that process is debatable. For seven years between 2007 and 2014, they dictated. But, just as when all dictatorships are overthrown, the subjects have had a good time stamping on the statues. Brazil in the Confederations Cup Final, Holland at the World Cup — La Roja were to be bullied, pushed around, made to chase, pressed to within an inch of their lives. The striker has struck up a 'thing' with Andrea Pirlo at Juventus . But there’s no doubt that renovation is afoot. Isco, Real Madrid’s gem of a midfielder, should have been at the World Cup, should probably have been a starter. Koke, dynamic, aggressive, intelligent — the heartbeat of an Atlético Madrid side which won the Spanish title and came within seconds of winning the Champions League — is now a fixture. Debuts have been given to Diego Costa, Juan Bernat, Paco Alcácer and David de Gea, while everyone waits for Javi Martínez and Thiago Alcántara to get fit. And stay fit. Yet Spain, Europe’s reigning champions, are fighting for their dignity and automatic qualification from this group because they could not control a 1-1 situation in Slovakia last year. They are sore and should be contemplating this midweek’s friendly against Holland with queries in their minds because they could neither augment, nor control, Friday night’s 28th-minute lead against a Ukraine side which at first came to defend and play on the break. Then, sniffing glory, piled runners forward through the Spain midfield, robbing possession and launching assaults on Casillas’ goal. It all makes the scorer much more interesting. What Spain require, even above some restored arrogance and self-confidence, even above key players avoiding injury, is for a prolific striker to emerge. Morata has also been likened to Real Madrid and France striker Benzema . In Raúl’s day, his goals patched up the fact that Spain didn’t have a world-class XI. Good, but not great. When David Villa and Fernando Torres took charge they would, regularly, add the goal or goals which gave sense, confidence, and purpose to La Roja controlling play via Xavi, David Silva, Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Marcos Senna and Sergio Busquets. Cutting edge. Costa — if del Bosque accepts that more direct, more vertical football, quarter-backed by Cesc Fabregas, is central to the renovation — may become vital. Meantime there’s Morata — once of Real Madrid, lately of Juventus. His former Madrid mentor, Míchel, himself a mighty forward, recently said that Morata, whose debut goal on Friday was more valuable than it was beautiful, was ‘part van Basten, part Benzema’. Now that is praise. It’s meant to mean that he has the direct No 9 repertoire which accounts for his 32 goals for Spain at junior levels and his tournament top-scoring performance last time La Rojita won the European Under-21 Championship. Holland's Marco Van Basten is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time . Equally, it speaks of his awareness of space and how to profit from it. ‘Sometimes you have to really “love” football to understand strikers,’ he says. ‘To understand, or spot, their movements behind strikers, the process of “opening up a defence”. ‘Some people can’t see it. Some think that if you haven’t scored you’ve not had a good game. Right now, first-touch, fluid, strategic football is in fashion — the old style centre-forward who finishes but is static is a vanishing species. If you don’t have much more to your game, you won’t play.’ When he did get to play he chose the No 7 for his back. With Spain, just like at Manchester United, that’s a special number. It belonged to Raúl, record scorer until along came Villa — now Spain’s record scorer, and not formally retired. ‘I dream of scoring my first goal for La Roja,’ Morata said on Thursday. Then: ‘I was angry at myself for missing an earlier chance, so I didn’t really celebrate when I scored,’ he told me on Friday evening after the dream arrived. Good mindset. At Juve, he has struck up a ‘thing’ with Andrea Pirlo. ‘He never looks up when he hits you a first-time pass, but you learn. You anticipate.’ Just as he did against Ukraine to sprint onto Koke’s volley-pass. Some of Spain’s transition will be played out through the talents of this guy. Part van Basten, part Benzema. Taught by Pirlo.","Alvaro Morata scored on his Spain debut against Ukraine on Friday night .

"During an interview with Barclays Premier League World to be shown this week, Ross Barkley announces that his best position is striker. 'I can have my greatest impact there,' he claims. 'I'm free to roam around, take players on, have shots and create chances.' This season, the year when people were convinced Barkley would come of age in the colours of Everton, he has scored twice and created just two more. Little wonder he accepts he has had a dip in form. Ross Barkley (right) gets away from Italy's Roberto Soriano during England's 1-1 draw in Turin . The Everton midfielder loses the ball after a challenge from Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . Barkley replaced Theo Walcott in the second half and looked bright as the Three Lions earned a draw . The problem with Barkley, who showed flashes of his talent after coming on as a 55th-minute substitute during England's 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin, is that nobody is quite sure what his best position is. Ask everybody involved with him at Everton or with England and they will come up with a different answer. This season alone he has played in five different roles (six if his appearances as a substitute are included) for Everton: 10 in his favoured role off the main forward, six starts on the left, once in front of the back four, once in the centre of midfield and one start at right wing. At 21 there has to be an element of confusion, struggling to work out why his manager Roberto Martinez is playing him in so many different positions at Goodison Park. Barkley came off the bench as England beat Lithuania on Friday to stay on course for Euro 2016 . The 21-year-old replaced midfielder Jordan Henderson for the last 20 minutes at Wembley . For some players this would be an education, an opportunity to experience the game from different areas of the pitch as they continue their development. With Barkley, it feels very different. He has had such a billing since he first broke in to the Everton them, with comparisons to the late, great Alan Ball, to the mercurial talents of Paul Gascoigne over recent times, that his name creates mild hysteria whenever it is mentioned. It seems particularly unfair to compare him with Ball, a man who controlled the tempo of matches when he was playing for Everton, Arsenal and England. He was also, notably, a World Cup winner. It should also be remembered that Gascoigne, who had a far better goalscoring record at Newcastle, had to wait until he was 21 to make his England debut, against Denmark in 1988. Barkley has serious potential, something Roy Hodgson and his coaching staff recognise with his regular appearances in the England squad. They, too, are baffled by Barkley's failure to hold down a regular, fixed position with his club because he is attentive and willing to learn during England's training sessions. Barkley has been compared with Alan Ball - pictured on the left celebrating England's 1966 World Cup win . Paul Gacoigne - an England hero at the 1990 World Cup - is another former star Barkley has been likened to . 2011-12 Appearances 9 Goals 0 . 2012-13 Appearances 0 Goals 0 . Sheff Wed (loan) Appearances 13 Goals 4 . Leeds (loan) Appearances 4 Goals 0 . 2013-14 Appearances 38 Goals 7 . 2014-15 Appearances 28 Goals 2 . Barkley made his England debut in 2013 - he has 12 caps and no goals. There is a theory that Barkley, who began his career as central defender, would be better making those surging runs from deeper position. The problem is convincing Barkley to commit to the idea. In Miami last summer, after England had drawn a tune-up game 2-2 with Ecuador, he was encouraged by Hodgson to keep the ball, to be more intuitive and use it more wisely. There is a similar issue with Everton's central defender John Stones: he has outstanding attributes, but he is caught in possession, in dangerous areas of the pitch, too often. This is an area England's coaching staff have addressed with Barkley, showing him the hotspots when a careless ball or misplaced pass at the highest level can end in the back of Joe Hart's net. Against Scotland last November, when Hodgson placed enormous pressure on himself to secure a result at Celtic Park against an old rival, he was caught screaming expletives at Barkley after he came on as a substitute. There is certainly an element of frustration building up around this young player because has yet to convert his obvious talent into the complete, all round, match-winning performance. Barkley featured against Scotland last year but was on the receiving end of a Roy Hodgson blast at Parkhead . Like Barkley, Everton's John Stones (left) can also get caught in possession in dangerous areas of the pitch . There is certainly a demand for more goals, something he aspired to with those two shots that hit the woodwork during Everton's damaging 5-2 defeat by Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League. Last summer, when Barkley was in Miami preparing for the World Cup with England, Martinez told Sportsmail that his young midfielder needed room to breathe. 'We have to allow him to develop and let's not put too much pressure on him. At the moment he is perfectly suited to playing in the No 10 role, but in time he will develop into the complete midfielder.' At the moment he is a substitute for England, watching the games from the bench and listening to the advice of captain Wayne Rooney after the game with Lithuania on Friday. Rooney has taken a pastoral role in Barkley's welfare, offering him advice when he was named among England's substitutes for the 4-0 victory over Lithuania at Wembley last Friday. Barkley accepts that his form has dipped, well aware that he has yet to mature in to a role that suits club and country. When he settles on a preferred position, Barkley will be the biggest beneficiary. Barkley, keeping an eye on Manchester City playmaker David Silva, was expected to shine this season .

"There will come a time, hopefully soon, when Jose Mourinho accepts that the role of the television analysts and newspaper columnists is to pass comment on key decisions. Here at Stamford Bridge there were four moments - minute 18, minute 23, minute 46 and minute 56, as Mourinho refers to them - that affected the direction of this game. ‘Pundits are pundits and managers are managers,’ explained Chelsea’s manager after his team had been held to a 1-1 draw by an engaging and adventurous Southampton team at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho may one day accept that the role of pundits is to pass comment on key decisions . Yet again, after Mourinho's Chelsea drew with Southampton, Mourinho attacked his critics . ‘Pundits are paid to wear my suit, but I’m not paid to wear their suit or comment on their comments. ‘If one day I become a pundit I will wear a manager’s suit and win every game because that’s what pundits do. I can be phenomenal, like they are.’ He really has a bee in his bonnet over the role of Graeme Souness or Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, gravely offended that anyone could dare to criticise his tactics or his team. And so it goes on. This is Yawnsville and as unappealing as this will sound to Chelsea’s manager, the match officials are also tiring of his constant complaints. Here Mike Dean, the latest poor sap given the onerous duty of refereeing the Barclays Premier League leaders, was pretty much spot on. He made honest decisions for heaven’s sake, not judgments designed to haul Manchester City, Arsenal or Manchester United back into the title race. Referee Mike Dean was lumped with taking charge of Chelsea and on key decisions was pretty much spot on . Dean awarded this penalty to Southampton, scored by Dusan Tadic, which didn't please Mourinho . Chelsea were a goal to the good through Diego Costa when Mourinho’s faithful servant Rui Faria was sent down the tunnel to watch the television replay of the decision to award Southampton a penalty when Nemanja Matic fouled Sadio Mane. A few days ago, in the boisterous atmosphere of the second leg of their Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea’s players were guilty of kettling Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off. Here they largely kept their cool, with captain John Terry the only player in a blue shirt to contest the decision to award Saints the chance to level. ‘My view is not important because what is important is the referee’s view,’ claimed Mourinho. In any event, Dusan Tadic equalised. Diego Costa appeals for a penalty that would have seen Jose Fonte sent off had it been awarded . The biggest bone of contention was the failure of Dean to spot the delicate tap on Branislav Ivanovic inside the penalty area when Southampton’s goalscorer Tadic flicked out a boot. ‘Graeme Souness says it’s worse if a player asks for a yellow card than if a player kicks someone in the chest — that’s what he says — so my opinion is not opinion. What is important is Mr Mike Dean and his decision was no penalty on Ivanovic.’ There was, to Mourinho’s credit, a weary sigh when he was asked whether the decision to replace the sluggish figure of Matic with Ramires was to avoid an inevitable dismissal. Matic was booked in the first half for his challenge on Mane and should have been sent off when he clattered into Southampton’s deep-lying forward in the 46th minute. As ever, there was a sting in the tail. Fonte calls for Branislav Ivanovic to be booked for a dive but replays showed he been clipped by Tadic . ‘When that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow would come,’ admitted a doleful Mourinho. ‘With fast players like Mane coming out of midfield, driving the ball, that could happen. If you remember Ramires’ red card against Villa, obviously you are afraid of it.’ It is these comments, designed to twist the knife, that get people’s goat. There is no agenda and no-one is out to get Chelsea. As for the 56th-minute incident when Southampton captain Jose Fonte tackled Costa, you can make a case for either. ‘You have to control me here...’ claimed Mourinho. Matic was booked for the foul that gave away the penalty and should have got a second and sent off later on . He made no mention of Costa’s reaction — shoving Fonte in the chest as the pair waited for a corner kick to be taken in front of the Matthew Harding Stand. ‘Sky told me their pundits said it was a penalty, then I went to BBC and they said it wasn’t a penalty,’ he said. ‘I went to do the radio and they said it wasn’t. Now I come here and I think you’re saying it’s not a penalty. I’m not jumping with happiness and not crying with disappointment.’ Instead, it was just more of the same.","Jose Mourinho takes exception to criticism from TV pundits and writers .

"It wasn't just the Clasico — Victor Valdes always prepared for every game by imagining the worst things that could happen. He would muscle up his psychological preparedness by spending time mentally filing through the great times in his career, the things he valued highly in his personal life. If he had a stinker, or even if he had a blinder but still couldn't stop his opponents getting the better of Barcelona, then he would have a store of precious images and memories with which to dilute the pain of defeat or failure. He would rely on them. This will be Barca's first Clasico at the Nou Camp without Valdes at the club since 2002 - 13 years. Claudio Bravo in training at Barcelona's Joan Gamper base ahead of El Clasico against Real Madrid . Despite the million-kilowatt glare given off by the stars on the playing surface, I'll miss his presence — saturnine, deeply competitive, gently eccentric, hugely effective. Damn good at his job and one of the plethora of characters who have helped elevate this to the best, most regularly high-quality, most-watched game of football in the world. I am still learning what Claudio Bravo's mind usually does to him before a big game, and, vice versa, what the former Real Sociedad keeper tries to do to either dominate or harness the powerful psychological alert system which should be telling him, right about now: 'Oh no! Real Madrid again.' From the moment when David Beckham scored past him with a free-kick at the Anoeta Stadium in February 2007, where the ball squirted past Bravo like a wet, angry salmon trying to evade capture, the contest with Los Blancos has appeared to have been Bravo's Room 101. Following that Beckham moment, Bravo has faced Madrid 10 times, losing nine, drawing one and conceding 33 goals. Like Colin Montgomerie and a major golf tournament, Brazilian Ronaldo and the Champions League, Madrid are the sharpest thorn, digging into the goalkeeper's side. Bravo joined Barcelona in the summer of 2014 and is looking to improve his record against Real Madrid . Bravo comes up against Lionel Messi in 2012 while playing for former club Real Sociedad . Back in October, leading 1-0, perhaps he allowed himself to dream. But by the end it was 3-1 going on 6-1. It's important to be clear, in not one of Real's goals — Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty, Pepe's thunderous header, Karim Benzema's blitzkrieg counter-attack third — did the Chilean carry any blame. But here he is, guardian of a team expected to win — able to make a decisive statement about taking the title back, at a time when they are in the last eight of the Champions League and Copa del Rey finalists. His mind must have wandered to ... what if? He's already admitted: 'It's true, we do talk about the Treble... it's an achievement which was in this club's recent past and it would be fantastic to repeat. The Barcelona No 1 (right) and Jordi Masip Lopez train in preparation for the game against Real Madrid . 'But thinking about it and assuming it's going to happen are totally different things.' Right now Bravo is in line to win the important Ricardo Zamora Trophy for La Liga's stingiest keeper — 16 goals conceded in 27 matches. But, even given that statistic, he's yet to give, or be asked for, a display where he can definitively say: 'Those three points belong to me.' Chile's star of the World Cup admits it is still a learning process. 'People ask you the difference of playing at Barcelona compared to another team and it' s waiting. Waiting with total concentration, mental preparation, staying ready despite the fact that you might not be tested, not even involved for 20 or 30 minutes at a time. 'I tell myself that we are under attack, that at any second, including that one right then, something vital might be asked of me.' The match will be Barcelona's first Clasico at the Nou Camp without Victor Valdes in 13 years . Just under 105 metres away from him for most of the night will be someone who would have nodded, with a knowing grin, at all of those sentiments. This isn't the first time that some have reckoned that Iker Casillas is facing his final Clásico (and who knows whether the two sides might yet meet in the Champions League) — but neither Father Time nor the club's transfer market planners are on his side. If Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez has his way, this will be David de Gea's fixture next season. But, right now, it's San Iker's. The 4-3 loss to Schalke at the Bernabéu 12 days ago was the match which made all Barca fans say: 'Three points on March 22, for sure. Madrid have gone.' Valdes (right) joined Manchester United this season where he is currently No 2 behind David de Gea . But that's not so. Casillas was correctly blamed for at least two of those goals. But the impression that the game, and it's embarrassing defending, was definitive was false, I think. Casillas' desire, his cat-like alacrity seem diminished. But he's a feisty, cold-minded competitor and this matters the world to him. Thirty-seven times he' s played Barca, far more than any other rival. If this is his last, and he'd like there to be another six or seven before leaving in 2017, then he'll be determined to produce another save like the one which turned last October's clash. Losing 1-0 to Neymar's opener, Casillas made a point-blank save from Messi (who's scored 18 times past the Madrileño). Madrid weren't 2-0 down at home, Madrid pressed the accelerator and crushed Luis Enrique's side in 'Lucho's' first Clásico as a coach. It's an anecdote that Casillas' first Clasico at the Nou Camp, nearly 15 years ago, also saw the first goal he conceded to Barca — scored by that same Lucho. When the world watches this contest it will be in anticipation of another of the three-plus goal games we've seen over the last 10 years. But spare a thought for the Nou Camp Clasico debutant in one goal, and the legend in the other. Different lives, different men. Shared pressure.","Claudio Bravo preparing for El Clasico against Real Madrid .

"At some clubs, the association with a former manager or player is so strong, so deep, that they can never really move on. It is an itch, nagging away in the background because results are not coming up to scratch for the supporters who long for days when they were attached to someone special. Jose Mourinho is perhaps the most notorious example, promising Chelsea supporters that he would one day return to Stamford Bridge after he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in September 2007. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce could be on his way out of Upton Park when the season finishes . Allardyce had Diafra Sakho to thank for a return to winning ways at the weekend . This last-gasp goal from Sakho was enough to see off Sunderland and take the three points . They got their wish in the end when he returned to the club in the summer of 2013. Further back in time, Howard Kendall twice returned to Everton in an attempt to recreate his successful period at Goodison Park, where he won two league titles, the European Cup Winners’ Cup and the FA Cup. It was the same at Newcastle United, where Alan Shearer had scored 148 goals in the Barclays Premier League for his boyhood club; Kevin Keegan also returned to St James’ Park for a short stint in 2008. At Upton Park there is a similar dilemma, with the boardroom once again tempted to turn to Slaven Bilic at the end of the season. Every so often the momentum for Bilic builds at Upton Park and it is heading that way again because of the annual uncertainty over the future of Sam Allardyce. His name seems to stalk the corridors. Although Bilic only spent a season as a player at West Ham, his profile has increased over the years by dint of his tussles with England during his successful coaching career with Croatia. Slaven Bilic, seen here staring down a pitch invader last week as Besiktas crashed out of the Europa League, is continually linked with a return to West Ham as manager, having played for the club in the 1990s . Bilic (left) joined West Ham in 1996 and spent a year there before moving to Premier League rivals Everton . Hajduk Split - 2001-02 . Played 17 Won 11 Drawn 4 Lost 2 . Win % - 64.71 .

He is currently coaching Besiktas, second in the Turkish Super Lig going in to the international break after they were beaten by rivals Fenerbahce. The plan is to leave at the end of the season. Surprisingly they were beaten 5-2 on aggregate in the Europa League by Club Brugge, knocked out of the competition before they had reached the quarter-final. Bilic’s target now is win the title, to regain control of the Super Lig and finish above the leaders Galatasaray at the end of the season. That will add to his appeal. There is an aura about the man, a presence that few managers possess at the highest level of the game. Bilic belongs in that category. He wants English football, the chance to return to Upton Park as the club’s manager after spells with Lokomotiv Moscow and Besiktas. West Ham’s ownership structure, comprising David Sullivan, David Gold and Karren Brady, along with some influential voices on the fringes of the boardroom, have a decision to make at the end of the season. Had they been the types to appease supporters, Allardyce would have been sacked after their lame, 5-0 surrender at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup last season, which was immediately followed by a 6-0 defeat at Manchester City in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg. Alan Shearer (right) didn't have much to celebrate when he took over Newcastle after starring as a player . Howard Kendall (left), celebrating with Paul Bracewell after Everton sealed the First Division title in 1985, was in charge from 1981 until 1987 and returned to Goodison Park in 1990 and again in 1997 . Jose Mourinho always said he would come roaring back to Chelsea after leaving in 2007 . They finished the season in 13th, a respectable position for a team that had only just been promoted from the Championship under Allardyce’s leadership. But his contract is up in the summer and there has been little to suggest that he will stay beyond the end of the campaign. He is a good manager, underlined by his sharp thinking and the tactical switch he made within minutes of being handed Sunderland’s team-sheet on Saturday. Sunderland’s new manager Dick Advocaat spooked him by playing three forwards in his first game, starting Connor Wickham, Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe up front as part of a surprise attacking strategy. Allardyce responded instantly, sensing a vulnerability down the flanks and telling his team to flood the wide area. Hammers old boy Jermain Defoe was kept quiet by Allardyce's men at Upton Park . Allardyce was able to change his tactics at short notice to get the better of Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat . By the end of the game they had crossed the ball 42 times, winning for the first time in nine when Diafra Sakho scored in the 89th minute. Allardyce accepts that the results of his team have not been good of late, mindful that a dip in form in the second half of the season could affect his future at the club. There has been friction all year, manifesting itself when Sullivan claimed just after Christmas that football management was not a science. ‘The longer you are in the game and the longer you’ve had the manager, you get involved more and more because when you see your money wasted year after year, you think “I could do as good as that”,’ admitted Sullivan. ‘And you really can, you know. I know that sounds daft but if you’ve had 20 years of buying players, seeing money spent, they’re not geniuses.’ Perhaps not, but to move on and build a team ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2017, there is a view that Bilic fits the bill. Sometimes, you just can’t get them out of your head.","West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is out of contract in the summer .

"Back in 2001 the former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein took part in a BBC documentary called The Five Men Who Changed English Football. ‘I was voted to join the Arsenal board in October 1993, I still had my old business at the time and decided that I felt football was really a sleeping giant and still had a long way to go,’ he told the programme makers. ‘Particularly after spending time in the States and seeing how the Americans operated their sport, particularly American football and baseball and basketball.’ Crystal Palace thumped QPR on Saturday - Joel Ward is pictured celebrating the third goal in their 3-1 victory . Wilfried Zaha took one for the team as he clattered into the post during Palace's win over Rangers . Dein, who sold his stake in Arsenal to Uzbekistan billionaire Alisher Usmanov for £75m six years later, is regarded as a visionary. Overseas investment has become an accepted practice in the Barclays Premier League, an attractive market because the top 20 teams in English football pull in more than £3bn a season through television, commercial and gate receipts. Soon it will be the turn of the Crystal Palace board, the four men who formed CPFC2010, to convince the club’s supporters that the US dollar will enhance the club’s long-term prospects. When it comes round to your team, it certainly sharpens the senses. What are the motives behind the investment? Why now? Will they develop the stadium? Will they improve the team? What will happen if it all goes wrong? Billionaire Josh Harris is set to join the list of American owners in the Barclays Premier League . Crystal Palace owners (from left) Stephen Browett, Jeremy Hosking, Martin Long and Steve Parish with sponsor Bill Hill in the middle holding the shirt . David Dein (centre), who sold his stake in Arsenal for £75m, is regarded as a visionary . Assuming the takeover by the American billionaire Josh Harris is confirmed, the ownership constitution in the Premier League will be comprised: . United States (Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Sunderland, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace). Russia (Chelsea); United Arab Emirates (Manchester City); Switzerland (Southampton); Malaysia (QPR); Thailand (Leicester); Egypt (Hull City). Swansea, another team involved in takeover talks recently, are currently owned by a group of astute Welsh businessmen. Seven top-flight teams - Tottenham, Stoke City, West Ham, Newcastle, West Brom, Everton and Burnley - remain in English hands. Manager Alan Pardew has Palace sitting in mid-table since returning to Selhurst Park from Newcastle . There will be a good deal of Palace fans who will be sceptical about overseas investment, wondering how a club embedded in the streets of south London came to be owned by mega-wealthy Americans. Visibility is usually one of the main concerns. ‘Silent’ Stan Kroenke, who gathered a few more shares in Arsenal earlier this week, only speaks to supporters at the AGM because they put pressure on the club to hear from him. Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in July 2003 and the fans have never once heard the Russian billionaire speak about his association with the club. They will live with it because Chelsea have won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, the Champions League and Europa League since Abramovich took control. Results usually do the trick. South of the river, potential is a dirty word at Palace because people have been talking about the size of the club ever since 51,482 crammed into Selhurst Park to see them promoted to the old First Division in May 1979. Back then Raymond Bloye, a Chelsea fan who harboured ambitions to buy the west London club, was the owner and chairman of Palace. Utopia for most supporters is for the Jack Walker-type, the local boy who made his fortune in the steel industry, to walk through the door and spend his money building a team of champions. Walker lived in Jersey, presumably for tax reasons, and nobody complained about his proximity to Ewood Park when Tim Sherwood lifted the Premier League title in 1995. It worked for them. Jack Walker pumped his money into Blackburn -  Alan Shearer (left) and Chris Sutton hold aloft the Premier League trophy after Rovers finished top of the pile in 1995 . At Selhurst Park, the four men who saved the club from oblivion in 2010, taking them out of administration and into the Premier League, are all mad Palace fans. Stephen Browett, one of the shareholders, admits he bought into Palace ‘to stop my Saturday afternoons being ruined’ when the club were in administration. Fan ownership, though, is not always such a success. Mark Goldberg and Simon Jordan, both Palace supporters and successive owners of the club, took them into administration on separate occasions. History is important, particularly to football supporters, but it can also stifle progress. Change has to be for the better. At Palace this means the redevelopment of the stadium, a must if the team are to compete long-term in the Premier League, investment in better players and an infrastructure off the field to cope with the increasing demands of football at that level. When the Premier League was formed in 1992, all 22 member clubs were owned by a spread of, mainly, British-based businessmen. Liverpool, champions of the old First Divison on 18 occasions, were still under the guidance of the Moores family. Redeveloping Selhurst Park is a must for Palace to compete long-term in the Premier League . Is it time for the Eagles to fly higher than ever before under new ownership? Philip Carter, who was among those who championed the idea of a breakaway league, had presided some of the greatest moments in Everton’s history. Tottenham were owned by property investor Irving Scholar; Sam Hammam, born in Lebanon and living in England, was chairman of Wimbledon. Fred Reacher had recently succeeded Maurice Roworth at Nottingham Forest. And so it went on. In those days stadiums were operating at 69.6 per cent of capacity and the combined turnover of Premier League teams was £45m. Compare that with the present-day statistics, where stadiums run at 96 per cent capacity and turnover has reached record levels, it is inevitable that Premier League teams attract overseas interest. In south London, supporting Palace is about to change forever. On that basis it’s run to catch up, or get left behind.","Crystal Palace set to be the next English club under American ownership .

"There is so much resting on Wednesday’s return leg between Barcelona and Manchester City. The vast torrent of money which flows into a club’s financial reservoirs for progression. The job security of both Manuel Pellegrini and Luis Enrique. The fascinating battle of pride and self-respect between Spanish and English football. Might it become part of all of England’s representatives exiting the Champions League before the quarter-finals? Xavi (left) and Frank Lampard have been two legends of Champions League football over the past decade . Lampard could be playing his final Champions League game if he faces Barcelona on Wednesday . Lampard has been on the fringes of the Manchester City team since extending his loan spell . The culture clash is slighter than usual given that City are self-acknowledged pretenders to the Barcelona crown. Development, passing style, player selection, executive stewardship — they want to squeeze the best out of what Rinus Michels, Johan Cruyff and then Pep Guardiola instilled in the Catalan club, but with added Anglo-Saxon steel, organisation, petro-dollar resources and hungry, aspirational fans. However, the Champions League is a wider tasting plate than that. This is where ‘the greats’ measure themselves. And, sadly, two of the all-time European greats, Xavi and Frank Lampard, face the prospect of arriving at the Nou Camp at about 7.30pm Spanish time, not being listed in the starting XIs... then one of them leaving in the knowledge that that was their last ever night in the competition. What a sore thought. Xavi is a club legend at Barcelona, but has also become increasingly a fringe player this season . When he has played, Xavi is still providing assists, and is a vital part of the set-up off the pitch too . Xavi, who Barcelona’s managing director was trying to sell when I arrived in this city in 2002, is the leading all-time appearance maker in the Champions League. Thirty-eight matches ahead of the next active outfield player — Cristiano Ronaldo. Even if CR7 inspired Madrid to retain their trophy this season, then won the next two Champions Leagues consecutively, he’d still be seven matches short of tying the Catalan. The 35-year-old has three winner’s medals, two more than Lampard, who is a year-and-a-half older. But in reality, Xavi has played precisely an hour less in Champions League Finals. A horrible knee injury in 2006 meant he never stepped off the bench against Arsenal when Barca came back from a 1-0 deficit and won 2-1 thanks to Samuel Eto’o and Juliano Belletti. In his other two triumphs, 2009 and 2011, he gave fabulous goal assists for Lionel Messi’s header in Rome and Pedro’s opener against Edwin van der Sar at Wembley. Lampard was a different case. He confessed to me that after so many semi-final disappointments, following the horror of losing in Moscow (where he scored), it felt a little as if Chelsea were cursed. Precisely the opposite of how he felt the last time he was in this stadium. Lampard is due to join MLS club New York City at the end of the season, while Xavi rejected the same move . The Chelsea legend has been a Champions League mainstay for over a decade, but could bow out this week . Few pick it out now but not only was his performance for Chelsea in the 2012 semi-final precisely what City require tonight from someone, his return pass to Ramires to make it 2-1 was exquisite. Javier Mascherano’s thumping challenge sets Lampard back a pace but holds it off and holds the ball. Off-balance and facing the wrong way, he slots a delicious right-footed, slide-rule through Xavi, Carles Puyol and Sergio Busquets for Ramires to stride on to and lob Victor Valdés. One of the great assists. He had already done something similar in the first leg, robbing Messi of the ball with precisely the kind of sharp, anticipatory pressing which City have lacked across three consecutive defeats to Barca. Then a fabulous reverse-pass for Ramires to set up Didier Drogba’s close-range winner. I had the great fortune to interview Lampard in the dressing room of the Allianz Arena in Munich about an hour after Chelsea beat Bayern in that dramatic 120-minute final. Penalties. He scored his, of course. Third taker in Moscow, third taker in Munich. Back of the net. Frank Lampard celebrates with the Champions League after the 2012 victory over Bayern Munich . He was cradling the cup with the big ears and told me: ‘We’ve been a group since the troubled times, since we beat Barcelona.’ The Nou Camp was his turning point. The catalyst to him finally winning this tournament. Right now he feels stagnant, frustrated. Why stay at City, rather than begin the season properly with New York City if Pellegrini isn’t going to play him regularly? It was City’s initiative, not Lampard’s, to stay on beyond the initial few months which were agreed. Xavi would understand. His appearances since deciding to turn down moves to New York City, who admit they still want him to join David Villa and Lampard, or to Qatar, have been limited. When picked, he’s performed — goal assists in his last couple of matches. When not picked, he’s been a voice for calm and reason at times when Luis Enrique’s first term threatened to degenerate into chaos. Xavi, as captain, played a huge role in calming stormy waters between Luis Enrique and Messi in early January when the former dropped the latter for the defeat at Real Sociedad and the Argentine then, coincidentally, didn’t come in to train the following day. All of which followed a stand-up row between the genius and the iron-fist coach in training. Xavi brokered peace. Xavi holds the record for most games played in the Champions League, 38 games ahead of his nearest rival . If Cristiano Ronaldo won the Champions League this season and the two that follow, he'd still be behind Xavi . I’ve spoken to both Lampard and Xavi about the other. The Catalan will admit that tracking his English opponent has been a nightmare. Perpetual motion, perpetual determination to haul his team forward, make them competitive. Lampard once told me that England’s 2009 defeat to Spain in Seville, featuring him, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, was the first real experience in his career where one midfield simply couldn’t get the ball off the other. It was both galling and educational to him. It’s feasible that next season the two are in midfield together for New York. It very nearly happened in 2004 when Lampard’s agent represented Patrick Vieira. Called to meet Txiki Begiristain at the Nou Camp, it became clear that the Frenchman signing wasn’t feasible but Begiristain demanded to know how he could bring Lampard instead. Ten years later, for City, Begiristain joined the dots. But when Xavi was asked to name his best ‘England’ XI, it contained Lampard — in a 3-5-2 of Forster: Ferdinand, Campbell, Terry; Giggs, Scholes, Gascoigne, Lampard, Gerrard; Walcott, Rooney . His rationale was: ‘He’s one of the very few midfielders who scores a striker’s number of goals — which is a mark of greatness — and he’s technically excellent.’ And Xavi told the Guardian’s Sid Lowe about England’s style that it had been ‘...no football. Carragher, boom, up top; Terry, boom, up top. I think it’s changing: Lampard, Gerrard… they are players who treat the ball [well]. You see them now and you think, dammit, they are trying to play!’ So, however it goes on Wednesday, here’s a plea to the coaches: Let them play.","One of these two could play their final Champions League game this week .
Both Xavi and Frank Lampard have been fringe players this season .
Both still have plenty to offer, but Lampard is moving to New York City .
Xavi still brings assists, but is used increasingly infrequently ."
"It would be lovely to think that Nick Cruwys will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters. At the time of writing he is in a coma, fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of Wolverhampton Wanderers fans as he made his way to the railway station after Watford's 2-2 draw at Molineux on Saturday. A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches. Watford fan Nick Cruwys (left) is currently in a coma after being ambushed by a group of Wolves fans as he made his way to the station following the 2-2 draw in the Championship fixture (right) at Molineux on Saturday .

Watford fan Nick Cruwys lies on the ground as he is attacked following his side's draw with Wolves . Cruwys is currently in an induced coma and fighting for his life in hospital . Cruwys was heading to Wolverhampton train station when he was subjected to an 'unprovoked attack' The initial target was £1,000 but by Tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £22,089. Football can respond in the most remarkable ways, but these supporters know that society's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place. We have a tendency to move on so quickly, to switch on the television set, to sit down to watch Liverpool against Blackburn and then look forward to a mouth-watering FA Cup tie between Manchester United and Arsenal. It is natural. Always looking forward, leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on Saturday. Nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. But sometimes we must pause for thought, to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. To wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband, their dad, their son, is lying in a hospital, in a coma, may never wake up. Cruwys was making his way to the train station after the 2-2 draw between the sides at Molineux (pictured) Troy Deeney (left) stretches out top convert the equaliser  for Watford who took a point in a 2-2 draw . Deeney celebrates after his goal prevented rivals Wolves from taking all three points in the promotion race . Or to consider his friends, the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station. Or the innocent bystanders, the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place. They, too, will be traumatised. Then there are the perpetrators, the thugs who are responsible for this attack. Are they proud men today, or hiding like cowards? Cruwys is a football fan like me or you, following his team - Watford, in this case - around the country on a Saturday afternoon. There is a rising tide in the sport, the 'Who-Wants-Some?' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from Villa Park last weekend. What is the motivation for this? Please don't say a 5.30pm kick-off meaning lads full of ale, because that is no excuse either. We cannot put a news value on someone's existence either, just because the team Cruwys follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the Barclays Premier League each weekend. This is someone's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues. Aston Villa fans storm on to the Villa Park pitch after their 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup . The 5.30pm kick-off in the West Midlands derby on Saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans . West Midlands Police are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days. There is a desire to do more, to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people, however small their number, throwing punches, even in isolated incidents. For Cruwys and his friends, who were among the 2,239 Watford supporters who made the trip to Wolves, the game was a real nail-biter. Leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point. The Watford great Kenny Jackett, a long-serving player and former manager at Vicarage Road, is now manager of Wolves. He remains a popular figure with their fans. Towards the end of a riveting 2-2 draw, Wolves defender Bakary Sako was sent off when Watford substitute Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face. That incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett is a former Watford player and manager and remains a popular figure with fans . Bakary Sako was sent off after Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face following an altercation . To think Cruwys's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory. This is the unacceptable face of the game, a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums. According to Home Office statistics there were only 2,273 football-related arrests last year, which includes all four divisions, plus European competitions and internationals. It is the lowest since records began. Last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested. The numbers look good on paper, but the Home Office also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests. If 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at Villa Park - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned . Fans charge towards Scott Sinclair and his team-mates after his goal against West Brom on Saturday . For example, let's say around 5,000 Villa supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2-0 victory over West Brom in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Theoretically, every one of them could be arrested and banned from Villa Park for life. It will never happen, which is why those Home Office statistics can easily be distorted. There is certainly some grim reading in the West Midlands at the moment, with the police force making further appeals on Monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in Wolverhampton. Wrong place, wrong time? Don't give me that.

"Host commentator . Ashton: The club need to be supportive off the field, to create an environment so that his family can settle in the north west and enjoy their life in Cheshire. His wife wants to leave the country and return to Argentina, and Di Maria is wrestling with that decision: Let her leave with the children and leave him to continue his United career, or move to another club more suited to their lifestyle in Europe. Tough one. CLICK HERE TO READ NEIL ASHTON'S FULL PLAYER RATINGS FROM OLD TRAFFORD . Ashton: Without a doubt. He looked the business with his great Ajax team in the Nineties and he has an excellent record in European football. The problem is that he has under-estimated some of the demands and the customs of English football, such as the Capital One Cup defeat at MK Dons and the failure to inspire the supporters at Old Trafford. He claimed United would be stronger in the second half of the season. They actually look disillusioned and directionless. Ashton: Busy. I was surprised that Van Gaal did not build from the back when he arrived, buying top class defenders (although I like Marcos Rojo) to make sure United would be difficult to beat. Everybody with a passing interest in the club knew that they would need defensive reinforcements after Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra left. The task of rescuing United and turning them into a formidable attacking presence again was bigger than he thought, possibly too big. Ashton: Not a lot, but at the pressure moment of the game he delivered. He spotted the back pass, the opportunity to take Arsenal into the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley if he could take advantage inside a stadium where he has only ever known what it is like to play in red. To finish the way he did, clipping the ball around the advancing figure of David de Dea, was a moment of composure and genuine class. CLICK HERE TO READ NEIL ASHTON'S FULL PLAYER RATINGS FROM OLD TRAFFORD . Ashton: Absolutely right. Van Gaal was dismissive of him when he decided to sell, claiming that he was not of the standard required for his new United team. He had been fairly anonymous until his goal, but he took it brilliantly. When he was substituted he showed respect for his surroundings by clapping all four corners of the stadium. You know in his heart of hearts he would still like to be a United player, but the decision was taken away from him. Ashton: History is on Arsenal’s side because they have won the trophy five times under Wenger. If Liverpool reach the final then it will be difficult for them to deviate from the narrative about it being a fitting send off for the captain Steven Gerrard before his move to LA Galaxy. The reality is that it would be a distraction, particularly for a team that hasn't won the competition since 2006. Having said that, Gerrard’s contribution to the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham was superhuman. You could not rule out something special. Ashton: United measure their seasons on silverware, not top four finishes. At the moment they are making up the numbers, trying to work out where they are heading under a manager who appears uncertain of his own values. Van Gaal is becoming increasingly tetchy and his response on Monday evening, sarcastically batting away questions, is a sure sign that he is under pressure. Finishing in the top four would be an achievement, nothing more. Ashton: Yes. To win a sixth FA Cup under one manager would be impressive, but Wenger wants another crack at the Premier League title before he calls it quits at the Emirates. To do that he will need a better squad, not team, than Chelsea and Manchester City. As good as Arsenal look at times, they do not have the muscular presence and stature of Chelsea. Ashton: A quiet word is needed because English football frowns upon it. I do actually have sympathy in some instances because I’m sure that a lot of players throw themselves to the floor to avoid robust challenges in situations where they think they might get injured or seriously hurt by an opposition player. Gareth Bale is a case in point, because he had a terrible reputation for diving when he was at Spurs. Ashton: He has added a protective force in the shape of Coquelin, an unexpected bonus after he was sent out on loan to Charlton. He has made the grade because he has finally listened to the coaches who told him that he could have a career in the position, provided he sacrificed his initial preference to be more extravagant on the ball. The big test is whether he can get the better of Nemanja Matic in the big games with Chelsea. If he can’t get to grips with him then they will be second best again next season. Ashton: It was a bizarre decision to substitute two players at half-time because United were in the ascendency after Rooney scored the equaliser. After the game Wenger even conceded that his players had been demoralised at half-time because they felt they did not deserve to have been pegged back. Van Gaal should have persisted for a little while longer, but the changes disrupted the team’s rhythm. It felt like a big mistake at the time and an even bigger one when Arsenal scored the winner. Ashton: I am not sure he has a philosophy because he urges caution and does not want to play with risk, and yet he makes two huge gambles at half-time with his substitutions. Everybody can bring in players, but has he really identified the players who can turn United in to a team capable of challenging for the top four? Patience is beginning to wear thin.

"It's probably  totally to do with my age I'm sure, but I don't think of the Eighties as that old. Big hair on our heads. Madonna in a state of undress. House music on the dancefloors. Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet on tour. I could be describing last weekend, let alone something that is in fact four decades old. But I am happy to commit that era to the past if it means Sky Sport's new documentary 'Chelsea: Black & Blue' can be seen as a truly historical document. Chelsea's first black footballer Paul Canoville has been the subject of documentary Chelsea: Black & Blue . Talented Chelsea winger Caoville was racially abused by his own supporters during the Eighties . Canoville was targeted by racists after signing for Chelsea in 1981 before making his debut a year later . BORN: England, March 4, 1962 (age 52) 1981-1986: Chelsea (79 lg apps, 11 gls) 1986-1987: Reading (16, 4) 1988-1989: Enfield (9, 2) 1990-1991: Maidenhead United (17, 3) Because it told the incredible story of Paul Canoville, the talented young winger who in 1982 became Chelsea's first black player. And in doing so, also told of the torrid time he had in that pioneering role; one which, as we go on to discover, was in fact crucial in the development of both the club and its supporters. Yet this is not all. Because although this was clearly a massive part of Paul's life and career, it paled in comparison to some of the other adversities that he has faced. Adversities that, as a viewer and a human being, you ultimately are delighted this incredible individual has gone on to overcome. In 'Chelsea: Black & Blue', Canoville proved himself more than eloquently capable of recalling how it was for him from the time he signed professional forms from his local club Hillingdon Borough in 1981. He talked vividly and emotionally, for example, about warming up as a sub for his debut at Crystal Palace the next year, and thinking 'are they for real?' as he heard a torrent of racial abuse. Then on turning and telling them to 'say that to my face', he discovered 'it was my own fans'. 'All I wanted to do was get off the pitch,' he added, and this was only the beginning of how life was going to be as a pioneer at the club. A time that ended when 'one of their favourites called me a racist name. I didn't take it too well. And I was edged out.' Canoville pictured during a Chelsea match in 2008 as the former players got together at the training ground . Canoville makes a prize draw during a Premier League match between Chelsea and Blackburn in 2009 . This 'favourite', although discussed, is never named in the documentary. In between Paul's heartfelt confessions are testimonials from other men who'd had a vested interest in Canoville's career. And they all gave a vivid context to the times in which Canoville was making his way in the game. DJ Trevor Nelson is a lifelong Chelsea fan and recalled walking down the Kings Road at this time with 'the National Front trying to recruit. Imagine how that felt being a little black kid'. Omid Djalili, who was also a regular at Stamford Bridge during these times, recalled 'Chelsea fans fighting each other'. While Pat Nevin, a team-mate of Canoville's, had seen and heard this hardcore of 'not fans...users of Chelsea Football Club', and chose to use a post match press conference to take a stand against the abuse. Ultimately though, Michael Duberry was able to talk in the documentary about 'the luxury' of just being able to be a footballer because of what Canoville had gone through. While he also pointed out that Paul should be 'acknowledged a lot more for shutting down and changing the way people see Chelsea.' Chelsea's Canoville (right) gets away from Arsenal's Brian Talbot in a London derby match in the Eighties . Canoville scores for Chelsea in December 1983 after making his debut two years earlier for the club . Canoville was approached by a fan, he reveals in the documentary, that regretted the way he treated him . Yet for Canoville during the Eighties, kudos was the least of his priorities. Because it was the beginning of a period in his life that saw him disappear from the game prematurely through injury, go broke, turn to drugs, get clean, twice be diagnosed and beat cancer, and lose a son at just nine days old who 'died in my arms'. Yet in spite of, or more likely because of all of this, we discover at the end of 'Chelsea: Black & Blue' that he is now working in the community for his old club, mentoring and advising kids in school. Not only that, he is also going back to see his old team. Where one night, he told us, a fan approached him because he needed to apologise to Canoville for having been one of those racist abusers. With a tear in his eye, the former winger told us of how the fan said: 'I was ignorant. I was following my dad. I didn't know better. I realise now...and I tell my kids about racism.' Paul said: 'I got to respect that. I do respect that.' It is a life-affirming story, and one that not only hopefully confirms that those tales from the Eighties are fundamentally a thing of the past, but also that Paul Canoville himself has a future that is well worth looking forward to.","The new Sky Sports documentary goes through the life of Paul Canoville .

"When Jose Mourinho returned to English football in 2013, he produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket to claim it was the only thing that had changed in six years away from Chelsea. This time Mourinho has read the small print, carrying out Roman Abramovich’s vision for his club to be self-financing and operating within UEFA’s strict Financial Fair Play guidelines. They were rather more gung-ho in 2004, spraying money around Europe to sign some of the best talent in the game to make sure Chelsea cleaned up in Mourinho’s first three seasons at Stamford Bridge. From July 1, 2004 to July 20, 2004, Abramovich splashed £89million on seven players — including Petr Cech, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba — in a whirlwind shopping spree. They finished the season with the title. Jose Mourinho won his first trophy since returning to England when Chelsea beat Tottenham on Sunday . The Portuguese manager has reduced spending at the club but has continued to bring success . Players like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been brought to the club and proved a huge success . On Sunday evening, less than half an hour after John Terry had lifted the Capital One Cup, Chelsea’s manager claimed the club are now operating in the ‘third tier’ of clubs. Financial Fair Play has become something of a hobby horse of Mourinho in recent months. He highlights the money-no-object strategies of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain while emphasising how Chelsea are working within strict, fiscal parameters. ‘There are teams who don’t care about FFP and are punished, but they play,’ he added. ‘Then there is a group, which Chelsea are in, the group who care about FFP.’ Last week, City manager Manuel Pellegrini did not have the confidence to start Eliaquim Mangala, who cost £32m last summer, alongside captain Vincent Kompany against Barcelona. After Chelsea collected the Capital One Cup, a trophy City won last season, Mourinho referred to £11m signing Kurt Zouma, 20, as his ‘Marcel Desailly’ after a mature performance alongside Ramires in midfield. Whichever way you look at it, the numbers add up for Mourinho as he turns his attention to winning his third Premier League title. Chelsea sold defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for a staggering £50million last summer . Juan Mata was a star player for Chelsea but when Mourinho arrived he sold him to Manchester United . Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku was sold to Everton for £28m, giving Chelsea a considerable profit . The average age of his Chelsea team at Wembley on Sunday was 27 years and three months compared to the 28 of City, beaten 2-1 by Liverpool at Anfield earlier in the day. And Mourinho’s squad looks the better long-term bet. Once a player has worn that blue shirt, there is an automatic premium, as Mourinho has used to great effect, whenever he decides to move them on. They made a profit of about £18m on Romelu Lukaku, who made just 10 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, when he was sold to Everton before the start of the season. Juan Mata was moved on to Manchester United for £37m and David Luiz went to PSG for £50m. All three, among others, were astute business decisions. In return he signed Diego Costa, who played in last season’s Champions League final for Atletico Madrid, and Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona. Good business all round. At this point it would be remiss not to mention Chelsea’s record shirt sponsorship deal with a tyre manufacturer, which rolls in next season, or their claim that they have 500m fans around the world. Some of them were fortunate enough to be at Wembley as their side beat London rivals Tottenham 2-0 to claim the first meaningful trophy of the season. Mourinho is building a team around a young group of stars like Belgium international Eden Hazard . Chelsea recently announced a new lucrative sponsorship deal with Japanese company Yokohama . The new lucrative endorsement is double the amount of the clubs current sponsors Samsung . Mourinho prepared for the final like a battleship commander, wisely using the eight days he had with his squad after the 1-1 draw with Burnley in the Premier League on February 21. Mourinho took advantage of Tottenham’s misfortune, a team who had just one full training session following Thursday’s elimination from the Europa League to prepare for Sunday’s showpiece. It was an important win for Mourinho, highlighted by the manager’s celebrations with his assistant Rui Faria in the technical area. ‘As you know, this country is very difficult,’ he added. ‘If you look at how difficult it is to qualify for the Champions League, you can imagine how difficult it is to win the Premier League. ‘We are speaking about Chelsea, City, United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Southampton, seven teams for four positions.’ There was relief for Chelsea’s players, too, because they are finally starting to deliver for a manager who admitted it had ‘felt like 20 years’ when he went two years without winning silverware. John Terry believes the Capital One Cup success ca act as a springboard for future trophies . The Chelsea squad and their manager celebrate beating Tottenham in the final at Wembley Stadium . The expensively assembled squad from Mourinho's first reign at Chelsea . There were players at Wembley who have won a European Cup — Terry and Gary Cahill among them — but they celebrated this triumph as if it was the first trophy of their careers. There was a reason for that. ‘It was important to get our first trophy together,’ admitted Terry. ‘I spoke about this being the springboard, like it did when the manager came here in 2004/05. It had that affect then and hopefully it does now.’ Mourinho is a trophy-hunter manager, sniffing out the game’s honours in a coaching career that has taken him to Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid in the past decade. The Capital One Cup meant so much, not because of the size of the prize, but because it proved to this group of players that they can cross the finish line and win the game’s major honours using his methods. Mourinho said: ‘You see the semi-finals we played against Liverpool, you see Tottenham going to Fiorentina and they played with players they didn’t use at Wembley. ‘They saved players to win the Cup. In this country it’s much more difficult to win than in my first period.’ Now, when Mourinho arrives at West Ham on Wednesday for a Premier League clash, his eyes will be on a bigger prize.","Chelsea more careful with their money since Jose Mourinho returned .
The Blues are selling players for huge fees and investing wisely .
Mourinho has been boasting that the club are complying with FFP .
The Capital One Cup success was Mourinho's first trophy since returning .

"A couple of weeks back, after Chelsea’s fiery 1-0 win over Everton, Twitter’s support team took swift and decisive action over a series of deeply unpleasant tweets. On February 10, 2015, one user wrote ‘I hope you get shot you utter w*****’ in response to a piece I had written about Branislav Ivanovic’s reaction to Everton substitute James McCarthy. The same day, an Arsenal supporter sent the message ‘kill yourself’, without even referencing anything I'd written about the club. It was by no means a unique experience. Branislav Ivanovic got to grips with James McCarthy in angry exchange during Chelsea's win over Everton... The incident, a major flashpoint in the game at Stamford Bridge last month, was covered by reporters... And at that point the Twitter users took it as their invite to join the party . Click HERE to follow Neil Ashton on Twitter . There was worse, much worse, but publishing the depressing details, which would bring a family member of mine into the public domain, would be an invasion of privacy - and the accounts involved, along with many others that week, were suspended for violating Twitter’s rules. The motivation behind this piece is because the Daily Mail’s head of sport was genuinely taken aback by the scale and sheer venom of the attacks that can take place on this forum. This is the life of a football reporter in 2015, waking up to indiscriminate messages each morning in the same casual manner you check your phone for texts. Social media should be a theatre for healthy debate, a chance to forcefully bat around some ideas or opinions about a sport many of us have devoted our lives to. Unfortunately Twitter has become the elephant in the room, the one subject we are reluctant to discuss in depth because an admission that the medium can be psychologically taxing is perceived as a weakness. Toughen up, grow some, and all those other things people say when they are unable to accept that these are serious issues to confront. The experiences described above are by no means novel: on the night of Saturday December 11, 2010 it was impossible to monitor the number of people who threatened my life when Carlos Tevez’s transfer request was reported. A piece about Carlos Tevez, pictured here unhappy at being substituted by Roberto Mancini in December 2010, just before his transfer request, did not go down too well with some people out in cyber space . Tevez is much happier now at Juventus... Twitter can still be just as horrible and angry a place though . There are people who will tell you that this is part of the game, that these attacks are just Twitter trolls hiding behind the anonymity of a keyboard in a bedroom at their parents’ house. If it is true, it doesn’t mean we have to accept it, either. To many we have the best job in the world, roaming the country to watch the biggest matches in the Barclays Premier League and heading overseas for the Champions League, or with the national team at World Cups. This is the boyhood dream, a personal obsession after realising at a very, very early age that a career playing the sport professionally would be beyond question. Twitter is a modern phenomenon, a bear pit for the football reporters who cross a very fine line when they write about some of the most high-profile issues in the game. Neil during an interview with Adel Taarabt last year when the QPR player responded to comments made by then-manager Harry Redknapp. Taarabt was answering claims he was overweight . Neil is up for sports news reporter of the year at the British Sports Journalism Awards this month - an award he won during his time at the News of the World (above with long-time Daily Mirror man John Jackson) Many will argue that journalists, with the undoubted privileges we enjoy at times, are fair game. Others will have similar experiences and many - admirably, as it happens - put it down to a hazard of the job. Goodness knows we dish out enough stick to clubs and managers over the decisions they make and there will be people who argue that we should learn to take our medicine. The abuse, though, is pure cyanide. Sadly it also affects dialogue, with sensible tweets often lost in an avalanche of poison if you happen to write something even remotely controversial about a team, a player or manager. Errors are seized upon, with reporters called to account in a way that was never possible until Jack Dorsey and Co dreamed up Twitter in 2006. It’s fine to spar, with people such as @cfcaway, @terrencethecat or @wisepoyet frequently pulling me up on pieces that have been written about the goings-on at Chelsea. They never overstep the mark, but they do have an opinion and can, on occasion, show a sense of humour. They enjoy the exchanges. Jack Dorsey, pictured in October last year, is a co-founder of Twitter . Surely this is an environment we should encourage, to take responsibility and trade messages about subjects in an atmosphere that is not intoxicated with bile, abuse, threats or intimidation. It feels naive to write that, particularly when you learn about the experience of Gaelic Athletic Association referee Patrick Nelis in 2013. He attempted suicide after he was bombarded with, among other things, abuse such as ‘fat, red hamster’ on social media. How sad that it came to that. It is little wonder that Twitter’s chief executive Dick Costolo told the company’s staff, in a leaked email in mid-February, that it was time to clampdown on the pollution in this social forum. ‘We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years,’ he told employees. (From left) Dorsey, at the New York Stock Exchange in 2013 with co-founders Biz Stone, Evan Williams and chief executive Dick Costolo, who outlined the need to find a way of getting rid of the pollution on Twitter . ‘It’s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day.’ In the days after Costolo’s memorandum was leaked to the media, the company began to take action on the users mentioned above, along with scores of others who were being abusive or harassing people. When they suspended the account of one, he returned under a different guise on Monday evening to warn that that I was no longer safe. People like that need to be educated. This is an opportunity for Twitter to evolve, to make it clear that this remarkable concept is to be used in a way that is socially acceptable. The issue of trolling, as we know, is not confined to sport. In September 2013 the Met Police admitted they were powerless at times to investigate and prosecute Twitter trolls for their hounding of various public figures. Progress is slow, but Twitter has suspended accounts of those threatening physical violence and have emailed others to remind them that a behavioural policy is in place. The intentions are honourable and the moment has arrived for a system of best practice to be observed by its 288m users. Without it, the minority will continue to distort the experience for the good-natured majority.","Twitter users are quick to criticise reporters for their reaction to matches .

"'We've got fans on the pitch. The game's still going on'. That's not me making a mess of Kenneth Wolstenholme's infamous words from Wembley in 1966 when the boys in red won the World Cup. That was Jonathan Pearce's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some Villa fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team's semi-final at home to West Brom. Of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see. Except that they very nearly were. Because they were a hare's breath from what we saw when Geoff Hurst went through to make it 4-2. Only time surely makes that a less controversial incident? Aston Villa fans invaded the pitch after their FA Cup win over West Brom on Saturday night and are seen taunting the away supporters as a line of police keeps them apart . Thousands stream onto the pitch after the match, which was moved to Saturday evening by the BBC . Geoff Hurst races through to score England's fourth goal in the 1966 World Cup final with West Germany . The FA Cup is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre. And attendances may well have endorsed that. But this season, with the FA succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the BBC and BT, the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life. The kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great Cup days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch. Not that that makes that group of Villa fans' behaviour justifiable. Although you might debate that a Midland derby that doesn't kick-off until Saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response? But the timing was because, I can only assume, the slots were preordained for the BBC to include Saturday and Monday evenings. While BT had Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoon. And with the Beeb having first dibs on that deal. Or in other words, Auntie had what they'd consider would be the ideal ties, with which to ensure the biggest possible audience, at the best possible times in their schedule. BBC presenter Gary Lineker and pundits Jermaine Jenas and Alan Shearer watch the pitch invasion . Monday night's line-up for the Manchester United vs Arsenal featured Roy Keane, Alan Shearer and Ian Wright alongside Gary Lineker in the Old Trafford studio . BT Sport's team of (from left) Jake Humphrey, Paul Jewell, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman with the FA Cup pitchside at Bradford City vs Reading on Saturday . This was a situation BT Sport decided to create a silk purse from. Why hadn't we'd been following this season's giant killers Bradford, a nation had cried, having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits? Well, on Saturday lunchtime, BT went free to air to answer that call and show us this season's favourite Davids in action live against the Goliaths of...Reading. OK, not a hell of a mismatch, but Bradford were still a great story. Unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig's ear on Bradford City's pitch. Indeed, such a vision in mud it was, it required the club to provide BT with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth. Nevertheless, there it was, an old school FA Cup that we could all watch, for nothing, and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage Cup season. By way of a precursor for the new Premier League telly deal, this sense of occasion rolled on into Monday night. Again, this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad. Danny Welbeck celebrates his winner for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night . Scott Sinclair is mobbed by Aston Villa supporters after scoring against West Brom . Not to mention some fans from North London who would have had to make their way back from Lancashire by any means necessary on a school night. But again, if you look at the bigger picture, it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the Cup. And a formidable old pro line up of Roy Keane, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Martin Keown alongside Gary Lineker all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event. Next up, more disruption for four teams whose replayed games will be shoe horned in to fit nicely for us folks at home. regardless of how it affects their League schedules. Dermot O'Leary reacts after Peter Schmeichel draws Arsenal to play Bradford City or Reading in the semis . But I echo Dermot O'Leary's cry of 'woohooh' when he drew his team Arsenal's ball for the semi final draw against either Bradford or Reading. Yes, it has lacked a certain sense of tradition. Yes, it has occasionally proven awkward for certain clubs, and their fans. And yes it provided that unsavoury moment at Villa Park. But I celebrate the fact that the FA Cup has been put back in the forefront of our football thinking. And if it is because the BBC and BT have decided between themselves to make it their own, then I'll live with the negatives and embrace the positive.","BBC and BT Sport shared coverage of weekend's FA Cup quarter-finals .

"When on the BBC it was suggested to Sunderland manager Gus Poyet that the DVD of their thrashing at home by Aston Villa wouldn't make very edifying viewing, the phlegmatic gaffer replied 'you cannot pick what you like to watch'. Well, if Gus tuned in to watch his centre half Wes Brown on All Star Family Fortunes on Sunday evening, he might well have decided to pick up the DVD of that Villa game again, and stick it straight back in the recorder. Playing against soap and Strictly star Jill Halfpenny and her family, things were actually looking pretty good for the Browns at the start. As in, before they'd actually started playing. Wes Brown (left) appeared alongside his family in All Star Family Fortunes, where his team lost heavily . The Browns appeared to have got host Vernon Kay onside early, but soon lost their advantage . The Halfpennys hail from the North East, while Wes was playing a flat back four of sister, brother, wife and mother-in-law from Manchester. This had the man in the middle, Bolton's own Vernon Kay, immediately looking to favour the team from the North West. But even with the man in black in their pocket, the Browns were still about to have an absolute mare. And just like on Saturday, it began badly, and just got worse. Wes was first up at the buzzer with Jill. And on beating her to the ball, suggested that the thing you'd hang onto when it was windy was 'a railing'. And our survey said... well, I'll leave you to do the noise. So the Halfpennys nipped in, and nicked the lead. Yet a couple of the Browns' other answers - namely 'a child' and 'the elderly' -  weren't far off, surely, from an actual correct answer 'somebody else'? Brown is brushed off the ball by Gabriel Agbonlahor in one of two poor performances this week . Gus Poyet didn't enjoy watching his side's defeat to Aston Villa, but Brown's TV appearance was even worse . Soap star Jill Halfpenny and her family made it a torrid weekend all round for the Sunderland midfielder . Frankly, the fact the Browns weren't surrounding the official on that one showed remarkable restraint on their part. Then, before you could blink, the Halfpennys had doubled their lead. And this time, it was very much through a Wes own goal. Who, as we had seen earlier in the show - when discovering about him from his family on a home video they'd made - has his own mini cinema and a grand piano in the front hall. So it's not all bad, eh? The challenge this time was to name a small bird. 'Pigeon', said Wes. Vernon did his best for him. 'Compared to an ostrich' was how he defended the defender's answer, but suffice to say... that noise again. Yet amazingly, there was arguably worse to come. The next question  had the Browns pondering a variety of potential trouser malfunctions you might have while wearing a pair at work. Brown shares a joke with the host, but he failed to produce the goods on the pitch or the telly this week . I'm writing this sentence here now to give you a bit of time to think about a few possible answers for yourselves. I'll even point out, to give you a little more time, that Vernon did acknowledge that wearing trousers at work was not exactly in Wes' area of expertise. Wes said 'they'd changed colour'. Anyone else out there? Anyone? Frankly, this was turning into a rout. So even Wes was probably grateful when Vernon took time out to ask everyone to join him for a song from Wes' favourite musical - which happens to be the Sound of Music. That's right, Brown's fellow footballers. Just in case you think you might want to remind him of the fact next time you're with him in a dressing room or on the field of play. The Sunderland defender did however manage to raise plenty of money for charity . Perhaps something along the lines of the fact that he clearly couldn't Von Trapp a house brick? No, too much knowledge, that. Wes did finally get off the mark with a correct answer about lying on a dating website, but when you looked up at the scoreboard come the end of the game, it was still something like 581 the Halfpennys, but most certainly the Browns close to nil. In the end then though, the plucky, affable footballer and his family still managed to raise money for their chosen charity. And did at least give it a bit of a go in the process. But all I can say if that if Gus had been in charge of this team's performance, chances are he'd have cleared his desk at the training ground and said goodbye to the players before you'd even had the chance to read this. No big deal though, Wes. Put that one behind you. You can fix it in the next game. You're away at Only Connect.","Wes Brown took part in All Star Family Fortunes on Sunday night .

"Even by their own self-proclaimed standards, this Sunday on Sky Sports had the prospect of being even more Super than normal. A top of the league clash and a Cup Final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early, and making their way to Wembley. And it was Neil Ashton who opened proceedings with a special Sunday Supplement from Sky Sports' studio high in the stands. There he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here, Oliver Holt. And early in the discussion, Ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon. With a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a Super Sunday that lived up to its billing . Philippe Coutinho scored a fantastic goal for Liverpool in Sky's first game of the day from Anfield . He acknowledged the Capital One Cup was probably 'bottom of the league for top clubs'. But as he then went on to point out, both ten years and today, for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea 'this competition can act as a catalyst'. Well, as it turned out, we'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out. Next up it was Goals On Sunday, during which Chris Kamara very nearly scuppered the Super. During the show, Kammy managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with Ben Shephard, and went exploring. A very entertaining Paul Robinson then told us about a previous Spurs visit to Wembley under Juande Ramos, before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team 'stag do', complete with 'archery, a mock casino... and a shed load of cheese toasties', . During which time Kammy had made his way to the Chelsea dressing room. Here he went on a dizzying tour of the space, where we even got to see the 'tea-making facilities'. So, so far, so good. There was even a great chat with Chelsea kit man Gary Grey who explained that John Terry took his captain's duties so seriously, he was like ' a second kit man'. And that Didier Drogba was a fastidious preparer, who would 'stuff his boots with newspaper'. 'The French paper, L'Equipe', added Gary. Which is where it all started to go wrong. The other guest on the show was Shaun Wright-Phillips, who was also in the dressing room. Reluctantly, he found himself being dragged from his seat by Kammy; 'I don't want to ruin my shoes' muttered the poor fella. To no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy-uppy session which yielded a best total of one. 'You won't see this quality anywhere else', cried Kammy. You'd struggle to argue with that. Luckily, though, the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he'd 'borrowed' from the Bobby Moore Suite to present as a gift to Ben. So at least he'd provided some decent service. The next action came from around 300 miles north of the North Circular with Liverpool welcoming Manchester City to Anfield. Another welcome guest was Gary Neville on Sky Sports' co-commentary who, it has to be said, didn't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the M62. What's more, he carried on not saying it. As the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red, Gary had no sympathy. 'With the experience they have... I'd be embarrassed', he sighed. And he went on, saying it was also 'painful to watch', and that 'I keep seeing the same mistakes being made. (They're) so easy to play against'. Not much Super going on around those parts for Gary, then. Time to head back to Wembley, where host Simon Thomas and his excellent trio of Jamie Redknapp, Glenn Hoddle and Thierry Henry not only had the run of Wembley, but also a seeming age to fill before kick off. There also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that wouldn't play fair, and a stadium PA system they could probably hear back up at Anfield. It all made for a painful build-up. John Terry fires the ball home via a deflection off Eric Dier to put Chelsea in front at Wembley . After the game at Anfield Sky headed back to Wembley to see Tottenham's failed quest for the League Cup . Gary Neville was critical of Manchester City after their 'embarrassing' defeat to Liverpool at lunch time . For their cup final coverage Sky put together a team of Glenn Hoddle, Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp . Hoddle kept Henry focused on football as the ex-Arsenal man put in his best peformance since joining Sky . Luckily, though, the boys decamped at kick-off to the studio where the day had begun. Where as the game got under way, things started to get back to nudging Super. All of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited Chelsea gaffer, who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride. 'I've never seen him so happy', said Jamie. Even if on interview he was a little more the familiar Jose. 'Celebrations', he agreed were in order, but 'in 20 minutes, over. Goodbye. Training tomorrow'. Things were back to normal for the pundits, too. What's more, I think this was also the best we've seen of Henry since his formal arrival at Sky Sports. With the insightful experience of Hoddle on one side, and the encouraging cajoling of Jamie on the other, Thierry was sharp, punchy and keen as mustard to talk football. With Jamie steering him through from a (thankfully) fully functioning TV monitor, his dissection of Diego Costa's goal was nigh on a masterclass. 'If I'm the striker there', he enthused. 'Happy days!'. Which indeed it was, in the end. Not to mention, even a bit Super.","With a cup final and a top of the league clash, Sky were on their game .

"Gareth Bale has told his Wales colleagues he wants to stay at Real Madrid for at least one more season. But Chelsea are poised to move in. Indeed, the Madrid hierarchy are ready to accept Bale's £75m buy-out clause back to a Premier League club in order to refurbish their team and keep Cristiano Ronaldo. Manchester United would love Ronaldo back but, as long predicted by this column, have other priorities in team building this summer with targets such as Mats Hummels, Paul Pogba and Dani Alves. Gareth Bale wants to stay at Real Madrid but Chelsea are poised to move for the Wales international . Manchester United would love to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid but have other transfer priorities . Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels and Juventus star Paul Pogba are targets for Manchester United . It could then be that Bale becomes a battle between Chelsea and Manchester City with the Blues in pole position given FFP rules. Arsenal, meanwhile, aspire to sign Germany international Marco Reus but Real Madrid are likely to win that battle. Arsenal are keen to sign Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus but Real Madrid are likely to capture the winger . Sam Allaradyce could become the new Republic of Ireland manager next season. Martin O'Neill goes into Sunday's pivotal Euro qualifier against Poland under pressure. If it goes the wrong way then Big Sam - on his way out of West Ham - has been identified as a potential new man, Football Grapevine has been told. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce could replace Martin O'Neill as Republic of Ireland boss next season . I am hearing . While West Ham have cooled on the idea of signing Alex Song, currently on loan from Barcelona, on a permanent basis, they are keen to buy Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal when his loan term expires in the summer. Arsenal, though, could play hard ball over the fee, wanting perhaps in excess of £10 million. Meanwhile, Song still harbours hopes of making it to a Champions League club with Manchester City and Liverpool still possibilities. West Ham have cooled on signing Alex Song but are keen to purchase Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal . I am also hearing . Liverpool still believe they will sign Danny Ings from Burnley on a Bosman transfer this summer. But Ings, who has attracted interest at Real Sociedad, also has options with Bundesliga clubs Borussia Monchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool believe they will sign Burnley's Danny Ings but the striker is also wanted by Borussia Dortmund . I was in the company of Frank Lampard snr (father of ex-Chelsea star Frank Lampard - now of Manchester City but very soon to be New York City) last week at Langan's restaurant in London’s Mayfair for a pre-launch of Bobby Moore: The Documentary. Some funding remains to be required to get the show on the road; hence the event. But it would appear the project inspired by broadcaster Matt Lorenzo is on its way, not least because of the support of the Lampards. 'Big Frank' was mentored by Moore as a young West Ham player. He still reveres the sadly deceased England World Cup winning captain of 1966, who was a football, fashion and style icon of his era. With one reservation. As some wonderful footage was rolled out Big Frank whispered in my ear: 'Mooro was the guv'nor at most things, but he couldn’t dance.' Frank Lampard Snr (second left) revealed Bobby Moore (right) was the guv'nor but he couldn't dance . iSay . There were many people, including ex-pro pundits, who somehow thought Steven Gerrard received an easy ride from the media for his red card  against Manchester United last week for a stamp on Ander Herrera compared to Chelsea striker Diego Costa, who was also given a retrospective ban for a similar incident earlier this season. Some went as far to suggest it was more evidence of a conspiracy against Chelsea. Or an anti-foreigner agenda. The notion that there is unity of opinion in mainstream media is of course nonsense. Steven Gerrard is shown red for a stamp on Ander Herrera during Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Man United . But it's true that in general, Gerrard did receive far less of a 'coating' for his nasty act than Costa. Quite right. The main reason was that Gerrard was quick to hold his hands up and quickly came out to publicly apologise for his act of madness. Costa, even after video evidence proved his guilt, remained in denial. Gerrard offered an apology and gained respect with his contrition. Costa did not. Simple as that really. Many people believe Gerrard received an easy ride compared to Chelsea attacker Diego Costa . Costa was handed a retrospective ban after stamping on Liverpool midfielder Emre Can at Stamford Bridge . BTW . As soon as Harry Kane began celebrating his debut England goal after his hurricane entry into international football, the TV cameras flashed to the VIP box and caught FA chairman Greg Dyke beaming with a smug grin then turning to someone in the row behind. I've no idea exactly what Dyke said. But he was quite entitled to chortle: 'Now that just goes to prove my point.' Earlier in the week, Dyke announced bold plans to raise the quota of home grown players in 25-man Premier League squads from eight to 12. Greg Dyke (left) shows his delight after young striker Kane finds the back of the net for England . He also wants to see a reduction in work permits given to non EU players of 'mediocre' standard. The Premier League have quickly come out in opposition. But Dyke's idea is sound. He argues that there could be a lot more Harry Kanes out there but their chances of breaking through are being blocked by, in some cases, an obsession with overseas players at some clubs. Dyke argues the Premier League could have more Kanes by raising the quota of homegrown players . Indeed, Kane - after a series of loan spells - looked to be on his way out of Spurs because his route to the first team was blocked. Emmanuel Adebayor, who has long been coasting on the gravy train, was just one player in his way. Tim Sherwood thought differently and blooded Kane. It took some time for Mauricio Pochettino, Sherwood's successor as Spurs boss, to trust Kane to start in the Premier League but at least he gave him a go. And what a reward. Sherwood, now in charge at Aston Villa, argues there are many academy graduates up and down the country who, if given a decent run in the team, have the quality and hunger to be top class players. As Kane now looks. It took a season or so for John Terry to find his feet at Chelsea back in the day. One wonders though, would Jose Mourinho have the patience with a 19-year-old Terry? John Terry took a season to find his feet at Chelsea and has made over 650 appearances for the Blues . Take West Ham - they have taken 33-year-old Brazilian Nene, who is effectively past it, for the rest of the season on a free transfer to plug a gap rather than recall promising 20-year-old forward Elliot Lee from his spell at Luton. Given the Hammers are safe from relegation surely there could be no better time to really find out about the striker - son of Newcastle legend Rob Lee - who made one first-team appearance THREE years ago. But Sam Allardyce does not have a good track record for bringing young players through. West Ham signed 33-year-old Nene (left) on a free transfer rather than blooding the club's youngsters . Those Premier League owners who object to Dyke's plan should take a step back and consider it could make economic sense for them and not just boost the pool for the national team. After all, how much has Kane saved Spurs. The way he's going it's hurtling towards £50 million. iBet . Italy have had the upper hand against England over the years, winning eleven, losing eight and drawing six. On the face of it, a weakened England team look vulnerable and one bookmaker make Italy 6/5 favourites with England 12/5. A 2-1 Italy win at 8/1 is decent shout. Harry Kane, who is set to start, is 8/1 to score the first goal. One of England's best displays against Italy was the 0-0 draw they achieved in Rome in 1997 to qualify for the World Cup. Paul Gascoigne, Paul Ince and Ian Wright were among the England heroes that night. You can get 8/1 on a 0-0 draw. Any draw is 11/5. Paul Ince was one of the heroes as England draw 0-0 with Italy in 1997 to qualify for the World Cup .","Chelsea are poised to move for Real Madrid frontman Gareth Bale .

"Manchester City and Chelsea are set to challenge Manchester United for the services of Gareth Bale this summer. The pressure on Bale at Madrid has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the Premier League is on the cards. It has been assumed that if Bale does leave Madrid then a move to United is a 'shoo-in'. But both Chelsea and City are in need of attacking stimulus, especially in the context of Champions League football. Gareth Bale is attracting criticism in the Spanish capital and Chelsea and Manchester City are interested . The reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a £100million deal plus near £300,000-a-week wages and stay within FFP rules. And in the case of Manchester United they have priorities in other areas of the pitch. Chelsea, on the basis of transfer sales and turnover, will have the ability to push the boat out to get Bale. The Blues are also looking to sign Real Madrid centre-half Raphael Varane. Chelsea could demand as much as £20million this summer to let Petr Cech leave the club. In what may well be a merry-go-round of elite goalkeepers this summer, Cech is a target for Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG. Although Cech is now Chelsea’s No 2, he is still just 32. Former Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann has urged the Gunners to sign Cech, arguing that he could well be entering the best period of his career. Petr Cech is wanted by a raft of top clubs and Arsenal have been urged to sign him by Jens Lehmann . Liverpool are prepared to play poker with Raheem Sterling and his advisors over a new contract. And the Merseyside club remain convinced they will win. The Reds don’t believe there is genuine, firm interest from clubs such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United as has been reported, as talks over a new £100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled. Certainly Liverpool believe that if they slap a £50million-plus price tag on the England forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer. Raheem Sterling is reportedly wanted by Europe's elite, but Liverpool aren't buying that . Talks on a bumper £1000,000-a-week deal have stalled between Sterling and Liverpool . Indeed the club believe Sterling constantly being linked with a range of 'platinum' clubs is part of a strategy from the player’s camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to £140,000 a week - the sort of level Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez were on. But the view of the Liverpool hierarchy is that in stages of progression Sterling does not yet command such a figure in the context of their wage structure nor in how they deal with FFP regulations. The club want Sterling to understand that the current offer is generous, especially given that despite his rapid emergence he has yet to prove himself as a consistent force, and that a new £100,000-a-week five-year deal would have re-negotiation stages built in. The obvious concern of the club is that if they bow to the demands of Sterling’s advisors now, they could have a talented 20-year-old player on their hands who suddenly lacks sufficient motivation and incentive to fulfil his potential. Brendan Rodgers bluntly told Sterling not to wave goodbye to Liverpool . It was telling that manager Brendan Rodgers said pointedly on Saturday: ‘I think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [Sterling’s] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for Liverpool.’ The club also doesn’t want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to Sterling's demands. Liverpool are also relaxed about the situation not least because Sterling’s current contract does not expire until the summer of 2017. Sam Allardyce's days are numbered as West Ham manager. The club are set to sever his contract on May 25, the day after the last game of the season against Newcastle. Even if the Hammers have a good end to the season there is no way back for Allardyce whose current contract expires in July. The 3-0 defeat at Arsenal took West Ham's Premier League run to just one win in 12. Sam Allardyce looks aggrieved during West Ham's latest capitulation at the Emirates . The West Ham board still harbour hopes of luring Carlos Tevez to the club next season from Juventus in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium. The club’s hierarchy see former cult hero Tevez as a platinum signing that can help attract a new fan base. Carlos Tevez is wanted by the Hammers as a marquee signing in their final year at Upton Park . Everton could move for Chelsea’s misfit striker Loic Remy this summer if they decide to cash in on wantaway Romelu Lukaku. Radamel Falcao, as revealed by the Football Grapevine, will not stay at Manchester United beyond this season’s loan deal from Monaco, where indeed the Colombian could well be playing his football again next season. Radamel Falcao could return to Monaco after a frustrating first year in the Premier League . I am hearing . Tottenham’s Danny Rose is set to get an England call-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania later this month to prevent him opting to declare for Jamaica. BTW . Luis Suarez last week claimed it was English media which forced him to quit Liverpool last summer and join Barcelona. Utter tosh. The main reason Suarez left Liverpool is because he had been hankering for a dream move to Spain for over a year. And he also wanted to nearly double his salary. Luis suarez looks glum as Liverpool's title hopes evaporate on a crazy night at Selhurst Park last year . Suarez grins from ear to ear as the Uruguayan is turning it on for La Liga leaders Barcelona . Yes the press reported various indiscretions by the Uruguayan, including a race row, a propensity to dive and a habit of assaulting opponents from time to time. That’s part of the job. What did Suarez expect? High fives? Or flowers? Yet for all that, the English press still honoured Suarez last season when the Football Writers Association (FWA) voted him as their player of the year. That’s hardly hounding a player out, is it? I-Say . Jamie Carragher labelled the behaviour of Chelsea players in Champions League defeat by PSG as a ‘disgrace’. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness described the manner in which the Chelsea players pressurised referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Zlatan Ibrahimovic as pathetic. Ibrahimovic called the Chelsea players ‘babies’. I can’t disagree with any of those verdicts. I just found it embarrassing. Yet in the commentary box, Gary Neville almost paid the Chelsea players a compliment by calling them ‘shrewd’. Really? Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch official sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Matches between Manchester United and Tottenham have often been entertaining and full of goals down the years, although this season’s encounter at White Hart Lane ended 0-0. Coral offer 12-1 on the same outcome. For the more adventurous, they offer 50-1 for 3-3. Harry Kane is 6-1 to be first scorer. Shrewd is being clever, not cheating then is it? Does an employee of the Football Association - Neville has a role as England boss Roy Hodgson’s assistant - advocate cheating? Let’s not forget one of the main roles of the FA is to act as custodians of the game, uphold discipline and even offer a moral lead. Once again there would seem a conflict of interest with Neville being an opinionated media pundit AND a senior member of the England coaching staff. After all, do we want to see England players acting in the same pathetic manner, as Souness put it, as the Chelsea players did last week? I think not.","Gareth Bale's suitors now include Chelsea and Manchester City .

"Nine months ago the talk was of the European Tour rebuffing an audacious takeover bid by the PGA Tour. Now, with their vision of a global schedule as a viable alternative to the American behemoth having survived intact, the European Tour is set to embark on the next phase in its development. I can reveal negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the PGA of Australia for some sort of merger. Whether this means an arrangement similar to that with the Sunshine Tour in South Africa — where seven events are co-sanctioned — or something more formal has yet to be determined. But it’s surely good news for European Tour members, who were given an outline of the plans at the Qatar Masters recently. If events with the prestige of the Australian Open, the Aussie Masters and the Australian PGA Championship made their way on to the schedule in December, it would be a significant upgrade on the slim offerings at the moment. The Australian Open, last won by Jordan Spieth, could make its way onto the tour their schedule in December . As well as here in Europe, there are events in America, Asia, South Africa and the Middle East that all count towards the Race to Dubai, seen here with 2014 winner Rory McIlroy . For their part, the PGA of Australia have the titles and golf courses but linking up with the European Tour would surely help in terms of improving strength of fields and attracting sponsors. Australia is just about the only great golf playing region the European Tour will not visit this year as part of its international schedule. As well as here in Europe, there are events in America, Asia, South Africa and the Middle East that all count towards the Race to Dubai. The addition of some Australian events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of Patrick Reed . The two tours did co-sanction one event on the 2014 schedule in Perth but any merger this time is likely to encompass a number of tournaments. Naturally, there will never be any serious competition between the European and PGA Tours in terms of the size of prize funds. In America, they give away $1million-plus first prizes every week and there’s no matching that. But to young Americans with ambition, the addition of some seriously good Aussie events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of Patrick Reed and the leading Europeans and sign up to enjoy the best of both worlds. Only Tiger Woods and Sam Snead have ever won the same event on eight different occasions on the PGA Tour, so you can only imagine how low the former must be feeling about his chipping yips to skip this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he has been such a serial champion. How cruel that his severe bout of stage fright now precludes him from even making it to the first tee. As for the Masters and all those tight Augusta lies, the question is rapidly changing from whether Tiger (right) can make it to a sense of foreboding if he did. Tiger Woods has been out of action since the beginning of February when he withdrew midway through his first round at the Farmers Insurance Open due to back pain . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘I’m looking forward to getting there and seeing my grandad. It’s going to be a great week. I’m in the field on merit and playing well.’ It’s taken a while but 27-year-old Sam Saunders is slowly emerging from the shadow of his grandfather, the host this week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Saunders has finished runner-up and tied 24th in his last two PGA Tour starts and will compete in the event for the first time as a fully-fledged card holder, rather than on a sponsor’s exemption. Sam Saunders acknowledges the crowd on the 18th green during the final round of the Valspar Championship on Sunday . Spieth leading the US charge to crash McIlroy’s date with destiny . Jordan Spieth makes no secret of the fact he’s got Rory McIlroy in his sights and, excitingly for the sport, he not only talks a good game but plays it as well. The 21-year-old Texan displayed great skill and considerable resolve to prevail in a marvellous shootout against fellow Americans Patrick Reed and Sean O’Hair to win the Valspar Championship in overtime in Florida on Sunday. It was his third win in his last eight events, and he became just the fourth golfer aged 22 or under to have two victories to his name on the PGA Tour in the last 70 years. Spieth (right) achieved it in a manner that augurs well for his chances next month of going one better than his remarkable runner-up performance on his Masters debut last year. He got down in two from any number of unfavourable spots before holing a 28ft birdie putt to win on the third extra hole. Spieth has World No 1 Rory McIlroy in his sights following his Valspar Championship success . ‘Rory is the man who has picked up Tiger’s mantle and he is the one I am focused on,’ said Spieth, now up to a career-high sixth in the world. With the season’s first major just three weeks away, the cream of this generation of American golfers have certainly laid down a marker, with the performances of Spieth and Reed in this event following Dustin Johnson’s victory over current Masters champ Bubba Watson in Miami the previous Sunday. Now who should re-enter the fold at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this week but McIlroy himself. This is his last scheduled tournament before his date with history at the Masters. Over to you, Rory.","European Tour is set to embark on the next phase of development .

"There are two players in the post-Tiger Woods era who have left Graeme McDowell feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete. One, of course, is his old friend Rory McIlroy. And the other is Dustin Johnson. As it turned out, McDowell, like everyone else, didn’t have to worry about beating the American because he was too busy beating himself. Johnson vehemently denies a failed test for recreational drugs use prompted him to take a six-month leave of absence that caused him to miss the Ryder Cup last year. Whether that is true or not, there were plenty of other party-style vices he did own up to that needed addressing and were enough by themselves to turn an obvious world top-three player into one struggling to stay in the top 20. American Dustin Johnson (left) won the WGC Cadillac Championship on Sunday . Graeme McDowell hits onto the 18th green after his ball landed near a tree at the WGC Cadillac Championship . McDowell holds Johnson in the same regard as fellow Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy . Johnson shows off his awesome power off the tee with another brutal drive at Doral . Johnson stands 6ft 4in and is such a naturally talented athlete he had every sporting coach at his college clamouring for him to specialise in their particular pursuit. When he started making millions from golf, it was hardly surprising that temptation lay at every turn. Only Adam Scott attracted more swooning women than Johnson, but only Scott was wise enough to pick his way through the pitfalls. And now Johnson’s back. Will this turn out like another John Daly fable, where he returns but only to fall back into his old ways as quick as a lead can disappear on a pressure-filled Sunday? Happily, all the signs point the other way. During the break, his fiancee Paulina Gretzky — whose ice hockey-playing father Wayne holds the same revered status in Canada that Kenny Dalglish holds in Liverpool — gave birth to their first child. When Johnson starting practising ahead of his return, his coach Butch Harmon couldn’t believe the difference mentally. Johnson's happy family life with Paulina Gretzky (left) could spell trouble for McIlroy (right) on the course . Johnson's form has been stunning since he became a father. Gretzky gave birth to son, Tatum, in January . Gretzky and Johnson share a kiss, while Tatum watches, after his victory in Miami on Sunday . It’s showing on the golf course. Heck, he’s only played five events following that long break and he’s already had two second-place finishes and, on Sunday, a classy win in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. How’s that for talent? It was all on show on the 18th hole on Sunday. The water hazard that juts out at 300 yards to the edge of the fairway and caught even McIlroy’s drive? Johnson cleared it comfortably. McIlroy hit a three-iron for his third shot; Johnson had an eight-iron. It was the eighth consecutive season in which Johnson has managed at least one victory. The next best sequence on the PGA Tour is Justin Rose’s five. Johnson was handed the Gene Sarazen Cup by Donald Trump after his victory at the weekend . Johnson pictured putting on the sixth hole during his final round in Florida on Sunday . Johnson insists that his six-month absence from golf was not down to a failed drugs test . Just like the Northern Irishman, his game is built on devastating power and accuracy from the tee. Now 30, he has given McIlroy an enormous head start. Imagine the pair coming down the stretch at a major with one man having four Grand Slam wins to draw upon while the other is still awaiting his first? But if you’re looking for the player who ought to run McIlroy the closest over the next few years, Johnson has the game. And now — finally — it looks like he might also have the brain. ‘I can hardly believe I’ve played a tournament without a single bogey. I didn’t think it was possible on this course.’ It was a good job it was possible for the impressive Korean Inbee Park, for it’s about the only way any of the women can beat 17-year-old Lydia Ko these days. Inbee Park (left) won the Women's Championship trophy in Singapore by two shots over Lydia Ko . Park (second right) won the tournament by not firing a single bogey across the four rounds . Ko, wh became golf's youngest-ever world No 1 last month, finished the event in second place . Even so, 26-year-old Park still only won the HSBC Women’s Champions tournament in Singapore by two shots from the New Zealander, who has two wins and now this second place to her name since becoming golf’s youngest-ever world No 1 last month. Sections of the American press are wondering why Rory McIlroy was given a largely free pass for tossing his three-iron into the water last week while the criticism that would have followed Tiger Woods, if he’d done it, ‘would have blown up the internet’. So let’s see if we can explain the difference. At the age of 25 Woods never engaged with spectators, rarely signed autographs, was frequently seen spitting on the side of greens and treated the press with barely concealed contempt. McIlroy acknowledges the crowds, devotes hours of his time to signing autographs and spends way longer than he needs trying to give an insight to the media. Reap what you sow, it’s called. American media has queried if Tiger Woods would have got more stick than McIlroy for throwing a club away . McIlroy threw his three-iron into the lake in Florida but a scuba diver later discovered it . It is not known whether Woods (right) will compete at the Masters at Augusta next month . As for whether Tiger will be back for the Masters next month there is, of course, no word. No update on his progress, nothing. To turn the question around: could you ever imagine McIlroy acting like that? The only thing we can say with a degree of certainty is that Friday is surely a big day if Woods is to turn up at Augusta. That’s the deadline for entering the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week — and if he doesn’t play in that event, one he’s won a remarkable eight times, it’s hard to envisage him playing the Masters.","Dustin Johnson had a six-month leave of absence from golf .

"You don't  restrict an artist. He's there to create, to entertain, to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering  how the hell he did it. Louis van Gaal used Juan Mata as a 'false right winger' at Anfield six days ago, and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by David Moyes and Jose Mourinho. The  two-time Chelsea Player of the Year showed good things come to those who wait, as Liverpool's 3-4-3 formation that snookered teams from January onward was lost on Manchester United. Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at Anfield . Mata's perfect technique for his scissor-kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season . Liverpool could do little to stop Mata's incredible scissor-kick giving them a 2-0 lead at Anfield . Mata runs away in celebration with United team-mates Marouane Fellaini (right) and Wayne Rooney (left) It was, if nothing else, unexpected. Mata had gone unused, having played just 15 minutes across four Premier League games in February, and it was reminiscent of his bit-part role at Chelsea. Mourinho considered Oscar a better fit as his No 10, believing Mata's defensive cover left a lot to be desired. He is not a tackler, nor is he the physical type. You don't buy a Jack Russell Terrier then expect it to behave like an American Pit Bull. Mata is a different breed. What he is, is an architect. Since the start of the 2011-12 Barclays Premier League season, he has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder. Close behind is Manchester City's David Silva (63) and Yaya Toure (61), then Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard (both 58). Yet his defensive discipline – or lack thereof – is what Mourinho considered his Achilles heel. It's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles (0.64), clearances (0.16) and duels won (14.29 per cent) per game when he, Silva, Toure, Hazard and Gerrard are compared, but that's not his job. Mata left Chelsea for United in a £37m switch but manager David Moyes never got his money's worth . Mata's prayers have been answered at United as he looks to get a regular run out by Louis van Gaal . Only Silva (365) beats him in chances created out of the entire Premier League since the beginning of 2011-12, but Mata (291) has played 466 fewer minutes. He's the creative kind, but would most likely still be warming the substitutes' bench at Stamford Bridge had he not swapped south for north. It was Moyes that bought Mata from Chelsea, phoning him personally to explain what he wanted. Fluidity, assists and goals were the demands, and Mata agreed. Two days later, he arrived at Carrington – by helicopter, no less – and it was confirmed. Chelsea made a tidy £13.5m from the Mata move. Shrewd as ever, as they were with David Luiz (£31.6m profit), Andre Schurrle (£4m), Kevin De Bruyne (£11m), Romelu Lukaku (£18m) and Thorgan Hazard (£5.5m), among others. Moyes, however, never got his money's worth. Mata celebrates his goal with team-mate Daley Blind at Anfield on Sunday during their win . Mata has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder in the Premier League since 2011 . It was when he left Manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began. He hadn't kept Sir Alex Ferguson's backroom staff. He failed to replace Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra. His style of football was cautious, slow and predictable compared to his predecessor's attacking outlook. Another supposed error was wasting £64m on Marouane Fellaini and Mata. Yet the new man at Manchester United is getting what Moyes couldn't out of both. Against Liverpool, Fellaini and Mata covered the most distance (11.6km each) out of everyone. Mata had more touches (93) than anyone else, made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy, and made Hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player (3). For a player without a shot on target in the Premier League since December 20, he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry. Alberto Moreno, lugging five yards behind for Mata's first and not tracking him for the second, was tormented by the man that goes by 'Johnny Kills' – a suitable nickname handed to him by former Chelsea team-mate Daniel Sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name.

Feb 28 vs Sunderland - 4 . March 4 vs Newcastle - 8 . March 15 vs Tottenham - 77 . March 22 vs Liverpool - 90 . Against Liverpool, right-back Antonio Valencia was used as cover, sprinting up the wing to allow Mata to abandon his post. Those two exchanged more passes (55) than anyone else on Sunday, and worked in tandem. Their average positions show Mata (No 8) stayed close to Ander Herrera (No 21), who was equally devastating at Anfield, while Valencia (No 25) pushed up, just short of the half-way line. Mata played a similar role against Tottenham Hotspur the week before,  as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate. But he is not out of the woods yet. Mata is flirting with a first-team place, having replaced an out-of-sorts Angel di Maria, but the trick is to stay there. He has been crying out for this, ever since he was phased out at Chelsea, and even more so now he has been dropped by Spain. Mata has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons. Restricted, to say the least, when compared to former Chelsea team-mate Hazard, who has  5,461 minutes and  61 starts. It's easier said than done to become a must-pick – £37m doesn't buy you that luxury these days. Can it happen at Manchester United? If Mata can rip teams to shreds as he did against Liverpool, then how can it not? Trouble is, Louis van Gaal – like Jose Mourinho – is a hard man to please. Mata has played 3,724 minutes with 44 starts over the last two seasons - far less than his counterparts .

"Manchester United and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head this summer to sign William Carvalho. The Sporting Lisbon midfielder has a £35million get-out clause in his contract, though changes to third party ownership could see his price drop by around £10m. However, the action between the two Premier League giants could mean his value surpasses the £30m mark. Liverpool and Manchester United will go heafd-to-head to land Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho . The Portugal international has a £35million get-out clause but his value could drop due to third party ownership . Liverpool see Carvalho as the ideal player to replace the departing Steven Gerrard. Equally, United have eyes for him to shore up a midfield which has lacked an enforcer this season. Arsenal are still confident of landing Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. The French midfielder is rated in the £25m category. His club Southampton have offered him a new £60,000-a-week deal to stay at the club. But the Gunners will raise the bar on salary and more than likely offer Champions League football. Sources in France tell the Football Grapevine that Schneiderlin wants to join the Gunners. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin wants to join Arsenal according to Football Grapevine sources . Manchester City’s hopes of signing £60m-rated Paul Pogba from Juventus could be dashed this summer because of the emerging interest of Barcelona. President Marc Bartomeu is lining up an audacious move, despite the Catalan giants’ transfer ban. Barcelona are lining up an audacious move for Manchester City target Paul Pogba, currently with Juventus . Sunderland will move in for Sam Allardyce should he - as it seems likely - leave West Ham in the summer. Whatever the outcome of their season it appears the Black Cats will part company with Gus Poyet. The Football Grapevine understands Besiktas boss Slave Bilic is high on West Ham’s ‘long list’, along with Michael Laudrup and Frank Rijkaard. Steve Bruce is set to leave Hull City this summer. Fulham and Wigan are two possible destinations. Sunderland will make a move for Sam Allardyce should the West Ham boss leave Upton Park this summer . I am hearing . Roy Hodgson will restore Wayne Rooney to his favoured role of lead striker when England play Lithuania in the Euro 16 qualifier at the end of the month. Rooney has been moved around the Manchester United team this season, even playing deep in midfield under Louis van Gaal. But Hodgson still believes Rooney’s position is as a front man even though he has used him in differing roles. It remains to be seen though if Rooney can justify his place in the national team and not just be picked because he is captain, especially given the emergence of Tottenham’s Harry Kane as a contender for the central striker role. Indeed, suddenly Hodsgon has plenty of options up front with QPR’s Charlie Austin and Burnley’s Danny Ings also candidates with Kane and Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge to challenge Rooney for the ‘No 9’ role. Roy Hodgson will restore Wayne Rooney to his favoured role of lead striker when England play Lithuania . I am also hearing . Reports of a deep rift between Man United boss Louis van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs may be exaggerated but Football Grapevine hears there have been differences of opinion with regard to tactics, not least the use of Wayne Rooney. This time last year FG reported that if David Moyes was ousted, Giggs would take charge until the end of the season. That happened. FG hears it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that Giggs will be United’s next boss. How soon? That depends on how LVG negotiates the remainder of this season. Ryan Giggs, (second left) pictured next to Louis van Gaal, could be Manchester United's next boss . iSay . The day after the Football Association appointed Martin Glenn as their new chief executive, Roy Hodgson announced he wanted his contract extended for at least two years to take in the 2018 World Cup finals. It would seem Hodgson, or perhaps someone who advises him on PR matters, thought it was good timing to state his case. Whatever the reason it could well backfire on Hodgson. Roy Hodgson has announced he wants to extend his contract with England for at least another two years . After all, on what grounds does Hodgson think he has earned the right to a new deal ? Yes, England are well on the way to qualifying for the finals of Euro 2016, but in a very weak group. And does he think people have forgotten last summer’s lamentable display at the World Cup? England’s dire performances in Brazil encouraged scathing comments towards Hodgson from BBC's main man Gary Lineker. And here’s the thing. Lineker is a pal of Glenn. Why? Because Head of Walkers Glenn offered former England skipper Lineker a lucrative career in advertising crisps. Indeed, Lineker lauded the appointment of Glenn. Food industry boss Martin Glenn (left, with Gary Lineker in 2000) has been named the FA's new chief . The only way Hodgson, who is 67 by the way, should continue as boss is if the team reach at least the semi-finals at the Euros. Of course the obvious question then is who to replace him. Given his strong views on football over the last 20 years from the comfort of the pundit sofa after a great International career, it might just be that Glenn persuades Lineker to put his money where his mouth is. BTW . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has suggested that Steven Gerrard’s ‘dream’ of leading out Liverpool in this year's FA Cup final as a last hurrah before moving to LA Galaxy is not guaranteed. Quite. After all the Reds have got to get there first. Sunday’s quarter-final tie against Blackburn may seem a shoo-in for Liverpool but any manager tempts fate when they look too far ahead. Especially in the cup. That said, Liverpool look well placed to go all the way to Wembley this season. Steven Gerrard is back training but won't walk straight into the Liverpool team, according to Brendan Rodgers . With Gerrard in mind, Rodgers was spot on when he said: ‘No player has a God given right to walk into the team.’ Indeed Liverpool have played their best football and have picked up points since Gerrard was ruled out of action with a hamstring injury. Moreover, Liverpool’s revival this season has coincided when Gerrard ended all the speculation about his future and said he would leave the club and join LA Galaxy . In a sense that liberated the rest of the players… not least Jordan Henderson. Jordan Henderson, pictured celebrating against Burnley, has been liberated since Gerrard confirmed his move . Squads can’t live under the shadow of an ageing star. Even that time will come for Barcelona and Lionel Messi. There comes a point when even the best players, club legends, can end up overshadowing the squad and thus undermining the team evolving into a new era. Bill Shankly was a master at moving on stars and refreshing the team. So was Bob Paisley. And of course at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson did the same. It would seem Rodgers realised that offering Gerrard two more years at Liverpool was more sentimental than pragmatic and thus detrimental to the club moving on up under his watch. That is a sign of good management and may in a few years time see Liverpool achieve what they never did in the ‘Stevie G era’. Win the Premier League title. Brendan Rodgers says Gerrard does not have a god-given right to return to the team straight away . iBet . The Champions League resumes this week. Chelsea are 8-1 to win the trophy. Given the way the beat West Ham 1-0 last week when overrun in the second half suggest they have the mettle and desire and even the luck to go all the way. The Treble Lite is on for the Blues.","Liverpool see William Carvalho as a replacement for Steven Gerrard .

"The issue of spitting, sadly, has emerged again this week with Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse both being condemned. As usual, there have been a number of people who have said 'it is the worst thing that can happen on a pitch'; it is vile but let me assure you now – I would have preferred Lucas Neill to have spat at me the day he broke my leg in September 2003! I was spat at once in my career. It came during a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 and the player in question was a Russian midfielder called Aleksander Mostovoi. I was shocked more than angry when he did it because I couldn't believe what had happened. The issue of spiting in football has, sadly, raised its head again after Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse clashed . Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . The only time Carragher was spat on was in a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 .

I know it is a disgusting thing to do but I do think that punishment seems a little excessive, particularly if you compare it to an over-the-top tackle that would 'only' get three games. For Evans, the incident doesn't look good at all. It would have been easy enough for him to spit well away from Cisse. One final thing: all those people who have said about Evans 'he's not that type of lad'. Who is then? Is there are a list somewhere of names who are 'that type'? It is a stupid thing to say. It's not about his character. It's about whether he had a moment of madness, deliberately or not. Blackburn Rovers defender Lucas Neill is sent off after breaking Carragher's leg in September 2003 .

"When a regime starts to unravel at Liverpool, there is usually only one way it will end. Bad results become like an avalanche and the onset of disappointment is impossible to prevent. I first saw it happen shortly after I broke into the team under Roy Evans, and history repeated itself with Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez. After failing to build on a challenge for the Barclays Premier League, Liverpool would slip away. Ultimately, the manager would lose his job. Title challenges have not happened too often in the modern era. Liverpool fell short in 1997, then 2002 and again in 2009. The disappointment lingers and the realisation that you might not get another shot at the biggest domestic prize alters the atmosphere. It is hard to break that cycle. Brendan Rodgers talks with Adam Lallana (right) as Liverpool train ahead of Sunday's clash with Man United . Rodgers and his players and staff appeared in good spirits ahead of a crucial Premier League clash . Rodgers has managed to turn around Liverpool's season after a stuttering start to the campaign . So, as Liverpool suffered one setback after another at the start of this campaign — and expensive new signings failed to produce what was expected of them — I was concerned that my old club were heading down a familiar, bleak path. Putting it bluntly, I feared for Brendan Rodgers. This was a challenge unlike anything he had ever faced. Liverpool is a club like no other when the atmosphere changes and disappointment grabs hold. The manager’s position gets scrutinised, his decisions get picked apart and it undoubtedly has an impact. I owe Houllier and Benitez a lot for the help they gave me career but it’s important to reiterate the point I have made before: they walked out of Anfield as different men to the ones who were appointed. By the end they were giving bizarre press conferences and some of the decisions they were making were not as sharp as they had been — that is what the burning intensity of carrying Liverpool’s destiny on your shoulders can do to you. Gerard Houllier celebrates winning the League Cup in 2003 - but he left Liverpool a changed man . Rafa Benitez was another manager who Carragher believes was changed by his experiences at Liverpool . Credit, then, must go to Rodgers for how he has arrested the slide and propelled Liverpool back into the race for the top four. It was against Manchester United, Sunday's opponents, that Rodgers first unveiled his 3-4-3 formation on December 14. You rarely see many other managers play in such a way but that alteration has unlocked so much improvement. For starters, look at the way some of the new players who were criticised early on are thriving. Emre Can wasn’t bought to play on the right side of a three-man defence. Lazar Markovic didn’t arrive to be a wing-back while Adam Lallana wasn’t expected to play in some of the positions he has done. They arrived as players with talent and Rodgers has given them a platform to show what they can do. The best managers find solutions and a way to make their players thrive. That is what is happening, particularly with Can. Credit shouldn’t go to the transfer committee. Rodgers has made it work. He did it last year, too, when accommodating Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge in the same team — a lot of his counterparts, remember, struggle to fit two top-class forwards in the same line-up but Rodgers made Liverpool one of the most exciting sides in Europe. Lallana is one of Liverpool's summer signings who has flourished under Rodgers' new system . Lazar Markovic, who has impressed in recent weeks, takes time out of training to watch Friday's eclipse . Liverpool are two points behind United going into Sunday's huge game at Anfield . We associate radical systems and the ability to think on their feet with foreign managers but that is exactly what Rodgers does. His changes at half-time against Swansea on Monday were instrumental in contributing to their win. The past few months have also dispelled the idea it was just individuals who were responsible for Liverpool’s title charge. Rodgers was said to be lucky to have Suarez and Sturridge but don’t forget he banished Suarez to the reserves in August 2013, and he had the season of his life. Well, one has left for Barcelona and the other is nowhere near his best following a series of injuries, but Liverpool are the form team in the Premier League and playing some of the most exciting football in the country. That is down to Rodgers, his ideas and man-management. Aside from that, he has also had to deal with Steven Gerrard’s imminent departure and the problem of phasing him out of the side. Again, it is a challenge he has confronted and one that he has prevented from having a negative impact. Steven Gerrard, who is leaving for the MLS, will play his last game against Manchester United on Sunday . Gerrard scores the opening goal from the penalty during Liverpool's 3-0 win at Old Trafford last season . Negativity has long since been dispelled and Liverpool now have an opportunity to enjoy what I believe would turn out to be a better season than last year, if they are to achieve both their remaining objectives. Qualifying for the Champions League would, considering where they were after losing to Crystal Palace on November 23, make this season a huge success. Adding the FA Cup would make it outstanding. Rodgers is aware that no Liverpool manager in modern history has gone three years without winning a trophy and his time will ultimately be measured by silverware, but he is on the right lines. Only Kenny Dalglish, after all, has taken more points from his first 104 league games. It has been interesting to see his name being talked of as a potential replacement for Manuel Pellegrini, should Manchester City make the decision to dispense with him at the end of the season, but that isn’t something by which I am overly concerned. Rodgers (centre) addresses his squad during training and has proved his managerial credentials this season . Whether you are a player or a manager, leaving Liverpool for domestic rivals is not something you do easily and Rodgers said recently he could not see himself managing another English club. What about managing England? Once the time comes for the Football Association to look for Roy Hodgson’s successor, Rodgers would tick all the right boxes: he works with young players, promotes an attractive style and has experience of competing in Europe. He has been bold, brave and the way he has changed Liverpool’s fortunes has proved one thing beyond doubt: Brendan Rodgers is a top-class manager. Now we will see if he can propel himself to the level of Anfield’s greats. Lionel Messi proved he is the best around against Manchester City... he has eclipsed Cristiano Ronaldo this year . It was a privilege to watch Lionel Messi on Wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory. There have been times over the last 12 months, particularly at the World Cup, when I wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against Manchester City was magnificent proof that he is still the best around. What he did to City — and the way he has played since Christmas — makes me think he has jumped back above Cristiano Ronaldo in their struggle to be football’s No 1. It will make their battle in this weekend’s Clasico even more intriguing. Lionel Messi was in inspired form against Manchester City and proved he is still the best around . Cristiano Ronaldo has struggled of late and Messi may have jumped back above the Real Madrid star . I am hoping that the Champions League will produce the dream final of Barcelona versus Bayern Munich — I will be in Berlin on June 6 — and it would be fascinating to see Messi in this form in a showdown against his mentor. We all saw Pep Guardiola’s reaction to Messi’s trickery during the game and, afterwards in Barcelona, I was among a group from Sky that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into Bayern’s manager. He gave us a couple of moments of his time and, inevitably, Guardiola was asked whether he fancied coming up against Messi when the quarter-final draw was made. Milner slides as Messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their Champions League match . Messi slips the ball through Manchester City midfielder Milner's legs at the Nou Camp . James Milner approaches Barcelona star Messi during their Champions League tie on Wednesday . Bayern, after all, have been in outstanding form, scoring goals for fun, but his reaction was telling. ‘No! No! No!’ said Guardiola. ‘If I have to face Messi, I want it to be in one game rather than two!’ If they do happen to face each other in Berlin — and after Friday's draw it is not wrong to expect Barcelona and Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola (centre) reacts to the ridiculous skill from Messi during the match . This week I'm looking forward to... Dick Advocaat’s debut in the Premier League . So how will the veteran former Holland manager fare in the unforgiving arena of English football? His task is basically to finish above Burnley in a nine-game mini-season with a one-point start as I fear the bottom two clubs, Queens Park Rangers and Leicester, are already doomed. It is extraordinary to think, though, that Sunderland have gone four years without a manager seeing out a full campaign. Chopping and changing will never do a club any good. Dick Advocaat takes charge of his first game as Sunderland boss against West Ham on Saturday . If all goes well with Advocaat, maybe Sunderland will review the decision to offer him only a short-term contract. But I have a feeling that Sunderland’s hierarchy will be looking at the West Ham dug-out at a manager who looks like he may be on his way in the summer and thinking, “What if?”. If Sam Allardyce does leave West Ham, he would suit Sunderland down to the ground.","Liverpool's poor start to the season left Brendan Rodgers under pressure .

"Is there any sport better at self-criticism than Formula One? Here we are barely 24 hours after watching one of the greatest drivers ever to turn a wheel, Lewis Hamilton, winning the Australian Grand Prix in the most advanced car ever devised, yet some people have already applied the match to the paraffin. Nobody sane would suggest that Sunday's race was the most thrilling ever staged, but to call for rule changes to condense the field is ludicrously premature. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . I remember when, in 2010, refuelling was done away with and the season started with a horrific bore in Bahrain. Calls for the immediate rewriting of the regulations followed then, too. That urge was resisted and a fine season unfolded: four drivers contested the final round. Even last year, with Mercedes dominant, there were some memorable races – the best of them, this time, in Bahrain, with heart-in-your-mouth, wheel-to-wheel scrapping throughout the field. We should also provide some perspective. For most of the sport’s history, the field was far more spread out than now. Laps upon lap, minute upon minute, were not uncommon gaps in the oily-rag days of yore. Sir Stirling Moss, for example, beat his nearest challenger, Mike Hawthorn, by 5min 12.75sec to win the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix. You cannot legislate to make every grand prix interesting any more than you can make every football match interesting. Or every boxing match, or every athletics race. Thank goodness, too, because the thrill of sport would be diminished if we arrived knowing what to expect. Yet, unlike in football, Formula One feels an insatiable need to reinvent itself to ‘improve the show’. The navel-gazing is totally boring and counterproductive.

Teams cry for changes when they are failing to match their opponents, as Red Bull’s Christian Horner did in calling for Mercedes to have their grunt reined in. Toto Wolff responded by telling Horner and the rest to get their ‘f****** heads down and work hard’. Yes, is Formula One not about striving for the best, winning the arms’ race and getting your super-rich rewards? In passing, it is worth pointing out that the teams are far too powerful. The FIA, now presided over by Jean Todt, should surely be leading Formula One rather than following the consensus. If the sport does need an injection of competitiveness, we look to Nico Rosberg to play his part by challenging Hamilton in a way he did not manage in Melbourne. Last year see-sawed until Hamilton took near total command towards the end, and there is no reason to believe that Rosberg may not get the better of Hamilton at some stages this year. But for now we should celebrate the brilliance of Hamilton and his Mercedes machine, and stop moaning. Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger interviews Hamilton after his winning start to the season . Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has warned, not for the first time, that the drinks company is considering leaving Formula One because the rules are not to their liking. This threat should be wafted away. It probably is not genuine, but, even if it is, so what? Global companies such as Mercedes, Toyota and Honda use the platform of Formula One to promote themselves so long as their boardrooms see an advantage in doing so. Then, when it no suits them, they suddenly stop. It is nothing to do with the regulations or the state of the sport. Understanding that is crucial to knowing there is no point bending over backwards to pacify transient visitors. Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between 2010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution . Some wagging paddock tongues suggest that Manor never intended to race here in Australia. The suggestion is that they simply flew over the team and cars and parts to make it seem as if they would. Why? They stand to get £28million in prize money by fulfilling their obligations to be in attendance, at least. (They have missed three races – at the end of last season – and cannot miss another under the terms of their contract.) Manor deny the accusation. They say a software problem caused their unavoidable 11th hour withdrawal, adding that they have not saved a penny by not taking part, having bought the fares and paid their staff in any case. Manor’s revival, after the team previously known as Marussia went into administration last autumn, has been widely seen as a tonic for Formula One, beset by the overspending of the less successful teams (my interpretation), or by the iniquitous way it the sport is run (the popular narrative). However, it is unsettling that Manor, backed by OVO Energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, are paying just 1.3p in the pound to creditors. Manor driver Roberto Merhi walks along the grid during the drivers' parade but did not take part in the race . Spaniard Merhi waves to supporters before the first race of the season in Australia . It is no doubt reassuring for Manor’s staff to know that the self-made Graeme Lowdon, sporting director of the old Marussia team and the new Manor team, is an experienced businessman. He made about £3.5million when a previous business of which he was a director, the internet group J2C, closed amid the global technology crash in the early 2000s. Also among the lucky few was Alan Donnelly – Labour’s one-time leader in the European Parliament and a close adviser to former FIA president Max Mosley – who collected £400,000 for his £1,250 stake. Investors who bought shares when the company floated, shortly before its shares peaked, did considerably less well. One shareholder said at the time of J2C’s closure: ‘It seems unfair that the directors should be rewarded quite so well for failure.’ Graeme Lowdon, CEO of Manor arrives in the paddock but the team did not start the race in Melbourne . Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, it was gratifying to note Lewis Hamilton’s contribution to Mercedes’ post-qualifying press conference. He stood at the back, put his hand up and said to his team boss Toto Wolff: ‘From the Daily Mail, is there any news on the contract?’ Wolff: ‘No news on the contract, to the Daily Mail journalist.’ I am happy to swap salaries with Lewis. Yet while I don’t know if he could do my job, I know I could not do his. 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes +00:01.360 . 3.

"MAGIC FROM MATA . At times I’ve felt like a bit of an apologist for Juan Mata. At Anfield on Sunday, he showed his class. All game his touch was like velvet and he showed fantastic technical quality with two devastating finishes. I’ve heard some United fans and ex-pros saying he’s got no pace or he can’t do this or that. When he gets in the right place at the right time, he can cut open any team. He has a fantastic football brain and his decision-making is so quick that he doesn’t need to be fast. If you can read the game that well and take up intelligent positions then pace is not necessary. Nothing moves faster than the ball. Juan Mata scored twice as Manchester United beat Liverpool at Anfield - he showed his class throughout . Mata has a fantastic footballing brain his decision-making is so quick that he doesn’t need to be fast . Juan Mata has made 91 passes in his last two games, more than any other Manchester United midfielder . Sunday’s performance was a nod to all those who have written him off. He was good against Tottenham but he was sensational at Anfield. The acid test for any player is how well you perform in big games and they don’t get any bigger than Liverpool against United. It was a game for cool heads and that’s what Mata had. It’s a shame the same can’t be said for Steven Gerrard. Watching on, he will have been at boiling point. He must have been wondering why he was on the bench when players not in his class were struggling to make an impact on the pitch. But even though I have some sympathy, that’s still no excuse. Steven Gerrard will have been fired up after coming off the bench but there is no excuse for what he did . IT'S PERFECT FOR PARDEW . Alan Pardew was delighted after Crystal Palace came back to win at Stoke. And no wonder. When he left Newcastle for Palace, even he couldn’t have seen things going this well. He is at a club where he’s loved and since the switch Palace’s results have been far superior to Newcastle’s. Six wins and a draw means Palace have overtaken Newcastle, so all credit to him. HARRY MUST BE IN DREAMLAND . What a week for Harry Kane. He gets called up for England duty and responds with a first Premier League hat-trick. The boy is on fire. Last month I picked him out as my player of the season. A few people might have laughed at me for that, but I’m sure they’re not laughing any more. Only one player could take it off Kane now, and that’s Eden Hazard, but with three more goals, Harry’s done nothing to make me change my mind. Harry Kane scored his first Premier League hat-trick against Leicester and is still my player of the season . BRISTOL BOOMING . Bristol has always been a big rugby area, but it’s got a great football tradition as well and Steve Cotterill added his own chapter of history at Wembley on Sunday. Bristol City controlled the game in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy final and deserved their success. Cotterill is an excellent coach and an ambitious manager and that result should set them up to go on and win League One. With excellent fans and committed backers, it’s time for City to dream big. Steve Cotterill's Bristol City deserve their success and should go on and win League One this season . CHELSEA CLOSE IN . When I saw the score at the KC Stadium go to 2-2, I started to look at the league table. Would this bring City back into the title race? Would it give Arsenal a sniff? Were United even in with a chance? Then Loic Remy scores a late goal and Chelsea keep their lead at the top. When we look back at the end of the season, that could well be the result that wins Chelsea the title. After going out of the Champions League and drawing at home to Southampton, a draw at Hull would have piled the pressure on. Defensively they were poor and John Terry and Gary Cahill found Hull’s pace hard to deal with. Now they have breathing space. They have tough games to come, including Man United and Liverpool at home and Arsenal away, but results like this will help get them over the line. Chelsea's win against Hull on Sunday could prove to be the result that wins them the title . WHAT MORE CAN BIG SAM DO? The last time West Ham had 42 points at this stage of a Premier League season was in 2007-08. That year they finished 10th with 49 points in total . It may not have been a pretty watch at Upton Park on Saturday, but it was a significant win for West Ham and Sam Allardyce. Victory over Sunderland took the club to 42 points, which is more than they won in the whole of last season. And I don’t care what anybody says, Big Sam has done a good job at West Ham. He saved them from relegation last year, rebuilt over the summer and some of their attacking football in the first half of the season was fantastic to watch. But for whatever reason, his face doesn’t seem to fit and I suspect he will move on in the summer. If that happens, I’m sure there will be plenty of suitors for Sam. He is a talented manager and something of a relegation specialist, so don’t be surprised if he waits until a struggling club comes calling. Sam Allardyce has done a good job at West Ham despite what people say - some of their football is fantastic . MEETING THE MAESTRO . It was a privilege to be at the Nou Camp last week to see Lionel Messi put in a magical performance in the Champions League. I used to worry that we might have seen the best of the little magician. Not anymore. His delivery to set up Jeremy Mathieu’s opener in El Clasico on Sunday night was spot on and he was sensational against City last week. The only problem was he wouldn’t stop bugging me and Carra for a photo... Lionel Messi (centre) poses for a photograph with Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher at the Nou Camp .","Juan Mata was excellent against Liverpool and can cut open any team .
Alan Pardew deserves credit for the job he is doing at Crystal Palace .
Harry Kane is still my player of the season after his first top flight hat-trick .
Bristol City deserve success and should dream big after Wembley win .
West Ham have more points than last season - what more can Big Sam do?"
"John Terry is going to cause Chelsea a huge problem in the future and the cost to fix it will be enormous. There will come a point one day when Jose Mourinho is no longer able to rely on his captain and, privately, he will be dreading when that time comes. The term to describe Terry’s influence on this Chelsea team is the same as the one you would label his performance at Wembley: colossal. Mourinho’s brilliance as a manager cannot be overstated. Wherever he goes, he is successful and he has won trophies with any number of different players. Some managers need big individuals to get them over the line but Mourinho does it regardless of who he is working with. John Terry's current form for Chelsea is arguably as impressive as it was 10 years ago . Terry scored the opening goal of the game in the recent Capital One Cup Final win against Tottenham . Premier League: 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10. FA Cup: 1999-00, 2006-07, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12. League Cup: 2004-05, 2006-07, 2014-15. Community Shield: 2005, 2009. Champions League: 2011-12. Europa League: 2012-13. With Terry, however, the case is different. When Chelsea won the League Cup 10 years ago — the first of the five trophies they lifted during Mourinho’s first reign — the side was built around a formidable spine of Petr Cech, Terry, Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. All those players have been subsequently replaced with one notable exception. Terry was as good against Tottenham as he was against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium in 2005 and you have to ask when the time comes to fill his shoes, what will the price be? When you think Manchester City paid £32million for Eliaquim Mangala last summer and David Luiz cost Paris Saint-Germain £50m, you get an idea of how difficult it will be to find someone with Terry’s many qualities. On these pages 14 months ago, I described Terry as the best defender in Barclays Premier League history and one moment towards the end of the game on Sunday showed why he has stayed at the top of his profession for so long. Terry is the only player that remains from the old spine of the Chelsea team, the others have been replaced . Jose Mourinho recognises the importance of his captain ad will be keen to retain his services . The game was won but Tottenham were looking to grab a consolation and it looked like it might arrive when Harry Kane wriggled into the area. He was denied, though, by Terry putting his body on the line to make sure Chelsea’s goal wasn’t threatened. During the World Cup last summer, I complained that there was a lack of great central defenders playing now — the type who will do the dirty work and would kill for a clean sheet. Terry is one of the remaining few. As a player, I hold him in the highest regard and his consistency has been remarkable. Sometimes I don’t think it gets appreciated how difficult it is to stay at one club for your entire career, especially in the position John has filled. I know what it is like to get beyond 30 and have people writing you off on the basis of your age, the constant questioning of ‘Is he the same as he used to be?’. A bad game and the scrutiny comes on you. There is an added pressure for defenders. When you are not at your best, you know that one mistake and you will be the one who costs the team the game; midfielders or strikers can be taken off but as a defender there is nowhere to hide. Paris Saint-Germain paid £50million for David Luiz, who was considered surplus to requirements at Chelsea . Manchester City paid £32m for Eliaquim Mangala but didn't feel comfortable starting him against Barcelona . But John has never hidden, not even after the campaign two years ago when he made just 14 appearances. This season he is up to 36 and playing as well as he has ever done, leaving some to ask whether he could play for England again. Wisely, he has ended such talk. He might be the best English defender but he is not needed for the Euro 2016 qualification campaign, as England have already qualified. The extra recovery time he now has between games helps his form and who is to say he will be playing so well in 18 months anyway? The future for England is players such as John Stones and Calum Chambers. Concentrating on Chelsea is best for him. He is yet to sign a deal but I don’t for one moment expect the Stamford Bridge hierarchy to let him slip out of the club. He is too valuable and given how Mourinho sets his team up, he could play for at least another two years. Gary Cahill and Kurt Zouma are good players but without Terry, I would not be confident about Chelsea winning the Premier League next season. If he was to leave, there would not be a team in the top flight who Terry would not improve. Mourinho knows this better than anyone. Gary Cahill and Kurt Zouma are good defenders but perhaps not in the same class as Terry . Terry and fellow goalscorer Diego Costa celebrate during the Capital One Cup final win at Wembley Stadium .","Chelsea will find it extremely difficult to replace their captain John Terry .
Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Petr Cech, Claude Makelele all replaced .
But Chelsea have never found a replacement for Terry .
People underestimate how hard it is to stay at a top club for so long .
Jose Mourinho knows the value of Terry and won't let him leave ."
"Forgive the gross presumption in offering career advice to Lewis Hamilton, but he has given his father’s management the flick and told Simon Fuller’s XIX Entertainment their services are no longer needed. He, a novice in such entanglements, is now negotiating his own future, albeit with the help of a lady lawyer of impeccable and long-standing loyalty to the family. We are told by Mercedes that a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the season is a formality. Hamilton has said he wants to sign it. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win at the season-opening race in Melbourne, Australia  - but is yet to sign a new deal with the team . Hamilton's current Mercedes contract runs out at the end of this season and no new deal has been agreed yet . Yet four months after he won the world championship in Abu Dhabi, there is only one important fact: no deal has been concluded. This is strange. It is literally only an afternoon’s job sorting out the terms of a contract if there is a willingness on both sides to tie it all up. So why the delay? It may be that Hamilton is holding out for the salary he wants. It is not £1million a week he seeks, despite some reports to the contrary. It is probably about €1m – or the piffling matter of £720,000 according to the current exchange rate. Perhaps the two sides will yet come to a mutually agreeable financial arrangement. But, as one of my mentors advised me about the chicanery of the paddock, there is a reason behind everything in Formula One. Mercedes say a new contract is a formality while Hamilton says he wants ti sign, so why the delay? Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . I hope that the delay is because Hamilton is seeking a move to Ferrari. Madness? No. By the end of the season, he hopes to have emulated his hero Ayrton Senna in winning three world titles – the number that most clearly defines a driver’s status in the pantheon. What has he got to lose? Such is Senna’s immortal fame that here in Australia, from where I write this, Senna’s face is still emblazoned on billboards advertising Tag Heuer watches. Never mind that he died in 1994. Before his fatal accident at the San Marino Grand Prix, Senna, as has since become common knowledge, talked to Ferrari about racing for them. I suspect scratching the itch that Senna could not - namely, competing for the sport’s most evocative marque - would mean more to Hamilton than the possibility of clocking up win after win, title after title. He has never been a chaser of records for their own sake. That kind of thing is for Vettel and the birds. Vettel joined Ferrari ahead of the new season after six seasons driving for Red Bull . The German finished third in his first race for the Scuderia in Melbourne eight days ago . However, there is no reason why Ferrari, with their vast resources, could not deliver title-winning cars for him. Then, he would have won championships with three teams, McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. His status would be further embellished. Another tantalising, legend-making prospect is a straight fight in identical machinery between Hamilton and Vettel. Hamilton, like Fernando Alonso, thinks himself a better racer than Vettel, who, so the theory goes, was flattered by his Red Bull car in winning four world titles. By replacing Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, Hamilton could prove what he has always believed. I can hear the chorus of the cautious. Mercedes are a super-team; Ferrari are in upheaval and struggling for form. Yes, but success in sport is often cyclical. Ferrari are fabulously well-resourced. And who knows whether the team that Ross Brawn built at Mercedes will thrive so dominantly in the long run? Will Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe work harmoniously if the wheels fall off? How will Niki Lauda’s scattergun style of chairmanship play out? If Hamilton wants to be bold and take the plunge, he has a big ally at Ferrari. I hear from unimpeachable sources that the Scuderia’s president, Sergio Marchionne, rates Hamilton top of the drivers available to him. Vettel won four consecutive world championships as Red Bull dominated Formula One . It seems journalism is not a crime, Max Mosley . I hope it won’t spoil our next very agreeable lunch if I point out to Max Mosley that it has emerged from the Old Bailey that journalism is not a criminal offence, after all. For, in a blow to the former FIA president's censorship-seeking pressure group Hacked Off, four Sun journalists were cleared last week of paying public officials for stories in a case that delved far into the ethics of the tabloid Press. My trade's hero of the court is Mr Justice Saunders for his reaction to the prosecution’s haughty counsel, Mr Michael Parroy QC, who implied that the Sun’s chief reporter, John Kay, was wrong to describe the death in Afghanistan of Prince William’s Army mentor as ‘a belting exclusive splash’. The judge said: ‘The mere fact of it being a tragedy does not stop it being a good story.’ Jules Bianchi suffered a horrific crash at the Japanese Grand Prix in October last year . This reminded me of a furore after Jules Bianchi’s awful accident in Suzuka last year. Several bloggers – some of whom, we note, have never remotely held down a staff job at a blue chip media organisation – fulminated piously on their websites about the supposed insensitivity of at least one of my Fleet Street colleagues in seeking facts and answers from Bianchi’s Marussia team and the FIA in those worrying hours immediately after the crash. The critics did not understand that when a sports event immediately becomes a news inferno, the reporter must adapt. It was not insensitivity that led journalists to ask detailed questions of those whose job it was to answer them; it was a professional requirement. I shall stop being sanctimonious myself, now. But if anyone doubts the sense of what I say, I cite Mr Justice Saunders. Former FIA president Max Mosley arrives the High Court in London for the Leveson Inquiry . It's a shame to lose the German Grand Prix . It is bad enough being a Pommie visitor Down Under when the Australian team are blazing their way towards cricket's World Cup final and the boys who briefly masqueraded as the England team are already back and badly bruised in Blighty. But it is not only born and bred Aussies to be dodged. There was also the Pakistani-supporting taxi driver in Melbourne, who dissected England’s failings, brought me up to date with Imran Khan’s latest political plans and was about to fly next morning to Adelaide to watch his Pakistan team lose, as it predictably turned out, to Australia. Then you go to Sydney and are driven back from Watsons Bay by a Bangladeshi taxi driver. He hoots with laughter at how his heroes gave our lot a national disgrace of a caning. England were dumped out of the World Cup after a defeat by Bangladesh earlier this month . But it was still a rare thrill to go to the giant bowl of the MCG to watch one of the 49 days of cricket in this absurdly protracted competition. Sitting in the members’ area, we could visit the library, sip refreshments in reasonable comfort and gawp at the galleries of pictures of heroes like Douglas Jardine, who, as captain of the 1932-33 ‘Bodyline’ team, led the most notorious touring party to these shores since the First Fleet. A few hours after returning from the MCG it was announced that the German Grand Prix was off. Like most Formula One devotees, I was sorry. This is a heritage race. But could either German venue, the Nurburgring or Hockenheim, claim that they offered a world-class experience for punters or the travelling Formula One family? Hamilton drives his Mercedes to third in last season's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim . F1 is missing the voice of Murray Walker . Australian television sport is said to be a tough and jealous business. Especially so if you sound as English as Eddie Redmayne. But a few of our chaps have really cracked it: Henry Blofeld and Mark Nicholas, both from cricket, and, spectacularly, Murray Walker. Murray’s friend and successor, James Allen, told me once that by his reckoning only Sir Jack Brabham and, possibly, Alan Jones stood higher in the esteem of Australian motor-racing than our own high-decibel warbler. Reflecting on the dissatisfied response to the first race of the season in Melbourne, I wondered how different perceptions among TV viewers would have been if Murray had been behind the microphone rather than watching, headphones on, from the study of his Hampshire home. The famous F1 commentator Murray Walker had the ability doubled the excitement levels just by being there . For all the blanket coverage provided by Sky’s pioneering crack team, and the BBC’s excellent professional output, there is no longer that one voice which doubles the excitement levels just by being there. Transcendent commentators come along in any sport once in a generation, if we are lucky. David Coleman was one such golden larynx in athletics, a sport that has lost a little of its allure since he left it. Murray Walker, on two continents, was another.","Lewis Hamilton's current Mercedes deal expires at the end of this season .

"The first thing you need to know about Jose Mourinho is just how much he loves winning football matches. It is everything to him — whether it is the Barclays Premier League, the Champions League or a charity match. Last summer, Jose was in charge of the Rest of the World for Soccer Aid, I was playing for Sam Allardyce’s England side and Mourinho’s team were leading at Old Trafford going into the final moments. To ensure the advantage was preserved, however, Mourinho — with a glint in his eye — had a word with James McAvoy, the Hollywood actor, who he was putting on as substitute. Not long after, James had gone to ground with an ‘injury’ to help run the clock down. The job was done and they won 4-2! Nemanja Matic (left) John Terry and Gary Cahill joke during training at the end of a hard week for Chelsea . Mourinho spikily replied to comments made by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness . Cesc Fabregas controls the ball as the Premier League leaders look forward to Sunday's Southampton game . I must stress that it was all good-natured, but on Wednesday night against Paris Saint-Germain, the actions of a Mourinho team were significantly darker. I called Chelsea’s behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a Champions League quarter-final place. They went beyond what is acceptable but, unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen them do it. I doubt it will be the last, either. Mourinho and his teams take winning to a level that other teams and managers do not. Mourinho shakes hands with fans before the start of last summer's Soccer Aid match at Old Trafford . Jamie Carragher (centre) played for Sam Allardyce's England side for the charity game in June last year . As the seconds dwindled, James McEvoy (left) went down with an injury as the the Rest of the World won 4-2 . Respect for Mourinho’s achievements in the game is beyond doubt. In a few years from now, we could be acknowledging him as the most successful manager of all time, particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches, as is his current remarkable ratio. But will he be loved? Chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him. Porto and Inter supporters will too. Yet beyond that? It is debatable. Will he care how he is remembered? I think he will. Deep down, I think everyone in football cares how they are perceived. Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch referee gives Zlatan Ibrahimovic his marching orders . It was this tackle by the Swede on Oscar that had the Chelsea players swarming round the ref . Ibrahimovic's night was over after the tackle in the first half . Every outfield Chelsea player except Oscar was involved in the mass protest . Are trophies more important than creating good memories? I would always argue ‘yes’ to that. During my career, I won 10 major honours but none of the Liverpool teams I played for is particularly remembered for being a top side. If I’m honest, it annoys me, especially when I hear stories even now of how great Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle team of 1995-96 were or how thrilling the Leeds team were that reached the Champions League semi-final in 2000. Yes, they both played fast, exciting football but what did they win? Nothing. Mourinho led Porto to the UEFA Cup in 2003 and the Champions League a year after . Mourinho grabs Marco Materazzi after guiding Inter Milan to their third European Cup in 2010 . You want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime, like the Real Madrid team of the 1950s that Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas inspired to five consecutive European Cups or the Ajax team of Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff from the 1970s. They took that style on to the Dutch national squad. Cruyff once said, ‘how you play is more important than what you win’ and to some extent, he is right. The Holland side from the 1974 World Cup, for instance, get spoken about more than the West German squad that actually won it. Personally, I would have rather been a German than in the Dutch squad that came up short. The same goes for Brazil in 1982, the other great team that captured hearts but failed to conquer the world. Real Madrid's Raymond Kopa, Rial,  Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Gento pose before a game in 1959 . Johan Cruyff rounds Argentina keeper Daniel Carnevali before scoring in the 1974 World Cup quarter-final . The great Brazilian side of 1982 celebrate Socrates' wonderful equaliser in the 3-2 defeat by winners Italy . I know most of the names of that great squad, as I am sure many do — Zico, Eder, Falcao, Socrates — but what would those men rather have, a winner’s medal — like their compatriots in 1970 — or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played? In an ideal world, you get remembered for winning with style. The best example I have of that from my childhood was the AC Milan team of Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten that was guided by Arrigo Sacchi in the late 1980s. Their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the European Cup. Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, however, are the team that took style and success to another level all together. They will still be writing books about them in 50 years, such was the swagger with which they won 14 trophies in four extraordinary years. When a team wins silverware with imagination and fantasy, it almost seems more special. Mourinho is just as prolific at collecting trophies as Guardiola but the brand of football his team play does not compare. That is why, in the long-term, you won’t find his teams spoken about like some of the others I have mentioned. The behaviour of the teams, of course, doesn’t help either. Chelsea have been likened to the Leeds team from the 1970s but I actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during Mourinho’s first spell in England. They were prepared to push it further still. Pep Guardiola is thrown by his adoring Barcelona players after winning the 2011 Champions League . Leeds players surround Ray Tinkler after the referee controversially allowed Jeff Astle's goal in 1971 . John Terry, John Mikel Obi, Ashley Cole and Michael Essien get in referee Rob Styles' face in 2007 . None of that might bother Mourinho, in the same way it didn’t bother Rafa Benitez. I remember him once telling me about a conversation he had with a Spanish journalist, about what was perceived as ‘great football’ and ‘winning football’. Rafa was puzzled by this, so he asked the journalist: ‘Who scored Spain’s winning goal in the 1964 European Championship?’ The reply came: ‘Marcelino’. So Rafa then asked, ‘And how did Spain play in the game?’ to which there was silence. Oscar appeared to be no worse off after Ibrahimovic's midweek tackle as he trained on Friday . Diego Costa sat down for a bit of keepy-uppy at Cobham as the players prepared for Southampton . Mourinho keeps a close eye on things as the Blues boss gets his side ready for Sunday's lunchtime kick-off . His point was all that mattered was Spain had won the trophy. Mourinho would clearly understand the logic in that argument. I can see what he means, too. But the idea of winning at all costs? That is something with which I am not comfortable. I loved winning, there was nothing better that you could experience in football. But when all is said and done, you want to be remembered and respected for what you achieved. And if Mourinho’s teams keep taking things to the brink, the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come. Hughes revival will put big clubs on alert . There is a big game in the Midlands with West Bromwich Albion coming up against Stoke. Praise for the work of Albion’s Tony Pulis, the former Stoke boss, shows no sign of dwindling, particularly after he was named manager of the month for February. West Brom are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the Barclays Premier League next season. But what about Mark Hughes, the man who succeeded Pulis at Stoke? Tony Pulis won the manager of the month award for February after his fine work at West Brom . Mark Hughes (right) has flown under the radar but has led the Potters to eighth in the Premier League . Without grabbing any headlines, Hughes has impressively manoeuvred Stoke into eighth place in the Premier League and they have built on their efforts of last season. They spent just £1.2million last summer, and lost Bojan Krkic to a serious knee injury, but they continue to get good results. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more points since Boxing Day. The work Hughes has done at the Britannia Stadium seems to have gone under the radar. His journey since he was sacked in a poor manner by Manchester City in December 2009 hasn’t always been smooth. For instance, he was criticised for the way he left Fulham in 2011 and was then sacked by Queens Park Rangers after spending less than a year at Loftus Road, even though he kept them in the top flight in May 2012. But he has rebuilt his reputation in the Potteries and looks like he will be rewarded with a new contract. If he continues to make such impressive strides, he may get the chance once again to work at a club that can regularly compete for top honours. This week I'm looking forward to... Seeing if Everton can keep flying the flag in Europe . Another disappointing week in Europe for teams from the Barclays Premier League but, once again, Everton proved an exception to the rule. The last hour of their clash with Dynamo Kiev saw Everton playing at their best under Roberto Martinez — the football was good, the energy was high and there was an intensity in everything they did. It all helped to show how difficult Romelu Lukaku  can be to play against in that mood. He bulldozed his way past a number of challenges to set up Steven Naismith’s goal, showed character to take the crucial penalty and bullied Dynamo’s defenders, including the highly-rated Aleksandar Dragovic. He now has 16 goals for the season. Romelu Lukaku skips past Aleksandar Dragovic (left) during an all-action display against Dynamo Kiev . Lukaku's penalty was not convincing, but it hands Everton the upper hand in the tie ahead of the return leg . When you see Everton play like that, you wonder why they have struggled in the Premier League. But if they replicate the performance that gave them a 2-1 lead to take to Kiev, they will have an outstanding chance of beating Newcastle for just their second league win of 2015. As soon as Everton start getting points on the board again, the tense atmosphere around Goodison Park will relax and Evertonians will be able to enjoy the European adventure a little bit more.","Winning is everything to Jose Mourinho - whether it is the Barclays Premier League, the Champions League or a charity match .
Chelsea went beyond what is acceptable against PSG but, unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen them do it. I doubt it will be the last, either .
In a few years from now, we could be acknowledging Mourinho as the most successful manager of all time .
But will he be loved? Chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him. Porto and Inter supporters will too. Yet beyond that? It is debatable ."
"SAINTS TO MAKE IT SEVENTH HEAVEN . The race for the top four has always been keenly contested, but it’s normally between the same six sides: Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal, Man United, Liverpool and Spurs. Now Southampton are forcing people to reconsider and make it seven. That was an excellent point at Chelsea and, aside from poor marking for Diego Costa’s goal, the Saints were excellent at the back. They are so well organised, have an excellent midfield shield in Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin and Fraser Forster is a top goalkeeper. He was immense against Chelsea and has been a big plus since arriving from Celtic. The result keeps Ronald Koeman’s side in the hunt and, whatever happens, it’s been a good season for Southampton. Southampton team-mates congratulate goalscorer Tadic after levelling the score at 1-1 in the first half . 21 -  Southampton have conceded the fewest PL goals this season and kept the joint-most clean sheets (13). They have made huge strides and anyone with a talented young lad would love them to play for that club. Their transfer policy is sound and they are happy to give youth a chance thanks to their incredible academy facilities. Some of the top clubs in Europe will be keeping tabs on Koeman because he has done a fantastic job with a side many tipped for relegation. As for the race for the Champions League? If it keeps going as it is there are going to be some big clubs and good sides who miss out. Southampton keeper Fraser Fortser takes the ball away from Ivanovic's head as the Saints defence holds firm . Jose Fonte (right) posted on Instagram after the Chelsea draw saying 'Since 2010 . . .#MARCHINGON' BOY OH BOYD! George Boyd typifies what has been good about Burnley this season. He works so hard for his manager and his team-mates, but he’s also got that little bit of quality to go with it. He scored a fantastic goal against Man City — it was superb technique and such a pure strike — but I was so impressed by his work ethic. He covered 8.4 miles on Saturday — the fourth-highest distance in the league this season. And, incredibly, of the top 10 distances run in 2014-15, six of them belong to Boyd. That is an incredible effort and exactly what managers want. George Boyd (centre) wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner against Manchester City . PELLEGRINI'S CITY SLACKERS . That was a shambolic performance from Man City. I can’t understand how a team can go from being champions to being so slack. The players almost look bored and uninterested. It happened under Roberto Mancini and it’s happening under Manuel Pellegrini. Every time Chelsea stutter, City fail to take advantage. I don’t think you can pin it all on the manager, but he needs to do something and quick, because now they’re looking over their shoulder at the chasing pack. Manchester City players traipse from the pitch after losing 1-0 to Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday evening . £195m - The approximate cost of Manchester City’s star-studded starting XI at Turf Moor this weekend - Burnley’s was less than £7 . PAIN FOR POYET . I’ve played alongside Gus Poyet and he is one of the most passionate people in the game. That result will have hurt him. He took full responsibility after the game but that was one of the worst performances I have seen in the Premier League. Sunderland were hopeless. They were sloppy with the ball and showed no real desire to get into the game. No wonder the supporters were venting their anger. Gus Poyet was left fuming in the Sunderland dugout after his side fell 4-0 behind to Aston Villa by half-time . PULIS ON THE UP . Tony Pulis has his strikers firing but, most importantly for West Brom, he has stopped them leaking goals. He builds teams from the back and it shows in the stats. At Palace last season they conceded far fewer goals after his arrival and it’s the same now at the Hawthorns. He’s such a specialist in the relegation scrap. Tony Pulis is doing a remarkable job at West Bromich Albion as his side continue move towards safety . MAGIC MAROUANE STRIKES AGAIN . I’ve never been his biggest fan, but credit where credit’s due: Marouane Fellaini was outstanding against Tottenham on Sunday. Since he first arrived at the club he has had to fight perceptions and prove his worth. I still don’t think in the long term he is a United player — he’s certainly not someone to build a team around — but this season he has been one of their most effective players. Louis van Gaal has made him his go-to man and it is paying off. He scored one,was involved in another and caused Spurs the most problems. He was United’s best outfield player against Arsenal and again on Sunday, so fair play to him and Van Gaal for making it work. Marounne Fellaini buries this chance for Manchester United's opener against Tottenham in the 3-0 victory . N'ZOGBIA KEY TO VILLA'S REVIVAL . I was speaking to Tim Sherwood a few weeks ago and he said the biggest problem at Aston Villa was that the players were paralysed by fear. Tim has come in and changed all that. He has Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor scoring but, more importantly, he has brought Charles N’Zogbia back in from the cold. Paul Lambert froze him out but he is exactly the kind of creative force Villa were crying out for. He certainly doesn’t play with fear and his energy and skill tore Sunderland apart. Charles N'Zogbia (right) was in fine form for Aston Villa against Sunderland on Saturday afternoon . BLUES ARE BACK . It's been a good week for Everton in a very tough season. The first half-hour against Dynamo Kiev was painful to watch last week — there was almost an anger around the ground at the way the team were playing. They had to fight so hard to get that win but you saw what it did for their confidence — they followed it with a big result against Newcastle. I never felt they were in danger of being relegated and now they could go on a run and might even be England’s last team standing in Europe. James McCarthy (right) opened the the scoring for Everton on Sunday at Goodison Park . 170  - Bolasie has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014-15, more than Neymar (160) and Arjen Robben (154). PALACE'S WIDE BOYS GET IT DONE . Palace are flying under Alan Pardew and it’s the wide men who are doing the damage. Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha were excellent but it was a tough result for Chris Ramsey. He looks like he’s playing youngsters to please the chairman but this is a time to win points, not brownie points. 170 Bolasie has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014-15, more than Neymar (160) and Arjen Robben (154). Yannick Bolasie (left) was in great form to provide two assists for Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon . JAMIE'S PREMIER LEAGUE NUMBER CRUNCHING . 3 - During their demolition of QPR on Saturday, Crystal Palace scored three first-half goals for the first time in their six seasons in the Premier League. However, it was the third time this season that QPR had shipped three before the break. The fact that Matty Phillips scored from the furthest distance this PL season (40 yards) will be of little consolation for Rangers fans. Matty Phillips fired in an unbelievable strike for Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park on Saturday . 18 - Wilfried Zaha had gone 18 Premier League games without a goal or assist before Saturday, but managed both in the first half against QPR. 21 - After failing to score in 21 games for Lille, Liverpool loanee Divock Origi grabbed a hat-trick in his side’s 3-0 win against Rennes. 2005 - Arsenal have hit some excellent form in the second half of the season. The Gunners have won eight straight home PL games for the first time ever at the Emirates and the first time overall since November 2005. 12 - Aston Villa scored as many goals in the first 18 minutes against Sunderland as they had in their previous 12 away league games (two). 1-  Southampton have not conceded more than a single goal in a Premier League away game since the opening weekend of the season, when they lost 2-1 to Liverpool at Anfield. Divock Origi (centre) celebrates after scoring for Lille against Rennes at the Pierre Mauroy stadium .","The Saints have a great chance qualifying for Europe next season .

"Roy Hodgson is holding his cards close to his chest with England’s squad due to be announced this week. England meet Lithuania at Wembley in Euro 2016 qualifying on March 27 before travelling to the Juventus Stadium in Turin for a friendly with Italy four days later. The last time England played was in mid-November, when they beat Scotland and Slovenia with Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert and Saido Berhaino. Yet the contenders have arrived. Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge, Charlie Austin and Danny Ings are among those that could be selected, and Hodgson is set to pick four from the eight available. So, stick or twist? Well, here are the numbers that may sway Hodgson’s decision one way or another. England captain Wayne Rooney, pictured celebrating against Scotland, looks a certainty to be picked . Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur . Against Arsenal on February 7, Kane scored twice in front of watching England manager Hodgson to win the north London derby. It was deja vu on March 8, when the 21-year-old added two more against Queens Park Rangers yet again in front of the England manager. If that doesn’t convince, perhaps these statistics will: . • Only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo (both 41) have scored more than Kane (26) in all competitions this season . • Only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa (both 17) have more Premier League goals but Kane (16) did not start a game until November 9 . • Kane has scored 14 in his last 13 Premier League games and became the fourth player in history to score in six consecutive away games . • His goals have contributed a staggering 19 points in the Premier League this season . And we could go on. Kane is used to leading a 4-2-3-1 at Tottenham, and would have to adapt to a partnership in Hodgson’s classic 4-4-2 midfield diamond formation. Even so, the question is not should Hodgson pick the highest scoring Englishman, but rather how could he not? VERDICT: SHOULD GO . Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane beats Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Robert Green last week . Kane celebrates one of his many goals this season as the striker gets noticed in the Premier League . Kane will hope to be involved in Roy Hodgson's England squad when it is announced this week . Charlie Austin, Queens Park Rangers . QPR vs Tottenham was billed as the battle of the two best kids on the playground yet, with teacher watching on, Kane overshadowed his potential England team-mate. But Austin, seemingly carrying the third-bottom team in the Premier League, remains the fourth top goalscorer (15), just one behind the man with better service at White Hart Lane. Shoot on sight, seems to be the strategy. Austin ranks first in total shots (61) and shooting accuracy (67 per cent) out of the eight potential England forwards, having played more minutes (2,169) than any of the others this season. Austin’s goals have contributed 45 per cent of QPR’s points this season, and manager Chris Ramsey reckons he and Kane would complement each other in a front two partnership. VERDICT: SHOULD GO . QPR striker Charlie Austin scores against Arsenal at Loftus Road earlier in March in the Premier League . England hopeful Austin is in contention to be selected by Hodgson when his squad is announced this week . Wayne Rooney, Manchester United . Rooney, no longer being restricted to deep midfield, was restored to an attacking role recently, and scored twice against Sunderland to show he hasn’t lost his touch. He’s joint-first for chance conversion (29 per cent) and assists (four), and Hodgson previously announced he has no intention of using him as anything other than a striker. Was that a bluff? Rooney could still be used as an attacking midfielder or auxiliary forward behind two strikers, without wishing to step on Raheem Sterling’s toes as No 10. Rooney looked comfortable up top against Arsenal on Monday night, scoring Manchester United’s only goal in a 2-1 defeat. ‘He’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer,’ Hodgson said in February. ‘It would take a lot from a 19 or 20-year-old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps.’ Never say never, but Rooney surely has a place reserved, whether that be as a striker or otherwise. VERDICT: SHOULD GO . Wayne Rooney has become the regular face of England and is set to be selected once more by Hodgson . Rooney celebrates Ashley Young's wining goal at St James' Park for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United . Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool . Sturridge is just returning from a thigh and hamstring injury that cost him five months, but has the third best minutes-per-goal ratio (175) of the eight strikers. The fit-again Liverpool forward started against Blackburn Rovers and Burnley, rather than Sterling being used in the centre, as the youngster had been against Manchester City and Southampton. Easing Sturridge back in to middle of Liverpool’s 3-4-3 is only natural, but he should be fit enough to be used internationally this month. Plenty are calling for England to adopt SturriKane, and we know the former Chelsea forward has no qualms in developing a partnership, as he showed with Luis Suarez. Sturridge can create something from nothing, and he and the young Tottenham forward could click, if Hodgson fancies it. VERDICT: SHOULD GO . Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge heads his goal against Burnley in the Premier League at Anfield . The ball nestles in the back of the net as Sturridge continues his recovery from an injury that cost months . Sturridge runs away in celebration after scoring for Liverpool as he continues his return to fitness . Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion . Nobody can say Berahino isn’t a workhorse. The only player to have featured in all 28 Premier League games, he has an admirable 12 goals and dominated back pages when he was selected by Hodgson in November. Yet he never made it off the substitutes’ bench against Slovenia or Scotland, and it led to a run of eight games without a goal for West Brom. He broke that duck against West Ham with an equaliser on New Year’s Day, before letting his frustration out on poor, old Gateshead with four goals in a 7-0 humiliation in the FA Cup third round. Hodgson has put plenty of faith in his Young Lions previously, and could well choose to give the 21-year-old his England debut in March. But the fight to be Hodgson’s fourth striker arguably rests between Berahino, Ings, Austin and Welbeck. For me, the pendulum swings the way of the QPR striker more than the rest. VERDICT: SHOULD NOT GO . West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino is in contention to be selected by England manager Hodgson . Berahino runs away in celebration after scoring for West Brom in the Premier League against Aston Villa . Berahino could be selected  as he continues to show why he deserves a place in the England team . Danny Ings, Burnley . What about the chap wanted by Liverpool, both Manchester clubs and Real Sociedad? Ings has scored nine goals for second-bottom Burnley – five of them in 2015 alone – and has the joint-most assists of the lot (four). Young and English with plenty to prove, he’s beating the odds week in, week out. Perhaps it is that which convinced Louis van Gaal to send chief scout Jim Lawlor to Anfield last week when Burnley were in town. Sean Dyche fielded the first all-British Premier League XI in December since 2011, and Ings is among those taking his chance in a team that use similar formations to England – 4-4-1-1 and 4-4-2. Ings has scored four goals in seven games for the England Under-21 team, but a call-up can only come if he proves more worthy than his competition, and that’s a tall ask. VERDICT: SHOULD NOT GO... YET . Danny Ings is wanted by a number of top Premier League clubs and could be called up by England . Ings is being looked at by Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool as he is likely to leave Burnley . Danny Welbeck, Arsenal . Against Slovenia in November, Welbeck scored twice in the Euro 2016 qualifier as England won 3-1. Same again? He played as a lone striker against his former club at Old Trafford, scored, and celebrated. Arsenal opted for 4-2-3-1 that night, although they tend to alter between 4-1-4-1 and 4-4-1-1 with Olivier Giroud the preferred striker. But Welbeck seized the day, pouncing on Antonio Valencia’s suicidal back-pass and making no mistake. Yet this season has not gone according to plan for Arsenal forward. He’s ranked last for minutes per goals (379) out of the eight, as well as bringing up the rear in chance conversion (11 per cent). Does he deserve a spot more than Kane, Ings or Austin? Not according to the rankings. VERDICT: SHOULD NOT GO . Danny Welbeck trains with Arsenal as the Premier League club look to clinch Champions League football . Welbeck has had a dip in form recently but will be looking to clinch a place in the England team once more . Rickie Lambert, Liverpool . Lambert got 10 minutes against Scotland in November, having gone to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, hardly getting a look-in. The 33-year-old’s rankings tell the story better. In 19 appearances in the Premier League, he ranks last for goals (2), shots (12), and, for a man with aerial ability, is the only one of the eight to not have scored a header. It would be bold to argue those with more than a decade on the Liverpool striker are less worthy to be included in Hodgson’s squad, and it seems Lambert’s time has been and gone. The consistency of Kane and Austin, among others, has blitzed the man on the wrong side of 30, and it’s time for the young blood. VERDICT: SHOULD NOT GO . Rickie Lambert has found life difficult since joining Liverpool and is unlikely to be selected by Hodgson . It would be surprising if Lambert (pictured right with Fabio Borini in training) was picked for the England team . SHOULD GO: ROONEY, KANE, STURRIDGE, AUSTIN . SHOULD NOT GO: WELBECK, BERAHINO, INGS, LAMBERT .","England face Lithuania on March 27 and Italy in a friendly on March 31 .

"I just loved seeing Danny Welbeck celebrate his goal. It is a load of tosh when a former player doesn’t celebrate against his old team. Goalscoring is why we play/watch/support — and it’s a while since Danny scored one! United didn’t want to keep him, he left for Arsenal and here he was back at Old Trafford scoring a predatory winner. Danny Welbeck rounded David De Gea to score Arsenal's winner against Manchester United . Welbeck latched on to an weak pass from Antonio Valencia to take the ball past De Gea and score . Welbeck (left) celebrated his goal at Old Trafford despite the fact he used to play for United . Of course he should enjoy it. Before his goal, watching Danny for an hour was awkward TV. The ball was bouncing away from him. He looked desperate at times. Even when he went down in the box, I thought he could have gone on to get a shot away. How much did he want to get into that position to shoot? If you look at Chelsea striker Diego Costa, he just lives for the chances, but as soon as the ball drops for Danny, it’s as if you can hear his pulse racing through the TV and nerves get the better of him. There are lots of things you can work on in football, but goalscorers have that ice in their veins, like Robbie Fowler, Alan Shearer or Thierry Henry. It was staggering that Louis van Gaal did not turn to Radamel Falcao. The poor lad must be thinking: What am I doing here? Louis van Gaal did not use striker Falcao to rescue the game against Arsenal at Old Trafford . Michael Carrick (right) was brought on at half-time but Colombia forward Falcao was unused . I know he is not the player Manchester United thought they were getting, but isn’t it down to the manager to get the best out of him? Goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with Daley Blind and Michael Carrick, two sitting midfielders, on the pitch. The defending from United for Arsenal’s first goal was unbelievable! Yes, it was a fantastic goal for Arsenal but the defending from United was scandalous.That’s not about tactics, that’s players needing to tackle. Three United players failed to stop Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as he ran at them and Antonio Valencia – who was playing at right back – turned his back on the Arsenal player. Nacho Monreal wheels away to celebrate scoring Arsenal's first goal against United at Old Trafford . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain breezed through the United defence to provide an assist for the Monreal goal . You cannot do that. Roy Keane was in the studio but he must have been thinking he should be putting his boots back on. Even Roy, at 43,would have put up more resistance. Oxlade-Chamberlain does very well, driving forward and creating the opening (it was nice skill from Mesut Ozil in the build up too), but they cannot be allowed to do that. This fixture used to have Keane v Vieira, but these two midfields were packed with different players and nobody more bold than Santi Cazorla. Santi Cazorla (second right) was in inspirational form as Arsenal secured a place in the FA Cup semi-final . He doesn’t crash into tackles, but he has a different type of courage; courage on the ball. He’ll take it in tight areas, uses both feet and always likes to get the play moving. I could watch him all day. Arsenal were shot to pieces in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco and if it had been down to me, Per Mertesacker would never have played for them again after his display that night. But his performance at Old Trafford showed character and a welcome return to form. Per Mertesacker (left) and Francis Coquelin (right) were particularly impressive for Arsenal at Old Trafford . Francis Coquelin is another who stood out here. Luke Shaw will come through this, but he is playing like he has the handbrake on. Is he being overcoached? What has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for Southampton? He is only 19 and he will come again, but the player Manchester United signed for £30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch. He isn’t doing that now. It looks to me as if he’s thinking too much and that will be down to him trying to carry out instructions. Luke Shaw didn't enjoy his best night for United and has struggled to recapture his Southampton form . Marouane Fellaini's tireless work for United made him one of their standout players against Arsenal . He is going to be a star, but when you consider how Nathaniel Clyne is developing, why isn’t Shaw doing the same? He is a young man, who has had his injuries, but he is struggling and was taken off at half-time in a reshuffle that ultimately didn’t pay off. It is strange watching United and when their best player is Marouane Fellaini then it shows where they are. I’m not a Fellaini fan, but he is working hard and looks the player most likely to get them out of this hole. The irony is that he is a signing made by David Moyes .","Danny Welbeck struck Arsenal's FA Cup winner against Manchester United .

"WHAT MORE DOES WAYNE HAVE TO DO . When Louis van Gaal said he needed a 20-goal-a-season striker, I almost laughed. Manchester United have spent huge money and now he is saying Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie or Radamel Falcao can’t score 20 goals? Do me a favour. Rooney issued the perfect response on Saturday. I still don’t know why Van Gaal insists on playing him in midfield. In his career Rooney averages 18.8 goals a season. At United that figure is 20.6 goals. Still not good enough, Louis? Even if he only meant league goals, Rooney still ranks highly. Thierry Henry, one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history and my Sky colleague at Wembley on Sunday, only scored 20 league goals in a season five times. Wayne has done it twice. His Premier League average is 14.1 a season but Alan Shearer, the league’s leading goalscorer, averaged 18.6. Using Van Gaal’s maths, even Shearer couldn’t get into this United team… . Louis van Gaal's suggestion that he needs a 20-goal-a-season striker is laughable - he has Wayne Rooney . Rooney scores for Manchester United against Sunderland in their 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday . THE BACK FOUR LOVE TO SCORE . It was not a vintage final, but Chelsea’s back four held the key to victory at Wembley. Last time they played Tottenham they conceded five. On Sunday they didn’t give them a sniff. Not only that but they were a threat at every set piece — Spurs looked fragile whenever John Terry and Co. went up. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify Jose Mourinho’s style: win at all costs. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at Wembley . HAMMERS MUST AVOID FLAT FINISH . It was a surprise to see a Sam Allardyce team concede three set-piece goals. They are normally well organised, but I wonder if Big Sam’s contract situation is affecting the players. It’s the chairmen’s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer, but if the players aren’t sure the manager will be there, they might wonder why they should keep playing for him. Alex Song in particular was poor on Saturday and after a fine season for the club, it would be a pity if it tailed off. Sam Allardyce needs to turn West Ham's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season . Peter Crouch has now scored 46 Premier League headers, equalling Alan Shearer’s record in the competition. PETER PERFECT . When I played alongside Peter Crouch at Southampton, I was laughed at for saying he was good enough for England. Crouch has spent his career fighting people’s perceptions, but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities. He scored a fantastic header against Hull but, even at 6ft 7in, heading may not even be the best part of his game. He’s got a great touch, scored some fantastic goals — scissor kicks against Galatasaray, hat-tricks against Arsenal, volleys against Man City — and has enjoyed some memorable moments. Peter Crouch celebrates after scoring against Hull City during their Premier League clash . BRENDAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION . After that brilliant win over Man City, Liverpool are bang in the race for the top four. And here is a stat to prove it. In his three years in charge, Brendan Rodgers has lost just four league games after January 1. That is some record. Liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time. It helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to Champions League qualification this time round. They were excellent against City, with two world class goals, and they proved there is life after Steven Gerrard. With no Europa League football to distract them now, there’s no doubt Liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch Manchester United and Arsenal. Liverpool's players celebrate during their 2-1 win against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday . MURRAY'S MOMENT . Glenn Murray was key in Crystal Palace’s promotion to the Premier League but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013-14 with injury. He spent the first half of this season on loan but at Upton Park he looked every inch a top-flight striker. His movement was good, he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal, his second was top class. Yes, he tainted his day with a silly red card, but he looked like he was loving every minute. He deserves it. Glenn Murray rises above the West Ham defence to score during Crystal Palace's win at Upton Park . SWANS FLYING UNDER MONK . When Swansea sold Wilfried Bony I feared for them, but Garry Monk’s team have continued as if nothing has happened. Their win at Burnley was scrappy but it was another three points and the club is in its best ever position after 27 games. Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup might be more ‘glamorous’ names but, as our table shows, Monk is outperforming both. I like the way his team plays, I admire his honesty and if Swansea keep it up, he will be more than justified in asking for extra investment in the summer. Swansea City manager Garry Monk has coped exceptionally well with the departure of Wilfried Bony . VILLA ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF SOME VICTORIES . In the last 10 seasons, the average number of points needed to stay up has been 36. This season it could be even lower. Either way, Aston Villa face an uphill struggle. Tim Sherwood’s side are 14 points shy of that average with 11 games left. They’ll need at least three or four wins but when they have won just five all season, and with away games at Manchester United, Tottenham, Manchester City and Southampton to come, that’s easier said than done. I think they will survive but Sherwood has to make the numbers add up. P.S. It was great to see Jonas Gutierrez back at Newcastle after his battles with testicular cancer and he got a fantastic reception. It’s exactly what he deserved.

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with his latest  column for Sportsmail. The Barnet manager admires Jose Mourinho's courage in playing Kurt Zouma against Tottenham but takes aim at the sluggish strikers currently masquerading as Manchester United stars. MOURINHO'S GOT BALLS! Chelsea manager Mourinho threw Kurt Zouma in against Tottenham to shield the back four, to stifle and stop the opposition in the League Cup final. They were rewarded with a clean sheet. How many managers would have the confidence to play a centre-back in central midfield in a cup final at Wembley? In front of 90,000 fans and millions watching across the country - across the world. It must be said, Mourinho’s game management is second-to-none. It was no surprise that their goal in that game came from a set play and their second on the counter attack. Jose Mourinho's game management is second-to-none, particularly when it matters most . He soaks up the pressure, waits for the game to open up and frustrate the opposition. He knows within his ranks he has game winners who will score. The work ethic he has drawn from those technically brilliant players is astounding. His ranting and raving about the injustices from referees puts pressure on the officials into giving Chelsea better decisions. He is the master at it and keeps all the attention and focus off his player. But above all, he’s got balls. The Chelsea manager threw youngster Kurt Zouma in to protect the back four against Tottenham . SLIPPING AT THE TOP . The pressure, the anxiety, the expectancy, not rotating enough? What is it about the top teams slipping up at this point in the season? Getting close to the finishing line, you start looking over your shoulder. We all know running a race it’s better to chase a person in front than to be looking behind you. I don’t know the answers, I wish I did. In the Championship we’ve seen Bournemouth fall from the top, Wycombe Wanderers have done in League Two, my club Barnet have fallen behind in the Conference. Even Mourinho’s Chelsea had a blip, although they are managing it well. We see it right across all sports. We see it in golf in the Masters every Sunday night at Amen’s Corner. We see it when cricketers get into the 90s and are chasing a century. We see it in darts when the players start missing doubles. Over the next two months, the teams who come out on top will be the ones with the goal-scorers, who maintain their self belief throughout it all. Eddie Howe has seen his Bournemouth side slip away from the top of the Championship recently . UNITED’S SLUGGISH STRIKE FORCE . How slow is Radamel Falcao? And Robin Van Persie has lost half a yard of pace from his days at Arsenal. You can’t fault Falcao for his work ethic and atittude. He most definitely has that. But he lacks a yard or two of explosive speed. Manchester United have crept up on to the shoulders of the Champions League places, but there is far from enough pace and athletic ability in the group to make it into the top four. Radamel Falcao has failed to hit the ground running and appeared slow in a Manchester United shirt . Robin van Persie seems to have lost half-a-yard of pace under Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford . ONE PERSON I KEEP HEARING ABOUT... DARRELL CLARKE, BRISTOL ROVERS BOSS . Darrell Clarke has grafted through the lower levels where he had success. As a player he was at Mansfield Town, Hartlepool United and Salisbury City. He’s a young manager, only 37-years-old, who has done a magnificent job galvanising Rovers after relegation from League Two. It showed how much it meant to him when he was reduced to tears after they were relegated out of the Football League for the first time in the club’s history last season. They have kept thousands of very passionate supporters this season and he has guided them to the top of the Conference table. He is a manager to look out for in the future. Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke has grafted through the lower levels and enjoyed success . ONE THING I'D CHANGE ABOUT... GOLDEN EYE . I think there should be a referee in the stand, who has the opportunity to stop play and call back decisions in exceptional circumstances. An extra set of eyes on the pitch. It is something may be to look at for the future. On big decisions in penalty boxes and major incidents there should be a referee in the stand with access to video replays to review key decisions within games. Penalties, sending offs, balls over the line, the odd elbow here and there. If the are in contact with the referee they can give him a heads up. Things happen so quickly it’s often so difficult for the officials to make the right decision. Of course the game would just carry on as normal, but if there was something missed or that the referee or the linesmen got wrong then the man in the middle can get help from Golden Eye in the stands. Something sooner or later has got to be done to help these referees who are now getting criticised left, right and centre every week by managers across the board. Roger East (sending off Sunderland's Wes Brown) would've benefited from an extra official at Old Trafford . THE BIG ISSUE... MANCHESTER CITY'S SQUAD . I must say I do like Mr Pellegrini. He is cool, he is calm and he managed to put out a lot of fires that were raging in that Manchester City dressing room after taking over from Roberto Mancini. It does make me smile when so many so-called experts totally annihilate his tactics, most of whom have never even managed at any level. Criticising him for playing two up front and getting out-numbered and out-played in midfield. Last year, he won the Premier League. So is he really, seriously tactically inept? He would have his reasons for what is going on there, but clearly it is not working. Manuel Pellegrini has struggled in the defence of his Premier League crown with Manchester City . Captain Vincent Kompany hasn't been able to continue his sterling form at the back for City . However, it it not always just about the tactics of the manager. There is clearly something missing in the DNA of the City squad. They look lacklustre and without real fire in their belly. And when you’re dropping your captain, your talisman, it is yet another big, brave decision from the man I always regard with the utmost respect. It looks to me like he needs to move a few on, to move City forward up to the next level.","Kurt Zouma's switch to in front of the back four was a masterstroke .

"I can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see Kell Brook the day after that horrific knife attack in Tenerife. As soon as I walked in I looked into his eyes and I knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over? The wound was horrific, some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together. I couldn’t believe it, only weeks before we had been celebrating the biggest moment of his career when he dethroned welterweight sensation Shawn Porter in his back yard to capture the IBF welterweight title. Suddenly we are sitting there waiting to find out if he would ever be able to enter a ring again. The doctor’s analysis wasn’t great - she said with the right rehab there was a decent chance he could fight again but he would not be able to perform in the same way in and out of the ring. She couldn’t have been more wrong. Kell Brook performs at a media workout ahead of the first defence of his world title against Jo Jo Dan . Brook at home shortly after he was stabbed (left) and showing his scar (right) on the week of his fight . Over the last few months Kell Brook has shown the heart of a lion. No one really gets to see the struggle he went through - dressing the wound, struggling to walk at first, the endless hours of rehab and massage and this is all before the camp got underway. What we have now, just days away from the first defence of his IBF welterweight title is an elite level fighter, someone who I believe can go on and unify the 147lb division and someone who is in devastating form, ready to make a statement to the world in front of his home fans. Saturday in Sheffield is going to be an emotional night. No one has taken Jo Jo Dan for granted - he has earned the right to challenge Kell as the No 1 and mandatory challenger - a position Kell was in not so long ago. He is confident and full of hope to become world champion but he has a wounded lion in front of him who is ready to bite. It will be an awkward fight. Jo Jo is a southpaw who comes on strong late in fights. Another challenge for Kell will be handling the emotions of the situation in front of 10,000 people. But I believe in Kell. I think he has to impose himself early and I suspect he’ll produce a devastating performance with a stoppage somewhere in the middle rounds. We’ll see. Dan has earned his shot at Brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his IBF world title . There are some huge plans ahead for Kell Brook but for now it’s all about Saturday. Live on Sky Sports and live on Showtime in the US - finally he gets his chance to get his big homecoming. It’s going to be some night. Fight fans can tune into a packed bill from 7.30pm - Frankie Gavin makes his Matchroom debut against Bogdan Mitic ahead of his massive fight with Chris Van Heerden on May 9 in Birmingham and Gavin McDonnell continues his fairlytale career battling Ukraine’s Alexander Yegorov for the vacant European title. Big-punching Sheffield middleweight Adam Etches could be in a fight of the year contender with Sergei Khomitsky, who dismantled London super-middleweight Frank Buglioni in his last visit to the UK. Kal Yafai, Charlie Edwards and Stephen Smith are also in action. Adam Etches (above) takes on Sergei Khomitsky in what promises to be an intriguing fight in Sheffield . Last week we announced a huge show for May 30 at the O2 in London. After his destruction of Daniel Estrada at the same venue earlier this Year, Kevin Mitchell will go toe to toe with three-weight world champion Jorge Linares. That fight, for the Venezuelan’s WBC world lightweight title, is going to be an absolute cracker. It is a real 50-50 fight. It is going to be a huge night of boxing in the capital, a year after that massive occasion at Wembley. The Welsh Mayweather, Lee Selby, is fighting Evgeny Gradovich for the IBF featherweight title and that is another fight that could go either way. Lee is so talented. Kevin Mitchell (left) will challenge for Jorge Linares' world title when he takes on the WBC champion in May . Anthony Joshua is on the bill against Kevin Johnson, a loud American with some real talent. People ask me about AJ and how he is recovering after the stress fracture in his back. I watched him sparring in a three-hour session last week and he is looking devastating. I left that day feeling more convinced than ever that this guy is going to be the world heavyweight champion. He will fight first on April 4 in Newcastle and I will make an announcement on his opponent in the coming days. I will meet Barry McGuigan and Carl Frampton’s team in London today as we work towards making the fight everyone wants to see between Carl and Scott Quigg. Two world champions from Britain in the same division – they simply have to fight. I have submitted my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side. I feel we need to make progress now. The hope is for a summer fight, possibly on June 20. But all dates, venues and purse splits can’t be decided until we know where we are going with the broadcaster. I think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon, probably the next two or three weeks, if we are to get this fight on in the summer. It really is the fight people want to see. Carl Frampton (left) and Scott Quigg look set to unify their super-bantamweight world titles this summer . I should know in the next 24 hours what date James DeGale will fight Andre Dirrell for the IBF super-middleweight world title vacated by Carl Froch. Contrary to rumours stateside, it will most likely be in mid to late May on the US east coast.","People haven't seen how much Kell Brook has had to suffer .

"This saga’s gone on longer than The Mousetrap. And let’s be honest — it’s not been handled brilliantly by the ECB. But you can hardly blame Kevin Pietersen for wanting to throw his lot in with Surrey and score some first-class runs. His interpretation of what Colin Graves said about playing in the domestic game has given him a lifeline. Now it’s up to Pietersen to use it. Kevin Pietersen has agreed to rejoin Surrey as he looks to make an unlikely England comeback . With Graves and Tom Harrison coming in as ECB chairman and chief executive respectively, it’s reasonable to work on the basis that everyone starts with a clean slate. They could well be leaning on Paul Downton, the managing director, with this basic point: the best players get picked. That’s how it works in other sports, so why not in cricket? Pietersen will have a great chance to excel in Division Two at an excellent club. He’s also fit enough, even in his mid-30s. He leads a good lifestyle and he’ll be desperate to bang the door down. It’s all set up for him. The 35-year-old will focus on the longer form of the game in a bid to force his way into Ashes reckoning . Pietersen still wants to add to his 23 Test centuries despite being axed by England last year . People are worried about his book, but the main targets in those pages — Andy Flower and Matt Prior — are no longer in the England set-up. I thought the book was a sad read, to learn that he wasn’t enjoying what should have been among the best moments of his life. That’s a real shame. But if Pietersen scores so many runs for Surrey that Graves and Harrison think he’s irresistible, then everyone will just have to sit down and talk things through. Yes, it would become tricky for Downton and Peter Moores, who Pietersen didn’t rate highly in his first stint as England coach. But I’d put the key players in this drama in one room and tell them not to reappear until they’ve bashed out a compromise. Treat it like a jury: don’t emerge until you’ve got a majority decision. The batsman, pictured playing in Australia's Big Bash, may change his Indian Premier League contract . Peter Moores didn't see eye to eye with Pietersen during his first spell as England head coach . Pietersen is the best batsman I’ve seen for England and if he can get his mojo back playing for Surrey then at least he’ll have fulfilled the criterion that Graves laid down. Test cricket is what gets Pietersen’s juices flowing. It’s unrealistic to imagine he could still be around for the 2019 World Cup. But he’s found himself a county and now he’s got to get some runs. It’s going to be a very interesting summer. England fell to an embarrassing early exit from the World Cup after a defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide .","Kevin Pietersen agrees to return to county cricket with Surrey .
The 35-year-old is hopeful of forcing his way into Ashes reckoning .
He is fit enough even at 35 years old and will want to bang the door down .

"I just cannot understand why Ian Ritchie has made such a statement. The first thing that surprises me is the timing, following one of the most exciting days ever in Five and Six Nations history. England’s victory over France was brilliant to watch, even if they did fall just short of winning the title. Twickenham was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home World Cup. I’m in Switzerland at present and on the flight the pilot, air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about Saturday and their real optimism for the World Cup. So for Ritchie to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood. It doesn’t seem right and is a massive own goal. Stuart Lancaster (second left) consoles his players  after falling six points short of a Six Nations title . England captain Chris Robshaw (left) and his team-mates came second for the fourth year in succession . Ben Youngs celebrate his try during England's storming 55-35 Six Nations victory against France . More importantly, his words undermine Stuart Lancaster. I would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that Lancaster and the team have achieved. If this had happened to me, I would be in Ritchie’s office demanding an explanation. This is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position. The moment someone says something, the opposition see a chink, a weakness, and try to drive a wedge through it. It’s one thing to say these things in private, as professional sport is about winning, but to say them in public is wrong. If Lancaster has called the result unacceptable, fair enough, but Ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team’s performance. This year is all about preparing for the World Cup and England put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style. The atmosphere at Twickenham for England's final Six Nations match was electric from start to finish . This was the time for a pat on the back and a united front. Ian Ritchie appointed Stuart Lancaster after an interim period, which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches. He appointed an inexperienced coach in Lancaster yet later awarded him a six-year contract. If the priority was short-term gains, he should have been given a one-year contract. Coming in with no international coaching experience, Lancaster has done a very good job. Wales and Ireland are very strong teams too so to think you can just win Grand Slams and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the English are arrogant. Ian Ritchie (right) should be backing Lancaster ahead of the eagerly-anticipated World Cup in September . I’m sure Ritchie had good intentions, perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. But he will regret what he said as England are in a very good position. If England are going to win the World Cup, they have to have everybody together as one team, everybody’s noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys. We should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against France and looking forward to the World Cup. It’s all positive.","Ian Ritchie's words have undermined England coach Stuart Lancaster .

"ENGLAND VERDICT . In one sense disappointment because that was the fourth straight year England have finished runners-up. Professional sport is about winning; sport’s oldest adage is ‘nobody remembers who came second’. On the other hand, England are growing and improving and I am very positive and excited about this team. They have discovered a creative, attacking game that can put any team in the world under pressure if they have the courage to use it. If they work massively on their defence, ensure the full might and power of England’s front five can be brought into every game and become far more clinical in their decision-making at key moments they can achieve great things. And Twickenham was rocking again on Saturday, the first time in ages we really did have 80,000 people on their feet screaming. England are going to be incredibly tough to beat at Twickenham this autumn and that’s a good place to be in a World Cup. England's players form a huddle after narrowly missing out on the Six Nations title to Ireland on Saturday . Head coach Stuart Lancaster walks down the tunnel after watching his country's 55-35 victory against France . WHAT DID STUART LANCASTER GET RIGHT AND WRONG? 15. Mike Brown 14. Anthony Watson 13. Jonathan Joseph 12. Henry Slade 11. Jack Nowell 10. George Ford 9. Ben Youngs 1. Alex Corbisiero 2. Dylan Hartley 3. Dan Cole 4. Courtney Lawes 5. Joe Launchbury 6. James Haskell 8. Billy Vunipola 7. Chris Robshaw . Bench: Marler, T Youngs, Wilson, Parling, Wood, Care, Farrell, Tuilagi . RIGHT: He has nailed down the first-choice half-back combination — George Ford and Ben Youngs — and that is huge. Ford has been impressive from the start and Youngs has finished the tournament like a train. The coach has also given Jonathan Joseph his head at 13 and England have a real cutting edge at outside centre, supported by two fast-developing wings. Jack Nowell has impressed in all sorts of ways and Anthony Watson has pace and class, although he needs to find ways of getting more involved. The first-choice England backs, with the exception of 12, pick themselves now and have a tournament together under their belt. Billy Vunipola is now an 80-minute player — he didn’t miss a minute of the five games. That’s a big step forward and down to hard work and dedication. George Ford (pictured), alongside Ben Youngs, have formed a first-choice half-back combination . WRONG: Lancaster missed a golden opportunity to check on Danny Cipriani’s form by starting him against Scotland, when I would also have tried Henry Slade at 12. Ford could get injured, so Cipriani needs to be fully integrated and Slade could be the answer in a problem position. England have also missed out by not getting Steffon Armitage involved because there are occasions when the back row has looked unbalanced and one-paced. It is too late now and that idea, alas, has to be binned totally. I am still puzzled by some of the substitutions. No Cipriani against Ireland, then he was brought on at full back on Saturday when it cried out for him to play at inside centre. Also, why bring on Richard Wigglesworth, who is just not an impact player, for Youngs with 10 minutes left against France? Youngs was enjoying the game of his life and when the adrenaline is pumping you can achieve remarkable things. It was his day and he wasn’t finished. Lancaster missed an opportunity to start Danny Cipriani (centre) against Scotland during the Six Nations . HOW CAN ENGLAND IMPROVE THEIR DEFENCE? England conceded 11 tries in the tournament and though I would discount the France game as an extraordinary one-off, they still coughed up sloppy scores in other games. At this level it is about two things on top of great technique. Firstly, you have to throw a mental switch from attacking to defending. You must instantly go into a different mindset. That defensive mindset was just not there on Saturday and cost England the championship. Secondly, you need to communicate all the time from 1-15 — keep talking, pointing and tackling. If Twickenham is going to become a fortress again it starts and finishes with defence — 11 tries is six too many for a team which has the firepower to trouble any side. Ben Youngs goes over the line to give England an early lead in their must-win Six Nations clash against France . Leicester Tigers star Youngs jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on Saturday evening . PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT . My England player of the tournament is George Ford, who has quickly proved himself a real gem. He is the man who has started bringing out the full potential of a talented and dangerous England back division. My player of the tournament, though, is Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien, who is a force of nature when fully fit. He set the tone for Ireland in their important win over England and his display against the Scots on Saturday was the most impactful individual performance of the tournament. Ford (centre) is my England player of the tournament - he has proved himself as a real talent . ARE IRELAND WORTHY CHAMPIONS? Yes, totally. They have the best coach in Joe Schmidt and the outstanding captain and leader in Paul O’Connell. Ireland have seamlessly brought in young players, notably Jared Payne and Robbie Henshaw, who have replaced Brian O’Driscoll and Gordon D’Arcy. Schmidt varies his game plans and selections cleverly and rarely misses a trick. They outplayed and out-thought England in Dublin and their more expansive — but ruthless — game plan at Murrayfield was delivered perfectly. Ireland are rock solid, they are only going to get better and will not fall off the cliff like they did in the 2007 World Cup in France. The Irish will be a big factor at RWC2015. Ireland have the best coach in Joe Schmidt and Paul O'Connell (right) is an outstanding captain and leader . WALES VERDICT . They look very dangerous and threatening and are building their year nicely. Warren Gatland is another excellent coach — for some reason he never gets the full credit he is due — and he will have Wales perfectly fine-tuned by September. Their incredible defence against Ireland impressed me most of all and they have dangerous backs all over the park. My one concern would be their front row, with injuries and the retirement of Adam Jones. Even in that huge win in Rome, Italy pushed them about a bit at scrum-time. They can’t afford that to happen at the World Cup but Gatland has been there and has the T-shirt, and Wales really need to get behind him now. Warren Gatland never gets the full credit he deserves and he will have Wales fine-tuned by September . CHAMPAGNE MOMENT . In fact it was a eureka moment! It was when Ford took that quick line-out throw on England’s own line in the first half on Saturday and started a brilliant counter-attack that ended with Youngs going in under the posts. That was this England team at their best and most dangerous and they need to be fearless and reproduce that in the very biggest games. Will they do it in the first minute against a world-class team in the World Cup? That’s still the big question. George Ford slides in to score England's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half against France . AND FINALLY THE FRENCH! I don’t buy for one minute this idea that the T14 is diluting their talent. They still have an incredible pool of players and any top coach would love the prospect of having the French national team. They just need to stop looking for excuses and start to leverage their amazing talent. Yes, they have been a bit of a shambles at times in this tournament but, incredibly for a team who shipped 55 points, there were one or two hints at a brighter future on Saturday. And I would say this: France turn up at World Cups. They have reached three finals and there will always be an anxiety about playing them in the knockout stages. France still have an incredible pool and players and they need to stop looking for excuses .","England are growing and improving - the future is certainly exciting .
Stuart Lancaster has done well to nail down a half-back combination .
George Ford and Ben Youngs have been very impressive for England .
Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien is my player of the Six Nations tournament ."
"England will kick off Saturday's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the Six Nations and take huge momentum into the World Cup. They had a similar chance a year ago — although they didn’t play last — but blew it badly in Rome. The common language of coaches in this position is ‘let’s win the game first,’ but that is nonsense. This is not about beating France, it is about winning the title. They need a clear game plan to maximise points difference. Nobody remembers who comes second. Chris Robshaw's England will know exactly what they have to do to win the Six Nations when they kick off . Luther Burrell breaks with the ball during the England captain's run at Twickenham . It is tempting to think England must throw caution to the wind and play a wild, attacking game. But if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck. This is not a bad French team — in fact I have never really seen a bad French team as they do have so much talent available. They don’t look comfortable on or off the field but the French have a habit of performing under pressure and they’re capable of beating England. Throughout this week, I would have gone through match scenarios with my captain, the scrum-halves and the fly-halves, discussing what decision we’d make depending on how many points we need in the match. That would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message. England's players gather as head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on during the captain's run . Jonathan Joseph passes the ball during the England captain's run ahead of the game with France . Lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title . If England need a big score, Chris Robshaw and the half-backs will face big decisions from the first minute. I hope Stuart Lancaster has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings. As soon as the early games finish, the results should be up on the changing-room wall. The amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big, bold type. This is the day for real detail and no surprises, and finding out which players can really perform under pressure. England should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in, especially after the hiding they received in Dublin. With the games falling as they do, I wouldn’t set out any directives for the team about watching them or not — it should be every individual’s decision. Personally, I would like to watch as much as possible; if nothing else, it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes. Some of the players may want to watch the Wales v Italy game while others won’t. They’ll be warming up while the Scotland v Ireland game is being played so there’s no question of them watching that, but I’d let the players know I would be putting the score from the Ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what’s required of them. That can be broken down into six very clear areas. 1 Build the score . It sounds easy, but it’s critical. France are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to Twickenham. The best way to create pressure is to lead throughout. So England must try to ensure they take the lead early and force France to chase the game. They must take every penalty that is offered — if the referee, say, gives an advantage, decline it and take the points. Take three points from drop-goal opportunities — never leave their 22 without points. Joseph scores England's first try against Scotland and they must build a score against France . This game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes, even if you don’t score tries until later in the game. If opportunities arise, we must take them, something we failed to do against Scotland. 2 Maintain discipline . England must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half. The contact area and scrum will be key and England cannot afford to gift France easy points. Scrum-half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens and England must not allow France to have the ball at the breakdown. Yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster, and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game. Scrum half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens . 3 Keep the ball in play . The speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical. I want to see quick, pre-called line-outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it. If the line-out isn’t secure, there’s nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty. Keep the tempo up because this massive French side will not want to be moved around. George Ford passes the ball and England must keep the ball in play as much as possible . Also, to score maximum points, you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time. Every time the ball’s out of play, it is not only time but points ticking away. England must also employ an exciting restart policy. Every kick-off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back. We need variety so we can kick left, right or down the middle but we must get it back. 4 Kick well, chase hard . This is a huge test of England’s tactical kicking game, which I’m not sure is as good as it needs to be yet. In the 2003 World Cup semi-final, I picked Mike Catt at No 12 ahead of Mike Tindall because he had a superior kicking game. France will believe they can get at George Ford so Mike Brown needs to support his kicking game. Mike Brown needs to support Ford's kicking game and limit the up-and-unders . I’d limit the up-and-unders and box kicks, too, as they are too much of a lottery. Ford, Youngs and Brown need to look deep and hit the green stuff. Field position gave Jonny Wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as England won that semi 24-7 against a French team who were favourites to beat us. 5 Half-Time . The message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes. You can’t change what’s happened in the first half but you can learn. They’ll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be. The bench can then be used to identify areas of French weakness and attack them. England must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes . Understand, France are currently the best defensive team in the tournament, having only conceded two tries. Patience will be a key word, but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace. 6 Keep your best men on . Matches are won in the last 30 minutes, not the first 30, and I’d always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game. The key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team. I still believe Danny Cipriani can be a trump card. Will Lancaster dare opt for a Ford-Cipriani-Joseph combination if the game calls for it? You can score two tries in the last five minutes; it only takes 20 seconds to score. Danny Cipriani can be England's trump card coming off the bench . I’d expect England to win — then it becomes about by how much. I just feel this French side is better than everyone is giving them credit for, and I’m very surprised Lancaster has not picked a specialist second-row on the bench. It’s a massive gamble as Courtney Lawes and Geoff Parling have a history of injuries, potentially leaving Nick Easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row. This is a hugely exciting day of rugby. People have questioned the staggered kick-off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home. It is a massive day for Lancaster and his team. They need this championship more than the others. They can’t afford another bad day at the office.","England play France in the final game of the Six Nations and will know exactly what they have to do to win the tournament .

"Ahead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title... ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I’m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster’s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven’t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It’s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there’s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster’s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 — and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity — but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi’s absence hasn’t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach’s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster — compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone’s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O’Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe’s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don’t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O’Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach’s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent’s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He’s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach’s strengths? Warren Gatland’s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him — the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I’d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.","George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline .

"It’s nearly time for Kell Brook to make an emotional walk to the ring and fight Jo Jo Dan on March 28. He has the world at his feet again and I’m looking at fights against the likes of Juan Manuel Marquez, Brandon Rios and Keith Thurman in the summer and then the winner of Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather. But it was so nearly game over for Kell. I remember being sat next to his bed in the hospital in Tenerife and I didn’t know if he would fight again. I think it’s hard for you or I to imagine to what he has been through since that horrific knife attack. But this guy is special. Dan is going to face a fighter in Sheffield who has only thought about fighting for the past six months. It has been hard on Kell – he won a world title and what was supposed to be his moment has been spent recovering from that attack. It’s been a nightmare. Kell Brook with his world title in September as he began his recovery from being stabbed in the leg . The challenge – and it is a big challenge – will be handling himself in the right manner on the night. Everyone wants to see how he comes back physically from what happened. But how will he cope with the emotions? He will be in his own city, defending his title after all that frustration and pain. There is a lot that can go wrong in those circumstances. But Kell is different to normal people. The night he won his world title against Shawn Porter in California, the stakes were so high. He was fighting in Porter’s backyard after having so many title shots postponed because of injury. A normal person could easily have been swallowed up by that pressure – the rest of us were properly nervous. I was there in his dressing room looking at him for a sign of how he was feeling. My dad walked over to Kell just before he put his gloves, grabbed his arm and said to him: ‘This is your time, don’t let this moment pass.' I went outside the dressing room and my dad was smiling. He said to me: ‘That boy is barely breathing. He is about to fight for the world title in America and his pulse is so low.’ The Sheffield fighter lands a punch on Shawn Porter on his way to becoming world champion in August 2014 . I am telling you, this guy has ice in his veins. Nothing fazes him. He has been stabbed in the leg and could have died. Now, a few months on he is fighting to retain his world title. People will doubt him but I won’t. That is why I will make the biggest fights possible for him if he comes through this next challenge against Dan. I have already made contact with Marquez’s people and also Rios’s representatives. Marquez is a legend and that would be a huge fight and Rios has been a world champion. Thurman is also keen and a quality fighter. Any one of those guys in Sheffield in June would be a very big fight. After that, I would love to see Kell fight Pacquiao or Mayweather. Anyone would. After those two fight on May 2, the winner and Kell will be the only world champions in the welterweight division. It would be a great unification match. Of course, the fight the whole country wants to see is Kell versus Amir Khan. Khan’s team told us the fight would happen one day but why not on June 13 at Wembley? We can’t wait forever for them. All Kell can do is take care of his own business later this month. It’s a challenge but he always comes through. Brook is putting together his final training preparations before fighting Jo Jo Dan later this month . Another fight everyone is desperate to see is Carl Frampton versus Scott Quigg. Talks are underway between me and Barry McGuigan’s Cyclone Promotions, who look after Frampton. Scott is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on – we just want to make this fight. Of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money. They will talk with their broadcaster and see what’s on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible. After that, we can push negotiations on. I’m not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - I would be happy for a 60-40 purse split in favour of the winner. If you really fancy it I can’t see a problem with that. Let’s see. We can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight – and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially. If we can all reach an agreement, then I would love to make this fight in June. We’d be happy to fight in Belfast if the numbers were right, but likewise Manchester would be brilliant and so would the O2 Arena in London. There is a long way to go but who wouldn’t want to see this fight? Scott Quigg (right) joins Carl Frampton in the ring after he beat Chris Avalos in Belfast last month . I was disappointed to lose the purse bids for James DeGale-Andre Dirrell after some long negotiations with Dirrell’s team. We backed our man to a tune of $2.1m but they put in a huge bid of $3.1m. I’m confident James DeGale gets the victory regardless of the location and make history in the process. I am hearing rumours that the fight will be on April 24 in Chicago but we back James to get the win. Tony Bellew is back in the UK after his foray into Hollywood. Don’t ask me how he came to be involved in the Creed film, but what a great opportunity for him. We will be talking in the coming days about his options, but rest assured after beating Nathan Cleverly last time out, he will be in a world title fight next time. We are looking at all four of the cruiserweight world champions. Marco Huck, the WBO champion, is keen and appeals to us as well. But we would fight any of Denis Lebedev (WBA champion), Grigory Drozd (WBC) or Yoan Pablo Hernandez (IBF). All are quality fighters and I have had good feedback on all options so watch this space. We are heading for a brilliant battle of Hull lightweights this summer. Golden boy Luke Campbell was brilliant again in beating Levis Morales in Hull at the weekend and Tommy Coyle survived a huge scare against Martin Gethin on the same card. He was knocked down but got up and perforated Gethin’s ear drum to win. They are both huge draws in the city and now I am going to make the fight between them for this summer. They are a great mix. Coyle’s family is known all over Hull – they have a fruit and veg stall in the middle of the city and Tommy is full of beans. Luke is already an MBE, the boy with an Olympic gold medal. Tommy Coyle celebrates his win over Martin Gethin at The Hull Arena on March 7 . Above all else, they are tremendous fighters. It will really divide the city. I am looking at the KC Stadium and Craven Park, probably for a date in mid-July. Many people would have Campbell as favourite but how can anyone underestimate Tommy Coyle? This will be a huge night. I would like to say here how relieved I was to hear that Charlie Payton is OK after being taken to hospital following his defeat against Bobby Jenkinson in Hull at the weekend. He looked in a bad way but has been given the all-clear, thankfully. It reminds you how tough this sport is and, for me, it reinforces that above all else these guys ought to get the paydays they deserve. People say that fighters should ignore the money and just get fights made – it is easy to say when you are not the one putting your health on the line for your living. Fight for titles and fight for glory, of course, but let’s remember what these athletes put themselves through in the process.","It's time to judge what Kell Brook is made of when he makes his comeback from being stabbed .

"Martin Atkinson performed well in varying circumstances in this intriguing battle; there was not so much to do in the first half but the opposite in the second period. He used his experience and common sense whenever he could to ensure that his was a positive influence on the game and did well not to let the emotion of the crowd influence his decision making. The biggest call of the game was the clearest – once it became clear that both Atkinson and his assistant had seen Steven Gerrard’s stamp on Ander Herrera there could only be one outcome. Steven Gerrard can't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on United's Ander Herrera at Anfield . Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . Gerrard accepted the decision to send him off after he had only been on the field for just over 30 seconds in a post-match interview. Atkinson did not let Herrera escape as he cautioned him for the late challenge which provoked Gerrard’s retaliation. Atkinson was always going to come under pressure from Liverpool players and fans to ‘level things up’ and there were opportunities to do that the most notable 10 minutes later when Phil Jones mistimed a strong challenge on Jordan Henderson. The incident was merely a poorly timed tackle and I thought that a yellow card was appropriate but Jones could just have easily seen red. Late in the game Liverpool fans screamed for Wayne Rooney to be sanctioned when he caught Simon Mignolet but he had been blocked off by Martin Skrtel and that caused the collision. Liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when Skrtel followed through on David De Gea but Atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win. GIUSEPPE LORENZO 1990 At 10 seconds, believed to be the fastest red card in professional football. The Bologna man was sent off for hitting an opponent.

"Standing in the middle of a pitch with a crowd of around 40,000 questioning your fitness and ability to get decisions right is a real test of mental strength. Having a group of athletic, testosterone-fuelled players surrounding you, trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them, is almost too much to bear. And I am incredulous that Gary Neville and John Terry seem to think this harassment of referees is now somehow acceptable. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . In November 2006 I reported Chelsea and their players for attempting to intimidate me during a game at Tottenham. I asked the FA to study a specific incident, which was clear on video, when I felt intimidated and pressurised to give a decision. The FA reviewed the footage and said as I did not look frightened or intimidated, they would not be taking the case any further.

This is not a case of Chelsea- bashing, although it was their players again who demonstrated that apparently anything is acceptable now in the pursuit of winning a football match. Ganging up on referees is happening more and more and unless something is done to reverse the trend, it will get worse. We have former England captain Terry saying that hounding a referee is OK because everyone does it. On Wednesday night I am sure that Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers was influenced after being harassed by Chelsea’s outfield players. There was nothing in his body language to suggest he was about to reach for his red card and send off Paris Saint-Germain’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic until all that pressure was brought to bear. Chelsea's players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (second right) Some observers will suggest that referees could just brandish cards at players who apply too much pressure. However, players know that there is no credibility in showing multiple yellow cards at such incidents. Instead, the time has come to rule that only the captains should be allowed to approach the referee.","Chelsea players swarmed referee Bjorn Kuipers to influence a red card for PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic during their Champions League exit .

"That was a big wake-up call for England but I wouldn’t panic or over-react to a defeat against a very good Ireland team in Dublin. They won’t be the first or last England team to experience that. I would largely stick with this England group and trust that they will learn — and learn quickly — from such a painful defeat. And make no mistake, this will hurt because England went into the game with high hopes. I predicted England would win by five points based on two simple points, England would dominate at the scrums and England’s discipline would keep the penalty count to single figures — neither remotely happened and the scoreline flattered England in the end. It’s not a setback on the scale of Cardiff two years ago, nowhere near. England were competitive against what I believe is an Ireland team capable of winning a World Cup but there were some major disappointments and areas which quickly need working on. Former England coach Sir Clive Woodward would have brought on Danny Cipriani in place of Luther Burrell . England's players look dejected after they conceded the only try of the match against Ireland . The discipline was very poor, especially in the first half when they gave eight of their 13 penalties away and went down the tunnel 9-3 down. In fact, it should have been 12-3 because Jonny Sexton missed a penalty he would usually have popped over. I’ve said it countless times before but nine is the absolute maximum number of penalties a Test side should be conceding, preferably less. You are always going to be under pressure in Dublin but England compounded that massively yesterday. It revealed that under intense pressure the mental strength is still missing at crucial times. The decision-making was flawed in a number of key areas. When England were 6-3 down midway through the first half Chris Robshaw opted for the corner when England had won a very kickable penalty. OK, the ref might have indicated that he was thinking about a yellow if Ireland offended again but that was still a huge call when you are playing away to Ireland early in such a big game. You take the points on offer, surely? It was also important to get George Ford ticking over as a goal-kicker. He had landed a nice dropped goal — and it was great to see that back on the menu — but it would have been good for his confidence to slot over a relatively simple penalty shot. If you do go for the bold option, and I accept that very occasionally it can be an inspired call, you must execute. Robbie Henshaw (centre) is congratulated by his Ireland team-mate Jared Payne after scoring his try . That was a very high-risk throw England called to the back of the line-out, where Devin Toner was guarding against just that possibility. England duly got turned over. It felt hugely important at the time and it nagged away at me throughout the game, it was a real momentum changer. These decisions, by the way, are not just a matter of experience, it is more a case of being properly organised and knowing exactly what you want to achieve. Again, in terms of decision- making, England got it wrong with their use of the bench. Tom Croft and Nick Easter made a decent impact but I would certainly have brought Danny Cipriani on after an hour in place of Luther Burrell. If you are chasing a game, Cipriani is your trump card. If you need two tries in the last 15 minutes the priority is to get your creative players on and also leave the ‘gas’ players like Jonathan Joseph on. You have about only a 20 per cent chance of pulling the game out of the fire anyway, so defence is not your priority. Johnny Sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for Ireland's win . Instead at that crucial stage we had Burrell, who wasn’t enjoying one of his best games, and Billy Twelvetrees at centre, which is the England midfield line-up Ireland would have felt most at home defending against. England were not asking enough questions when they finally started to get on top territorially. Another thing which England must continue to work on is their kicking game and exit strategies, which were again very much second best to Ireland’s. I have spoken before about this. My preference is for a footballing 12, but if that is not the way England are going they need to ask their full back to step in as an extra 10 more often. Alex Goode had a very decent, busy game at full back, he was one of England’s best players, but at times he needed to step in and provide an extra kicking option. Sexton (right) of Ireland tackles George Ford (left) during the Six Nations game at the Aviva Stadium . Elsewhere, the Ireland half-backs, who are truly world class, were at their best and exerted much more influence than their England counterparts. George Ford is developing and learning but yesterday was one of those games when I wondered again if it shouldn’t be Cipriani starting and Ford contributing from the bench. The England scrum was disappointing. I was convinced they would dominate the set-piece but actually Ireland did a fantastic job and you have to give praise to them and especially the veteran Mike Ross who was being written off by some a while back. I’m hoping that’s a one-off because the England scrum has been outstanding prior to this. With a little more than six months to the World Cup, England have a stack of work to do. There will be no Grand Slam this year and possibly no Championship so, for me, the final two Six Nations games are all about the World Cup now and England need to make those games against Scotland and France count.

"The behaviour of Chelsea’s players as they surrounded Bjorn Kuipers was nothing short of disgraceful, but it’s a sign of the way the modern game is going. Blue shirts swarmed around the Dutch referee and the pressure put on him by Jose Mourinho’s men certainly played a part in the harsh dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his challenge on Oscar, after replays suggested the PSG man pulled out. Chelsea are not the only team to harrass officials on a regular basis and it’s time we introduced a rule to put an end to it.

"Sir Clive Woodward, World Cup winning coach, gives his views on the good points and bad points of England's 25-13 win over Scotland in the RBS 6 Nations at Twickenham. The 12-point win means Stuart Lancaster’s side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely Championship title if they can see off France more convincingly than Ireland beat Scotland or Wales beat Italy. But the display was strewn with errors and England delivered less than they should have done, although there were positive signs. England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup after England beat Scotland, but it was a mixed bag . WHAT I LIKED . THE CREATIVE SPARK . I am enjoying England’s creativity and their ability to fashion try-scoring opportunities, even if they must be more clinical in accepting them. Their first try summed up what is best about this England side. George Ford is a sublime late passer of the ball and when he works in conjunction with a talent such as Jonathan Joseph, who has quick feet, pace and strength, it can prove lethal. The caveat is that Scotland were poor and most top international defences are akin to that which England encountered in Dublin, the only Six Nations game this season when the England backs have been blunted. George Ford is a sublime late passer of the ball and clearly has the composure for Test matches . Jonathan Joseph has such quick feet and that is an attribute that can be lethal when linked with Ford . SETTLED AT THE BACK . Ford and Ben Youngs are now established as starters and an established half-back pairing is a boon to any side. Equally, I believe the back three of Mike Brown, Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson are probably the preferred trio going forward and Joseph is a must at outside centre with the cutting edge he now brings — four tries in four Six Nations games this season. A settled side will allow those chances to be created but, more importantly, finished off. Ben Youngs (right) is part of an established half-back pairing with Ford and that is a boon to any side . LAWES THE HITMAN . Northampton lock Courtney Lawes is one of the key men for England, with an athleticism that matches anything in the southern hemisphere. He is capable of big plays and hits beyond the ability of others in the pack. He will go up another gear against France on Saturday. Add Joe Launchbury to the mix and England have arguably the best second-row pairing in world rugby. Courtney Lawes is a key man for England and his athleticism matches anything in the southern hemisphere . SNIFF OF A TROPHY . The southern hemisphere teams, and indeed Ireland and Wales, won’t be particularly bothered whether England win the title or not — only Grand Slams impress the rugby world at large — but England winning the title could be important. They have won nothing under Stuart Lancaster —England have won only one title since 2003 — so to chalk up a Championship would be a useful stepping stone and receiving the trophy at Twickenham would help set up the year ahead. That defeat in Dublin would be my abiding memory of this Championship, though. England have won nothing under Stuart Lancaster so a Championship would be a useful stepping stone . PLENTY IN RESERVE . I have studiously avoided mentioning England’s injured players in this tournament because if they are unavailable they simply don’t come into the equation, but moving into the World Cup forwards Alex Corbisiero, Launchbury and, hopefully, Tom Croft will add considerably to this side’s firepower. BETTER FROM THE BENCH . England still haven’t got this entirely right, as they showed against Ireland, but against the Scots on Saturday Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling, in particular, made a big impact that wasn’t quite reflected on the scoreboard. There are international players and there are the top international players who can go head to head with the All Blacks and South Africans — we need the bench full of top players. With England’s policy of using the bench they will be there in the final 20 minutes where the big games are won and lost. Tom Youngs made a big impact that maybe wasn't reflected on the scoreboard, he is a good bench option . JACK THE LAD . I am really warming to Jack Nowell, who has returned to the international scene a much better and stronger player than when first blooded last season. He’s industrious and has all-round rugby nous. Against Scotland the ball came to him frequently, which is a good sign in a winger. The Exeter Chiefs man could really kick on now. Jack Nowell scores for England against Scotland, he has returned to the international scene a stronger player . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . AND WHAT I DIDN’T . CENTRE HEADACHE . Inside centre. We’ve been here before! Luther Burrell has good qualities but has no kicking game and looked on edge yesterday. England need a better ‘footballing’ 12 and might have Owen Farrell in mind, but he has endured an injury-hit 12 months and does he fit into the dynamic of England’s back line? You would think Manu Tuilagi must play some role but is he similar to Burrell? If not, where do you play him and who do you drop? Henry Slade could well be a strong contender but England have been reluctant to blood him, which is a badly missed opportunity. Luther Burrell has good qualities but no kicking game, England need a better 'fooballing' 12 in the side . MATCHING GEORGE . Ford clearly has composure at Test level but others do not — so much so that gilt-edged opportunities went begging against Scotland. The excitement and/or pressure of Test rugby is causing mistakes. Experience will help considerably but also highly pressurised coaching will help too. Ford has the composure required for Test level but the Scotland game showed that others do not . MISSED THE BOAT . It is too late now to integrate Danny Cipriani and Steffon Armitage into your starting team. Ford is my first-choice 10 but I would have started Cipriani against the Scots as we had to see him in a competitive match. Ditto Armitage. England cannot start either against France now and that’s the only match that matters before the World Cup, the only real test. We have seriously missed the boat with these two. I would have started Danny Cipriani against the Scots as we had to see him in a competitive match . PAYING THE PENALTY . There were 13 penalties against Ireland and 10 against the Scots, which is still too high. And it’s when they occur that is important, too. England are conceding too many penalties when either in no immediate danger from opponents or needlessly when on the attack — for instance, Joe Marler going in on the angle in the first half when England had the Scotland scrum on toast and it was odds on for a pushover try. In the second half Dan Cole was very lucky not to get a yellow card for diving in. On another day it could cost you the World Cup. England are conceding too many penalties needlessly such as Jose Marler (centre) going in on the angle . SLOPPY SET-PIECES . The England line-out has been strong but it must be better, the very best in the world. England must continue to chase line-out perfection, to drill those routines until they can’t go wrong. The scrum, one of the key weapons, has at best been 50-50 in the last two Tests. We must get it back to its best for what is to come. The England line-out has been strong but it must be better, the very best in the world, reaching perfection . KICK IN THE TEETH . Ford is good but he is not a world-class kicker yet at Test level, and he missed two shots again on Saturday. England need to address this. Ford is still developing and can improve his percentages, but they need alternatives. In my opinion, Farrell is their best goal-kicker so how is that factored into team selection? The standard is Leigh Halfpenny. Drop goals just do not seem to register with England. Just study the history of the World Cup to understand why they matter, especially in the big games. Leigh Halfpenny is the standard in terms of world-class kickers, Ford is good but not at that level yet . WHERE’S OUR FORTRESS? Fortress Twickenham: England’s magnificent home ground still isn’t the citadel it needs to be for the World Cup. It is a home and not a fortress. The crowd must raise their game against France. A Championship will be at stake and England fans need to show just how badly that matters to them. It does make a difference — we have home advantage and this could still be the key to England success. Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious. England’s home ground still isn’t the citadel it needs to be for the World Cup, it is a home and not a fortress .","England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham in the RBS 6 Nations .

"One of my favourite lines in sport is: ‘Winners perform at their best when the pressure is at its greatest.’ Stuart Lancaster and England are under real pressure now. They may be annoyed at the criticism they received after Dublin but it was not the result, it was the manner of their defeat. England were inferior in every area of the game, and that should hurt a lot. After a great start against Wales, England had the wind taken out of their sails by Ireland. Suddenly the nightmare scenario of England not making it out of a World Cup group which contains Wales and Australia becomes a real threat. Danny Cipriani is among England's fringe players who must get a start in the remaining Six Nations games . Stuart Lancaster's focus must shift to the World Cup with two competitive matches left before it starts . Steffon Armitage may be left out due to his choice to play for Toulon but he's really too good to ignore . Lancaster’s men have just five games before their campaign begins against Fiji on September 18... Six Nations . Saturday, March 14 v Scotland (h) Saturday, March 21 v France (h) World Cup warm-ups . Saturday August 15 v France (h) Saturday August 22 v France (a) Saturday September 5 v Ireland (h) If Wales defeat Ireland at home this weekend, their year is back on track and they go into World Cup camp in great shape. Australia will be battle-hardened and energised by a new coaching team. They know if they can put a scrum together to compete with England then Twickenham holds no fears. With two games to go in the Six Nations, England’s momentum going into the World Cup camp depends on their performances against Scotland and France. They should win those games regardless of the team they select. But Lancaster faces some crucial decisions: either continue along the same path or make changes, and send the message to everyone that there is yet more to come from his side. Since the end of last year’s Six Nations, England have lost six out of eight matches against top-tier teams. My concern is that teams will look at England and like what they see. Nobody doubts the front five is as good as any in the world. The England pack is fearsome, and behind the scrum they have the players - but a response is needed. Now is the time to show that ‘pressure’ sits comfortably on their shoulders. Here’s my seven-point guide that England should follow... England's squad are put through their paces ahead of Saturday's Six Nations clash with Scotland . 1 POOL PRACTICE . 2015 is all about the World Cup, nothing else. England can win the Six Nations title on points difference, but in a World Cup year, once the Grand Slam is gone, the tournament is gone. England only have five games before their World Cup opener in September, and three of those are friendlies, which are not games to judge anybody on. That leaves just two meaningful matches - Scotland and France at home. These are must-win games, but use them as rehearsals for the pool matches against Wales and Australia. England have to do everything they can to replicate the atmosphere they will encounter when they play those World Cup games. 2 THREE AND EASY . There are three men Lancaster still needs to see start - Danny Cipriani, Steffon Armitage and Henry Slade. Lancaster can make it clear he’s not dropping George Ford, but he needs to find out about Cipriani in a significant game once and for all. Armitage is arguably the best player in Europe and must be in the squad. We can deal with the politics of overseas players after the World Cup, but let’s just get the best players on the field. Lancaster needs to find out about Danny Cipriani in a significant game once and for all, so he should start . Slade - alongside Jonathan Joseph - is perhaps the most in-form centre in England and his left foot, at inside centre, would offer more kicking variations. England’s kicking game was poor against Ireland and they have got to find players who can dictate a game. Kicking is now so important and they are off the pace. Perhaps only one of the three will really seize their opportunity, but at least you will know once and for all. Lancaster must be bold and those selections would change the whole atmosphere at Twickenham. Exeter's Henry Slade  is probably the most in-form centre in England at the moment so should be tested . 3 REST ROBSHAW . I’m a big Chris Robshaw fan but he is in a very competitive position and must be in the team on merit, so we need to see his biggest rival play. Also, if he gets injured in the first minute at the World Cup, nobody knows who will replace him as captain. It’s time to see who else has the capacity to lead this team and I would give James Haskell a chance to see how he handles the task, which allows you to bring in Armitage at No 7. Haskell is one of the few players who captains his club, so give the role to him on Saturday. Captain Chris Robshaw, here attempting a drop goal at training, should be rested to try out alternatives . James Haskell captains Wasps so would be an interesting replacement for Robshaw should one be needed . 4 NEED FOR SPEED . The current back row of Robshaw, Haskell and Billy Vunipola is not quick enough at the very top level. It is such a shame Tom Croft is injured - he is one of the quickest forwards in world rugby at No 6 - while Armitage is no slouch. In a World Cup you are playing against the fittest and fastest players, and you need to be able to match that. We have a big powerful front five but we do not need the same in the back row, we need speed. The current back row of Billy Vunipola (pictured), Haskell and Robshaw don't have the speed required . 5 GET YOUR KICKS . Dave Alred is one of the best coaches I’ve ever worked with. That’s why I’d bring him back into the England set-up. It wasn’t just Jonny Wilkinson’s kicking that he helped - Alred improved the whole team. England’s kicking and catching was so poor against Ireland and the whole world will have seen that. Dave Alred (right) not only helped Jonny Wilkinson's prodigious kicking but the all-round England game . It would be a challenge persuading him to join because he is very much his own man, but he is the best person for the job by a long way. Many of his methods, based on Aussie rules football, could be introduced over the coming months. Then, by the time England go into camp, the team will understand how he operates and will have one of the game’s great specialist coaches at their disposal. 6 FOCUS ON FITNESS . When I managed England, I made it clear I would only pick players who can play 80 minutes. If you can’t last a full game at full pace, you are not going to survive in a World Cup. Lancaster has faith in his strength and conditioning team, but an independent opinion, from someone who has prepared World Cup teams, could be a shot in the arm. I would bring in someone like Dave Reddin, who was in my set-up, was with Team GB at London 2012 and is now head of performance at the FA. He will pull no punches and get everyone’s mind back on track. Every player picked should be fit enough to play for 80 minutes if they're worthy of the World Cup . 7 SMARTER SUBS . Assuming all your players can last 80 minutes, the first purpose of your bench should be for injury replacements, but England started against Ireland with no specialist second-row substitute. If Dave Attwood had gone off in the first minute, could Nick Easter really play the whole game in the second row? Secondly, the bench is there to make tactical changes. Lancaster’s substitutions against Ireland were his most important because England were chasing the game. But his changes surprised me. Mike Brown . Anthony Watson . Jonathan Joseph . Henry Slade . Jack Nowell . Danny Cipriani . Ben Youngs . Alex Corbisiero . Dylan Hartley . Dan Cole . Courtney Lawes . Dave Attwood . Tom Wood . James Haskell . Steffon Armitage . With 15 minutes to go he needed to bring on Cipriani, not Billy Twelvetrees. Keeping Ford in the game was the right call but he needed help creatively and with the boot. For Lancaster to say Cipriani coming off the bench at 12 is not an option because he hasn’t seen him play there before doesn’t add up. Between Cipriani and Twelvetrees you need to cover six positions so you cannot be inflexible and say Cipriani is only a fly-half. England need to find ways to unsettle the opposition and do the unexpected. If we haven’t seen Cipriani at 12, you can guarantee Ireland haven’t either. It may not have changed the outcome, but I’d love to have seen Ford, Cipriani and Joseph finish that game together.","England have won just six of their last eight against top opposition .

"Samir Nasri was lucky to be on the pitch at half-time after a clear red-card kick on Barcelona’s Neymar. Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi settled for giving the Frenchman a yellow card in the 38th minute, when Nasri lashed out with his right boot at the Brazilian. Nasri had been hustled off the ball and his kick — an act of clear frustration with Manchester City being outplayed — left Neymar writhing in agony. Samir Nasri is shown a yellow card after he kicked Neymar with Manchester City's frustrations boiling over .

Silva's protest in the face of the referee was out of line considering it was a clear foul on Messi . Silva’s aggressive protest in the face of the Italian referee was well over the top, as replays showed it was a clear foul. I believe Rocchi got it wrong when he awarded City a penalty for a trip on Sergio Aguero late on. Justice was done when Aguero’s kick was saved.","Samir Nasri was shown a yellow card by Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi .

"Mike Dean had a good game in very difficult circumstances and over the 90 minutes, to the independent eye, did nothing to add to Jose Mourinho’s claims of a campaign against his team. Sure enough some referees would have waved away appeals for the penalty which Dean awarded against Nemanja Matic, but replays confirmed what I thought when agreeing that the midfielder had caught Sadio Mane before playing the ball. There were some referees who would have given the home side a penalty of their own when Diego Costa was challenged by Jose Fonte. Referee Mike Dean (right) had some tough calls to make in Chelsea's draw with Southampton . Some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to Southampton, as Nemanja Matic brings down Sadio Mane, but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball . Chelsea striker Diego Costa appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by Dean . Replays were inconclusive but pundits felt Dean was correct. Had he awarded the penalty of course Jose Fonte would have had to be dismissed. The one decision I had to disagree with was when Matic cynically tripped his opponent and Dean, after due consideration and perhaps realising that Matic was already on a caution, decided to keep his cards in his pocket. Mourinho wisely subbed Matic shortly afterwards. Chelsea could also point to a trip by Tadic on Branislav Ivanovic just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which Dean did well not to caution. Branislav Ivanovic went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from Tadic but it would have been tough to give . Costa claims he was fouled by Diego Fonte - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off .

"Make no mistake, this is a huge game for England and Scotland. After the anti-climax of an uninspiring defeat in Ireland, England must strike back and show that they are a nation to be feared at this year’s World Cup. Scotland, after a promising start under Vern Cotter, are without a win, have lost at home to Italy and are looking increasingly desperate. Their players need to put in a performance to restore some pride. So I was surprised to see men from each camp this week making comments that could make things worse rather than better. This is a huge game for England's players - but they are not an arrogant group and will look to perform well . Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride . England forwards coach Graham Rowntree talked about the home side being able to ‘win by many’ if they get their game right. I have absolutely no problem with him saying this privately to his players, as it is true. And putting pressure on them in public is an effective way to add pressure and focus. But sometimes saying something this provocative makes him and his team a hostage to fortune and feeds the stereotype that England are arrogant, which I don’t believe we are. In his youth the brilliant French back rower Imanol Harinordoquy used to employ similar tactics and I'd chuckle, knowing how characters like Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson would react. I doubt Scotland will come back to haunt Rowntree in the same way but why risk it? Then we have Scotland’s Stuart Hogg, a brilliant player - on the back of losing to Italy at home, a run of 15 games at Twickenham without a win and the last seven games conceding on average 36 points - saying England do not respect Scotland. You earn respect by winning big games and Scotland’s performance against Italy suggests it was they who were guilty of not respecting their opponents. It’s time for them to look in the mirror, regain composure and forget the old stereotypes. It has been a long time since I have seen a Scottish side play with a real threat of winning at Twickenham and as a result the rivalry has inevitably diminished and is mostly myth and hype. I really do hope they make a game of it or the Mexican wave could be on us after 20 minutes. This England team is not arrogant - in fact, in many ways I’d like to see them carry themselves more confidently to demonstrate self-belief - and Hogg’s comments were wide of the mark. Scotland’s players should look at themselves and ask themselves if they really believe they are good enough to win at grounds like Twickenham. Recent history suggests not. They need to be careful or they will not be back at Twickenham this year - they are only scheduled to play at HQ at the World Cup if they get out of an awkward group containing South Africa and Samoa. As for England, the most worrying aspect of that defeat to Ireland was their lack of intensity at the breakdown so I was pleased to hear that they have been having some pretty spicy training sessions this week. Stuart Hogg said that England do not respect Scotland which could make things worse at Twickenham . This England team are not arrogant, in fact, they could do with carrying more confidently to show self-belief . England's players trudge off the pitch at the Aviva Stadium after their defeat to Ireland last time out . The breakdown is the responsibility of every single player in the team, not just your back row. It is an area of the game where there is the most physical contact, you need to be brave and you can really hurt your opposition here and we came off second best in Dublin. All very good being tough in training but it is on the field of play where it matters most. There should be real anger within the squad about the way they underperformed in Dublin. This is World Cup year, England are at home and they need momentum and to cause fear and dread among their opponents. England failed to fire any meaningful shots and as a result the Grand Slam has gone and the Championship is no longer in their hands. They must strike back immediately. I want to see England take out their pent-up frustration on Scotland by producing their most clinical, technically proficient and above all fierce performance. George Ford is our ‘creative director’ and I want to see his most expansive game, showcasing his best imaginative rugby. If he can achieve that, Twickenham will burst into life. England showed a worrying lack of intensity at the breakdown in Dublin, which is everyone's responsibility . George Ford is our ‘creative director’ and I want to see his most expansive game against the Scots . There is no question Scotland are massive underdogs going into this game but underdogs will always lift their performance levels and it is up to the favourite to respond. England must respond. I was involved in three major upsets in my time as England coach and I remember every single one as if they were yesterday. They were all bitterly painful experiences, England just one match away from a Grand Slam on each occasion. I remember Wales’ Scott Gibbs dancing his way over at Wembley in 1999. I watched it the other day again with my sons and it almost ruined my weekend all over again. Wales’ Scott Gibbs dancing his way over at Wembley in 1999, watching it the other day was horrible again . Andy Nicol (right) showed sheer joy at the final whistle at Murrayfield in 2000 when beating England . Keith Wood bulldozed his way across for the match-winning try at the old Lansdowne Road in 2001 . Then there was Scotland’s Andy Nicol’s sheer joy on the final whistle at Murrayfield in 2000 and Ireland’s Keith Wood bulldozing his way across for the match-winning try from a line-out peel at the old Lansdowne Road in 2001. Three great players, three very painful memories. But it’s important to say that all those upsets were away from home. This game is at Twickenham, where Scotland have not won in 32 years and I simply cannot see England losing this game. There will be no upset as long as England clearly understand the word ‘basics’. I was taught the importance of this word by a brilliant man called Yehuda Shinar, who was an Israeli psychologist I visited several times in Tel Aviv and who worked with me behind the scenes for a period with England. He knew nothing about rugby but he understood and studied winning - ‘basics’ is a key word in winning, never more so than when you are favourites - and his definition of basics is: ‘In every sport there are several obligatory steps. Each step is comprised of several Dos and Don’ts. If you do not follow them to the letter you can hardly expect to win. Therefore, they are defined as the BASICS.’ Captain Chris Robshaw was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against Ireland . England lost the ball at the line-out and that cannot happen again - if England dominate there they will win big . We then defined England’s basics quite simply as line-out and scrums - in the three Grand Slams we lost, simply we did not get these basics right. I hope England have spent this week drilling their set-piece to death. They need to be more unpredictable in these areas, especially the line-out. Chris Robshaw was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against Ireland but then the line-out which followed was stolen. This cannot happen again. Courtney Lawes’ club partnership with hooker Dylan Hartley should help rectify that. If they dominate that area of the game - and I am sure England will - expect a very high score.","England must bounce back from the defeat by Ireland in RBS 6 Nations .

"Angel Di Maria had to be sent off by referee Michael Oliver for grabbing the official’s shirt after being correctly cautioned for simulation. The United player will be awaiting the reaction from the FA, who usually take a dim view of physical contact with officials.

"What will it take for Arsenal fans to really love Olivier Giroud? Yes, he is appreciated by the home faithful at the Emirates but not to the same degree as other top strikers. Sergio Aguero, Diego Costa and Harry Kane are worshipped at their clubs. But with similar goal- scoring exploits this season, Giroud doesn’t get anywhere near the same level of affection from his fans or the rest of the football world. He is valued as a player but not unconditionally loved. He deserves much more credit. Of the strikers mentioned, only Aguero has a better minutes per goal rate in all competitions this season than Giroud, who is a good link man and an important source of goals for Arsenal. Olivier Giroud has scored 11 Premier League goals - and 15 in all competitions - during an injury-hit season . Giroud rounds Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic during Arsenal's win in the Champions League . The Frenchman slots home past Brad Guzan during Arsenal's 5-0 rout of Aston Villa . He started the season in fine form and then was unlucky with injury but he hit the ground running as soon as he returned. After his performance in the Champions League first leg against Monaco, everyone rushed to criticise and dissect his game. If Costa or Aguero have a bad game, there is no discussion. With Giroud it is as if he always has to play well to win people over. He’s never allowed an off-day. What has been impressive is the way he has bounced back mentally from that, scoring in four of his last five games. The only match in which he didn’t score was against Manchester United in the FA Cup, when he started on the bench. The circumstances of his arrival are part of the problem for Giroud. Arsenal fans have been fed a diet of pace and movement ever since Arsene Wenger arrived. From Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka to Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie, Wenger’s forwards have always been about great mobility and raw speed. Sergio Aguero won Manchester City the title in 2012 and the Argentine is worshipped by the club's fans . Harry Kane has burst onto the scene this season and is already adored by the Tottenham faithful . Diego Costa hit the ground running in England and has become a terrace hero amongst Chelsea fans . Giroud is not as quick or graceful across the turf but he was bought as a replacement for Van Persie. He is an entirely different type of player, so that he has shaken off any unfair comparisons with the Dutchman is to his credit. It’s also interesting that Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez were signed almost as Giroud’s replacements but the Frenchman is still the go-to man in the middle. His involvement shows how Wenger’s philosophy has almost come full circle. When he arrived he sold John Hartson and instead opted for pacy forwards. Now he has reverted to Giroud, who is in a similar mould — there’s not a great deal of difference between a Welsh battering ram and a French one. Not to say they are one-dimensional players, far from it. Hartson was technically sound, a giant in the air and provided a different attacking dimension. Giroud offers the same. But Wenger now seems to want physicality back at the top of the side. That means the team have had to play in a different way, though that is not a bad thing. Giroud’s link-up play is exceptional and Arsenal use him like a backboard, holding up play and waiting for others to run from deep and join the attack and he has been at the heart of many of Arsenal’s best team goals. After Robin van Persie's departure to Manchester United, Giroud was purchased to replace him . Alexis Sanchez was signed to replace Giroud, but the Frenchman continues to keep his place . Danny Welbeck has also been unable to dislodge the totemic striker from his role in the middle . Although he does not have the same movement as previous Arsenal greats, he is versatile and wholehearted, and that has endeared him to most of the fans. It goes without saying how powerful he is in the air and that has opened up a route to goal that has been for so long ignored by Arsene Wenger. Wenger has an outstanding track record of improving strikers — I witnessed how he transformed Emmanuel Adebayor — and he is doing the same with Giroud. His only focus is on what players can do. And you can see in Giroud the benefits of having a manager who believes in you. Giroud has talked about playing out of his comfort zone to try to improve. He has done that and hopefully Arsenal fans will come to love him more. But ultimately for any striker, it shouldn’t matter what you look like or how you play, as long as you offer goals. Luckily for Giroud, he does just that.","Giroud is appreciated by the home faithful at the Emirates but not to the same degree as other top strikers .

"This weekend's FA Cup action unsurprisingly brought up a number of talking points. Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll talks us through the key events from Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final draw with Blackburn on Sunday. Andre Marriner was well served by not giving decisions at Anfield, where there were four decent penalty appeals. While one could make a case — certainly technically — for three of the four to be given, I felt Marriner got every one of those decisions right. Liverpool’s best chance of a penalty was their first appeal when Adam Lallana went down under pressure from Matt Kilgallon.

"Another weekend and more discussions and dissatisfaction with officiating. At Old Trafford I could actually understand how Roger East thought that Wes Brown had clipped Radamel Falcao but the clear and obvious foul was clearly by John O'Shea. East was right to award the penalty kick. What mystified me was that the PGMO decided, unusually, to issue a statement regarding the incident, perhaps in an attempt to support one of their officials. East's statement, in which he felt Brown had made the foul for the penalty, makes it impossible for the FA to transfer the red card to O'Shea as they can only do so when the referee accepts that he has disciplined the wrong player. Wes Brown was sent off for a foul on Falcao even though it appeared John O'Shea made the contact . Gus Poyet's side are appealing Brown's red card but an overturn isn't certain . Roger East sends off Brown (right) and Poll admits he can understand his decision to show him the red card . Now the red card will be issued to Brown, although he has appealed it as he did not foul Falcao. Had no statement been made then the card could have been transferred and natural justice could have taken place - even when referees get decisions right there appears to be a mess-up. Nothing is certain, however, in the discredited disciplinary process following the Ashley Barnes and Nemanja Matic incident. Barnes could not be charged for a clearly and widely accepted red card challenge while a player guilty of violent conduct, according to the FA, had a reduced ban for some bizarre reason. Either he was guilty or not. Another example is that Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak should be charged for his clearly deliberate forearm smash on West Ham's Diafra Sakho towards the end of Palace's win at Upton Park. It appeared to be unseen by referee Mike Dean but was around the area of active play, where the ball was present, so could that be deemed as 're-refereeing' an incident? I hope not as the Australian certainly deserves a ban for the mindless assault. Mile Jedinak's elbow was labelled a 'mindless assault' and Poll says he should be punished . The Crystal Palace midfielder caught West Ham striker Diafra Sakho and was lucky not to injure him . There was more dissatisfaction, and this time by both mangers over the performance of referee Neil Swarbrick at The Britannia Stadium. There were three key incidents although both Steve Bruce and Mark Hughes seemed less than happy with the general refereeing. Two acts of serious foul play escaped Swarbrick's detection and Stephen Ireland was involved in both. First he went into a challenge with David Meyler leading with a sideways, stamping studs first boot which could have caused a really nasty injury – it certainly endangered his opponents safety and should have led to a red card. Just ten minutes later it appeared that Hull's Maynor Figueroa decided to take the law into his own hands and went through Ireland from behind, raking straight down the back of the Stoke midfielder's calf and causing a nasty injury. Another red card tackle which didn't even merit yellow for Swarbrick. Perhaps the FA will act or maybe they'll say they cannot. The fact that the only goal of the game came from Peter Crouch who was in an offside position led to more understandable frustration. Unfortunately the video replays that the game needs to correct such errors was turned down by the IFAB at their meeting this weekend. Stephen Ireland lies injured after a after a tackle from Maynor Figueroa which left him needing stitches . The Honduras international is unlikely to receive any ban from the FA as the officials saw the incident .","Wes Brown was sent off for a foul on Falcao when it appeared John O'Shea fouled him but Roger East's decision was understandable at the time .

"It was a day of firsts for Whitecaps FC striker Robert Earnshaw as he wasted no time in grabbing his first goal for his new club by scoring with his first touch of the ball against Portland Timbers on Saturday evening. With the game looking as though it was heading for a 1-1 draw, Welsh manager Carl Robinson put faith in his veteran compatriot, bringing him on as an 87th minute substitute for the Vancouver outfit . Within three minutes, the former Premier League striker was putting the ball in the back of the net and showboating his trademark somersault celebration.

Earnshaw punches the air in delight as he celebrates his 90th minute strike that decided the game . Following a finely weighted through ball from Pedro Morales and some circus-like defending from former West Bromdefender Liam Ridgewell and Nat Borchers, Earnshaw found himself bearing down on goal with just the keeper to beat. Putting any debut match jitters to one side in front of the home crowd at BC Place, the 33-year-old finished with aplomb with a delightful dink over the onrushing Adam Kwarasey.

After his signing was confirmed on Wednesday, the former Cardiff, Nottingham Forest and Derby County striker's input took the 'Caps to their third straight victory before they host LA Galaxy on Sunday, and he was thrilled to get on the score sheet so early in his Whitecaps career. 'The length of time I've been playing football and that feeling when the ball hits the net, oh my god, it's the best,' Earnshaw told reporters after the game. But it's not the first time Earnshaw has been among the goals during an MLS debut. The Welshman also netted on his first game for previous club, Chicago Fire, and also bagged a brace on his home debut with Toronto FC. Caps boss Robinson is a keen admirer of Earnshaw and his match-winning performance on Saturday merely confirmed his belief. 'I said he'll get one chance,' Robinson said. 'I brought him here because he can score goals. When he gets the chance and he gets in the right position, he usually takes it. I knew he'd get one chance. The coolness of the finish and the calmness in his head was outstanding.' Former Wales striker Earnshaw, who announced his retirement from international football last week, is not the only Brit to be plying his trade in the ever-expanding MLS. Earnshaw is not the only Brit to move to the MLS and will be joined by New York FC's Frank Lampard (left) Since David Beckham's high-profile move to LA Galaxy in 2007, and with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and former Chelsea star Frank Lampard set to embark on a career in America, there has been an influx of British talent travelling across the Atlantic.

"Willie Mullins has turned the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle into a one-man show. The Irish trainer would have won it with Annie Power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off Ruby Walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate Glens Melody. That makes it seven wins running, Mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record-breaker in Quevega before she retired to stud. Glens Melody capitalises on Annie Power's fall to win the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle . It will be a shame if Mullins’ total domination of day one overshadows the first Festival win of trainer Neil Mulholland courtesy of The Druids Nephew in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase. Mulholland, who runs The Young Master in this afternoon’s RSA Chase, is a trainer going places and now has the Grand National in his sights for The Druids Nephew, who won under Barry Geraghty. There was no redemption for last year’s unlucky Champion Hurdle third The New One, who could only manage fifth this time around. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies was adamant that his mount was not himself, describing the feel he gave him as ‘not like him’. His father trainer Nigel will begin a retrieval mission next week but I wonder if Tuesday’s run means The New One will be over fences next season.

Irish trainer Gordon Elliott is more established than Neil Mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the Festival with his National Hunt Chase winner Cause of Causes also deserves praise.

The final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the CHAPS Restaurant Barbados Novices’ Handicap Chase. Quite a mouthful but Welsh trainer Rebecca Curtis is hoping that might work in her favour after Irish Cavalier won for owner Andrew McIver and gave jockey Paul Townend his second win of the day.

"England fell agonisingly short of claiming an astonishing Six Nations title as Stuart Lancaster's side ran in seven tries to beat France on one of the most astonishing days in the history of the Championship. Going into the game knowing they needed to win by 26 clear points, Stuart Lancaster's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them finish one of the most remarkable matches in Twickenham history broken, but not bowed. England's players were left distraught as the realisation they had finished so near but so far away from winning the title.

They have reason to be proud. Twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately England finished six points adrift of the total they needed as Ireland claimed the title for the second season running. England could barely have done any more but were punished for a second-half lapse of discipline which saw James Haskell sin binned for tripping and France scored two tries. 'We're absolutely devastated,' said man-of-the-match Ben Youngs, who scored two tries. 'For all our endeavour, we fell short. We're gutted.' Ireland's crushing victory over Scotland at Murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left England with a huge mountain to climb. England began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of Lancaster's tenure. It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday. Parling's Leicester team-mate Dan Cole led his side out on his 50th cap and England knew they would need a titanic set-piece performance, first and foremost, to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win. And from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as England wheeled their opposing eight enough for No8 Billy Vunipola to put extreme pressure on France scrum half Sebastien Tillous-Borde. The France No9 threw a pass to nowhere with Vunipola breathing down his neck and England centre Jonathan Joseph – England's find of the tournament – gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back Mike Brown. Brown worked the ball to George Ford who flipped a clever pass inside to Ben Youngs who pirouetted over the line for a try inside 90 seconds. Ford added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7-0 and England were away. Only a missed penalty attempt dampened the crowd's enthusiasm. Then, disaster struck as Courtney Lawes fumbled a pass from Youngs down the right and Tillous-Borde snaffled the ball with only Cole covering across and the line at his mercy. There was no contest. The France scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the Twickenham crowd. Plisson missed the conversion but moments later France went even further ahead when winger Noa Nakaitaci broke away down the left to score his side's second try inside a couple of minutes. But the left winger can consider himself incredibly fortunate after he brainlessly attempted to run around under the posts only to touch the ball down milliseconds before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line. The Television Match Official agonised over the decision and eventually, after countless replays, the try was awarded. England's Jack Nowell goes over for his second try of the match but England could not find enough points to jump above Ireland . France's Noa Nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from Youngs during the first half . Nakaitaci was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line . England's Jonathan Joseph (centre) is tackled by France duo Maxime Mermoz (left) and Vincent Debaty . England's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another Six Nations title under Lancaster . Plisson's conversion made it 15-7 after 17 minutes and suddenly England's task was even greater than at kick off. Lawes caused a mini fracas when his huge hit on Plisson angered France, although referee Nigel Owens deemed the tackle was fair. Ford then reduced the deficit to five points with a long-range penalty and Plisson missed back-to-back penalties to deny France the chance to pull further ahead. Now it was England's turn to get lucky. Youngs made a searing 40 metre break down the right and fed inside to Ford who was tackled short of the line. James Haskell dipped for the ball but appeared to knock on in the process before gathering and popping to Anthony Watson to cross. But this time the TMO ruled in England's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off Haskell's knee. Ford converted to make it 17-15 after 31 minutes. Game on again. In an astonishing game, Joseph then broke from his own line to make 70 metres before chipping ahead for Luther Burrell. The centre lost out to Bernard Le Roux but earned a penalty which England took quickly and Youngs wriggled over for his side's third try. Ford converted to make it 24-15 and England dared to dream again. A Ford penalty on the stroke of half time left England 27-15 in front after a memorable half but Maime Memoz crossed two minutes into the second half to leave the home side 21 points away from claiming the title. Seven of those came four minutes later when Youngs, enjoying his best game in an England shirt, made a searing break down the right and fed inside for Ford to canter over for his side's fourth try. Ford converted his own try to make it 34-22. Lawes is grabbed by his shirt during the first half as France's players let their frustrations boil over .

It was Hartley's last act as he was replaced by Tom Youngs on 52 minutes. England struck again when Jack Nowell crossed after more good work from Youngs and Ford's conversion made it 41-25 after 53 minutes. But England's delight was tempered when Haskell was sent to the sin bin for a blatant trip on Plisson. With Haskell off the pitch, France broke again and Nakaitaci made a searing run down the left. Brown looked to have stopped him but the winger flicked a clever pass to the supporting Vincent Debaty and the prop scored. Kockott missed the conversion leaving the deficit at 11 points. Danny Cipriani was introduced to the fray at full back on 61 minutes with Watson going off and Brown moving to the wing. Within seconds England scored again when Vunipola drove over and Ford converted, leaving England 18 points in front. It was utterly astonishing stuff. France scored their fifth try when replacement Benjamin Kayser drove over from a line out but Kockott missed again to leave the score 48-35. Haskell was replaced by Tom Wood as England began to sense their title hopes were slipping away.

"A win is always a win and England will go into next week’s game against France with a fighting chance of winning the Six Nations but they will be annoyed with themselves for leaving so many points out there on the field. It’s all going to come down to points difference, and its nip and tuck with Ireland, but those points England left out there at Twickenham could cost them dear. The biggest positive I would draw out of the game is that there was plenty of creativity – George Ford and Ben Youngs led the way – and at least England were making try-scoring opportunities. This was no sterile kicking performance and with a bit more experience I'm hoping England will start putting good teams away comfortably. George Ford breaks away to score England's second try on a nerve-wracking afternoon . Ben Youngs gave England options with a display of much-needed creativity against an obdurate Scotland . Ford in particular was composed and was confident enough to slow the game down on occasions to allow play to come to him. He’s got time on the ball and some of England’s other exciting young backs must look to emulate that . The first half was extraordinary in many ways and spelt out the absolute necessity of taking your chances in Test rugby because it almost invariably comes back to haunt you. England started at a good tempo - which they definitely needed to after going behind early on in their last three Six Nations games - but they failed to take full advantage and put away three or four gilt-edge chances. Luther Burrell made a strong break in the first minute which should have led to a try but he showed no composure. He neither slowed down to allow Anthony Watson to get to him on his right nor did he look for Youngs steaming up on his inside. Instead he just went to ground and even then England didn’t recycle very well. England did score a fine try during this period which saw them at their best with Ford taking the ball to the line and Jonathan Joseph again showing that brilliant footwork of his to beat Hogg but then the sloppiness crept in again. Jonathan Joseph scored England's first try to give the hosts hope of a rout, but that did not materialise . Jack Nowell had been hungry for work and made an excellent initial burst but failed to transfer the ball to two hands which immediately limited his choice. He had the perfect arrowhead, support players on his left and right, but with the ball in one arm went to ground ineffectively. England also looked odds on to score at a scrum five having completely dominated Scotland in the previous scrum but then inexplicably gave a penalty away for coming in on the angle. Another try went begging when Mike Brown got dragged down by Stuart Hogg. There’ s no disgrace in being caught by Hogg who is a real speed merchant and I’m pretty sure Brown had lost a boot as well, but would like to have seen more support on his shoulder. Almost predictably Scotland hit back an scored with their very first serious attack to level the scores and in many ways England were possibly lucky to only trail 13-10 at half-time. That was definitely a yellow card when Dan Cole stepped into play the ball earlier at a ruck when Scotland were camped on England’s line! Mike Brown looked to have broken free but was hauled back by the pacy Stuart Hogg . Tom Youngs  leads an England breakaway with team-mates sprinting to joining in with his foray forward . Half-time will have been interesting in the England changing room and England looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match with Ford's try but then again we saw that lack of composure. Tom Youngs made a terrific break immediately after coming on as a replacement picking a wonderful angle but then lost his head completely and flung the wildest of passes to nowhere. Yet again if he had just slowed down for a second and picked his support runner there would probably have been a try. Moments later Watson was nearly through but again went to ground without looking for his support and Mike Brown slightly over-ran that pass form James Haskell.In the furnace of international rugby you must play it cool on occasions . Finally at the end they killed Scotland off with a well taken try by Nowell England should look carefully of why it took so long. Scotland attempt to clear their lines with Courtney Lawes (right) trying to block during the edgy encounter . England back-row Billy Vunipola evades the tackles of two Scottish opponents . Good show: England will have to taken heart from the attacking intent if not the finishing. Jack Nowell worked very hard and took his late try well and Jonathan Joseph again demonstrated how he can unpick the tightest defences with his footwork. Youngs and Ford were really lively at half-back, Lawes added physicality up front . Bad show: England have to recapture the coolness under pressure and ruthless streak they showed in the second half against Wales in Cardiff. That is what wins you big rugby matches. They made life so difficult for themselves  with their lack of precision and not building a score. Scotland took heart and scavenged like they always did.","England go into next week's game with France with a fighting chance of winning the Six Nations .

"France winger Noa Nakaitaci was inches away from committing the ultimate rugby gaffe during Saturday's crunch clash against England.

"Many football love stories start with a game shared with Dad. I never had this, but I’d heard the stories and was hoping for that father-son experience when I took my eldest son Jayden to Wembley on Sunday. He’s 10 and a Chelsea fan like his dad. Not like his brother Koby who is seven and declared recently that he’s changing teams to support Manchester United. On my mind was the Paris Metro incident. Not that I was worried about the real Chelsea fans but more so those idiots who put on the shirt claiming to be Chelsea fans without caring what image or message they send out, and are just out to cause trouble. Chelsea supporters pose with Michael Duberry (centre) and his eldest son, Jayden (second right) at Wembley . Chelsea fans cheer on their team in the Capital One Cup Final - and Duberry was one of the supporters at Wembley . Chelsea celebrate winning the Coca-Cola Cup at Wembley in 1998, Duberry's first trophy as a professional . I didn’t know what to expect. I wasn’t 100 per cent confident but we went by public transport on the Jubilee Line to Wembley Park because we wanted to walk down Wembley Way. A cup final wouldn’t be the same without it. It was great to see Jayden’s excited face counting down the stops as we neared the stadium. As soon as we stepped out of the station we saw waves of people in blue and white. What a great feeling it was walking down Wembley Way with my son. As a player you don’t get to experience this. I was loving it as much as him. The different races in Blue shirts walking towards the stadium was clear to see. It was nothing like the image those racist idiots painted of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro. 'As a player you don’t get to experience the walk down Wembley Way. I loved it as much as my son', said Duberry . 'It was a great feeling it was walking down Wembley Way with my son among different races in Blue shirts' The scenes on Wembley Way vastly contrasted with the behaviour of some fans on the Paris Metro last month . Chelsea have a more cosmopolitan set of fans than when I was playing. You have fans from all nationalities and not only British descent. The club must be happy with the progress and that Paris incident must have felt like a painful kick in the short-and-curlies. After stopping to grab pizza, we went inside and when you see the pitch and the stadium, you can’t help but wish you were out there. I played my one and only Wembley cup final in March 1998 in this same competition, but known then as the Coca-Cola Cup. We beat Middlesbrough 2-0 and it was my first trophy as a professional. The Chelsea supporters at Wembley were a mixed set of fans from different races, families and groups . 'When John Terry scored the first Chelsea goal I enjoyed a brilliant, that father-son moment of celebrating' As we took our seats, I gave him a history lesson about the day I played in this final 17 years ago. Around us again were a mixed set of Chelsea fans from different races, families, groups of lads and father and sons. After a while a few asked for pictures with me and also offered some kind words to me about my time at the club, dads explaining to their kids I used to play for Chelsea and making me feel old. Flag waving and singing songs with Jayden and the other Chelsea fans was great. I just had to make sure he missed out certain words to a few songs and it was fine. When John Terry scored the first Chelsea goal it was brilliant, that father-son moment of celebrating was priceless, then to see the other fans celebrating with him was great. And just when I thought the smile on his face couldn’t get any bigger his favourite player, Diego Costa scored the second. 'Diego Costa (right), my son's favourite player, scored the second goal to seal victory for Chelsea' Costa's deflected effort beat Hugo Lloris to make it 2-0 to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup Final . When the final whistle went, we were high-fiving and hugging strangers and watching JT lift the trophy which brought back memories for myself of Dennis Wise letting Gianluca Vialli lift the trophy in 1998. We went home on the Tube amongst lots of Spurs fans, disappointed but singing very loudly. Jayden kept laughing every time he heard a rude word. It was the only part of the day when I felt uncomfortable. It was a shame to hear more stories about alleged racism on a train later in the night. 'Watching Terry lift the trophy with his team-mates brought back memories of my Coca-Cola Cup win' Costa and Terry pose with the Capital One Cup trophy on the Wembley pitch after the 2-0 victory . The sooner a strong radical punishment for such behaviour is put in place the better it is for all. Thankfully we saw nothing like it. I had enjoyed the day as a black father and a Chelsea fan watching his team win at Wembley. The only colour that mattered was the same one wrapped around the cup…….Blue.

"It was just as well they got the fireworks out the way before the game, because even after an explosive start and some quite extraordinary rugby any hope England had of having something to celebrate had this amazing habit of quickly disappearing here on Saturday night. That opening try from Ben Youngs, scored after less than 90 seconds, invited England and their expectant supporters to dream. From Jeremy Guscott came a gushing, confident response. England would not only win the game, he declared, but they would do so in the style he once displayed on a rugby pitch. It was an understandable reaction but it did not take into account England's ability under Stuart Lancaster to too often blow these opportunities. They should have nailed Scotland last week, as the Irish did at Murrayfield on Saturday, and their failure to do so cost them dear in the end.

England's players, including captain Robshaw (right), look dejected after conceding a crucial try to France . If Lancaster likened the challenge his side might be facing on this most absorbing afternoon of international rugby to the Ryder Cup, he no doubt hoped his side would not need to pull off their own Miracle of Medinah. But a 26-point winning advantage against France, even this France, seemed like a pretty tall order and so it proved. No sooner had they secured seven points than they were nursing the bruises of two French tries, Philippe Saint-Andre's side punishing England for a lack of precision as well as patience. A lack of discipline too, summed up by the foolishness of James Haskell in what became an utterly insane try fest. That England then responded the way they did made it a highly entertaining spectacle. The try Youngs scored after 35 minutes was a beauty, the move England put together covering the full length of the Twickenham pitch. Ben Youngs goes over the line to give England an early lead in their must-win Six Nations clash . Leicester Tigers star Youngs jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on Saturday evening . France's Sebastien Tillous-Borde responded to Youngs' early try with one of his own after a 40-yard dash . But those early lapses in concentration as they chased that points total were so damaging to England's ambitions of securing a first Six Nations championship under Lancaster, with a 24-point victory still required after more than half an hour and 14 at half-time. Within three minutes of the second half they needed 21. There were moments when they were close. Painfully close. With four minutes remaining they needed just one converted try. But Lancaster will have to reflect on that period of the first half – as well as certain spells after the break - when they allowed France to look like their old selves and examine in detail where improvements still need to be made. With six months remaining until the start of the World Cup, Lancaster is sure to focus on some of the positives too. The fact that they beat Wales in Cardiff and Australia here last autumn certainly bodes well for those group exchanges. As does the emergence of players like Jonathan Joseph and other individual performances. But is this a team that can seriously make the most of home advantage and secure a second World Cup in 12 years? The evidence right now would suggest not, even if the detail in Lancaster's preparation extends to involving the players' partners in trying to win the tournament later this year. Courtney Lawes is grabbed by his shirt as France's players let their frustrations boil over . England's Lawes gets caught up in a scuffle with four France players as tempers flare during the first half . France's Noa Nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from Youngs during the first half . In 2003 England were the complete team. Dominant against their northern hemisphere rivals and quite clearly equipped to conquer all on the opposite side of the world. And they believed it too, with such confidence a crucial quality for any team with serious ambitions. But England in 2015? They can play some wonderful rugby with a nice combination of power and pace. But are they clinical enough? Are they robust enough? And do they really believe that anything is possible? Anything seemed possible here on Saturday in this insane contest; one that saw 12 excellent tries and some marvellous running rugby. Billy Vunipola set the tone with the thumping intervention that led to the opening Youngs try and what followed was a breathless 80 minutes of action to round off a remarkable climax to the championship. The balance of power on the pitch as well as on the final table swung violently. A missed kick from George Ford and a converted kick for the French from Jules Plisson and suddenly the challenge looked all the more insurmountable for England again; and nigh on impossible once an unforced error had invited Sebastian Tillous-Borde to run in a try that knocked the stuffing not only out of England but an expectant, excited Twickenham crowd. England's Jonathan Joseph (centre) is tackled by France duo Maxime Mermoz (left) and Vincent Debaty . Captain Chris Robshaw bursts forward as England chase a big win to beat Ireland to the Six Nations title . Youngs caps a brilliant first-half performance with his second try of the match and England's third . A second French try, one Noa Nakaitaci so nearly contrived to mess up, compounded England's early misery. The French were running the ball like the France teams of yesteryear. Like the teams Saint-Andre once represented rather than coached. England would come back valiantly, running in tries with a frequency that have Twickenham daring to dream again. But Maxime Mermoz would score for France and so too would Vincent Debaty, the giant French prop exploiting an England team caught out by their own desperation to score big. With Vunipola's try came a renewed sense of optimism. England were eight points from glorious victory. But then came another French try, arriving so rapidly the BBC managed to award five points to both teams. In fairness to the host broadcaster, the confusion was understandable. Bonkers. Just bonkers.","England lost on the Six Nations title by just six points on Saturday .

"Stuart Lancaster hailed his England team as they fell agonisingly short of claiming their first Six Nations title in four years on an extraordinary, record-breaking day. After big wins by Wales and Ireland, England knew they needed to beat France by 26 points at Twickenham to win the Championship. They ran in seven tries in a brilliant display of attacking rugby to beat France 55-35 but paid the price for a leaky defence — and wasting six try opportunities last week against Scotland. Stuart Lancaster (centre left) praised his England side's courage but admitted he was 'gutted' to lose out . Lancaster looks dejected alongside his players at the end of the exciting RBS Six Nations match . Wales beat Italy 61-20 in Rome, but saw their efforts then dashed by Ireland's 40-10 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Stuart Hogg went over the line in the last few minutes but the try was disallowed — costing Lancaster's men the chance of a title. England scrum-half Ben Youngs, who scored two tries, said: 'I don't really know what to say. I am absolutely devastated. 'We really gave it a crack but for all the hard work we showed, you cannot let them back in the game and we are just gutted. We knew that the French would tire but we just gave ourselves too much to climb in the end.' Man-of-the-match Ben Youngs scored two tries for England but it wasn't enough to claim the title . England were defensively weak and made too many individual mistakes over the 80 minutes . Lancaster added: 'We are gutted. It was one of the most courageous performances I have seen from a team. 'But it is desperately disappointing not to get that try at the end. Their first two tries hurt us and to come back as we did before half-time and then to concede the first try of the second half — it will go down as one of the great games of rugby. 'To go down like we did and show the character to come back. It was an unbelievable game of rugby and it was desperately disappointing not to get that try at the end. 'Credit to Ireland for winning the championship, they beat us and congratulations to Joe (Schmidt) and all his team.'","England needed just six more points against France to win the Six Nations .

"Stoke City forward Jonathan Walters has sent out a warning to any players thinking of spitting at him, saying that culprits will be 'eating through a straw'. Manchester United's Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse of Newcastle United were involved in an incident that saw both appear to spit at each other on Wednesday night, and were both charged by the FA on Thursday. But if any other Barclays Premier League players are planning on spitting, they would be well advised to keep it away from Walters. Jonathan Walters warned anyone spitting at him would be 'drinking through a straw' after the recent incident . Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored Newcastle United striker on Wednesday . Papiss Cisse subsequently retaliates, and appears to aim spit of his own, back at the Manchester United man . 'As a player you take anything off the ball; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up,' Walters told talkSPORT. 'Little things like that go on in any match. 'But spitting is pretty low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he'd be eating his supper through a straw that night. 'I wouldn't be that happy. It's the lowest of the low.' Cisse apolgised for his actions and accepted his FA charge on Thursday, resulting in a seven-game ban - six for spitting and one extra after a violent conduct earlier in the season. Evans, meanwhile, denied he had spat at Cisse and has until 6pm on Friday to respond to the FA charge. If found guilty he will be banned for six games.

"Barcelona defender Gerard Pique took to Facebook to answer questions ranging from who his childhood idols were to the toughest opponents he has ever faced on the pitch. With his team leading La Liga and on the verge of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Manchester City, Pique took time away from training to interact with his fans. When asked who were the best defenders he has played alongside, the 28-year-old listed a pair of stalwarts from the two clubs he has signed for during his career: Carles Puyol at Barcelona and Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique opened up during a Facebook Q&A session with fans . The Spain international scores a rare goal during the 6-1 defeat of Rayo Vallecano on March 8 . Pique picked former Man United team-mate Rio Ferdinand as one of the best defenders he has played with . A young Pique listens as Ferdinand gives youngsters advice during their time together at Old Trafford . Pique arrived at Manchester United from Barcelona's La Masia academy as a teenager in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later when opportunities at Old Trafford became limited, primarily because of the established form of Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. The Spaniard, who has a child with pop songstress Shakira, bears a similar cultured style to Ferdinand in the mould of a tall defender with excellent technique who is comfortable on the ball. Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, Pique again chose one player from England and another from Spain when asked who have been his toughest opponents. Pique picked Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo (right) as one of the toughest players he's played against . Chelsea battering ram Didier Drogba (2nd left) was another opponent that has tested Pique to the limit . 'Cristiano Roanldo and Didier Drogba,' he answered in reference to his Real Madrid rival and and Chelsea's physically imposing centre-forward. Among other revelations from Pique's Q&A session are that Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman were his idols as a child while, unsurprisingly, Lionel Messi is 'definitely' the best player he has ever played with. Pique also admitted he misses the presence of Puyol and close friend Cesc Fabregas in the Nou Camp dressing room, saying:  'Yes, a loooooot! Who wouldn't?'

"The team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on Wednesday night. Stoke City beat Everton, to nobody’s great surprise, and look on course for their best Premier League finish yet – a year after their last. Mark Hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this. Manager of the Year? Quite possibly. Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games. His team registered 50 Premier League points in reaching ninth last term, two club records, but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher. Seven wins from 11 in the league have seen Stoke nudge past West Ham United and Swansea – both clubs with claims to good seasons. And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed £1.2million on bringing in new players this season: £800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and £400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica. Mame Biram Diouf, scorer against Everton to take his tally to seven Premier League goals? Free from Hannover. Jon Walters (centre) congratulates Mame Biram Diouf after he scored Stoke's second goal on Wednesday . Phil Bardsley, a regular at right-back with 22 Premier League games? Free from Sunderland. Steve Sidwell, who has been adept when called upon, also cost nothing after leaving Fulham. Victor Moses, whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the Britannia on Wednesday, is on loan from Chelsea. Philipp Wollscheid, who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect, is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer. By contrast Burnley, hardly the most lavish of spenders, have parted with around £8m on transfer fees. Michael Kightly was one of Sean Dyche’s purchases, at £1.5m, from Stoke. Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of £2m – so in all are around £2.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes’s association with the Catalan giants. The player’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes’s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis’s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was £2m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes’s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, £3m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent £6.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let’s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A £10m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes’s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year’ s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.","Stoke City beat Everton 2-0 to move up to eighth in the Premier League .

"Phil Jones says public criticism of Manchester United has fuelled the team's recent revival. United are now odds-on to qualify for the Champions League after they recorded back-to-back wins over Tottenham and Liverpool. Such a double would have seemed impossible just a few months ago. Manager Louis van Gaal came under fire after his team put in a number of underwhelming displays. Phil Jones (left) celebrates after United's 2-1 victory over top four rivals Liverpool on Sunday . Juan Mata (left) scored twice to put United in the driving seat for Champions League qualification . Some of the strongest criticism came from ex-United players like Gary Neville, who compared Van Gaal's side to a pub team and Paul Scholes, who labelled some of United's play 'prehistoric'. But with United now five points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool, their critics have fallen silent. 'People criticising does spur you on,' Jones said. 'You are always going to get critics. We are at a massive club here at Manchester United and if things aren't going as well as they should be then there is always going to be people wanting to have a dig and a pop at you. Jones admits that public criticism sparked United's impressive performances in recent weeks . United also defeated Tottenham in their previous Premier League game at Old Trafford . 'We have been well aware of the criticism we have had. We are professionals and we are in a job where people have an opinion about you and they are entitled to it and we just have to get on with it. 'People can assume and predict and it is up to us to prove them all wrong. That is what the lads enjoy doing. We enjoy proving them wrong. So far we have done that.' Jones has come in for criticism himself this season, but he and Chris Smalling performed well against a fierce Liverpool attack at Anfield and the two kept 29-goal striker Harry Kane quiet in the 3-0 win over Spurs. Jones and Smalling were identified as long-term replacements for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic at United. Jones and his United team-mates applaud supporters after their away win at Anfield . Jones and fellow defender Chris Smalling (centre) were once doubted as the future of England's defence . The pair were also touted as alternatives to the Ferdinand-John Terry partnership with England, but as Jones points out, they have not played together often as a centre-half pairing. 'It has been difficult for us,' said Jones, who has played alongside Smalling at centre-back for England just once. 'It had been documented that me and Chris were going to be the next centre-backs at United but it has not gone how we would have liked it. 'Somebody told me the other day that we have actually only played alongside each other about four times in four seasons. 'You cannot build a partnership on four games. 'Hopefully now we have had back-to-back games together we can keep it going and keep playing well together. We complement each other well.'","Manchester United moved five points clear of Liverpool in the race for a Champions League finish with victory at Anfield on Sunday .

"Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks . Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle . Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs . The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath . Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.'

"David Beckham has thrown his backing behind under-pressure Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti ahead of a crucial El Clasico against Barcelona, listing the Italian coach as one of the best bosses he has played under. Real go into Sunday's showdown a point behind their fierce rivals from Catalonia, and talk has even surfaced that Ancelotti could lose his job should they fall further behind in the title race. A difficult year for the European champions saw them surrender the title lead to Barcelona and then struggle to make it through to the Champions League quarter-finals with a tight win over Schalke. David Beckham has thrown his backing behind under-pressure Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti . The Real boss goes into Sunday's El Clasico a point behind Barcelona and his position has been questioned . But despite their struggles, former Real midfielder Beckham believes Ancelotti remains the right man for the job after leading Los Blancos to their 10th Champions League win just 10 months ago. 'Is he the right man for the job? For me he is,' Beckham told AS. 'Because he knows how to get respect out of the players, he knows how to get the best out of the players – and the players respect him, as does everybody in the football world. Beckham labelled Ancelotti as one of the best managers he has worked under after their time at PSG . Ancelotti and Beckham had previously paired up during the England midfielder's loan spell with AC Milan . 'I love Carlo, he's one of the best people I've ever spent time with, one of the best managers I've ever been managed by.

"I can’t wait to compete at the European Indoor Championships in Prague, which is the biggest competition of the season so far. For multi-eventers, packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal. I noticed it more last year when I just did long jump at the World Indoors and I only had to take one pair of trainers. With pentathlon I’ve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles, high jump, shot putt, long jump and 800m. All kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them. It was easy for this weekend because I’m not away for long so will pretty much live in my GB kit and a couple of pairs of jeans. Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson spoke about her preparations for the European Indoor Championships . The 22-year-old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year's indoor championships in Prague . Normally at Championships I room with Holly Bleasdale or Jodie Williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so I don’t know who I’ll be in a room with this time – you get the chance to pick but I just left the box empty. Sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas I’m always on first thing so it’s more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality. I’m just competing for the one day on Friday so I’ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that. As well as being supported by the National Lottery I am supported by the philanthropist Barrie Wells, who also sponsors Jenny Meadows so I’ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on Sunday. If I’m rooting for any athlete other than myself it’s going to be Jenny because she’s had such a tough past. She’s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event. I’m glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes. You dedicate your life to it and it’s so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there’s literally nothing you can do about it. It’s definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it’s going to be a clean sport. I’ve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season. The last time I did pentathlon was 2012 because I didn’t do an indoor season in 2013 and last year I was ill. I was a little kiddy in 2012 so I definitely should be getting one this time. The Liverpudlian is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season . I feel like a different person since I had a foot injury, which ruled me out of the Commonwealth Games and European Championships last year. I can’t really pinpoint what has changed I just enjoy being out there and I’m not nervous to compete any more. Sometimes before the injury I used to think: “I just want to be a normal teenager or young person” but I realised it was this that I love and enjoy. It made me realise what I will be missing out on. I’ve been focussing so much on the indoors that I haven’t had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events. I’m really looking forward to my next session with the British number one Goldie Sayers, who is helping me work on my technique, in April. Away from competition, there’s been a new addition to my household - I’ve got another sausage dog as a companion to Chorizo. I’ve called him Bronx. I wanted to call him Richmond to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and I was trying to push the sausage names too much! He’s well trained though, much better than Chorizo. I think it’s like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second! As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities.

"Jeremy Clarkson's replacement on Top Gear might not be too far away after Zenit St Petersburg manager Andre Villas-Boas showed he's enough of a petrolhead for the job. Former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss Villas-Boas posted a photograph of himself on Instagram behind the wheel of a 1958 MG A roadster on Thursday morning. Villas-Boas's love of motors is no secret. He first told of his passion when in charge of Chelsea, revealing he owned five bikes and shares 12 vintage cars. Andre Villas-Boas pictured behind the wheel of a 1958 MG A roadster on Thursday morning . 'It feels fantastic,' Villas-Boas said. 'You feel the need for it. Driving is very adrenaline-fuelled and it makes me feel good. We all have our passions and respond in different ways. 'It has been a lifelong passion. My first bike was a 350cc heavy engine. I took my licence and drove it in a national competition in Portugal – then I broke my arm so I was out. 'I was coaching Porto youth at the time. The first bike was a Yamaha XT 350, then I had Hondas then a couple of KTMs. I have a couple of them now.' Villas-Boas also hopes to one day take part in the Dakar Rally which is now held in South America. 'I have a couple of bikes from the Dakar Rally that I own,' he added. 'One is for my collection, the other I ride it. I am a bit of a ""crazy head"" so I have enduro-bikes as well. I go into mountains with the big rocks and almost kill myself. I have a couple of trials bikes and cars with different owners, because we have an extension collection and split ownership of them.' Villas-Boas' love of motors is no secret as the former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager collects them . Villas-Boas is currently the manager of Zenit St Petersburg who are in the Europa League quarter-finals . Villas-Boas could have done with going on a long drive following his team's 1-0 defeat by Torino in the second leg of their Europa League last-16 tie. Zenit still qualifed for the quarter-finals with a 2-1 win on aggregate, but Villas-Boas's touchline row with the Torino bench soured the match. 'I lost my head,' he told Sport Mediaset. 'I got it completely wrong and I apologise for my behaviour. I was angry with the Torino team manager, but it was not the behaviour of a coach and I am sorry.'","Andre Villas-Boas posted a photograph of himself on Instagram behind the wheel of a 1958 MG A roadster on Thursday morning .

"Lewis Hamilton bounced back from a troubled first practice ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix to lead the way at the end of the day. The reigning champion, who began the year in stunning fashion just under a fortnight ago in Australia by claiming pole, fastest lap and victory, hit problems after just four installation laps in FP1. Hamilton was ordered to pull his Mercedes off the Sepang International Circuit after complaining of 'a click in the rear' of the car.

Hamilton hitches a lift back to the paddock after his car stopped during first practice . Although Hamilton stated his gears worked and he could have returned his car to the pits, he was told by his race engineer that 'we have no telemetry so we didn't want to risk the engine. It's a race engine.' Hamilton's car was hoisted away from the scene and returned to the Mercedes garage, where his mechanics furiously worked on a fault with the power unit inlet system. Mercifully for Hamilton, with only four engines available to a driver over the course of the 19 grands prix, a complete engine change was not required. Hamilton did not return to the circuit until 38 minutes into FP2, at the end of a red-flag session as rookie Roberto Merhi had beached his Manor in the gravel.

Although the South Yorkshire-based team travelled to Melbourne after being rescued from administration weeks earlier, they failed to turn a wheel in anger due to numerous issues. But in what was effectively the team's first test session of the season, rookies Stevens and Merhi finally hit the track.

"Lionel Messi left  Pep Guardiola applauding in the Nou Camp stands, the football world entertained and James Milner on the turf on Wednesday night as he pulled off a stunning nutmeg on the unfortunate Manchester City midfielder. The Barcelona superstar made a habit of performing the skill during his side's 1-0 Champions League win, mesmerising both the 92,000 crowd and City players including Brazilian Fernandinho. After Messi's breathtaking display, Sportsmail traces the origins of nutmegging and counts down 10 of the best of all time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch nutmegs from Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and more . James Milner approaches Barcelona star Lionel Messi during their Champions League tie on Wednesday . Messi slips the ball through Manchester City midfielder Milner's legs at the Nou Camp . Milner slides as Messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their Champions League match . Milner is left on his backside as Messi runs away from the England international with the ball . What is a nutmeg? A nutmeg is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent's legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. Where does the word come from? The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: 'Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang 'nutmegs', meaning 'testicles'. In case Messi is ever interested.' However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic. Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon puts the ball through the legs of Tottenham's Christian Eriksen this season . Hispanic America - cano, tunel, ordenar, cocina . Other European/Latin and African countries - panna . Germany - tunnel, Beinschuss . France - petit pont . Finland - langet . Ukraine - 25 kopiyok - meaning 25 cents player owes . South Africa - iShibobo . Holland - poorten, panna . Nigeria - O-C - meaning 'oh see' Egypt - kobry . Malaysia and Singapore - ole . Kenya - 'chobo, chobwe . Japan - Matanuki . Iran - lauyee . Brazil - caneta, saia, rolinho . Poland - zalozyc . Hungary - koteny . Malawi - kalulu . Italy - tunnel . Indonesia - kolong . Ethiopia - lochie . Denmark, Sweden and Norway - tunnel . Zambia - pomo . Portugal - cueca, rata . Zimbabwe - deya . Tunisia - adma . Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged. The verb nutmegged is listed by the Oxford English Dictionary as 'arising in the 1870s which in Victorian slang came to mean ""to be tricked or deceived, especially in a manner which makes the victim look foolish"".' In Spanish a nutmeg is known as 'cano' or 'tunel', while many countries around the world have their own unique words to describe the skill. Sportsmail's top 10 nutmegs . 10. John O'Shea on Luis Figo, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2003 . That isn't written the wrong way. Honest. Manchester United's utility man gave the Portuguese superstar a taste of his own medicine with this silky piece of skill in a Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford almost 12 years ago. 9. Fernando Redondo on Henning Berg, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2000 . Another Champions League clash between United and Real, another stunning nutmeg. Three years before O'Shea's effort Redondo set up the visitors' winning goal for Raul with a sublime flick through the legs of Berg. 8. Lionel Messi on James Milner, Barcelona vs Manchester City, 2015 . Messi's brilliant piece of skill - one of many on Wednesday night - is only good enough for eighth place on our countdown. The fact Milner came rushing in counts against the Argentine, although leaving the England international on his backside earns him extra points. 7. Ronaldinho on Chievo, AC Milan vs Chievo, 2010 . Some Brazilian magic from Ronaldinho now, as he toys with a helpless Chievo player in Serie A. The former Barca man is renowned for his dribbling skills and they can be seen in full flow in the clip below, which includes an audacious backheel nutmeg. 6. Ryan Giggs on Jason Cundy, Tottenham vs Manchester United, 1992 . The first nutmeg on our countdown which ended with the architect scoring. Giggs pounces on a mistake by Dean Austin, pops the ball through Cundy's legs before rounding goalkeeper Ian Walker to score. Not bad for an 18-year-old. 5. Luis Suarez on Ryan Shotton, Stoke vs Liverpool, 2011 . Similar to Giggs' effort in that it ended with a goal, Suarez showed superb vision to knock the ball past Shotton and create some space for himself. His next touch wasn't bad either, bending his shot into the bottom corner of Thomas Sorensen's net to help Liverpool into the Carling Cup fifth round. 4. Lionel Messi on Emir Spahic, Sevilla vs Barcelona, 2012 . Wednesday night's game against City wasn't the first time Messi has caught the eye with a nutmeg. The little Argentine showed speed, composure and skill against Sevilla as he put the ball through Spahic's legs before delightfully chipping the ball into the back of the net. 3. Ricardo Kishna on Stefano Marzo, Ajax vs Heerenveen, 2014 . One of Ajax's bright young things, Kishna showed exactly why he's destined for a big future with this outrageous touch late last year. The 20-year-old's flicked nutmeg left Marzo stranded and Ajax on the attack. Perfection. 2. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Steven Davis, Northern Ireland vs Portugal, 2013 . A wonderful piece of skill from Ronaldo who first fools Davis with a Cruyff turn before popping the ball in between the Southampton man's legs. The Portuguese also gets a whack but the referee plays advantage as he retains possession with a neat backheel to a team-mate. 1. Juan Roman Riquelme on Mario Yepes, Boca Juniors vs River Plate, 2000 . One of the most talented players of his generation, Riquelme was no stranger to moments of magic on the pitch. Even in a heated Copa Libertadores quarter-final he was cool enough to beat Yepes with a brilliant rolled nutmeg. Class. PS . Touted as the new Neymar, Brazilian youngster Kenedy definitely has the skills to rival his compatriot. The Fluminense forward pulled off this stunning elastico nutmeg against Argentina Under 20s last month, bamboozling his opponent with his quick feet. No wonder Premier League clubs are keeping an eye on him...","Lionel Messi showed off his skills in Barcelona's victory on Wednesday .

"The sons of Robin van Persie, Phil Neville and Darren Fletcher could be the Manchester City stars of the future. Because the trio, whose father's made their name at United, have now spent over a year taking part in training sessions at the academy of their cross-town rivals. It is not known why the talented group have been pointed in City's direction, although Shaqueel van Persie, eight, has also been training with United. Manchester United striker Robin van Persie's son could be a future star of local rivals Manchester City . The sons of Darren Fletcher and Phil Neville, who made their names at United, are also training with City . The Premier League champions, however, have recently moved to their new £200m City Football Academy and offer a clear pathway to the first team. City's philosophy is to see that each age group adopts a similar system to that used by the first team in a bid to ensure that, should youngsters be good enough, they can easily adjust to senior level. United, however, are well-stocked with talent at youth levels and many find it difficult to make the grade. Premier League champions Man City have recently moved to their new £200m City Football Academy . Van Persie Jnr, eight, has already showcased his talents to a wider audience. In January, he starred alongside his dad in an advertising campaign for BT Sport. The youngster is taught a number of freestyle tricks on the streets of Manchester by his old man before the pair take part in a two-vs-two game with a couple of unsuspecting locals. Showing finishing skills his dad, who cost United £24m, would be proud of, Shaqueel scores the winning goal before the father and son team head home. A proud Van Persie said last year: 'He plays for his local team with his friends and he got scouted and now he is playing for both Manchester United and Manchester City. 'In about a year or so he will have to make his mind up. Van Persie Jnr starred alongside his dad in an advertising campaign for BT Sport at the start of the year .

"Raheem Sterling and Liverpool remain 'miles apart' over a new contract, Sportsmail understands. The in-demand England star, 20, rejected what Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers called an 'incredible' offer, reportedly worth £100,000 week at Anfield. And Rodgers admitted earlier this month that no agreement would be reached before the end of the season. The in-demand Raheem Sterling and Liverpool remain 'miles apart' over a new deal, Sportsmail understands . Liverpool forward Sterling pictured training with England this week ahead of their international fixtures . Now, a source close to the negotiations revealed that the club and the player's representative remain 'miles apart' as they seek to agree a new, long-term deal. Sterling, who is expected to play for the Three Lions in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday night, currently has a contract which runs until 2017. But that is thought to be worth a relatively modest £35,000-a-week - way short of what some of the Premier League's top earners pick up. Rodgers remains confident that the issue will be resolved and that Sterling, plucked from QPR's academy in 2010, will stay at Liverpool. However, the pacy, Jamaica-born forward has a number of suitors at home and abroad with the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich monitoring the situation. The 20-year-old rejected what Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers called an 'incredible' offer previously . Sterling sees Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea save his effort during their match at Anfield . Rodgers admitted earlier this month that no agreement would be reached before the end of the season . A fee of £50m has been mentioned and Manchester City are also thought to be keen as they look to inject youth into an ageing squad but are wary of being used as a bargaining chip. The source added: 'There is a lot of talk of how staying at Liverpool would be best for Raheem's development, but the kid is a full international who plays for his club in the Premier League every week. It's only right that he explores his options.' Sterling, who has been struggling with a toe injury, is expected to miss England's friendly in Italy on Tuesday after being granted leave following the Lithuania match by Roy Hodgson.","Sportsmail understands the two parties are 'miles apart' from a new deal .

"Lewis Hamilton had to abandon plans to wear a one-off helmet for this week's Malaysian Grand Prix. Regulations for the new season state that a driver must stick to the same helmet design for the entirety of the campaign. Hamilton brought a different lid to the second installment of this year's championship in Sepang, but despite showing it off at the back of the Mercedes garage, opted against wearing it. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton will not be allowed to wear a novelty helmet for the Malaysian Grand Prix . Mercedes' Hamilton in action during the practice section at the Sepang International Circuit on Friday . Hamilton, who overcame engine problems in the morning session to end the day top of the timesheets, said: 'I had a special helmet made this weekend to celebrate Petronas and Malaysia as I love this race, but due to the FIA's new rule of not allowing drivers to change their helmet designs, I cannot wear it.' The FIA installed the new regulation for drivers to be easily identified by the sport's fans and track-side spectators. The controversial ruling was however, branded a 'joke' by four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel who has sported various different helmet designs throughout his career. Meanwhile, Mercedes have paid tribute to the victims of this week's devastating plane crash.

"How France manager Didier Deschamps must wish he had this group of legends to call upon in his quest for Euro 2016 glory. Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira all took to the Stade de France turf before France's defeat to Brazil on Thursday night to celebrate their position as national centurions. Together, they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by Les Bleus, with Deschamps another and all-time leader Lilian Thuram making up the list.

Zidane is next up with 108, then Vieira on 107 and finally current boss Deschamps on 103. And of the six, four started the 1998 World Cup final on the same Paris pitch where they became champions, while Vieira came off the bench during the 3-0 triumph and Henry was an unused substitute - although he was France's top scorer in the tournament with three goals. All six of them also started the final as France beat Italy 2-1 in extra-time to win Euro 2000.

Chelsea's Oscar levelled the game later in the half, before Neymar and Luiz Gustavo struck after the interval. It was a frustrating result for Deschamps, who kept his job despite seeing France crash out at the quarter-final stage to eventual champions Germany during last summer's World Cup. And with Euro 2016 set to be played on home turf, there will be precious few games for him to prepare for an assault at glory, with friendlies against Belgium and Albania in June before a trip to Wembley to face England in November.

"Religious protests have been planned in opposition to Northern Ireland's first ever home Sunday fixture against Finland. The national side have played overseas on a Sunday in the past, most recently in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Hungary, but this weekend will break new ground in Belfast. The Irish Football Association has been careful in the past not to arrange Sunday fixtures, and once had an article of association enshrining such a policy, but was powerless to act once UEFA introduced its 'week of football' blueprint for the current qualifying campaign. But that cuts no ice with critics, some of whom have called on the IFA to boycott the fixture. A general view of Windsor Park during a World Cup qualifier between Northern Ireland and Slovakia in 2009 . The Free Presbyterian Church is planning to hold a service at its Tyndale Memorial church, located just a few hundred yards from Windsor Park, 75 minutes before the 5pm kick-off. The Evangelical Protestant Society, meanwhile, has issued a statement expressing its dismay at events. 'This will be the first time an international football match has been held in Belfast on a Sunday, and it marks another watershed moment in modern Ulster's increasing rejection of the Lord's Day,' it read. 'Far too many sporting and social events are now organised on Sundays with, it seems, scant regard for the rights of evangelicals who, because of their faith, are unable to be involved. Many evangelical Protestants are ardent fans of the national team and would dearly love to be present at the match. 'We fully accept that we are out of step with the majority of public opinion on this matter, and we suspect that many who claim to be Protestants will be present at Windsor Park on Sunday.' Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill, speaking earlier this week to the Belfast Telegraph, said: 'We appreciate and understand people's religious beliefs - but the game must be played on Sunday, as that date was decreed when the fixture was made by UEFA. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill gestures on the touchline at Hampden Park on Wednesday evening . 'We hope for a victory on the night, and for the usual wonderful support from all Northern Ireland fans.' There was a conciliatory message from Gary McAllister, chairman of the Amalgamation of Northern Ireland Supporters' Clubs. McAllister told Press Association Sport: 'We understand there will be a protest near the stadium and that is their right. I imagine it will be very peaceful and they are fully entitled to do that. 'But this is not an IFA decision and I don't think suggestions that the game is forfeited are realistic at all. 'It is clearly a matter of choice. Some fans have made the decision not to attend for sincerely held beliefs and no doubt they are passionate as any other fans. 'I fully respect those who oppose it but it must be, and it will be, played.'","Northern Ireland take on Finland in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday .

"UFC's undefeated Bantamweight Champion 'Rowdy' Ronda Rousey has dismissed claims that mixed martial arts is too dangerous a sport or that it degrades women. The 28-year-old told Good Morning America, 'There are so many ridiculous arguments that MMA is somehow anti-woman. Fighting's not a man's thing, it's a human thing. To say it's anti-woman, is I think, an anti-feminist statement. In the UFC, I mean, I'm the biggest draw in the sport and I'm a woman!' Rousey, who won a bronze medal for Judo at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, also feels that MMA is unfairly stigmatized. UFC's Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey gives an impassioned interview on Good Morning America . The 28-year-old fighter believes that MMA is an unfairly stigmatized sport that does plenty to help women . She said, 'I'm a two-time Olympian, Olympic medalist, and when I was doing judo, the exact same things I really apply in MMA, I was celebrated as an American hero. Somehow, when I do it for money, I'm a barbarian?' Rousey also commented on how MMA has helped to improve the way women are treated in popular culture. In terms of UFC directly working towards that end, Rousey explained, 'Just this last weekend, women were introduced walking to the Octagon not as women's bantamweights, they were just bantamweights. They were just introduced as fighters, and that's it. It's the first sport in the world to do that.' Rousey has recently signed a new long-term contract with UFC.

He was joined by fellow Poland international, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski as the pair enjoyed some downtime ahead of the European Championship qualifying game against the Republic of Ireland on Sunday. Lewandowski threw the golf ball up in the air before Szczesny pulled off a perfectly timed strike to send it flying.

Lewandowski had been the one to throw the ball in the air before Szczesny pulled off the amazing shot . The pair are currently on international duty with Poland ahead of Sunday's Euro qualifier against Ireland . Szczesny has not played for Arsenal in the Premier League since a disappointing performance in the defeat by Southampton on New Year's Day, after which he was caught smoking in the showers. He has made three appearances for the Gunners in the FA Cup victories over Brighton, Middlesbrough and Manchester United, but it is widely suspected that manager Arsene Wenger now considers David Ospina to the club's first-choice stopper. And former Poland goalkeeper Jerzey Dudek believes that Szczesny should look for a new club at the end of the season if he is to continue his international career. Dudkek told TVP Sport, 'If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as (Swansea City's Polish 'keeper) Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.'

"Deco is part of an elite group of players to have won the Champions League twice - with Jose Mourinho's Porto in 2004 and with Barcelona in 2006. The Portuguese also played in Europe's elite club competition with Chelsea, playing a total of 103 matches in Europe and scoring 19 goals.

Manuel Neuer makes a penalty save from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2012 Champions League semi-final . Defenders . Carles Puyol . Was such a leader for Barcelona. That is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender, but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field. Barcelona legend Carles Puyol lifts the European Cup after their win over Man United in the 2009 final . John Terry .

John Terry lifts the famous trophy after Chelsea's win over Bayern Munich in 2012 . Ricardo Carvalho . One of my best moments is winning the Champions League with him, then it was great to play with him again all those years later at Chelsea. Without doubt he is the classiest defender I have ever played with. Ricardo Carvalho carries Pedro Mendes after Porto's triumph in the 2004 Champions League final . Midfield . Diego Simeone . Diego Simeone was a really tough competitor; he would always let you know he was there. He wasn’t just tough though, he had a really excellent range of passing. Diego Simeone guided Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last season . Paul Scholes . It is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of Paul Scholes. Of course he is one of the best midfield players of my Champions League, but also I think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game. Paul Scholes won the European Cup for the second time when Man United beat Chelsea in 2008 . Xavi . At the peak of Barcelona he was at the centre of everything that was good about Barcelona. Maybe the other players got more headlines, but Xavi was the catalyst for it all. Xavi takes on Manchester United's Ryan Giggs during the 2011 final at Wembley . Zinedine Zidane .

"Really, the only surprise was that it took him three touches. Harry Kane had already chested one down in midfield and rolled a pass to fellow substitute Ross Barkley. But his third touch? Well, that was headed into the net. That’s more like it, Harry. So much for the cries for patience. Here was goal No 30 of the season for a young man who simply cannot stop scoring. Twenty nine for his club and now one for his country at senior level. Raheem Sterling clipped an inviting ball up to the back post, where Kane’s instinct had taken him. There was just a thin slice of goal to aim for, but he was never missing. Giedrius Arlauskis, unaware of the script, attempted to recover, flinging himself across his goal-line but Lithuania’s goalkeeper could only help it into the net.

Booked: Zaliukas, Kazlauskas . Referee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic) 6 . Attendance: 83,671 . Ratings by Rob Draper . Somehow, it all seemed preordained, as if you could have tied up Kane’s bootlaces, blindfolded him, sat him on a chair in the centre of the penalty area and he would still have scored somehow. The 21-year-old Tottenham striker, who has been on fire in the Barclays Premier League, was off and running in international football 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney. Who needs time to adjust? This was the third-fastest goal by an England debutant and the quickest since Bill Nicholson in 1951. Quite understandably, Kane could barely control his delight, pushing the referee aside as he sprinted into to a jubilant knee-slide by the corner flag while the Wembley crowd leapt to hail their newest hero. All this was quite surreal. No wonder he described it as ‘just a blur’. The fourth goal of an easy win against a team ranked 94th in the world in the midst of a humdrum campaign has no right to command such excitement but it is impossible not to be swept along by this incredible story. Until then it had all been about Rooney’s steady pursuit of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goal record and Danny Welbeck’s wonderful display of attacking verve, which rightly earned him the man-of-the-match vote. Rooney needed less than six minutes to score the opener and might have had more on a night when he hit the woodwork twice in the first half. England’s second was probably an own goal but was claimed by Welbeck, who deserved it in a way for a display which justified Hodgson’s decision to select him and leave Kane on the bench for three-quarters of the game. Sterling converted the third — his first international goal — timing his run to perfection and tucking away Rooney’s cross from the right. It meant England had secured their fifth successive win in Group E long before Kane came on to thrill Wembley. Hodgson will reflect on the game with satisfaction. His team are six points clear with one foot already across the Channel at Euro 2016, and promising young players like Kane are forcing their way into contention. Kane comes on for Rooney for his first England cap and the Spurs striker made a dramatic introduction to international football . Sterling wheels away after giving England a three-goal cushion on a comfortable night for the runaway Group E leaders . Rooney is all smiles after Welbeck made it 2-0 just before the half-time whistle . Kane and Gary Cahill greet each other following the final whistle with England maintaining a six-point cushion at the top of Group E . The manager will also have been content with his team’s balance and shape, which flexed from a 4-1-4-1 into a classic 4-3-3 when England had the ball. Michael Carrick sat in front of the centre halves and supplied a trio of mobile strikers, while Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph covered the midfield miles. It will be different in a tougher game when Carrick is expected to shield his back four, but here is the perennial problem. England need one method to qualify — breaking down teams who surrender possession and offer no ambition — and an entirely different one when they reach the finals and come up against more clinical and potent opposition. Lithuania started nervously at Wembley and Hodgson’s team were smart enough to take advantage. Rooney hit the inside of a post having been released by Delph, before scoring his 47th England goal with a simple header after Arlauskis had pushed a fine effort from Welbeck into the air. England’s captain hit the other post midway through the first half. Again, Welbeck created it, this time by driving to the by-line and picking out Rooney at the far post. His header was firmly sent back from whence it came, as in the textbooks, and Wembley held its breath as it looped through the air and hit the frame of the goal. Fabian Delph was denied a first goal in an England shirt as his crisp volley was repelled by an excellent reflex save from Arlauskis . Roy Hodgson will be a very happy man after another convincing win with four different scorers and another clean sheet . Sterling and Vytautas Andriuskevicius collided in what looked like a 50/50 challenge and the England man was unfortunate to be booked . Nathaniel Clyne clears the ball upfield despite pressure from Saulius Mikoliunas as England launch another attack . As England began to wonder if they would extend their lead, they enjoyed a little luck by way of a scruffy second. Henderson worked a short corner with Leighton Baines and delivered an inswinging cross towards Welbeck, who stooped and skewed a glancing header off his shoulder which was deflected into the net from the right thigh of Lithuania captain Tadas Kijanskas. It was swiftly declared as Welbeck’s goal, and the Arsenal striker seemed happy to claim it. Arlauskis reacted well to keep out Delph’s volley after the break and Welbeck deserved a penalty as England dominated. Sterling, who grew into the game and was far more influential as Lithuania tired, celebrated his first international goal by tucking in a cross from Rooney via the near post. And then Kane appeared to a raucous reception. This crowd believed the hype. They had cheered through his warm-up routine and they demanded a goal as he sprinted on. No sweat. He promptly delivered. It wasn’t an easy finish. But it was never really in doubt, was it? On the bench, Rooney stood to applaud and like everyone else present, he could not help but smile and shake his head. Rooney makes a nuisance of himself in the Lithuania box, stealing the ball off the toe of Marius Zaliukas in a typical act of doggedness . Tomas Mikuckis clears the ball in an acrobatic fashion as Lithuania repel wave after wave of England pressure .

"David Warner and Aaron Finch will have the chance to impose themselves on New Zealand as Australia bid for a fifth World Cup final victory - and the two openers are hoping they have saved their best for last. Warner and Finch's destructive partnership has only intermittently fired over the past six weeks as Australia have nonetheless booked their place in Sunday's MCG final against their fellow tournament co-hosts. Victorian Finch, who will have home comforts on the famously huge playing area, made only his second half-century of the campaign in Australia's semi-final win over India in Sydney. David Warner thank the crowd after winning the semi final against India . But it was at the MCG where he smashed hapless England for 135 on Valentine's Day, and he returns in good heart after his hard-earned 81 against the defending champions on Thursday. 'It wasn't my most fluid innings but it was nice to get through that,' he said. 'I was under the pump - I hadn't scored any runs for a while. 'I felt like I was playing really well. It's just one of those things - it didn't translate into a hell of a lot of runs lately. 'But I hope I'm past that and there's some more runs to come.' Warner has had one feast - a career-best 178 against Afghanistan in Perth - and, by his standards, some famine in the World Cup so far. Aaron Finch will hope to make an impact for Australia in the World Cup final . Like Finch, playing in the tournament for the first time, he told Australia's Sky Sports Radio: 'It's just those easy 'outs' that are causing a bit of a stir in my mind.' Warner was caught from a leading edge into the ring field against India, and added: 'It's not great to have big edges (on your bat) sometimes. 'But every time I've come in I've looked a million dollars, I've hit every ball in the middle and I've just got to find a way to get past that (first) 10 overs, be clinical and bat deep.' The Kiwis need to get their minds right too, of course, to upset the odds. They are being portrayed as outsiders but remain the only unbeaten team in the tournament and scored a narrow victory over Australia in an epic, low-scoring group match in Auckland at the end of last month. Mitchell Johnson celebrates taking the wicket of India's Rohit Sharma on their way to the World Cup final . Australia celebrate their win over India in the World Cup Semi-Final . Much has been made of Australia's home advantage for the rematch, but New Zealand insist they are not fazed. Seamer Matt Henry was not supposed to be involved at all until injury intervened for Adam Milne. Henry was brought into the squad as a replacement and acquitted himself well for economical figures in Tuesday's semi-final win over South Africa. He said: 'This is definitely something I will never forget. 'As a kid, you grow up pretending to be these [cricket] heroes, like playing with my brother out the back and going through scenarios like running in to bowl at a World Cup final. 'You have to pinch yourself. 'I've been presented with an opportunity which I'm very grateful for and excited about.' Fellow seamer Tim Southee will take the new ball alongside Trent Boult, and is confident - whatever the conditions. 'We're not too worried about the size of the ground,' said Southee. 'It's a dream come true for all the guys. As a kid growing up, you either want to be an All Black or a Black Cap. 'This is as good as it gets, taking on Australia in Australia on one of the best cricket grounds in the world.' Swing is the forte for Southee and Boult, but attuning to the sell-out atmosphere will be the starting point. 'There's going to be a lot of people. It's going to be loud,' said Southee. 'There will be close to 100,000 people screaming. 'It will be interesting to see what it's like here.' Brendon McCullum's visitors, like Michael Clarke's hosts, appear set to name an unchanged team with veteran left-arm orthodox Daniel Vettori expected to be fit after all.","Australia are bidding to win their fifth World Cup final on Sunday .

"Montenegro and Russia's Euro 2016 qualifier was abandoned midway through the second half on Friday after two outbreaks of crowd trouble and a scuffle between the players. The game was first delayed by 33 minutes when Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was hit on the head by a flare thrown from the Montenegro section of the ground soon after kickoff. Midway through the second half a scuffle ensued between players near the touchline, with Eastern Europe's Sport Klub television reporting that a missile hurled from the terraces appeared to have hit another Russian player.

With the score at 0-0 in the Group G game, German referee Deniz Aytekin ordered the players back into the dressing room for the second time moments after Montenegro keeper Vukasin Poleksic saved a Roman Shirokov penalty. Montenegro and Russia supporters clashed at halftime, forcing riot police to move in to separate them. Montenegrin daily Vijesti reported on its website. It said there were talks during the break about whether to carry on with the game because of the intensity of the fighting with the start of the second half delayed by 18 minutes. UEFA said it would wait to receive reports from the match delegate and referee before opening disciplinary proceedings.

Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, leading to a 30 minute suspension of the game . Fans holding flares cut intimidating figures from the roof of the stadium in Podgorica . Montenegro coach Branko Brnovic said his players were distraught and apologised to their stunned Russian visitors. 'I apologise to the Russian players and staff for everything that's happened. It is no surprise that the game was abandoned after the second incident,' he told Montenegrin state television broadcaster RTCG. 'My players are completely distraught, all of them are at a loss for words and I also don't know what to say after all this. 'We now don't stand a chance (of qualifying) and also face a lengthy crowd ban,' he added, with Russia and Montenegro level on five points from four games behind group leaders Austria, who have 13 from five, and Sweden on nine from five. 'Fortunately, our FA president Dejan Savicevic has a very good reputation with UEFA, while we have to make sure we get back on the rails,' Brnovic added.

It was the third serious outbreak of violence involving teams from the former Yugoslavia in Euro 2016 qualifying. The Group I match between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade was abandoned in October after a flag of so-called greater Albania was flown over the terraces by a remote-controlled drone. It triggered a brawl between rival players and a pitch invasion by home Serbia fans, who attacked Albanian players and forced them to run for cover into the tunnel. Akinfeev was taken to hospital with a neck injury and burns, although UEFA doctor hopes he will be 'fine' In November, visiting Croatian fans littered the pitch with flares during their 1-1 Group H draw against Italy in Milan, forcing a 10-minute delay in the second half. On Friday, the stadium announcer warned spectators the game in Podgorica would be abandoned if there was any more crowd trouble after Akinfeev was wheeled off on a stretcher and taken to hospital before Russia began to dominate the game.

"John Hartson was reunited with Eyal Berkovic in Israel on Friday, 17 years after booting his former West Ham team-mate in the head. The former Hammers striker kicked Berkovic full in the face  after the Israeli midfielder struck him on the leg during a training ground incident caught on camera back in 1998.

Former Wales international Hartson, who also played for Arsenal, Wimbledon, Coventry and Celtic during a 15-year playing career, is understood to have been giving an interview to an Israeli journalist when Berkovic approached wearing sunglasses. He is said to have asked his one-time team-mate: 'Recognise me?', before the pair shared words and posed for the picture. Speaking to Sportsmail in 2010 about the about the incident, Hartson said: 'The Eyal Berkovic incident really blighted my career. It's something I deeply regret.

"A bizarre headed goal from Zlatan Ibrahimovic put Sweden on the road to a 2-0 victory over Moldova in their Euro 2016 Group G qualifier in Chisinau on Friday, with the striker also netting a late penalty. Sweden's captain gave his side the lead immediately after half-time when Moldova goalkeeper Ilie Cebanu's attempt to deal with a back pass failed to clear the frontman.

"The perfect end to a rewarding week. England’s five-day stay in the Czech Republic finished with a win that enhanced their credentials for summer success. England went Olomouc on Monday to familiarise themselves with the place they will call home and Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate was thrilled with how the experiment went. He was even happier, then, after Tom Carroll’s goal in Prague chiselled out victory for a much-changed side. Having flattened inferior opponents in qualifying for Euro 2015, Southgate was keen to see how his squad will fare against better nations and so far, it has gone how he wanted. Portugal – who will be opponents in Group B – were beaten in November and now the hosts have gone the same way. Tom Carroll celebrates his goal during the international match between Czech Republic U21 and England U21 . Though this performance against the host nation was not the flashiest but it had showed qualities that England will need if they are to go all the way. More than anything, it proved there is strength a depth beneath the core. ‘I thought we did some very good things,’ Southgate noted. ‘There were also plenty of things we can improve on. The Czechs are a good side and they put us under pressure but we still wanted to play the same way. It was a good test.’ There were four debutants in this experimental line-up, most notably Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, and for periods in the first half England lacked the cohesion of a team that has played regularly together. As an attacking force, they offered little. The England Under 21 squad celebrate as they take the lead against Czech Republic on Friday night . One thing, though, that was not in question was their fight to keep the Czechs at bay. Nobody embodied the spirit more than Carroll – whom Southgate called a 'super footballer' – who was well placed in the 29th minute to kick a header from Watford striker Matej Vydra off the line. Southgate anticipated this being a game when England would have a lot of the ball and be on the front foot but the opposite was true; the physically strong Czechs kept pushing England further and further back and the visitors’ passing was not sharp as it can be at their most fluent. It was clear from looking at Southgate’s demeanour he was not happy with what he was seeing. He strode purposely down the tunnel at the interval and whatever he said worked as England re-emerged purpose. England U21 ace Alex Pritchard skips over Czech Republic star Tom Kalas during the game at Letna Stadium . They were immediately aggressive and within three minutes, they had taken the lead. Chambers surged forward and zipped in a cross that Tomas Kalas – the Chelsea defender on loan at Middlesbrough – failed to clear and Carroll took advantage, sweeping in from eight yards. Here was another indication of his tenacity: he took a heavy blow to the ankle when scoring his first international goal since August 2013 and hobbled away as his team-mates raced over to him; the Swansea midfielder managed just another five minutes before his night ended. ‘We think he will be ok for Monday,’ said Southgate. ‘He just caught his ankle a bit. But he produced a real captain’s performance. He is at a club that really suits the way he plays and is developing physically. There is no reason why he can’t score more goals.’ Cauley Woodrow looks to beat Czech Republic U21 ace Matej Hanousek at Letna Stadium in Prague . His replacement, Derby’s Will Hughes, almost made an immediate impression when skipping past a number of challenges to set up Pritchard but, somehow, a posse of Red shirts managed to smuggle the ball away from danger. With the bit between their teeth, England looked for a second but ultimately, they could not find a way through and in the final 20 minutes they were penned back. That they came through it was thanks to an outstanding cameo from Everton defender John Stones. So another test has been passed and now Germany await on Monday. Negotiate that and England really will start to dream. ‘This was a game we needed with small margins,’ said Southgate. ‘We enjoyed qualifying but we are playing real football now.’ Gareth Southgate described England's win as 'real football' following their narrow victory on Friday night .","Tom Carroll secured victory for a much-changed England U21 side .

"Just a few months ago, Francis Coquelin was on the verge of being allowed to leave Arsenal, having made little more than a fringe impact on the club's first team. A loan at Championship side Charlton saw him play five games in the second tier this November and December, before Arsene Wenger recalled him following an injury to club captain Mikel Arteta. Coquelin was expected to be cover for Mathieu Flamini, and his first three games saw him play a total of 13 minutes, coming off the bench late in the game on all three occasions. Francis Coquelin has become a key member of the Arsenal first team after almost being allowed to leave . Statistically the Frenchman is the leading defensive player in the Premier League since his return to Arsenal . Coquelin's stint in the first team has earned him a new long-term contract with the Gunners . But an injury to Flamini has handed the 23-year-old Frenchman his chance, and Coquelin has emerged as a real talent, and a crucial part of Arsenal's recent good form. In fact, based on statistics alone, Coquelin is unquestionably the best defensive player in the Premier League since he returned to the club. Since his first start, in Arsenal's 2-1 win over West Ham on December 28, the holding midfielder has shown terrific reading of the game and positional sense, making more successful interceptions than any other Premier League player. Coquelin has also brought a degree of steel to the famously lightweight Arsenal midfield, topping the charts for Duels won. Arsene Wenger admitted he had expected to release Coquelin at the end of the season . Coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he's injured . Coquelin almost went on loan to QPR at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on . In fact, the French midfielder has dominated the Premier League in personal battles, his 97 duels won an astonishing 21 more than any other player. When it comes to tackling the Gunners' academy product is only second in the list, four behind Manchester City full back Pablo Zabaleta, but he is still comfortably ahead of the next best midfielder, Brazilian Fernandinho. As a result, Arsenal have lost just twice in the league since the turn of the year, and have climbed to third in the Premier League table, leaving some fans to ask whether Coquelin is the player the Gunners have been missing since the departure of Gilberto Silva. Certainly he is not yet the finished article, as shown in an unconvincing display against Monaco in the Champions League. The Frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot Mathieu Flamini in the pecking order . Arsenal have been linked with Christoph Kramer (left) and Lars Bender but might feel Coquelin is enough . Coquelin played five games on loan at Charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular . But Wenger, so long linked with a string of defensive midfielders - the most recent lists including Lars Bender, Christoph Kramer ad Morgan Schneiderlin - seems to think that Coquelin has a future at the club, offering him a new long-term contract last month. Whether he holds onto his place when Arteta returns, or can hold off competition from those potential summer signings, remains to be seen. But what is certain is that Arsenal have, statistically at least, found themselves the Premier League's leading defensive player on current form.","Since coming back from loan, Francis Coquelin tops defensive statistics .

"Brazil talisman Neymar and his national team-mates have jetted off to London having beaten France in Paris. The Barcelona forward scored a second-half strike to help Brazil defeat Didier Deschamps side 3-1 at the Stade de France in an international friendly on Thursday and now take on South American rivals Chile at Arsenal's Emirates stadium on Sunday. Neymar took to social media to update fans as he posted a picture sat next to Robinho on the plane over to London.

Following the French victory, Neymar posted a picture with former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry on his Instagram account hailing: 'This is one of the best in football history!!! THIERRY HENRY.' Henry picked up 123 caps for France during his illustrious career and Neymar appears to be heading in the same direction with Brazil. The former Arsenal star attended the match with former team-mates Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira  to celebrate their position as national centurions. Together, they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by Les Bleus, with Didier Deschamps another and all-time leader Lilian Thuram making up the list.

"Slovakia's impressive Euro 2016 qualifying campaign continued after three first-half goals secured a 3-0 victory over Luxembourg on Friday and kept them top of Group C with maximum points after five games. Adam Nemec volleyed Slovakia in front on 10 minutes when he pounced on the rebound after Jan Durica's free-kick hit the crossbar and winger Vladimir Weiss added a second midway through the first half. Slovakia continued to carve Luxembourg open at will and defender Peter Pekarik scored the hosts' third just before the break when he burst into the box and placed the ball past Jonathan Joubert.

Slovakia, who beat holders Spain in October, are on 15 points, three ahead of the European champions and six more than third-placed Ukraine. David Alaba atoned for a penalty miss with a superb long-range second-half strike as Austria stayed on course for Euro 2016 with a comfortable 5-0 win away to Liechtenstein on Friday. Martin Harnik and Marc Janko set the Group G leaders on their way with two goals in the first 16 minutes, quickly burying the hosts' hopes of repeating their shock 1-0 win over Moldova in their last match. Austria's David Alaba fails to score a penalty against Liechtenstein but made up for his miss with a goal . Alaba, Zlatko Junuzovic and Marko Arnautovic completed the win in the second half. Mario Frick captained Liechtenstein at the 40 as he made his 118th appearance but never looked like adding to his record total of 16 goals.

The visitors were awarded a penalty just after the half hour when Jehle fumbled the ball then clattered into Junuzovic as he tried to reclaim it, but Alaba spared the keeper's blushes by sending a poor effort wide of the target. The Bayern Munich midfielder made up for the miss when he collected a pass in midfield, side-stepped his marker and fired a dipping shot past Jehle from 25 metres just before the hour. Marcel Sabitzer headed into the path of Junuzovic for the fourth in the 74th minute and Arnautovic rifled home the fifth in stoppage time to complete Austria's fourth consecutive win in the group.

"Warm applause fluttered around Wembley as Harry Kane slowly jogged up the touchline in the first half, but on the pitch Danny Welbeck was putting in a performance to indicate he is in no mood to step aside anytime soon. Roy Hodgson’s selection of Welbeck ahead of the in-form Kane in England Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania divided opinion across the nation ahead of kick-off. Should he have started the hot-shot Spurs striker, joint-top in the Premier League with Diego Costa on 19 and with 29 in all competitions? Or Welbeck who has been performing well for the national team but in-and-out of Arsenal’s starting line-up, struggling to eight goals in 34? Danny Welbeck leads the celebrations after putting England 2-0 ahead against Lithuania on Friday . Welbeck's header deflects into the back of the net to send England into a commanding lead . Welbeck is congratulated by England captain Wayne Rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign . Former England striker Ian Wright thought the former. ‘Gutted that Harry Kane's not starting,’ he said before kick-off, ‘29 goals, form of his life.’ But within six minutes, the Arsenal man had justified the choice with a huge hand in the opener. Welbeck started on the left, but was to the right of goal when he nutmegged Lithuania’s Tadas Kijanskas with some nifty footwork and fired a shot across goal, which keeper Giedrius Arlauskis could only parry into the path of Wayne Rooney to head in. He almost set up a second on 19 minutes, again getting to the byline on the right before crossing deep to Rooney, who looped a header back across goal and on to the post. Welbeck was bright and alive around the box and got the goal his first-half performance deserved just before the break. Jordan Henderson crossed from the left and he diverted it in off a shoulder via a deflection. They all count. Welbeck caused the Lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection . Welbeck is congratulated by former Manchester united team-mate Wayne Rooney after doubling the lead . Kane may be the latest boy wonder, yet Welbeck is the top-scorer in this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. His goal moved him to six for the tournament, clear of Israel’s Omar Damari on five. Doubles against Slovenia and Switzerland, a goal versus San Marino and another against Lithuania is not a bad return. Say what you will about the strength of the opposition, but players can only score against what is put in front of them. Hodgson certainly recognised his value, choosing Welbeck as one of only four players - alongside Rooney, Gary Cahill and Nathaniel Clyne - to start from the last team he picked. Dat Guy Welbz, as he was dubbed by Ravel Morrison providing a nickname that went viral, did not let his manager down. He was close to adding another on 41 minutes, riding a challenge and bending a shot towards the top right corner from the edge of the box which was narrowly over. Welbeck is the first to congratulate debutant Harry Kane after scoring two minutes after coming on . Welbeck celebrates with Rooney after he turns home the rebound after the Arsenal striker's effort was saved . And again in the 54th, beating two men on his way into the penalty area to the right of goal and powering a shot on target which was pushed out for a corner. He would surely have had a second had Raheem Sterling not arrived in the box a fraction earlier to tap in England’s third. This may only have been Lithuania, the team ranked 94th in the world, but Welbeck’s passing was crisp and accurate, his runs inventive and movement fluid. An indication of his confidence was a clever back-heel flick in the middle of a quick England passing exchange early in the second half. England’s front three of Welbeck, Rooney and Raheem Sterling were swapping places all evening causing havoc to Lithuania’s defenders. Welbeck was substituted for Theo Walcott in the 77th minute, but the sponsors had seen enough to vote him their man-of-the-match. Kane may have scored within two minutes of coming on, but, for now, Welbeck will be going nowhere in the big games.","England beat Lithuania 4-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Friday .

"A man has been fired from his job as a 'hospitality ambassador' in California after video surfaced that appeared to show him beating up a homeless man.

"Not again. Not now. As news of Daniel Sturridge’s latest injury setback emerged, those four words will have swirled around Brendan Rodgers’ mind. Liverpool’s manager has become accustomed to picking teams that do not contain Sturridge — he went from August 31 to January 31 without him, remember — but, as the campaign reaches its defining moment, this is not something he will relish. It was bad enough to lose his captain Steven Gerrard to a three-match suspension last Sunday, and the FA’s decision to give Martin Skrtel, Liverpool’s best defender, the same ban for stamping on David de Gea exacerbated the problem. Daniel Sturridge will be out of action for around a month after picking up a hip injury . The new setback is another blow in a season that has been ruined by injury for the Liverpool striker . Sturridge injured his thigh on England duty last September and didn't play for Liverpool again in 2014 . Premier League goals for Sturridge since his debut in Jan 2013 — from that date until he left for Barca last summer, former strike partner Luis Suarez scored 41 . Immediately after the international break is over, no team in the Barclays Premier League has more at stake than Liverpool, who have a lunchtime trip to Arsenal next Saturday followed by an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn four days later. Gerrard and Skrtel would have had big contributions to make to those fixtures and, without them, there is absolutely no doubt Liverpool’s chances of success have been compromised. Taking Sturridge away has an even greater impact. Lose at the Emirates Stadium and Ewood Park and the campaign that Liverpool have fought hard to resurrect since Rodgers changed his system to 3-4-3 will effectively be over. That is what is on the line. That is why Rodgers needs Sturridge fit. At this point, it should be noted Sturridge has not set the world alight since he returned as a substitute against West Ham at the end of January. There have been some flashes of star quality but, in a lot of games, his performances could kindly be described as ‘enigmatic’. The thing with Sturridge, however, is that he scores. ‘He is an absolute nightmare for a defender when he is on it,’ Gerrard once observed. Even when he is playing poorly — like last Sunday against Manchester United — you cannot discount him for a moment. He has poise and awareness in the penalty area and it is why Rodgers believe he can become one of Europe’s top strikers. Sturridge scores for Liverpool in their FA Cup fifth round victory at Crystal Palace . Steven Gerrard was hit with a three-match ban after he was sent off against Manchester United . Note the words ‘can become’: something is holding Sturridge back from fulfilling his potential. Can his body stand up to the rigours of football at the highest level? Or is it more psychological than physical? ‘If Daniel had Wayne Rooney’s mentality, he’d be almost unstoppable,’ Jamie Carragher wrote in these pages during the World Cup last summer. ‘Wayne will play through the pain barrier and won’t let a niggle keep him out of the action. ‘Luis Suarez is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs. With Daniel, however, there was a feeling that everything had to be right for him to train or play. If a knock was playing on his mind, he would want it assessed to be sure he could play at the weekend.’ Sturridge’s latest ailment concerns his hip. He damaged it against United and, after a scan at St George’s Park following a recovery session on Monday, it was left to England manager Roy Hodgson to report that he has suffered ‘a small tear’ to his flexor muscles. Given all that has happened this season, with his initial calf problem being sustained on September 5, it left the 25-year-old ‘absolutely devastated’ that he could not figure in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. Martin Skrtel was handed the same ban after he stamped on United goalkeeper David de Gea . The question now, however, concerns how quickly he will be able to recover. It has been mooted that he could be out for up to a month and while that prognosis may seem overly pessimistic, history has shown it is not prudent to give definitive timescales when Sturridge is being treated. You would think, then, given what is at stake, he will now be redoubling his efforts to be ready for the trip to Arsenal. Rodgers will certainly hope so as Mario Balotelli is the only other recognised striker to score for Liverpool since January 31. ‘Winning games and scoring goals is the motto,’ Sturridge posted on Instagram last October. ‘Don’t think people realise how hard it is mentally being injured. I’ve had a lot of time to reflect. Can’t wait to be back!! Best feeling is to be playing football and I take it for granted when you’re fit.’ Much to his dismay, Sturridge has had a lot of time to think this season. His manager will be hoping he gets a lot of time to score. A Champions League place and the FA Cup are at stake.","Daniel Sturridge faces a month on the sidelines with a hip injury .

"Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’. And now, a never-before-seen photograph of the royal and his one-year-old grandson proves just how proud he is of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son. The framed image of the 66-year-old and Prince George took pride of place on a table  in the background of a newly released video clip, which the Prince released to support the world's biggest environmental event, Earth Hour. Scroll down for video . The Prince of Wales filmed a video about the important of taking part in the world's biggest environmental event, Earth Hour, this weekend and proved he's a proud grandfather with a sweet snap of him holding Prince George placed on a table in the background . The photograph shows doting Prince Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever in a white sun hat and dungarees as he points into the distance . The family snap, which was seemingly taken in the warmer summer months, shows doting Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever wearing a white sun-hat and navy blue dungarees as he seemingly points to something in the distance. In the video, Charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual Earth Hour and turn off our lights this weekend. The photo, of Kate and William, who are expecting their second child next month, first son, is rather fitting; in the message, he urges people to work to save the planet 'not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren'. The new photo, which takes pole position in the video, comes after reports that the monarch is  frustrated that he doesn't see his grandson very often. In the video, Charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual Earth Hour and turn off our lights this weekend and how important it is for the future of our families . Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom the Duke recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ A source told the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. The video comes in the same month as reports that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince's life . Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Little George, who will soon become a big brother after his mother gives birth next month, hasn't been seen in public since February. Whilst the grandfather and grandson were pictured together at the young royal's christening, the new photo is the only one of Prince Charles and Prince George that we have seen alone . Little George will soon become a big brother after his mother gives birth next month . The tiny tot was seen being carried through St. Lucia's tiny airport and boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique. Kate, who was almost seven months pregnant at the time, and William were on the island to celebrate Carole Middleton's 60th birthday on the 31st January, as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April. Prince William today told wellwishers ‘not long now’, as his pregnant wife Kate stepped out for her last official outing before she gives birth. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visiting the Stephen Lawrence Centre at the start of a day of engagements in South London. Kate, who is due to give birth late next month, looked radiant in a £1,500 fuschia-pink Mulberry coat as they toured the building named after the murdered teenager with his mother, now Baroness Doreen Lawrence of Clarendon, 62, and his younger brother Stuart, 37.

"While England kept up their 100 per cent in Group E with a convincing 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley, the chasing duo of Slovenia and Switzerland kept up the pressure.

Slovenia stay in second after thrashing Group E whipping boys San Marino 6-0 at home, with five of their goals coming in the final 45 minutes and all being scored by different players.

"Rafael Nadal eased into the third round of the Miami Open on a day when rain curtailed proceedings in Florida. The second seed's 6-4, 6-2 win over Nicolas Almagro was the fourth and final match played on the main court before the rain fell forcing 10 contests to be postponed until Saturday, including women's top seed Serena Williams' match against Monica Niculescu which did not start. Nadal has made the final four times at the event without claiming the title but looked to be in ominous form as he brushed aside his fellow Spaniard 6-4, 6-2 in 89 minutes. Rafael Nadal beat fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in straight sets in their second-round clash . The second seed was in good form as he brushed his countryman aside to reach the third round . 'In general, I think I played a solid match,' he said. 'I played well. I had good movement. I had to put the balls in and play with no mistakes, that was the idea today with very tough conditions. 'Almagro was not an easy opponent for the first (second) round. I am happy for that.' Heather Watson meanwhile, will have to mount a comeback against Angelique Kerber when her rain-interrupted match  resumes. Kerber had just taken the first set 7-5 during the second round match when the players were brought off court due to the weather and, although the rain stopped for a short time, it soon returned and play was abandoned for the day. Heather Watson's match against Angelique Kerber was postponed after bad weather struck . Angelique Kerber is one set up on Watson... their match resumes on Saturday . Earlier, third seed and British No 1 Andy Murray  cruised into the third round with a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 win over America's Donald Young. Murray will now face Colombian Santiago Giraldo, a 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 winner over Robin Haase as he aims for a third Miami triumph after lifting the title in 2009 and 2012. Stan Warwrinka advanced with a hard-fought 6-7 (7/9), 7-5, 6-2 win over Carlos Berlocq while Tomas Berdych had an easier time of it, beating Hyeon Chung 6-3, 6-4 to set up a clash with Bernard Tomic, a 7-6 (8/6) 7-5 winner over American Austin Krajicek. Home favourite Sam Querrey was knocked out as he lost 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 to Kevin Anderson while Dominic Thiem also needed three sets to beat 10th seed Feliciano Lopez 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 6-3. There were also wins for Leonardo Mayer, who overcame Jarkko Nieminen 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) and Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, a 6-4 6-4 winner over Jan-Lennard Struff.","Rafael Nadal cruised through to the third round after straight-sets victory .

"1 RAHEEM DREAM . Naturally Kane-mania has kicked in, but the trio of players who started in forward positions for England are creating a bit of a stir. ‘Europe will fear us now,’ declared Wayne Rooney and although it was a little optimistic, the front three are moving in the right direction. Roy Hodgson calls Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck his ‘five yard furies’, two players capable of causing chaos in opposition defences. With Rooney alongside them, they are flourishing. This was undoubtedly one of Sterling’s best games in an England shirt: he read Rooney’s pass to score and later sent in the left wing cross for Harry Kane’s debut goal. Raheem Sterling stole in at the near post to tuck the ball home for England's third against Lithuania . Sterling is forming a impressive understanding with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck . Sterling’s double nutmeg on Tomas Mikuckis and Marius Zaliukas, all completed in the same 18th minute move, was outrageous. Lionel Messi did something similar to James Milner during Barcelona’s totalising of Manchester City in the Champions League and the world went into meltdown. Sterling likes the trick, too. Welbeck was also one of England’s most prominent players, an increasing influence on this team as they head towards Euro 2016. He has the trust of his manager. Unfortunately Welbeck will probably miss the game against Italy because of a knee injury and Sterling is heading back to Liverpool for an injection on a long-standing toe injury. 2 SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT . England dropped to 17th in the FIFA world rankings earlier this month and yet the support for the national team is unwavering, even on a Friday night and against opposition as poor as Lithuania. England supporters were even singing ‘Roy Hodgson’s barmy army’ after Wayne Rooney had scored his 47th goal for his country against Lithuania. This was close to a full house at the national stadium for a routine victory, England’s fifth successive win in this qualification campaign. England fans flocked to Wembley on Friday night despite the latest in a long line of mediocre opposition . The atmosphere remains a problem and the FA would do well to change the playlist to whip up the Wembley crowd before the two teams emerge from the tunnel before kick-off. They did at least turn to old favourite Carnaval de Paris, but what’ s wrong with a bit of tub-thumping by playing some of the other terrace anthems, such as New Order’s World in Motion and the Lightning Seeds’ Three Lions? Bring them back. 3 PLAN FOR THE FUTURE . Roy Hodgson would have offered his resignation if England lost their opening group game against Switzerland last September, but they emerged with a positive 2-0 victory from that tricky night in Basle. Suddenly this emerging team has momentum, stringing together victories and establishing a winning mentality in that England dressing room. Roy Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at Euro 2016 . We have seen this before, with England unbeaten in their last two qualifying campaigns for Euro 2012 and World Cup 2014. Sadly, we know what happened the moment England ran into some opposition with real pedigree and class. Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at the tournament next summer. England have plenty of possession in games against Lithuania, but will they dominate territorially against world champions Germany, hosts France or Spain? Hodgson, who has the backing of his players in this qualification campaign, must plan accordingly if the national team is to avoid a repeat of the performance in Brazil. 4 NEW BOYS SHINE . The options appear to be increasing for Hodgson as this team beds in for the qualifying campaign, selecting a starting eleven with players from eight different clubs (Manchester City, Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Aston Villa). Manchester United and Liverpool are well represented on the field, but props to right back Nathaniel Clyne and central midfielder Fabian Delph for forcing their way into the first team ahead of some established, international players. Delph, who worked hard alongside Michael Carrick and Jordan Henderson in the centre of England’s three man midfield, was denied his first international goal by the brilliance of Giedrius Arlauskis in goal for Lithuania. Clyne is an accomplished player and he has been a breath of fresh air in his opening three games for his country. All three - Slovenia, Scotland and Lithuania - have resulted in victories. Fabian Delph has managed to force his way into the England side ahead of some more established players . 5 TRUE TEST IN TURIN . Roy Hodgson firmly believes that he has put the nightmare of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil behind him, but their next opponents will provide a brutal reminder of the past in their next game. England were beaten 2-1 in Manaus in their opening group game and were out of the tournament after another defeat, against Uruguay in Sao Paulo. On Tuesday, England head to Turin for a prestige friendly against Antonio Conte's side, but much has changed in the Italian camp since the World Cup. Eder (centre) was born in Brazil but now has Italian citizenship and could face England next week . Mario Balotelli, who scored Italy’s 50th minute winner in the Arena de Amazonia on June 15 2014, has been told he will never be selected again under their new coach. Instead Italy, who play Bulgaria on Saturday in a Euro 2014 qualifier, are stitching together a new side under the former Juventus coach. FA chairman Greg Dyke won’t like the look of it, that’s for sure: Palermo forward Franco Vazquez was born in Argentina and Eder, who plays for Sampdoria in Serie A, was born in Brazil. They now have Italian citizenship and are both in the Italy squad. Expect Hodgson and Dyke to have their say when we get to Turin.","Wembley was almost full for England's 4-0 win over Lithunia .

"Lightning forks, thunder claps and, finally, the sea fell out of the sky. That biblical scene caused qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix to be delayed for more than half an hour, but nothing could stop Lewis Hamilton taking pole again.

Will Stevens (Marussia) Hamilton, who racked up his 40th pole position in F1, said: 'I think the first lap was quite good. None of us have driven this weekend in the wet and the first lap is just the unknown. You need a banker. The next one was up at one stage, but generally it was a fantastic job by the team. 'When you go out in the wet for the first time it is all about adapting to new conditions. Because there is water on the ground you don't know which part of the track you're going to slip out of corners but you're just trying to test it and feel it and I've always been pretty good at that. 'It is going to be a hard race being a bit earlier. It is going to be hotter and tougher for the tyres. 'I'm happy to see that Ferrari are doing really well and are so close, it shows we do have a race with someone else as well.' Television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit during Q1 . Hamilton's pole position was his 40th in Formula One and second in a row to start the 2015 season . The Brit finished 0.074 seconds ahead of Vettel in Q3 with his lap on the intermediate tyres . ‘Yes, P2, great, Rosberg 50.2,’ chimed Vettel over the radio, having beaten his fellow German by three-tenths of a second in tough but drying conditions. 'Maybe it is just the track and condtions that went our way but hopefully we can keep that trend tomorrow,' the four-time world champion told Sky Sports after qualifying. 'I think it has been a bit too chilled for them (Mercedes) for the last few months. 'I think we can win but it depends on a lot of things. I think the pace looks decent but we have to be realistic that Mercedes still have an advantage. We just have to look after ourselves.' Rosberg conceded he simply 'didn't drive well enough'. He added: 'I'm annoyed by that, third place is not good enough. 'For tomorrow, I'm on the clean side of the grid so that should help me pass Seb at the start.' Vettel's P2 finish for Ferrari ended Mercedes' run of nine straight front-row lockouts . Rosberg was annoyed by his P3 finish and simply admitted he was not good enough . Hamilton set the fastest time with his first lap of the final session, skipping around adroitly on intermediate tyres. His calm performance followed the delay caused when rain started to fall two minutes into the second session. It was soon bouncing ankle high off the Sepang track. The cars, which had lined up at the end of the pit straight to get on the track to set a time before the rain started, tiptoed back to the garage. The times already set stood: Hamilton was only eighth fastest. His Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was fastest. ‘You guys got me too far behind everyone, man,’ Hamilton radioed back to his team about not getting to the front of the queue. But he had at least scraped through into the final session of qualifying, where he was to show his class in wet conditions. Daniel Ricciardo will join Rosberg on the second row in Malaysia in his Red Bull . Toro Rosso teenager Max Verstappen qualified for Sunday's race in sixth position . Vettel’s team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who was impeded on the busy track as he tried to set a fast lap, was eliminated early. He will start 11th. Race officials called a hiatus of at least 15 minutes. The drivers got out of their car. Fans had already run for cover from the exposed green banks. A restart was then planned for 6.15pm local time – a quarter of an hour after the scheduled end of the session with daylight beginning to fade. The McLarens were out of the reckoning even before the rain started. Jenson Button had one-tenth of an advantage over his team-mate Fernando Alonso, but they were both eliminated in the first session. Kimi Raikkonen will start 11th on the grid after being eliminated in the second qualifying session . Dark clouds gather in the background at the Sepang International Circuit during the qualifying session . ‘I can’t get the tyres working,’ said Button, who will start 17th. An optimistic Button told Sky Sports: 'When you get out of the car and you are 17th on the grid you're disappointed. But we've got to look at our progress and it is a lot of progress. We have made massive steps with the engine and are more competitive on the long run. It's still going to be tough tomorrow but we're making progress. Alonso added: 'It is a tough period at the moment for us but the facts and numbers are much better than Australia in terms of pace and we are making progress. Every race we will improve and we will learn things.' Fernando Alonso returned to action in Malaysia following his crash in pre-season testing . Jenson Button will start 17th on the grid after being eliminated in the first qualifying session . Alonso also struggled in the McLaren and will begin the race on Sunday in 18th place on the grid . Only the manor cars were below the McLarens on the timing sheets. Roberto Merhi was seven seconds off the pace while his team-mate Will Stevens did not even put in a lap. A fuel pressure problem was to blame, the latest in a catalogue of problems for the team. Stevens however, will line up at the back of the grid after Manor applied successfully to the stewards to let him race  on the grounds he ‘set satisfactory times in practice’. They failed even to get on to the track in Melbourne a fortnight ago and will have only Merhi representing them in the race here. Their part-participation in Formula One is in danger of turning into a prolonged embarrassment.","Lewis Hamilton on pole for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix .

"Tim Southee believes New Zealand are ready for 'one more big push' in the on Sunday in Melbourne when they face fierce rivals Australia in the World Cup final. The fast bowler said his team had allowed itself a day to celebrate the dramatic semi-final win over South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland, and had now 'parked' the memory of that match. Playing in a World Cup final, particularly against Australia in front of almost 100,000 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was his 'dream come true.' Tim Southee is relishing the prospect of facing Australia in the World Cup final on Sunday . New Zealand practiced at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday in preparation for the final . Daniel Vettori will play his last ever ODI for New Zealand on Sunday in the World Cup final . 'As a kid growing up you either wanted to be an All Black or a Black Cap and this is as good as it gets,' he said. 'I'm sure the guys are very excited to fulfill a childhood dream.' Southee said New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum 'speaks a lot about it being the time of our lives and the last couple of months we wouldn't replace for anything. We never wanted it to end, we've made it last as long as we possibly cane and one more big push and the guys will remember it forever.' Southee spoke of a sporting rivalry with Australia in which New Zealand was always 'the little brother.' He was asked directly at a news conference on Friday whether Sunday's final was about winning the respect of a fierce sporting rival whose attitude to New Zealand cricket has always contained a note of condescension. New Zealand batsman Kane Williamson practices his football skills during the training session in Melbourne . New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum in the nets just outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Grant Elliott has a throw at the stumps in a fielding drill during New Zealand's practice session . Southee allowed that there had been cause in the past for Australia to view New Zealand in that manner. 'In times gone by we haven't played to our potential or been as consistent as we should have been,' he said. 'In the last two years we've slowly, slowly gained a bit more respect because of the brand of cricket we're playing. 'We respect Australia, they're a quality side and they're not No 1 in the world for no reason. But I'm sure we've gained a bit of repsect for the brand of cricket we've played over the last couple of years. I guess that opinion has changed a little bit over the last couple of years in the way that we've played and because of the sides we've beaten.' Southee said a World Cup final between the tournament's co-hosts at the Melbourne Cricket Ground - one of cricket's greatest stages - was 'pretty exciting.' 'It's an awesome opportunity,' he said. 'It's going to be a great game of cricket. Obviously both teams are playing exceptionally well at the moment and both are playing a great brand of cricket so it should be an exciting game and a great game to watch.' New Zealand captain McCullum and fast bowler Trent Boult share a joke during their practice session . New Zealand's lethal opening duo of  Boult (left) and Southee (right) practice in Melbourne . The 100,000 capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground will provide a fitting venue for Sunday's showpiece . The first appearance of gamesmanship in the leadup to the match came early, when former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden said New Zealand might be at a loss in the giant auditorium of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, because it is so much larger than the venues in which they typically play at home.' New Zealand hasn't played Australia at the MCG in almost six years but Southee doubted they would struggle to adapt to the dimensions. 'We're not too worried about the size of the ground,' Southee said. 'Yeah, we haven't played here for a long time but there are half a dozen guys who were part of the last game that we played here and we have good memories of that game. It's a big cricket ground, there's going to be a lot of people, it's going to be loud, but at the end of the day it's another game of cricket.'","Tim Southee describes final against Australia as a 'dream come true'

"Shocking new footage has emerged of the moment on Friday night when a Montenegrin fan hurled a lit flare at the head of Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. The video shows the fans behind the goal in the moments following the start of the game, before one throws a flare onto the pitch that connects with the player. The incident occurred within a minute of kick-off, causing the game to be suspended for around half an hour.

The head of the Montenegro FA (FSCG) has branded fans who forced the abandonment of Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia as 'barbarians'. A statement from UEFA on Friday night said it would 'wait to receive reports from the delegate and referee to open disciplinary proceedings'. In a statement published on the FSGC's website, the association's secretary general Momir Durdevac said: 'The match from the first minute was on the verge of interruption. 'You saw how many people were involved in the organisation, how many times we asked the crowd to refrain from everything. 'But it seems that we do not deserve, neither the country nor the national team, a place in the big competition. 'They are here to disrupt, they are here to be barbarians. When we play against the great teams and great players, they are here to denounce these players, not to enjoy their skills. 'To interrupt the match, to throw something on the pitch, and then chant: ""Montenegro, I love you"" - it is such hypocrisy, it's such primitivism that should not be seen anywhere. 'For me, the game should not have continued after the first minute.' Durdevac also questioned whether players will accept future international call-ups amid such an atmosphere. Montenegro fans light flares from the stands during the Euro qualifier on Friday . A mass brawl between Russia and Montenegro players led to the Euro 2016 qualifier being abandoned . 'This is a human catastrophe,' he said. 'This is the final straw and someone has to say, ""Enough!"". 'What can we do after this? We pay a fine, we say goodbye to a great competition. And then there is a new game, and again there are flares and again there are chants, everything that should not be. 'Sorry, but I had to say this because as players responding to the call for the national team, to do your job - of course it would scare them. Who is going to come to play for the national team under these conditions? 'They all have a big dream. A big dream for little Montenegro is to appear in the big competition - but in these conditions?' Akinfeev was treated in a local hospital after the early incident, but the 28-year-old was able to travel back to Moscow with his team-mates later in the evening. Team doctor Edward Bezuglov told the Russian Football Federation's (RFU) website that the goalkeeper had been diagnosed with 'a concussion and burns to the neck'. And the player himself issued a short statement on www.rfs.ru, saying: 'I want to say thank you to all those who supported me. I feel fine now. 'Unfortunately these things can happen sometimes in football. But I hope nothing like this ever happens again in Montenegro or any other country in the world.'

Riot police clash with Montenegrin fans after the game is abandoned following a pitch brawl . Russia coach Fabio Capello also felt the game should have been stopped after Akinfeev was hit by the flare, a course of action requested officially by the RFU in communication with UEFA's match delegate. RFU president Nikolai Tolstoy said: 'After the match the RFU filed an official protest to UEFA. 'We had warned the UEFA delegate immediately after the incident in the first minute, when our goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was hit by a flare. The decision to continue the game after the episode was made by the delegate after consultations. 'The team were forced to continue the match but I want to stress that we warned the delegates and have filed a protest to UEFA. In our view, the match should be forfeited by Montenegro."" Capello added: 'We are waiting for the decision of the match delegate. But in my opinion the game should have been stopped immediately.'","Montenegro's Euro 2016 qualifier with Russia abandoned after mass brawl .

"Craig Gordon once sweated anxiously in a television studio while Scotland toiled at Hampden to see off one of the smallest nations in world football. Come Sunday, he sincerely hopes the national side will not put viewers through a similar experience when Gibraltar come calling. Gordon, then sidelined by a fractured arm, accepted the offer to turn pundit for the evening as Liechtenstein visited Glasgow for a Euro 2012 qualifier in September 2010. Craig Gordon hopes Scotland will not put fans through the tense evening against Gibralta . It was a decision he began to regret as Craig Levein’s side entered injury-time facing utter humiliation with a 1-1 scoreline. Only thanks to a 97th-minute header from Stephen McManus was Gordon spared the most awkward possible piece of post-match analysis. ‘I was in a television studio the night of the Liechtenstein game,’ he recalled. ‘That was a different life I had back then. ‘Towards the end I was sitting there worried what I was going to say at full-time to defend the rest of the boys. Gordon can expect a quiet evening on Sunday when Scotland face minnows Gibralta . ‘So thankfully we managed to grind it out because I don’t know what I would have said if we’d drawn that one. ‘When Stephen McManus scored I jumped out of my seat in the studio because it was hugely important to get that win. ‘That night is a reminder of what can happen in any game of football. It can be difficult and at this level you don’t want to lose a goal to give yourself an uphill task. ‘If you do that it can get edgy so we’re well aware of the need for a fast start on Sunday and a good tempo so we can take care of things. ‘These are the games we have to win and historically it hasn’t been that easy for us. ‘Getting the win is what we have to focus on first and foremost. Stephen McManus spared Scotland's blushes with late winner against Liechtenstein in 2010 . ‘If we can do that then looking to score a few goals comes afterwards – but winning the game is the main thing.’ Gordon made his first Scotland start in more than four years when he played the first half of Wednesday night’s 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland before being replaced by Allan McGregor. However, with David Marshall having served as Gordon Strachan’s more regular No 1, he has no idea whether he will form what should be an untroubled last line of defence against Gibraltar. ‘It was great to stand out there and sing the national anthem again,’ said Gordon. ‘You’d always prefer to play the first half rather than the second. ‘It was just good to get back out there, though. It was enjoyable and both keepers got a clean sheet. ‘I don’t know what will happen on Sunday — the manager will decide that. ‘He told us about the Northern Ireland game on Wednesday morning and I’m sure it will be the same again at the weekend.’","Craig Gordon watched Scotland struggle to beat Liechtenstein in 2010 .

Aldo has held the title since 2010 when the UFC merged with the old World Extreme Cagefighting organisation. As the fourth and final featherweight champion of WEC, he carried the belt across. McGregor certainly let Aldo know that he intends to take his crown and even faked a punch aimed at his Brazilian opponent, who just laughed and gestured that the Irishman was talking too much. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, McGregor said: 'I expect everyone in the top 10 of the featherweight division to line up and beg for forgiveness, beg to be pardoned!'

"A former Temple University football star and another man have been charged with human trafficking after they allegedly brought three girls aged 14, 16 and 17 to a hotel for prostitution, according to Baltimore police. Matthew Warren Brown, 25, and Anthony Leon Eley Jr., 30, were arrested during a sting operation at a Best Western Hotel. Undercover detectives used the escorts section on the website Backpage.com and arranged to meet with a woman, who claimed to be 23, at the hotel on St Patrick's Day, according to court documents. Matthew Warren Brown, 25, (left) was arrested with Anthony Leon Eley Jr., 30, (right) during a sting operation at a Baltimore hotel where they allegedly brought three underage girls aged 14, 16 and 17 for prostitution . Police said one of the girls asked for money, according to WBAL TV. Brown, a former Temple University running back, and Eley were arrested after they arrived at the hotel with the three underage girls in their car, according to police. Court documents state that Brown told police he had met the three girls on the street and gave them a ride to a different hotel before driving them to the Best Western. Brown claimed he did not know the girls were underage or involved in prostitution and that Eley provided the car, according to charging documents. One of the girls told police that both men had known the girls were underage, according to court documents. The girl alleged Brown drove them to two meetings with two other men before they arrived at the Best Western. She claimed the girls had robbed both of the men of their money and intended to do the same at the Best Western meeting. According to court documents, the girl told police she paid Brown $300 to drive the girls around. She said Eley had given the girls condoms for their meetings. The 17-year-old girl told police that Brown was the girls' pimp and also said he knew they were underage, documents state. Brown, a former football star at Temple University (pictured), told police he had met the girls on the street that day and were unaware they were underage or involved in prostitution, according to court documents . The girls were taken into custody as human trafficking victims and were interviewed by the FBI Child Sexual Exploitation Task Force. They face no charges and are under the care of social services, according to a spokesman for the police department. Brown is the son of prominent Baltimore attorney Warren Brown, who told WBAL TV that the news was 'gut-wrenching' and 'devastating'. 'It brought tears to my eyes. My heart was broken,' he said. 'I haven't had time to sit down and go talk to him about this. I haven't had time really to look at the charge papers.' Both Brown and Eley were released on bond. This month Eley was charged with assaulting a police officer, as well as second-degree burglary of a pharmacy. Brown was a Big East Special Teams Player of the Year while he played for Temple University, according to the Baltimore Sun. He was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a kick returner in 2013 before being released.

"Stoke City manager Mark Hughes will be given money to spend in the summer to maintain his side’s ambitions for European football after signing a new four-year contract. The 51-year-old has penned fresh terms which commit him to the Britannia Stadium until the summer of 2019. He has been in talks for some time but was always positive about extending his stay. ‘I’m delighted to have signed a new contract,’ Hughes said yesterday. ‘It’s exciting times for Stoke City. Everyone can see there’s more progress to be made and we want to see how far we can take the club.’ Mark Hughes has signed a new contract with Stoke City to keep him at the Britannia until the summer of 2018 . Stoke currently sit 10th in the Barclays Premier League this season under manager Hughes . Hughes has only spent £6.2million in four transfer windows since replacing Tony Pulis but guided Stoke to their highest Premier League finish and points total last season, and is on course to improve again this campaign. Bojan, a £800,000 signing from Barcelona, was a huge success before rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in January. Hughes added: ‘This season has been more difficult due to circumstances, like injuries to key players, but we’ve still been very competitive. We can do even better next season with a little bit more investment.’ Bojan soars away in celebration after scoring against Rochdale in the FA Cup match at Spotland Stadium .

"Manchester United utility man Daley Blind believes his move to Old Trafford has improved him as a player. After spending 16-years with Ajax, the Holland international arrived at United in the summer as one of Louis van Gaal's first season recruits - having impressed under the Dutch manager at the 2014 World Cup. The 25-year-old's debut season has been disrupted by injury, with a knee problem keeping him sidelined between November and January, but he has been influential on his return. Daley Blind is hoping to use what he has learned at Old Trafford on the international stage with Holland . The Dutchman posted an Instagram picture before heading off for the international break . The Dutchman has been used in a variety of positions, playing at left-back and then in midfield in the recent victories over Tottenham and Liverpool respectively. And Blind reveals it's the demands of the Premier League that has forced him to improve. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: 'In the Premier League, you have to grow. 'I noticed that the rhythm of the game is much higher. The games just went much faster than in the Netherlands. That comes in handy for me in the Dutch national team, and also in my career. 'When you develop yourself, you can become a more complete player and that's what I want - to get better every day, to learn little things; and these should naturally be reflected in the game.'

"Five Chelsea fans who were allegedly involved when a black man was shoved off the Paris metro amid racist chanting are fighting proposed bans which will stop them travelling to football matches. Souleymane Sylla, 33, was trying to board the busy train at Richelieu-Drouot station, ahead of the club's match against Paris St Germain, when supporters twice forced him back onto the platform. In shocking footage filmed at the scene, fans of the Premier League club can then be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it', while clapping along. Dean Callis, 32, from Islington, north London (left) and William Simpson, 26, from Ashford, Surrey (right) are among five Chelsea fans fighting proposed football bans following a racist incident on the Paris metro . Richard Barklie, a former policeman from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, could also be banned from games, if the Metropolitan Police win a court case to stop the men travelling to games both at home and abroad . The French commuter said the incident had 'destroyed' him, leaving him unable to work or travel on public transport. His children had also been left traumatised by the reports, he said. The Metropolitan Police are now applying for football banning orders to be imposed on five men whom they believe were involved in the incident. Football banning orders can last between three and five years and are designed to stop trouble making fans travelling to matches at home and abroad. The men involved in the court case are former policeman Richard Barklie, 50, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland; City worker Joshua Parsons, 20, from Dorking; Dean Callis, 32, from Islington, north London; Jordan Munday, 20 from Sidcup and William Simpson, 26, from Ashford, Surrey. The group attended Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court in north-east London today for a preliminary hearing. The men, who all wore smart suits, spoke only to confirm their identities. But prosecutor Ian Rees Phillips told the court that all five opposed the implementation of the banning orders. Jordan Munday, 20, from Sidcup (left) and Joshua Parsons, 20, from Dorking (right) also appeared in court today. All five men are planning to fight the proposed bans . He said: 'I understand all five respondents wish to contest matters.' District Judge Mary Connolly said the orders would involve severe restrictions to civil liberties. The incident broke out on 17 February this year while supporters were travelling to the Champions League  1-1 draw. Footage of the 'ugly scene' was recorded by British expat Paul Nolan, sparking outrage across both France and Britain. Barklie, who works as a director of the World Human Rights Forum, was a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and an officer with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He has previously apologised for his involvement on the night of the incident and has insisted he is not a racist person. Footage of the 'ugly scene' (pictured), which took place on 17 February this year while supporters were travelling to the Champions League 1-1 draw, sparked outrage across both France and Britain . A spokesman for the law firm representing him said: 'He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that. 'He accepts he was involved in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S was unable to enter a part of the train. 'He has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances as they prevailed at that particular time.' Parsons, who attended £30,000 a year Millfield private school, has been suspended from his job at the Business and Commercial Finance Club in Mayfair. A picture emerged of Parsons posing with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, complete with the caption 'UKIP BOYS! What a geezer' but the party denied that he is a member. Callis is expected to argue that he was not on the train carriage where the incident occurred. Meanwhile, a statement issued by lawyers acting on behalf of Munday outside court said he 'adamantly denied' being involved in the incident. He said: 'We question why the Metropolitan Police Service has chosen to become involved in an incident which occurred in another European country, and only after the football fans have returned to the UK, particularly in view of the fact we are aware that football officers from the Metropolitan Police Service were on the Metro train in question. 'Mr Munday now faces a football banning order application which he intends to contest. The effects of a civil football banning order are very draconian.' Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho previously said the club was 'appalled' by the incident and owner Roman Abramovich is reported to be 'disgusted'. Club captain John Terry has previously faced scrutiny for racially abusing former QPR player Anton Ferdinand. He was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in September 2012. Terry was acquitted of using racist language following a criminal trial on 13 July of the same year. All the men are expected to give evidence at the upcoming hearing scheduled for the 15 and 16 July. An investigation revealed earlier this week that Chelsea supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents as they travelled to and from matches on trains. The British Transport Police told the Press Association that since 2012 it had dealt with 15 incidents of alleged racism involving Chelsea fans, the most of any club in the country.

"Gus Poyet says he has endured his toughest week in management after the arrest of Adam Johnson. Johnson was suspended by the club on Monday after his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. When asked about the case after his side's 1-1 draw with Hull City, Poyet said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that it was a very difficult day yesterday. Very difficult day. I've never had one like that, very difficult.' Sunderland manager Gus Poyet admitted that Monday was one of the most difficult days of his life . The Uruguayan said his English isn't good enough to understand chants from the crowds at games . Adam Johnson (pictured left and right with girlfriend Stacey Flounders) was arrested on suspicion of having underage sex with a girl, 15, after she reportedly boasted about the alleged encounter on social media . Sections of supporters at the KC Stadium were heard chanting about Johnson, but Poyet insisted he hadn't heard. He said: 'I'm not very good at getting the songs. When I was playing I used to ask my kids who speak better English than me about the songs.' It is understood the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, bragged about the alleged encounter to friends and on social media, the Daily Telegraph reports. Johnson, who was signed for £10million in 2012, was then arrested and questioned for several hours. He has since been released on bail and suspended by Sunderland, pending the outcome of the police investigation. The Premier League footballer's arrest has come just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter, who was born on January 8, were at home at the time of the player's arrest. Poyet watches his side's draw with Hull City from the stands after a touchline spat with Steve Bruce . Johnson was arrested at his six-bedroom mansion after the alleged victim's father  complained to police . But Miss Flounders's mother has defended the former Middlesbrough and Manchester City player, insisting he is '100 per cent innocent'. Talking about the couple's relationship, she told the Daily Mirror: 'They are still very close and are absolutely still together. He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situation.' The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire for Tuesday's league game against Hull City before being suspended. A statement from Sunderland said: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation. No further comment will be made at the present time.' The FA refused to comment on Johnson's arrest. Johnson, who has represented his country 12 times, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. Johnson was arrested on Monday  and questioned for several hours. He has  been suspended by Sunderland . The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger. Pictured: Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December . Johnson has been released on bail and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo's former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the 'bright lights' of city life. On Monday, three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough's youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City. He was signed by Sunderland three years ago. He failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year, . In a statement, a Durham Police spokesman said: 'A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. 'A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.'

But Henry, who was a team-mate with Ibrahimovic at Barcelona, thinks French fans should cut the Swede some slack. 'Zlatan is an extraordinary guy. He is incredibly kind and we laughed a lot together,' Henry told L'Equipe . 'The people in France should make up their mind about what they really want. First they were complaining about the lack of big stars in Ligue 1 and now they have a player of Ibrahimovic's stature, they are complaining about him again.

He has won league titles wherever he went. 'Of course, he can be quite temperamental. He says what he thinks, but that has never bothered me. There are not a lot of players with his character.

"Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry hopes that his old club do not suffer a league title drought as long as Liverpool's and is backing them to make sure of that in the near future. Liverpool have not been crowned league champions since 1990 and save for last season's surprise charge, have sparsely been involved in the title mix for the past few years. Henry told L'Equipe, 'If I had told you in 1990 that Liverpool would not win the title in the next 25 years, you would have taken me for a madman. I don't want the same thing to happen to Arsenal.' Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry does not want his old club to suffer a lengthy league title drought . Henry is Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer with 228 goals in 376 appearances for the club . Arsenal are currently third in the Premier League table with 60 points, seven behind leaders Chelsea who have played one game less. While that gap might prove insurmountable at this late stage of the season, Henry is confident that the current crop of Gunners players could be developed to push for the title soon. He said, 'This year, we're not so far off. With the exception of the first leg against Monaco, they are on the right track, but they undoubtedly dropped too many points at the start of the season. But I think this squad can win the title in the years to come.' Following a 2-1 win over Newcastle at St James' Park, Arsenal are currently third in the league table . Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud (centre) fends off Newcastle's Jack Colback (left) and Mike Williamson (right) Henry was part of the last Arsenal side to win the Premier League title back in the 2003-04 season . Henry was part of the last Arsenal team to win the Premier League in the 2003-2004 season, when Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' managed to go the entire campaign undefeated. Having made little secret of his ambition to move into management following the end of his playing career in December last year, Henry has been one of the names touted to replace Wenger in the Arsenal dug-out, and is presently helping to coach the club's academy players. However, the Frenchman insists that he is happy in his current role for now and just wants to learn the trade before targeting the top job. 'I don't have the pretension to be able to coach a team nor succeed Arsene Wenger. I just want to learn with the Arsenal youngsters. I just want to be ready if -- one day -- an opportunity presents itself.'

"As PR blunders go it was hardly on the scale of Gerald Ratner's infamous quip that one of his jewellery company's products was 'c***'. But Manchester City's decision to extend Frank Lampard's contract to the end of the season, rather than allowing him to move as planned to sister club New York City, left many questioning whether the powers-that-be in Abu Dhabi believed their new American operation was an inferior product. Some in the Big Apple, who had already shelled out for season tickets, demanded refunds. In the home of Broadway, others rather dramatically branded it a betrayal. Frank Lampard (left) closes down James Morrison during Manchester City's 3-0 win over West Brom . Lampard reacts after he hit the post during his side's victory over the Baggies at the Etihad on Saturday . It was not, and the reality is that Spain legend David Villa was always a bigger draw in a city with a huge Hispanic population. Regardless, some may now be questioning the logic of keeping Lampard in Manchester, rather than Manhattan, after the media storm the decision triggered. Since January 1, when the former Chelsea man was expected to cross the Atlantic, City have encountered choppy waters. Knocked out the FA Cup they are now six points behind Lampard's former club, out of the FA Cup and out of the Champions League. Not that he can be blamed for that. Lampard has made 30 appearances for City this season, but many of those have been cameos from the bench . At 36, Lampard was never intended to be a regular starter, but given the ferocity of the response to his extended stay, City fans may have expected more. Manuel Pellegrini has given the former England man just 190 out of 990 Premier League minutes following the turn of the year. In that period he has scored once, in a 3-2 victory over Sunderland on New Year's Day. Should City stage a miraculous defence of their title, that may prove key but it is unlikely. Even with Yaya Toure absent in Africa and his remaining midfielders looking like they were operating on separate Continents the Chilean was reluctant to turn to a man who has won more Premier League trophies than the club he plays for. Former Spain and Barcelona star David Villa (centre) in action for New York City . Lampard, belatedly, did start Saturday's 3-0 stroll over West Brom. He was steady and kept things ticking over before being substituted with the game long won. As Pellegrini pointed out after that canter, the season is not over and there are still 24 points to play for as they head into the final furlong. However, if the decision to keep Lampard here is to be justified he must turn more often to his thoroughbred.","Frank Lampard signed for New York City before delaying his MLS arrival to finish the Premier League season playing for Manchester City .

"A high school student who suffers from autism and Down Syndrome was given a varsity letter by his mother to celebrate that he had begun playing special needs basketball at his high school, and then shockingly told he had no right to wear that letter. Michael Kelley, who attends East High School in Wichita, Kansas, wore the letter, which his mother purchased for him, on a jacket, until he was told to remove it and never wear it again at school. And not only did the school tell the young man he could not wear his letter, but they are now firmly standing behind their decision. Scroll down for video . The mother of Michael Kelley (above) purchased him a varsity letter to celebrate his participation in a special needs basketball program . East High School (above) in Wichita, Kansas told the boy, who has autism and Down Syndrome, he could not wear a varsity letter . 'Teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket,' East High Principal Ken Thiessen told KSN. When asked if that policy might change however, given the situation, he said; 'We have considered it, and our decision was no. We decided that is not appropriate in our situation because it is not a varsity level competition.' Wanting more answers, Mrs. Kelley turned to the district, who said there was no official rule about who could and cold not wear a varsity letter. As for how this all happened, Mrs. Kelley said; 'Another parent, from what I am told, was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket.' Michael however is getting a lot of support in the aftermath on this decision however, and a Change.org petition to change this rule already has close to 15,000 signatures.

'Before he got the letter he was one of the biggest cheerleaders in the school it was incredible, after he got the letter jacket it just sky rocketed him to another level,' said Calvin of Michael. He then said of the situation; 'We can’t be cookie cutter. We have all kinds of kids with all kinds of different needs and we need to be able to make our rules adjust to meet those needs.' He added; 'It’s a message to Michael that you can be a part of something anywhere you want to.' As for Mrs. Kelley, she is not just fighting for her adopted son Michael, but all the kids, saying; 'It’s not just my son. It’s every student that was out there last night.

"Bayern Munich's David Alaba is nearing a move to Real Madrid after his father and agent George met representatives of the Spanish club in Vienna, according to Marca. Alaba signed a new deal with Bayern in December 2013 that is supposed to keep him in Germany until June 2018, but the 22-year-old appears to be eager to move to Spain. Bayern consider Alaba to be worth at least £29.5million, and Real would have to spend big for him. Bayern Munich's David Alaba is reportedly nearing a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid .

"Bernie Ecclestone says Lewis Hamilton is as good as Juan Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher and all the other greats of the track. The Formula One Group chief executive was speaking in his air-conditioned office in the Sepang paddock before Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix, squinting through his John Lennon glasses at the state of the sport he has spent his life moulding. F1 has taken a pounding from the public and pundits since the processional opening race in Melbourne a fortnight ago. Only 75 per cent of the cars started. Only 11 drivers finished. Several teams are on the brink of bankruptcy. Lewis Hamilton is pictured in the paddock on Friday after ending the second session on top of the timesheets . Bernie Ecclestone, 84, rates Hamilton as the best world champion Formula One has ever had . Ecclestone is ‘disappointed’ but in Hamilton he sees only positives: a distinctive character who sells the sport by his deeds at the wheel and his celebrity on the red carpet. ‘He’s the best world champion we’ve had,’ said Ecclestone. ‘As a driver he is absolutely outstanding — as good as there’s ever been. Apart from the talent, he’s a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent. ‘It doesn’t matter what comes out of Lewis’s mouth, it’s good — even if it’s silly. It’s great for the sport. I told Sebastian (Vettel) he should do what Lewis is doing — put himself out there. He won four titles but went to ground. ‘He should have done the job of world champion. He got paid money for being champion. These guys think their only job is racing a car. It goes a bit further than that. The Briton, relaxing in the Mercedes garage, is bidding to win his second consecutive championship . Hamilton has helped boost the profile of Formula One, seen here with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian . ‘Most don’t think about a life beyond Formula One. Jackie Stewart is still making quite a bit of money and he hasn’t been in a car for a few years.’ Ecclestone, 84, is criticised for selling the sport’s soul to ever higher bidders, with Baku in Azerbaijan due to be added to the calendar next year and the German Grand Prix off for this season, with no guarantee of a return. Ecclestone said that even Monza, the track central to Italy’s love affair with motor racing, could be another victim. ‘It would be terrible, but if it goes, it goes,’ he said. ‘It’s funny how these people dig up money for things like the Olympics, European athletics and God knows what else. People say we charge too much for a race, and they are probably right, but teams get 62 per cent of the profit the company makes, so if we make less money, the teams make less money.’ Hamilton ended the second session in Sepang leading the way after missing most of the morning . Hamilton parades the Union Jack after sealing last year's championship at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . Ecclestone was speaking after meeting team principals, when he laid out ideas for improvement. Controversially, he wants to bring back double points, introduced to widespread ridicule for the final round of the 2014 season. ‘Last year we didn’t know who the world champion was until the last corner of the last race,’ he said. ‘It was exciting. I’d like to extend it to the last three races.’ And then there are the sprinklers to create artificially wet races. Ecclestone said: ‘We should do that. Why not have six races where there’s something different? ‘I also suggested that we give 20 points over a weekend. Ten points for pole and 10 for winning the race. Then the one on pole starts maybe 12th on the grid, so you get a bunch of decent guys starting in the middle of the field.’ Sebastian Vettel, the four-time world champion, speaks to Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on Friday . Vettel, on track during the second practice session, for the second round of the championship in Malaysia . What chance is there of these innovations being introduced? First, Ecclestone, would need agreement from the teams. ‘They need to think about it,’ he said. ‘It’s difficult for them — we’ve only been talking for five meetings!’ There is no way of reining in Hamilton’s Mercedes team or of spreading the prize-money more evenly. Ecclestone works for private equity firm CVC, criticised for taking out too much profit and investing too little in the future. But he explained: ‘We’ve got an old house and we keep repairing it. It’s not really the way to go but we can’t tear up contracts that have been signed. ‘Mercedes have the best engine, the best chassis, the best team, two of the best drivers, so they are entitled to win. It’s not good blaming them.’ Hamilton is favourite to seal back-to-back titles with Mercedes yet again boasting the best package . That is true — even if it means that Renault leave the sport as managing director Cyril Abiteboul hinted on Friday, if ‘Formula One is that bad for our reputation’. There are few cares in Hamilton’s world. He was fastest in practice on Friday, despite missing the morning session with an engine problem. The Malaysian Grand Prix — Hamilton’s 150th — looks sure to be a straight fight between the Brit and his team-mate Nico Rosberg, who, it has been emerged, was hampered by a fuel sensor problem when he was beaten into second place in Melbourne.","Bernie Ecclestone described Lewis Hamilton as '100 per cent box office'

"In the past 16 months, Jordan Rhodes has been shunned by Scotland and then dropped by Blackburn Rovers. Any suggestion that the mild-mannered forward might throw in the towel, however, has been a definite non-starter. Deemed unsuitable for Gordon Strachan’s favoured high-energy 4-2-3-1 system, a conciliatory Rhodes vowed that if he couldn’t change his game he would certainly bust a gut to try to improve it. Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes talks to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan on the touchline on Wednesday . Then, left out by Gary Bowyer for Blackburn’s FA Cup goalless draw against Liverpool at Anfield earlier this month, the 25-year-old again elected to keep his counsel. In an era when young millionaires aren’t slow to sound off about their perceived woes, the £8million man’s riposte was delivered silently on the park. A winning goal in his first game back against Bolton was followed up by a deadly double at Charlton the following week. It led to a £10m bid for his services from Middlesbrough, swiftly booted out by Blackburn owners Venkys two weeks ago. Kevin Gallacher, the former Blackburn and Scotland striker, is a big fan of Rhodes but admits there were times he feared there might be parallels between the hitman and Kris Boyd. Jordan Rhodes (left) challenges Northern Ireland's Aaron Hughes during the 1-0 victory . Boyd may have been the finest goal-grabber Scotland has produced in recent years, but the flaws in his overall game limited him to just 18 international caps and seven goals for his country. Gallacher has been impressed, however, to see Rhodes show a fighting quality to match his efficiency in front of the net. The boy seemingly without a temper has rolled up his sleeves and scrapped it out to win his first Scotland call-up since November 2013. Gallacher now feels Rhodes could be a key player on Sunday against whipping boys Gibraltar in a European qualifying group where goal difference could prove decisive. ‘Jordan’s not egotistical. He wouldn’t spit the dummy,’ said Gallacher. ‘But he’ s a real predator. Even though it’s not been his best season he’s still got 16 goals this season for Blackburn. Rhodes in action during his last Scotland call-up which was back in November 2013 . ‘We had someone like that before in Kris Boyd. But for some reason Kris never got the opportunity at national level to get many caps and many goals. Jordan had seemed to be going along similar lines. But he’s up for the battle. He’s proven that at Blackburn, where he has found it difficult this season. He’s been in and out of the side. But he came back in and got a few goals and put pressure on the manager. ‘I know he’s elated to be back in the Scotland squad for the Northern Ireland and Gibraltar games and he’ll be looking to start. He’s got to take his chance when it comes. Since Poland and Ireland have both taken seven off Gibraltar, I’ ve a feeling this group is going to come down to goal difference – and Jordan can certainly score goals.’ Gallacher recalls Rhodes facing a tough baptism of fire at Blackburn where fans viewed him as a striker proven only in the lower tiers of English football with Huddersfield. But if ever a pedigree for scoring against mediocre opposition comes in handy, it’s against a Gibraltar team so new on the scene they have no FIFA ranking. Rhodes, in action against Northern Ireland, will hope to feature in Sunday's contest with Gibraltar . ‘Jordan was scoring 20-plus goals a season but people questioned him when Blackburn bought him for £8million,’ said Gallacher, now 48. ‘He wasn’t tried and tested in the English Championship. I do think people worry because he hadn’t played and scored at the highest level. And maybe that’ s in the back of your mind as a manager. ‘But it’s up to Jordan to keep his head down – as he does – and to work hard and score goals. His game is all about goalscoring but at international level you need to do that tiny little bit extra if you want to succeed. But that’s what Jordan’s been working hard at. He’s shown he will try his best to do what it takes to get back in.’ By a quirk of fate, the last time Scotland reached a major finals, Blackburn Rovers striker Gallacher’s goals secured Craig Brown’s team a place at the World Cup in France. And his Ewood Park team-mate Colin Hendry led the team out against Brazil in the opening match in Paris. Rhodes (right), who has been in impressive club form,  celebrates with Blackburn team-mate Craig Conway . In 2015, Rhodes and his Ewood Park captain Grant Hanley both find themselves in the squad as Scotland hope to end their international exile by reaching the Euros, also in France, next year. Gallacher believes Hanley has a head start on Hendry but has the potential to be compared favourably to the man who in his prime was known as Braveheart. ‘Grant is young and has still got one or two mistakes in him. But if he keeps working hard it’s natural he will be compared with Colin Hendry because they are both Scotland and Blackburn defenders. ‘But what I would remind Grant is that Colin Hendry wasn’t the perfect player at 23. Colin was a late developer at national level and Grant is away ahead of Colin for his age. The older, the more caps, and the more experience Grant gets will make him an even better player. ‘I loved going to major finals as a player and I’d like to do it with the Tartan Army. Hopefully Grant and Jordan can help that happen.’","The striker has been dropped by Blackburn and Scotland in past 16 months .

"Scotland boss Gordon Strachan has vowed to stand by Steven Fletcher as the striker bids to end a six-year goal drought for his country. The Sunderland forward, a £14million player, scored his only international goal in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over Iceland in April 2009. Missing from the Scotland set-up for 19 months under former manager Craig Levein, the 28-year-old’s record now stands at one goal in 19 caps after Wednesday night’s friendly win over Northern Ireland. Striker Steven Fletcher has scored just one goal for Scotland in 19 appearances . A home European Championships qualifier with Group D minnows Gibraltar offers the chance to put that right on Sunday and Strachan believes one may be enough to set his first-choice striker scoring again. ‘There was a lovely movement from Steven and link-up play (against Northern Ireland),’ said the manager. ‘All his game is needing is a goal. ‘But I don’t think it’s affecting his touch or his willingness to work - you see him sliding into tackles and making blocks. ‘If you don’t have your goalscoring boots on then you dig in and do something else for the team. I’m happy with that. ‘He is terrific to watch. I think he is elegant, I think he’s clever, he brings people into play. You can trust him when the ball goes up so we can then get up beside him. Fletcher's goal drought continued in Wednesday night’s friendly win over Northern Ireland . ‘But I would like to see more people round about him. ‘In the first half against Northern Ireland, I didn’t think we had enough people in the box. ‘We played too much around the edge of the box, so I would like to see more bodies in there. In saying that, we don’t have a Podolski or a Muller who comes in off the line.’ Fletcher has found it difficult scoring goals for relegation threatened Sunderland as well, claiming four in 28 appearances this season. ‘He a good player,’ said Strachan. ‘But as I said, you don’t have to be scoring goals as long as your team is winning. So I’m fine with that. Fletcher (left) celebrates scoring against Iceland with Kenny Miller at Hampden Park in 2009 . ‘I went to bed fine on Wednesday night because the team was winning and making chances.’ Defender Christophe Berra has scored three goals in the period since Fletcher struck against Iceland, adding his latest goal on Wednesday night. ‘Funnily enough, when we put Christophe on we knew that he had scored a few goals this season so he came up with another one,’ added Strachan. ‘I felt pleased for him because he has been to all the get-togethers and not played - so we had to get him on the pitch to make all of his travels previously worthwhile.’ Berra is unlikely to start against Gibraltar, with Strachan set to name his strongest side after vowing to treat Sunday’s opponents with respect. ‘We’ve got to,’ he said. ‘But our players wouldn’t have got to where they are by taking shortcuts. ‘You just had to watch their intensity in training on Tuesday when they were playing amongst themselves to see their hard work. Scotland boss Gordon Strachan believes one may be enough to set Fletcher scoring again . ‘You don’t get to where they are by taking people for granted. That just won’t happen. ‘You can be rest assured that won’t happen.’ Gibraltar have yet to win FIFA recognition and, after battling for access to UEFA, shipped 21 goals in their four qualifiers so far - losing two of their games 7-0. Cautioning against expectations of a rout, however, Strachan added: ‘The world champions only beat Gibraltar 4-0. ‘I can’t tell our fans how to behave. I’ve said already, I’d imagine we’ll get about three minutes before they get anxious. ‘That’s just the way we are, everybody is like that. There is not a problem, we all come along to games and get anxious. ‘As long as the players don’t get anxious, that’s the main thing. ‘But as I say, when it was Germany, it was only four goals.’","Steven Fletcher bids to end a six-year goal drought for his country .

Cathy Calhoun's first job was as a bank teller at The National Bank of Spring City in Spring City, Pennsylvania, and when she learned in 1989 that the bank was closing and up for sale, she decided she would purchase the property. What's more, she decided to turn the bank into her new home. Scroll down for video . Cathy Calhoun (above) bought The National Bank of Spring City in Spring City, Pennsylvania in 1989 . Calhoun paid $52,000 for the bank, which was built in 1872 and which she worked at as bank teller when she was a teenager . She turned the downstairs vault into a steam room (above) The bank has about 5,200 square feet of living space . Calhoun paid $52,000 for about 5,200 square-feet of living space when she bought the bank, which was built in 1872, and soon after went about deciding how to make the interior like a home. According to CNN Money, the clipping room of the bank, where individuals would clip coupons from their bonds, became a powder room, the upstairs vault became a bar, and the downstairs vault, which had no ventilation, became a steam room. Calhoun also restored the clock that used to be in front of the bank, and emptied many of the safety deposit boxes, finding money that had been printed at the bank, old ledgers and books, and even spectacles. Calhoun had the ceilings painted with pink and blue clouds . The upstairs vault was turned into a bar . She made the boardroom into her master bedroom . The bank is on the National Register of Historic Places . She also put new lettering outside, labeling the building Calhoun Federal. The boardroom meanwhile became her master bedroom, one of three bedrooms in the building, and there is still one area left to explore in the basement. It seems that when the bank stopped printing money, the machine was concreted in rather than being carried out, and for her next project, Calhoun just might see what's back there in that basement. Calhoun also put new lettering outside, labeling the building Calhoun Federal . Calhoun also restored the clock that used to be in front of the bank . A closer look at the steam room in the old vault . And it seems she may not be alone in the home either, and after a 1921 robbery left one man dead after he suffocated in the vault, some have claimed to see his ghost wandering the stairs. Not to worry though, Calhoun says if he is there, he is very friendly.","Cathy Calhoun bought The National Bank of Spring City in Spring City, Pennsylvania in 1989 .

"Roy Hodgson has revealed that Danny Welbeck has been added to the growing list of injuries as the England boss prepares to take a depleted squad to Turin to face Italy on Tuesday. Leighton Baines and James Milner will also be unavailable for next week's friendly while Hodgson confirmed the agreed absence of Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling. Southampton left back Ryan Bertand will join up with the squad ahead of the Italy game to replace Baines, who will return to Everton. Danny Welbeck leads the celebrations after putting England 2-0 ahead against Lithuania on Friday . Welbeck's header deflects into the back of the net to send England into a commanding lead . Welbeck is congratulated by captain Wayne Rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualifying campaign . Welbeck played a leading role for England as they kept up their winning start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday. The Arsenal forward scored one and had a huge hand in another as he justified his selection afterbeing given the nod over new-boy Harry Kane. However, the night may have come at a cost after Danny Welbeck picked up a knee injury. Likewise, Hodgson revealed Sterling is set to have a injection to clear up a niggling toe injury, which will rule him out of the trip to Turin. 'We've had two blows as I've always known that Raheem Sterling has been waiting for an injection in his toe, he's been playing with that injury for a while now. Raheem Sterling will have an injection in his injured toe and will not feature against Italy . Leighton Baines will also be unavailable next Tuesday and will return to Everton . Roy Hodgson revealed Ryan Bertrand will join up with the squad to replace Baines . 'He's done ever so well but I always knew the situation and agreed with he and Brendan Rodgers that he would play tonight's game, which is the qualifier but then he would have the injection. 'So if we lose both of them that is a blow. Not only as they both played very well tonight but because they're an important part of the system that we're trying to play. 'We've still got enough players and it will be a chance for somebody else.' Meanwhile, Hodgson revealed defender Leighton Baines will return to Everton and will be replaced Southampton left-back Ryan Bertrand ahead of the trip to Turin.

"Tottenham striker Harry Kane hailed a 'dream come true' after marking his England debut with a goal within two minutes of action at Wembley. Kane replaced captain Wayne Rooney in the 71st minute and headed home with  his third touch to cap off a comprehensive 4-0 win for England over Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier. The 21-year-old claimed his debut goal was the best moment of his career so far as Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling added to the scoring. Harry Kane slides onto the Wembley turf in celebration having scored on his England debut on Friday . 'Not too bad is it. It’s the start that I dreamed of and to see it come true is amazing,' Kane told ITV. It’s all a bit of a blur at the moment but I’m delighted, I’m delighted for the lads and most importantly we got the three points.’ Asked whether it's the best moment of his career so far: ‘Yeh by far, obviously to represent your country at senior level is the top and hopefully I can continue to do it and hopefully it’s the first of many. The red hot Spurs striker would relish the chance to start against Italy in a friendly on Tuesday: 'Yeh of course but that’s up to the boss, If I’m called upon then that would be great,' added Kane. 'We’ll see what happens, recover over the next couple of days and look forward to it.’ Kane replaced England captain Wayne Rooney on 71 minutes during the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley . It took Kane 79 seconds to head in his debut goal for England, which was just his second touch on the field . Kane has been in blistering goal scoring form this season and capped his England debut with a goal . Manager Roy Hodgson was evidently pleased with Kane's instant impact at Wembley. ‘He’s had a wonderful season so far and crowned his England debut with a goal, a great goal as it was a marvellous piece of skill from Raheem (Sterling), with good movement from Kane to the back post and a very determined header. So it couldn’t be better for us at the moment, a very satisfying evening for us.’ England captain Wayne Rooney was full of praise for his fellow striker: 'It's fantastic. International football is different , so to score after just 80 seconds is incredible, we’re all delighted for Harry and hopefully it’s the first of many. Rooney and Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck both scored as England cruised to a 4-0 win at Wembley . Rooney had several chances to add to his impressive England goal tally and hit the woodwork twice in the first-half: 'I was a bit disappointed with the first one which hit the post. I felt I got a shove which knowcked me off balance but the second one I had to go to the far corner and unfortunately it hit the post,' said the England skipper. 'I’m happy, I scored, we won, it’s a big three points in this qualifying campaign. ‘Since the World Cup we’ve been fantastic with some great victories,' added Rooney. 'We’re scoring lots of goals, we’re a really energetic team, so I think a lot of team around Europe will look at the team and will be frightened.'","Tottenham striker scored after just 79 seconds on as a substitute .

"Javier Mascherano hailed Lionel Messi's impact on Barcelona's march into the Champions League on Wednesday night at Manchester City's expense. 'I have never seen anything like him (Messi). It is the way he dominates a game that sets him apart, ' said the Argentine who also admitted the problems the club had earlier in the season have helped knock them into shape. He said: 'A clip around the ear can sometimes shake you up and be the best thing.' Javier Mascherano hailed Lionel Messi's impact on Barcelona's march into Champions League quarter-finals . Messi was outstanding for Barcelona as Manchester City were dumped out of the Champions League . Full-back Jordi Alba added: 'Messi is the best player in the world and he gave another recital tonight.' Mascherano admitted trying to advise Barca keeper Marc Andre ter Stegen on which way to dive for Sergio Aguero's penalty. 'I know from international duty how he takes spot-kicks' said the midfielder. The Barca keeper admitted being advised by both Mascherano and Rafinha but in the end made his own mind up and stopped Aguero's shot. The German keeper saved a Messi spot kick in a game against Argentina and had studied his compatriot's record from the spot. It was Manchester City Joe Hart who impressed Barca coach Luis Enrique. He said: 'The game would have ended earlier if it had not been for Hart, his performance was spectacular.' Messi and goalkeeper Joe Hart were involved in a memorable duel at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night . Barcelona forward Messi shakes hands with City goalkeeper Hart after failing to beat the No 1 . And the rest of Spain was left in awe at the display. La Liga statistician Mister Chip tweeted that his performance was the best since Iker Casillas – the last keeper to make 10 saves in the competition in one game – against Juventus in the group stages in 2013. Hart's 10 stops came after he saved the penalty in the first leg that kept the game open in the second leg. Many Spanish supporters took to Twitter to hail Hart's display. One tweet read: 'Hart has made more saves tonight than Iker Casillas all season.' His performance even had some speculating on the possibility that he will now be on Real Madrid's all-encompassing radar. Barcleona now go into Sunday's Clasico in fine form.

"Barcelona forward Neymar Jnr has been gearing up for this weekend's crucial Clasico in the only logical way - freestyling in the gym wearing his underpants and not much else. The Brazil international showed off an impressive repertoire of tricks and flicks as he was filmed in a short video that was later uploaded to his official Instagram page. The former Santos player, donning socks, gloves and a hat in addition to the aforementioned under garments, pulled out all the stops ahead of Sunday's showdown against Real Madrid. Neymar has been gearing up for Sunday's Clasico by freestyling in his underpants in the gym . The Barcelona forward paused from his workout to show off an array of tricks and flicks . The 23-year-old pulled out all the stops before uploading the video to his official Instagram account . Neymar took up a boxer's pose and he will need all his fighting spirit during the Real Madrid clash . On this evidence, not to mention the 26 goals the 23-year-old has scored this season, the Real defence should have their work cut out trying to shackle Neymar at the Nou Camp. Barcelona could move four points clear of Carlo Ancelotti's side at the top of La LIga should they win what could prove a title-defining match. The two giants approach the match in contrasting form with Barcelona having won 17 of their last 18 matches in all compeitions - the latest a 1-0 victory against Premier League champions Manchester City on Wednesday night. Neymar carries the ball forward during Wednesday's Champions League clash with Manchester City . Neymar has netted 26 times in all competitions this season for the La Liga leaders . Real, meanwhile, have only won once in their last four games and have struggled for form since the turn of the year, but Lionel Messi admits his side cannot afford to become complacent. 'We are playing well but we cannot get carried away because there is a long way to go,' Messi said. 'We have some big games... first against Madrid and then there are the quarter-finals (of the Champions League) where we will face another tough team. 'I have a lot of respect for Madrid. When Madrid are in this situation it is when they are most dangerous,' he added. 'They have great players.

"It will be trebles all round on Sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the Camp Nou – Barcelona’s three-pronged attack of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Leo Messi up against Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Carlo Anceotti’s threesome have the edge so far this season having scored 56 goals between them — one more than Luis Enrique’s attack. But with Luis Suarez missing the first two months of the season and Messi out of form before the turn of the year, there is a feeling that the Barcelona strike-force gave their Madrid counterparts a head start and are about to go past them. There is also a feeling at a club that has a history of brilliant front threes that this particular Barcelona group could finish up being the best ever. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr have netted 55 La Liga goals between them this season . Messi has hit top form for the La Liga leaders after enduring a difficult start to the season . It was in the 2008-09 season that Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Messi scored 100 goals between them in one campaign with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38. Henry was at the Nou Camp on Wednesday to cover Barcelona’s victory over Manchester City for Sky and went down to the Barcelona dressing room after the game to congratulate the players who could yet break that scoring record this season. Following the Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line came the Messi/David Villa/Pedro one that also won a European Cup against Manchester United. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema have scored 56 league goals between them this season . In the 2008-09 campaign Barca's front three of Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto'o and Messi scored 100 goals . Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasico and Henry played in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu, Henry and Messi both scoring twice. On Sunday it is the Barcelona three who are in the best form, although none of them could get past Joe Hart on Wednesday. Real Madrid’s ‘BBC’ forward line are a little more out of sorts with Benzema, Bale and Cristiano having scored five each since the turn of the year.

"Robbie Brady is ready to put himself in the firing line as the Republic of Ireland attempt to derail Poland's charge for the Euro 2016 finals. The 23-year-old Hull winger could yet be asked to fill in at left-back having slotted into that position to spectacular effect in November's 4-1 friendly victory over the USA, in which he scored twice. Brady could be required with Stephen Ward still battling to shake off the after-effects of a broken ankle, but he insists he will be happy to be cast in the role of emergency defender if manager Martin O'Neill calls upon him. Robbie Brady acknowledges the crowd after Republic of Ireland lost against Scotland at Celtic Park last year . Brady scores from a free kick for Republic of Ireland against USA at the Aviva Stadium last November . He said: 'Over the last couple of years, I have been a bit more accustomed to the role. I have played there quite a bit, so if he calls upon me on Sunday and needs me to play left-back, I'll play left-back and I'll give 110 per cent, and hopefully we can come away with the result we need. 'It's definitely a change, but it's just concentration more than anything else. It's just work on the mind more than the body. You know how quick and how strong you are, it's just getting your positioning right. 'The more I play there, the more comfortable I feel. I have played there quite a bit and I will be ready to play there if that's where he needs me to play.' Indeed, Brady views the prospect of having to adapt his game to another position as one which can only benefit his career in the longer term.

He said: 'You need to learn new things if you are going to push on in the game, and hopefully that's just another string to my bow. Hopefully I can show that in the upcoming games and many years to come.'

"What is the last thing you remember about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? For Messi, it is most likely him tearing Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City apart, making them look like a League One team lost in Europe, nutmegging James Milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside. For Ronaldo, it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain, sulking back to the halfway line, protesting even though team-mate Gareth Bale had just put Real Madrid 1-0 up against Levante. Lionel Messi may well be priceless as the Barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career . Messi smiles during Barcelona's win over Manchester City that knocked them out of the Champions League . Cristiano Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration during Real Madrid's last match against Levante . It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve fast for El Clasico against Messi's Barcelona . It is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet. Yet there is currently no debate to be had. Not even close. The headlines this week belong to Messi, even if he didn't break a Champions League record on Wednesday and his free-kicks served only to remind us he is human after all. There was more to his embarrassment of Manchester City than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament. Much more. If it wasn't his menacing dribbles, it was his six shots against a magnificent Joe Hart. If it wasn't his assist for Ivan Rakitic's goal, it was his nutmeg on Milner that reduced Pep Guardiola – the architect of the Barcelona way and current Bayern Munich manager – to nothing more than another supporter in the stands. The one-twos, the drops of the shoulder, the shimmies. Pep has seen it all before – at the Nou Camp, at their Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training ground, at almost every stadium he took Barcelona to – yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief. He wasn't alone. Barcelona's Messi taunts the City defence on the edge of the penalty area during another classy performance . Messi joins in the celebrations after Ivan Rakitic's opening goal with Luis Suarez (right) at the Nou Camp . Messi's heat map showed he was very active in the City half. Click here for more from our Match Zone service . Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantastic' Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport . Should we have expected anything less? Messi has been untouchable this year. So much so it's almost unfair, and part of the credit can even go to – dare we say it? – his nemesis, Ronaldo. It was on January 12 when the Real Madrid man got the better of the Barca boy for the 2014 Ballon d'Or award, three weeks after Ronaldo returned to his hometown of Funchal on the island of Madeira to unveil a statue of himself. Before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Ronaldo beat Messi in goals (33 to 25), goals per game (1.18 to 1), minutes per goal (70.94 to 87.24), shots (119 to 96), minutes-per-goal involvement (52.02 to 58.95) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions. Messi sat there in Zurich, to the left of Ronaldo, and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third Ballon d'Or. Deservedly so, too. Yet Ronaldo's cry of 'Si' lit something under the four-time winner. Hell hath no fury like a Messi scorned, and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world's best in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Since the Ballon d'Or ceremony, there's been no contest. Messi beats Ronaldo on goals (18 to 8), goals per game (1.2 to 0.73), minutes per goal (75 to 122.75), shots (60 to 52), chances created (39 to 17), assists (9 to 3) and minutes-per-goal involvement (50 to 89.27). Messi has been outstanding ever since Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or on January 12 and the stats prove it . The frustration against Levante was written all over Ronaldo's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal . How the top of La Liga stands ahead of El Clasico . It's unrecognisable. A complete reversal. To the overall statistics in all competitions this season, it puts Messi ahead in the three major categories: goals (43 to 41), assists (21 to 15) and, comfortably, chances created (112 to 68). Down to the brass tacks of La Liga, too. There was a moment on November 22, when Ronaldo had 20 goals to Messi's seven. Yet today, Ronaldo has 30 to Messi's 32. All this has reopened the debate between Messi and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in Europe last Tuesday. Ronaldo is congratulated by FIFA president Sepp Blatter during the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich . Ronaldo cry of 'Si' lit something under four-time winner Messi, who has obliterated his form ever since . Ronaldo must up his game to stay in competition with Messi if he is to retain the Ballon d'Or next year . Ronaldo, for a man that had broken the Champions League goalscoring record, left the pitch shaking his head following a 4-3 defeat by Schalke at the Bernabeu. Those all-too-familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team's direction, and the Spanish whistles were piercing. 'I won't talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo announced afterwards, as frustrated as any, while a poll by Spanish newspaper AS found 32.2 per cent voted for Cristiano to be dropped. All is not right in Ronaldo's world, and he has been putting in additional work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas. Messi, meanwhile, warmed up for El Clasico by putting on a masterclass for Manchester City at the Nou Camp. Ronaldo has been putting in extra work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas . Ronaldo has been at the training ground preparing hard for the trip to Barcelona's Nou Camp on Sunday . Guardiola wasn't the only one mesmerised. Just look at the feedback: . The kid from next door in Barcelona, with the ability to glue the ball to his foot, has been swaying a few votes in his favour, it seems. Yet on Sunday at 8pm, another chapter of Messi vs Ronaldo – a rivalry that demands its own Wikipedia page – will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million. Messi received plenty of  feedback from the world of football and beyond for his performance against City .

"It comes to something when even Pep Guardiola looks surprised. After all, the former Barcelona coach has seen the Lionel Messi show many times before. He helped to construct it, to hone it. He could claim part-copyright. On the training fields of Barcelona’s Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training centre, on the slick, wet grass of the Nou Camp and at the best European stadia, Guardiola has watched Messi make fools of many. Here on Wednesday night, however, as the current coach of Bayern Munich chose to return to his spiritual home, even he was left gasping, gaping and giggling at another night of remarkable productivity and beauty from the greatest footballer those of us on the south side of 50 have ever seen. Lionel Messi runs with the ball as the Barcelona man produces yet more genius at the Nou Camp . Messi evades the tackle as he runs towards goal during the UEFA Champions League clash on Wednesday . Messi (centre) holds off the challenge of Manchester City's David Silva (left) as Barcelona progress . Read Martin Samuel's match report from the Nou Camp as Barcelona beat Manchester City 1-0 to progress to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Messi’s free-kicks weren’t up to much on Wednesday. Three times he had the opportunity to beat Joe Hart from just outside the penalty area. Three times the ball flew over the crossbar. It was, in some ways, good to see that he isn’t perfect, that he does make mistakes. After all, if we accept that we have the first flawless footballer in our midst then where do we go from there? Pretty much everything else, however, was exemplary and it was a nutmeg on James Milner by the near touchline in the first half that provoked one of the most memorable reactions of the season from Guardiola. As Milner disappeared in to a place no footballer ever wishes to go, Messi was away up the field, scampering towards the retreating figures of Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis with savage intent. On nights like this, Messi will terrify the best defenders and, here, City’s pair resembled pedestrians stranded on the central reservation of a motorway. Lots of footballers can pull tricks, of course. Messi isn’t the only one with the moves. The key to his majesty, however, is that none of it is ever for show. He does it because he can but also because it works, because it wins matches. At times here he made the English champions look like a desperate, disparate bunch. If this is to be Manuel Pellegrini’s final act in Europe as manager of City then he will leave with Messi’s scampering image burned on to the back of his eyes. James Milner approaches Barcelona star Messi during their Champions League tie on Wednesday . Messi slips the ball through Manchester City midfielder Milner's legs at the Nou Camp . Milner slides as Messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their Champions League match . Milner is left on his backside as Messi runs away from the England international with the ball . Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola (centre) reacts to the ridiculous skill from Messi during the match . A ‘nutmeg’ is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent’s legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who tweeted: ‘Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang ‘nutmegs’, meaning ‘testicles’. In case Messi is ever interested.’ However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic. Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged. In Spanish, the skill is known as ‘cano’ or ‘tunel’. They’ve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the Nou Camp thanks to Lionel Messi. When City look back on the goal that effectively ended this tie, they will ask questions. Was Bacary Sagna right to track Neymar all the way infield, allowing scorer Ivan Rakitic to proceed unimpeded from deep? If Sagna was not at fault then who was supposed to be tracking the runners? For the visiting team the tactical debrief will not be pleasant. There was a poverty about their football at times. Here in Catalonia, however, the locals will have taken home only memories of the way that Messi drifted infield from the right, dragging City defenders towards him like moths before lifting the perfect pass in to Rakitic’s path. This is what the really great players do. They create panic and prompt rash decisions. They destroy tactical plans. They do, as much as is humanly possible in a sport involving 22 players, win games all on their own. Not long after Barcelona’s goal, Messi did pretty much the same thing again. This time he got a lucky bounce off his own face as he moved forwards but once again the chipped pass was perfect. Once again Sagna was distracted by the darting Neymar but this time, somehow, there was no goal. It was to become a pattern. City didn’t help themselves. Kompany began dreadfully and hardly improved. Demichelis looked paralysed – perhaps he was just too aware of what his international team-mate can do – while City’s central midfield players failed palpably once again to locate the Barcelona midfield players queuing up to adorn Messi’s creative work. At times they resorted to simply fouling Messi. Even David Silva retreated back to his own 18-yard line to crudely halt his passage towards goal. That, in its own way, was one of the night’s most telling images. Messi (centre) is congratulated by Martin Demichelis (left) and Silva at full-time at the Nou Camp . Messi looks to break through as he terrorises the Manchester City defence on Wednesday .

Messi congratulates team-mate Rakitic on scoring the opener at the Nou Camp on Wednesday . Crudeness and violence, though, will never distract Messi. That is one of the many traits he shares with his great rival in Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo. In to the second half and his appetite indeed remained strong. He touched the ball three times within ten seconds of the restart and two minutes later drove a shot towards goal that Hart beat away. At the death Hart denied him again at the end of a 70-yard thrust that Messi began and almost finished. The City goalkeeper got the better of Messi at the end of the first leg, of course. He saved his penalty and Messi shovelled the rebound wide. Maybe that memory drove him on Wednesday night but it’s doubtful. Revenge is a motivation for the mortal. Messi is different. He’s just a genius. England legend Gary Lineker settled the argument of who's better between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . Former Chelsea player Andre Schurrle wrote about Messi's nutmegs: 'Again and again and again...' Manchester United's Ashley Young was among those admiring the Barcelona star and wrote: 'Messi WOW' Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin wrote that Guardiola's reaction said it all about Messi's skills .

"It was a privilege to watch Lionel Messi on Wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory. There have been times over the last 12 months, particularly at the World Cup, when I wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against Manchester City was magnificent proof that he is still the best around. What he did to City — and the way he has played since Christmas — makes me think he has jumped back above Cristiano Ronaldo in their struggle to be football’s No 1. It will make their battle in this weekend’s Clasico even more intriguing. Lionel Messi was in inspired form against Manchester City and proved he is still the best around . Cristiano Ronaldo has struggled of late and Messi may have jumped back above the Real Madrid star . I am hoping that the Champions League will produce the dream final of Barcelona versus Bayern Munich — I will be in Berlin on June 6 — and it would be fascinating to see Messi in this form in a showdown against his mentor. We all saw Pep Guardiola’s reaction to Messi’s trickery during the game and, afterwards in Barcelona, I was among a group from Sky that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into Bayern’s manager. He gave us a couple of moments of his time and, inevitably, Guardiola was asked whether he fancied coming up against Messi when the quarter-final draw was made. Bayern, after all, have been in outstanding form, scoring goals for fun, but his reaction was telling. ‘No! No! No!’ said Guardiola. ‘If I have to face Messi, I want it to be in one game rather than two!’ If they do happen to face each other in Berlin — and after Friday's draw it is not wrong to expect Barcelona and Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat.

"Stephen Quinn has warned the Republic of Ireland not to be fooled into believing they only have to shackle lethal striker Robert Lewandowski to get the better of Poland. The Republic entertain the Group D leaders at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday evening looking for a victory which would take them level with the Poles and get their campaign back on track after November's 1-0 defeat in Scotland. However, Martin O'Neill has left his players in little doubt that preventing Lewandowski from doing what he does best is only one of the missions in which they must succeed if they are to prosper, with Arkadiusz Milik and Sebastian Mila also representing significant threats. Stephen Quinn (left) believes the Republic of Ireland musn't concentrate solely on Robert Lewandowski . Quinn said: 'I don't think we need to say too much about Lewandowski because we know exactly how much of a threat he is. But hopefully we can keep him quiet at the weekend. 'But they are strong all over. They are plying their trades throughout the European leagues and they have got a top striker in Lewandowski up front, so we all know how good they are. 'Poland are a strong side. We have watched a lot of videos on them throughout the week already. The manager doesn't want to leave any stone unturned going into it for set-pieces, et cetera. 'We know how strong they are and we have done our homework, so hopefully we can deal with that on Sunday. Lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the Euro 2016 qualfying campaign to date . 'We can't dwell on how good they are, we have got to look at our own qualities and try to apply them in the game on Sunday and get those three points that we really want. We have got our own pace down the flanks as well, so hopefully we can counteract that.' Lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the campaign to date, although they all came in Poland's 7-0 drubbing of minnows Gibraltar in Faro in September, and it was Milik and Mila who were on target to defeat world champions Germany in Warsaw the following month. Ireland compounded the Germans' woes three days later when they emerged from their trip to Gelsenkirchen with a 1-1 draw, courtesy of John O'Shea's injury-time equaliser, although their hopes of securing one of the two automatic qualification berths were dented by the reverse in Glasgow. That left the Republic, the Scots and Joachim Low's men locked together on seven points, three adrift of Poland, although Quinn is confident there will be no hangover from the disappointment at Celtic Park. Quinn and James McClean (right) in action during a Republic of Ireland training session on Monday . John O'Shea (left) celebrates scoring an injury-time equaliser against Germany in October, 2014 . He said: 'No, I don't think so. Obviously, we were disappointed with the result, but we can't dwell on that. 'It was a close game, it wasn't the prettiest, but if we keep looking back at that, then we are not going to be going forward, so we have just got to concentrate on this Poland game. 'That's gone now and we have got to look at our home form and try to get the three points here, which is most important.' Poland appear in 34th place in FIFA's latest rankings list with Ireland in 66th, and it has been to Ireland's detriment that they have not been able to see off teams ranked above them in their most recent campaigns. ROI manager Martin O'Neill will lead his side out against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday . That is a situation which will have to change if they are to finish in the top two, and the significance of that will not be lost on a bumper crowd at the Aviva Stadium, the site of the former Lansdowne Road stage on which Jason McAteer captured the imagination of a nation by dumping Holland out of the World Cup back in 2001. Quinn said: 'As a boy growing up on the streets of Dublin, it's where everybody wants to be. Sometimes you pinch yourself, but being out on that pitch and playing for your country, you can't beat it. 'The boys are all ready and waiting. We all know how big a game it is, the boys are all on it and really looking forward to it.'","Stephen Quinn believes the Republic of Ireland mustn't focus solely on stopping Robert Lewandowski .

"As excitement builds around Sunday's El Clasico showdown between Barcelona and Real Madrid at the Nou Camp, Sportsmail asked two fans to take part in a Q&A. Enrique Schoch from totalBarca (part of the Football Collective blog network) and Lucas Navarrete from Managing Madrid answered questions on Spain's biggest rivalry, what they make of the La Liga title race and how past results and recent form will affect the clash. Scroll down to read their answers. Luis Suarez (centre) grapples with Pepe and Sergio Ramos during the last El Clasico in October 2014 . Click here to check out Enrique Schoch's work on totalBarca . Click here to follow totalBarca on Twitter . Click here to check out Lucas Navarrete's work on Managing Madrid . Click here to follow Managing Madrid on Twitter . Feeling confident? ES: It’s never wise to feel overly confident in matches like El Clasico. That said, Barca are coming off an incredibly impressive display midweek and frankly a very good 2015, whereas Real Madrid are having the exact opposite situation with iffy performances, Cristiano Ronaldo far from his best and a discontented Bernabeu crowd. LN: Not really, anything can happen in these matches, but Barcelona's form is so much better at the moment. Ivan Rakitic is congratulated by his team-mates during Barcelona's 1-0 win against Manchester City . What would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game? ES: As every year, a win in El Clasico is the sweetest victory and considering it would create distance in the league table, even sweeter. LN: It'd be a crucial win to regain the first spot in the table and put this bad streak to an end. Gareth Bale celebrates after breaking a long scoring drought to put Real Madrid ahead on Sunday . Is this the biggest rivalry in European football? ES: It’s certainly currently the rivalry with the most prestige and consequence. Real Madrid and Barcelona have the two best collections of footballers in the game and Clasicos are guaranteed exhibitions of a will to win and a very high level of football. LN: No question. Apart from football, it has political issues around it as well. Lionel Messi skips past Jesus Navas (right) during a mesmerising display at the Nou Camp on Wednesday . What are your memories of Real Madrid's 3-1 El Clasico win in October? ES: Utimately it's beyond debate, Madrid deserved the victory but had Lionel Messi made it 2-0 early on, the game would have been very different. But really it was no big deal, Barca were going through a lot of early adjustments with the manager and new players and losing is part of sport. LN: Real Madrid completely outplayed Barcelona and deserved the win even after Messi and Co earned the lead. Real Madrid's two expensive superstars both celebrate their side's second in Sunday's win over Levante . What's changed for both teams since that result? ES: Barca have gelled together extremely nicely, the style of play is both exciting and effective, whereas Real Madrid have stagnated, suffered a few key injuries and despite the spoils of talent elsewhere miss Ronaldo being Ronaldo. LN: Ronaldo's form isn't that great, Messi is back and Real Madrid look tired. Ronaldo slots home a penalty during Real Madrid's 3-1 El Clasico win back in October 2014 . You mention Ronaldo's poor form, What impact do you think he'll have? ES: Well, he’s long been one of the best in the world, but his 2015 has been rotten and he's often been totally ineffective in games. He needs others to facilitate him being his best more than Lionel Messi does. If the Barca defence put in a performance similar to that against Manchester City, I expect them to keep Ronaldo quiet. LN: Hard one to predict, but he should still be able to create some dangerous plays through Barcelona's shaky defensive system. Meanwhile, Messi is on fire. Will Real be able to deal with him? ES: Nobody can deal with Messi. SP: If Sergio Ramos' hamstring is healed, they definitely have a chance. Real Madrid's defence will have to cope with this stunning attacking trio for Luis Enrique's Barcelona . What are your plans for the day of the game? ES: I’ll have some cule (Barcelona die-hards) friends over and watch with good company. Nothing complicated. LN: I'll be covering the game from the Nou Camp's press box for SB Nation's Managing Madrid. What would a win for your team do to their La Liga title prospects? ES: Putting distance between Real Madrid can only help title prospects. Both teams have an equally challenging finish to the season so nobody would not want a four-point cushion. LN: It would make everything look much better, since a Barcelona win could potentially end the race for La Liga. At least, Real need to get a draw. All the bookmakers expect Barcelona to be victorious here. What's your prediction? ES: Things feel very positive at Nou Camp right now so I would have to go with the bookies and say this dangerous new-look Barca will make come out with the win Sunday night. LN: I'm expecting a 2-2 draw. Gareth Bale (second right) speaks with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) and Luka Modric (right) on Thursday .

The Northern Irishman suffered the problem during practice on Wednesday and, although he managed to play his opening nine holes on Thursday. After pulling out of the tournament he has set his sights on getting fit for the Masters at Augusta National from April 9. Graeme McDowell withdrew after his opening nine holes of the  Valero Texas Open due to an ankle injury . The Northern Irishman picked up the injury in practice before deciding he couldn't go on at five over par . McDowell, tweeted: 'Apologies to everyone at @valerotxopen for my withdrawal. Strained my lower left leg/ankle area practicing y/day and played with heavy strapping on it in the pro am and this morning. 'With The Masters upcoming I decided that getting fit is imperative.

World No 14 Kuchar, a seven-times winner on the PGA Tour, needed 'a lot of luck' as he mixed four birdies with four bogeys on the challenging layout at the TPC San Antonio to end the round level with compatriot Cameron Percy. Former world No 2 Jim Furyk battled to a 76 while US Open champion Martin Kaymer of Germany ballooned to an 82 in sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (48 km per hour) that gusted up to 40mph. 'I was giving it all I could on the last hole,' Kuchar, 36, told Golf Channel after bogeying his final hole, the par-four ninth. 'I was one under with one to go and hoping that I could bring it in under par. Matt Kuchar battled swirling winds to grind out a level-par 72 for the lead early in the first round . Kuchar said he needed 'a lot of luck' as he mixed four birdies with four bogeys on day one . 'But even par is still an amazing day. This was about as challenging of conditions as I can remember facing. This course is hard without wind and you've really got to drive it well. Then you throw in 30mph winds and what can happen. 'It took a lot of luck for me. I had a number of things kind of go my way. I was able to hit some great shots and make a few birdies out there as well.' Long-hitting American Dustin Johnson, the world No 9, carded a 78 that included five bogeys and a double. 'Whether it's into the wind or down-wind, it was playing very difficult,' said Johnson. 'I didn't hit it very good, I didn't drive it very well so that made it even tougher. My score is terrible but I'm still not out of the mix, I guess.' World No 6 Jordan Spieth and fellow American Zach Johnson, a twice former winner of the Texas Open, were among the day's late starters.","Graeme McDowell pulled out of the Valero Texas Open after nine holes .

"Manchester United benchwarmer Radamel Falcao sent a message to Louis van Gaal with two clinical finishes for Colombia in their friendly in Bahrain on Thursday night. Falcao struck twice in four minutes for Colombia's second and third goals in a 6-0 thrashing of the world No 103-ranked side at the Bahrain National Stadium. The 29-year-old has been craving regular football having not started for his club since February 28 but delivered as he so often has for national team head coach Jose Pekerman. Radamel Falcao celebrates the second of his two goals for Colombia in their friendly against Bahrain . Out-of-favour Manchester United striker watches his first strike, a classy  volley, hit the bottom corner . 1 Arnoldo Iguaran 24 goals in 68 games . 2 Radamel Falcao 23 in 55 . 3 Faustino Asprilla 20 in 57 . 4 Freddy Rincon 17 in 84 . 5 Víctor Aristizabal 15 in 66 . 6 Teofilo Gutierrez 14 in 37 . Adolfo Valencia 14 in 37 . 8 Ivan Valenciano 13 in 29 . Antony de Avila 13 in 54 . 10 James Rodriguez 12 in 32 . Willington Jose Ortiz 12 in 49 . First though, Falcao was the provider for  fellow striker Carlos Bacca to open the scoring on 14 minutes after Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado hit the post early on. Showing strength at the back post Falcao headed back to Bacca at the top of the six-yard box for the Sevilla marksman to drill home the finish. Captain Falcao then stepped up in the 32nd minute to get himself on the scoresheet with a clinical left-footed volley after a looping ball over the top of the flagging Bahrain defence. Falcao's second came moments later, again with a first-time finish, but this time after his explosive run between defenders was met with a well-weighted through ball. The strike, which it must be said took a significant deflection, took Falcao's international tally to 23 in 55 matches, just one short of his country's all-time top-scorer Arnoldo Iguaran's 24 from 68. Carlos Bacca drills home Colombia's first goal after a strong header from Falcao set him up . Falcao pierces through the hapless Bahraini defence on Thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time . Defender Abdulla Khaled Al-Haza'a brings down Falcao wide on the right during their friendly . After the break Borussia Dortmund's Adrian Ramos came on to add his second goal in as many international showings after a deft pass from Inter Milan's Fredy Guarin for 4-0. After Pekerman decided his star man had had enough after 72 minutes, Real Valladolid's Johan Mojica and Mexico-based Andres Renteria came off the bench to continue his work with goals five and six respectively to wrap up the mismatch. Despite his personal tally getting a boost, Falcao made a point to commend his team's effort after the match. 'Great victory today against Bahrain,' he wrote on his Instagram page. 'The most important think, the amazing team work!!! Go Colombia.' Falcao has scored just four times in 22 appearances since coming to Old Trafford on loan from Monaco and is almost certain to go elsewhere in the summer. Colombia's Andres Renteria, who plays for Santos Laguna in Mexico, beats Said Ahmad Jaffer for the sixth . Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado shoots in Colombia's 6-0 win at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa . Bahrain keeper Sayed Mohammad Jafar makes himself big as Falcao comes close for a third . Colombia enjoy support away from home in Bahrain as they continue preparations for the Copa America . But with some sharp running and eagle eye for goal - at least twice - he showed glimpses of the reasons why the club thought him worthy of £260,000-a-week for this season. He should have left the pitch with a hat-trick, to be fair, with a golden chance at the far post on 49 minutes squandered following a poor Bahraini clearance from a free-kick. Falcao's last goal for Van Gaal's side came on January 31 when he scored United's second in a 3-1 defeat of Leicester. His most recently involvement under Van Gaal has been minimal - as an 83rd minute substitute in wins against Liverpool and Tottenham after being hooked after 68 minutes with United 1-0 up against Sunderland - as the Dutchman puts his faith in Wayne Rooney with support from Danny Welbeck and Juan Mata in the absence of Robin Van Persie. Colombia's match in Riffa served as a warm-up for the Copa America in Chile from June 11 to July 4 at which they will be hoping to see the return of Real Madrid's James Rodriguez who is still recovering foot injury.","Radamel Falcao took his goal tally for Colombia to 23 in 55 matches .

"Liverpool and Manchester United may be two wounded animals, but the pair have a serious backer in Pele, who insists their derby is on a par with El Clasico. The legendary striker will be at Anfield on Sunday to witness who steals a march in the race for Champions League qualification, asserting that this clash cannot be bettered in world football. Real Madrid and Barcelona do battle at the Nou Camp on Sunday, but United’s trip to Merseyside will be watched by just as many around the globe. Brazilian legend Pele believes Manchester United's trip to Liverpool will be on a par with Sunday's El Clasico . United players celebrate during their side's 3-0 victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford in December . Luis Suarez (left), Neymar and Lionel Messi will play a part as Barcelona take on Real Madrid on Sunday . According to Pele, that is what makes it a standout fixture in the calendar. ‘They are very, very similar games,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It’s one of the best in today’s game. I always look forward to going to Anfield. I love to see good football. ‘Barcelona have excellent players. It’s not only Lionel Messi, but Xavi and Neymar. Maybe they have more individuals, but as a team Liverpool are the same.’ It is quite a show of support for the Premier League, which has a number of questions to address after a dismal fortnight in continental competition, with each of England’s remaining representatives crashing out of Europe. 2014 Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo will come face to face with Messi once again at the Nou Camp . The World Cup winner speaks with Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan ahead of the crucial Premier League clash . Pele, who will visit Anfield for the sixth time on Sunday, doesn’t buy into suggestions English football’s power is waning. ‘Oh yes, definitely,’ he said when asked if the Premier League remained the best division in the world. ‘It pains me as a Brazilian, but I have to say that. Even after the problems in Europe. ‘Remember, losing is part of the game. I don’t think there’s anything wrong - it’s something you can’t explain. ‘But there is no doubt that it’s the top league.’ Pele will be in attendance at Anfield on Sunday to watch Louis van Gaal's side take on Liverpool . The former Santos star compared Steven Gerrard (pictured) to German great Franz Beckenbauer . Pele admits that both Beckenbauer, seen here playing against Holland in the 1974 World Cup, and Gerrard would make his all-star team . Pele was also forthright in his views on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who he puts on a pedestal with the great Franz Beckenbauer and says would make his World XI. Asked where Gerrard would rank among the best midfielders of all time, the 74-year-old compared him with Germany’s biggest ever star. ‘Maybe people don’t remember, but Beckenbauer had the same style,’ he added. ‘I like Gerrard, he is a similar intelligent player. There is no doubt they’d both make my team.’ And Pele, flashing a wide grin, stated that Lionel Messi’s one-footed nature and lack of aerial presence gives himself the edge when pundits compare the two: ‘I used to kick it with both feet. I never saw myself play, but I think I was the better player.’ The 74-year-old joked that he was a 'better player' than Lionel Messi because the Brazilian used both feet .

"Lionel Messi's brilliant nutmeg on James Milner left the Manchester City midfielder on his backside, Pep Guardiola covering his face and Twitter reacting to the Barcelona star's masterclass. It was Messi's second nutmeg of the match, having already inflicted the same embarrassment on Fernandinho after the Argentina captain's assist created the game's only goal for Ivan Rakitic.

VIDEO Enrique hails 'special night' for Barca . Messi was the architect for Barcelona as they gave Manchester City a masterclass at times on Wednesday . Messi and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart exchange words after the Barca star misses a chance . A ‘nutmeg’ is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent’s legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: ‘Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang ‘nutmegs’, meaning ‘testicles’. In case Messi is ever interested.’ However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic. Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged. In Spanish, the skill is known as ‘cano’ or ‘tunel’. They’ve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the Nou Camp thanks to Lionel Messi.","Lionel Messi inflicts nutmegs on Fernandinho and James Milner .

"This is the haunting last picture of a 'kind and caring' Iranian sports journalist, taken in the window of his Barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the doomed Germanwings flight. Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of Hotel Hespiria before he departed for the airport on Tuesday morning, sharing it on his private Instagram account. He had been in the Spanish city to cover 'El Clasico', a football match between Barcelona and Real Madrid - his favourite team, according to his profile on the picture sharing site. Scroll down for video . Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of his Barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the flight . Mr Javadi was killed along with 150 other people when the plane crashed into the Alps . Rescue workers sift through the wreckage of Germanwings Airbus A320 which was deliberately flown into the French Alps . Mr Javadi, along with fellow Iranian sports journalist Milad Hojatoleslami, were travelling to Austria, where they were due to cover a match between Iran and Chile. But they never reached their destination, as the plane was plunged into the Alps by German pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz, killing all 150 people on board the flight to Dussedorf. Mr Javadi's long-time friend Maysam Bizær - who shared the picture on his Twitter account after learning of the tragedy - told the Evening Standard: 'He was a kind, loving and caring man with high passion for his work and football.' The heartbreaking picture of Mr Javadi, who worked for Vatan Emrooz newspaper, is just one of the traces left behind of the passengers' final hours. Many of the 16 German schoolchildren, who had been in Barcelona on an exchange, messaged friends and family as they boarded the plane. Among them were 16-year-old Elena Bless, who friends described as a ‘happy girl’ who dreamed of going to university and travelling the world. Germanwings co-pilot - 28-year-old German Andreas Günter Lubitz (above) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to 'destroy the plane', it has been revealed . These are some of the German pupils who died on the Germanwings flight, which crashed in the Alps, killing all 150 passengers. The teenagers had been on a week-long exchange trip to Barcelona and were flying home . ‘She had been sending me messages on WhatsApp and Snap Chat and had been very happy about the trip. She had had a good time.’ Elena’s best friend and classmate Philippa said. ‘She sent me pictures of the group together and the different sights they saw. They looked like they had had fun.’ Investigators have since revealed how the 28-year-old pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit in the moments before the aircraft was downed. The chilling final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'. 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit. 'His (Lubitz's) breath was not of somebody who was struggling. He never said a single word. It was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes. Nothing. 'There are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground. Then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door. 'The door is reinforced according to international standards. 'Just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact. It's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact. 'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower. 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds. 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'He did this for a reason which we don't know why, but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane. 'We have asked for information from the German investigation on both his profession and personal background. 'There is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack. 'People who commit suicide usually do so alone... I don't call it a suicide.'","Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of his Barcelona hotel .

"This might just be the best wake-up call ever. The Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida, has come up with a very unique way to ensure that guests rise and shine during their spring break holiday - by blasting Circle of Life. A classic Disney tune, Circle of Life was made famous by the studio's 1994 animated film, The Lion King. The Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach has introduced a unique wake up call for spring breakers . Circle of Life, one of the hit songs from Disney's The Lion King, was nominated for an Academy Award . Since 2012, the Holiday Inn resort has been performing this particular ritual, and guests now dance and sing along when it is blasted by a DJ. Each March, when the hotel is full of twenty-something spring breakers, staff play the track at 11am to ensure that everyone is up and ready for another day of partying in the sun. 'It was a song that worked real well as a wake-up call because of the loud beat in it and it also works real well because of the message of the song,' Holiday Inn Marketing Director Philip Corvin told WJHG. 'For these kids, this would have been one of their first Disney movies. We thought it would be kind of neat to play something from their childhood and see how they react to it.' Each March, when spring break attendees descend on Florida, the hotel wakes up guests with a Disney song . Hotel management blasts The Lion King's Circle of Life at 11am each morning to awaken the guests . And while it started as just a funny idea, it's clearly become as big of a hit with the spring break attendees as it has with hotel management. 'We were overwhelmed by how they reacted to it,' Corvin continued. 'We've done all sorts of songs as a wake up song and none of them had the reaction that this one did.' 'I think it's awesome,' said one spring break guest, according to Consumerist. 'I cried the first day because I was so happy. I thought it was so cool.'","A hotel in Florida has come up with a unique wake-up call for guests .

"The stampede by rugby’s dinosaurs to defend that monstrous Courtney Lawes tackle against France as perfectly legal has been as alarming as the potentially back-breaking hit itself. The stamp by Steven Gerrard against Manchester United was no more than a petulant irritant which threatened no real damage but he was rightly sent off and roundly castigated by football at large. The rugby snobs are fond of saying that that football is a game for gentlemen played by thugs. Not so when seen in the context of Mr Gerrard’s words of contrition for a rare blood-rush late in his honourable career. England lock Courtney Lawes made a bonecrunching hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half . Steven Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . Jeff Powell’s piece has provoked much debate, including the above tweet from Lawes himself... They also like to say that rugby is a game for thugs played by gentlemen. Not with the malevolent Mr Lawes around. Gerrard sought forgiveness from his team-mates and fans for how his stupidity left it impossible for Liverpool to avoid Sunday’s critical Premier League defeat. There has been no apology from Lawes for a violent act 24 hours earlier which cast a pall over an otherwise heroic England victory, which came close to snatching an improbable Six Nations Championship. The general reaction at Anfield was concern that an idol may have dented his legacy a little in one of his last big matches in this country. At Twickenham even the low-swinging charioteers gasped in horror as Lawes came close to cutting in two French fly half Jules Plisson. Lawes has talked in the past about the beneficial impact for his teams of ‘the big hit.’ That offers a disturbing insight into his view of sport and the spirit in which it should be played. Perhaps he feels no need to explain himself this week because so many others were only too eager to do it for him. Referee Nigel Owens and his video-reviewing assistant agreed that the Lawes’ tackle was within the regulations. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge . Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over . The majority of the rugby fraternity gave vent to their customary splutterings about this being ‘a man’s game.’ Not when you blind-side an opponent after he has passed the ball. The officials and the executives who are responsible for rugby were of a consensus that Lawes was already committed to the tackle so therefore he was not late enough to justify a red card. But did he really have to go through with it at such ferocious velocity? Was it vindictive or mere happenstance? Lawes is not telling us but if it had happened in a street outside the stadium police may well have been called to investigate if there were grounds for an assault charge. The rugby authorities – with the exception of the French who are asking for the on-the-spot not guilty verdict to be reviewed – are saying he did nothing wrong. Well, if that tackle was lawful then it explains why so many parents are discouraging their kids from playing this game. Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . If it is OK for a young man of average build like Plisson to be hit so hard by a giant that his head is shaken around like that of a rag doll before slamming against the ground, then what chance the campaign we at Sportsmail are leading for the reforms needed to prevent concussive head injuries? If the supply of youngsters dries up, rugby’s future will be bleak indeed. As for Lawes, he has past form. England internationals Charlie Hodgson and Owen Farrell and another French cap, Morgan Parra, are among a lengthening list of creative fly-halves who have been hammered – and in some cases injured – by trade-mark batterings from Lawes. The video of his brain-rattling of Plisson has gone viral and there is a danger of his hits becoming cult viewing. Now this is a contact game. The physical element is fundamental, while the strength and courage of the combatants are very much part of its appeal. But there has to be a limit. This is sport, not war. Football has a lot to learn from rugby about acceptance of decisions and respect for referees. But education is a two-way street. Come the crunches, football officials can take into account not only the force of the impact but the intent. Plisson continued to play after his mauling by Lawes and comes up against Luther Burrell here . England and France captains Chris Robshaw and Thierry Dusautoir listen to referee Nigel Owens . Was Lawes well-intentioned towards Plisson, who played even more poorly thereafter although going beyond the call of duty in carrying on? As the decision to let Lawes remain on the pitch came down he gave me the smug impression of someone who had got away with another one. No doubt it is asking too much for England to leave out the man they call their Enforcer. But they could come to regret not taking that decision if he does something similar in the World Cup later this year, the officials are less forgiving and they find themselves down to 14 men against the All Blacks. As power becomes ever more important than flair in rugby, so big men like Lawes bulk up even more muscle. And his own team-mates talk with increasing awe of how he targets the fly-halves he dwarfs. Legal or not Mr Lawes, try picking on someone your own size. Gareth Bale is reportedly determined to confound his enemies in Spain, win over his critics at Madrid and go on to prove himself a Real Galactico. All in preference to a £75 million transfer to Manchester United, Chelsea or Manchester City . Good for him. If he were to take even more money and run for home, it is unlikely greatness would ever become him. Gareth Bale is going through a fallow patch in his second year in the Spanish capital .","Lawes blind-sided the French fly half when the ball was gone .
