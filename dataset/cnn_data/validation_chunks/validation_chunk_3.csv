"(CNN)Three French sports stars were among 10 people killed when two helicopters collided in Argentina on Monday evening, authorities said. The helicopters were reported to be heading to a gorge in northwestern Argentina for the filming of the reality TV show ""Dropped"" for the French broadcaster TF1. Eight French passengers and the choppers' two Argentinian pilots died in the midair crash near the town of Villa Castelli in La Rioja province, Argentina's state news agency Telam reported, citing local authorities. The dead included the famed sailor Florence Arthaud, who in 1990 broke the record for crossing the North Atlantic alone; the swimmer Camille Muffat, who won three medals at the 2012 Olympics in London; and the boxer Alexis Vastine, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Members of the TV production team were among the other French victims, French authorities said. Former French soccer star Sylvain Wiltord, a contestant on the show who wasn't involved in the crash, expressed his shock. ""I'm sad for my friends,"" he tweeted. ""I'm shaking, I'm horrified, I'm lost for words."" Muffat's boyfriend, William Forgues, told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV of his shock at hearing the news of the 25-year-old swimmer's death. Clearly emotional, he said her agent had called him soon after midnight, herself in tears, to tell him of the crash. Muffat, he said, was known as ""madame 100%"" because she succeeded in so many things. He said she was happy and satisfied to be taking part in the show. ""To be over there was her choice, 100%,"" he said. At the 2012 London Olympics, Muffat won the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle, silver in the 200-meter freestyle and bronze in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. French President Francois Hollande expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in a statement. The sports stars ""made France shine so brightly"" during their careers, the statement said. The crash happened within moments of takeoff in good weather conditions, Telam reported, citing witnesses who spoke to a local radio station. The helicopters, which belonged to local governments in the region, collided about 100 meters (328 feet) above the ground, the news agency said. Police and investigators were at the scene of the crash. A manslaughter investigation has been opened in France into the incident, to be led by the Air Transport Gendarmerie, a representative for the Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday. It is standard procedure to launch an investigation if French nationals die abroad. Five national police officers were en route from Paris to Argentina on Thursday, authorities said. Their mission there is to collaborate with the Argentinians and assist  in the identification of victims. The TV show involved sports stars being helicoptered into remote areas while blindfolded and then having to survive in the wilderness, according to French media. ""We learn with immense sadness of the accident that occurred during the filming of the show 'Dropped,' "" TF1 said in a brief statement. TF1's staff ""come together in this terrible time with the pain of the families and those close to the victims,"" it said.

"(CNN)Rubén García Villalpando was supposed to arrive home from work on a Friday evening in February. But he never again pulled into the driveway of the home in suburban Dallas where he lived with his wife and four children. The 31-year-old welder died that night after a police officer shot him twice in the chest. Villalpando was unarmed, but in early reports about the shooting, police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer's commands during a traffic stop. It wasn't until hours after the shooting that his wife says she got a call from police, telling her what had happened. Now, questions swirl through Marta Romero's mind. How will their children grow up without a father? Will authorities take the case seriously or toss it aside because of her husband's immigration status and the fact that the man who opened fire was a police officer, not a civilian? And what happened that night to make something so horrible happen? ""If my husband had killed a police officer, he would be in jail,"" she said. ""But since it was the opposite, will they just leave it this way? Because an officer killed a man, because he killed an illegal and nothing more? What are a human's rights then? Now an animal gets more rights than a man."" Villalpando is one of three Mexican nationals killed in U.S. police shootings in the past month, sparking sharp criticism from Mexico's Foreign Ministry and a call for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate. Pressure for authorities to take a deeper look at the controversial case is also coming from north of the border. At a City Council meeting in Grapevine, Texas, last week, Romero and her children were among a group holding signs that said ""Justice for Ruben"" and chanting, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" -- the phrase that started as a call to action after the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and has now become a rallying cry across the country in protests against police violence. Police said it's too soon to say exactly what happened that night. Investigators have interviewed dozens of witnesses and plan to share their findings with prosecutors. No charges have been filed. ""I do not know now whether to believe in the authorities here or not,"" Romero said, ""because if a police officer acted like this, what can another official do? I don't know. I want to trust them, because they are the ones who are taking care of us in this city. But I don't know what they can do."" The case already has one piece of evidence that wasn't available to investigators looking into Brown's death: a police cruiser dash cam video. But police haven't released it to the public. ""There will be more information released as the investigation continues. This additional information may shed more light on Mr. Villalpando's actions that night,"" police and city officials in Grapevine said last week. ""We look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident, which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident."" Villalpando's family members said they've seen the video, and even though it doesn't show the shooting, they said it's clear there was no good reason for the officer to open fire. Villalpando was unarmed, they said, had his hands in the air and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him. It all started, police say, when a burglar alarm went off February 20 at a business in Grapevine. Officer Robert Clark of the Grapevine Police Department spotted Villalpando's car in the area and started to follow him. Soon, according to police, the pursuit turned into a high-speed chase, with the officer following Villalpando from Grapevine into the neighboring town of Euless, Texas. A Grapevine Police statement released after the shooting said the dash cam video shows Villalpando's car ""weaving through and around the heavy traffic and driving onto the highway attempting to evade Officer Clark."" Eventually, Villalpando pulled over. His family said they believe he didn't stop for police right away because he was scared. He was an undocumented immigrant who had lived in the United States for 15 years and he knew any encounter with police could end with him getting deported and separated from his children, Romero said. U.S. President Barack Obama's announcement last fall that undocumented immigrant parents of U.S. citizen children could be eligible for work permits as part of a new executive action gave them hope, but also made them even more nervous about making sure they steered clear of trouble until the paperwork came through, she said. ""He was nervous. He knew that to have problems with the authorities was serious. ... We couldn't have a criminal record,"" she said. ""That is what he had in mind. What is going to happen to me now? Now I am not going to be OK. They are going to deport me."" Fernando Romero said it was jarring to hear what Villalpando says in the video as he gets out of the vehicle. ""My brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up,"" he said, ""and the first thing he asks is, 'Are you going to kill me?'"" There's no sound of any fighting or altercation, but what you do hear, he said, is the profanities the officer repeatedly shouts as Villalpando approaches with his hands up. It's hard to hear exactly what was said, according to Romero; the family believes the officer made a comment claiming Villalpando was drunk. Police in Euless, who are leading the criminal investigation into what happened, told CNN the video does contain foul language. The Grapevine Police dispute the family's assertion that Villalpando did nothing threatening, saying that ""contrary to clear instructions"" he continued to walk toward the officer after being told repeatedly to stop. But there's a key thing that's not shown on the video, police and the family said: the shooting itself. Still, Fernando Romero said the sound of gunshots is clear, piercing through the roar of rush-hour traffic. His sister, Villalpando's widow, was so devastated after seeing the video he had to carry her out of the police station. Grapevine Police said the video shows the officer did everything he could to keep the situation under control until backup arrived. ""We believe the dash-cam video, as well as information that has already been in the media, clearly demonstrates that Officer Clark was doing everything in his power, including the use of strong language, to keep Mr. Villalpando at a safe distance until backup arrived and an arrest [was] safely accomplished,"" Sgt. Robert Eberling said in a written statement released Thursday. ""Members of the media have also been diligent in reporting some of the possible explanations for Mr. Villalpando's actions on the night of February 20, including a previous high-speed chase and a prior arrest for DWI, and a fear that he would be deported. Officer Clark had no way of knowing Mr. Villalpando's nationality at the time the traffic stop was initiated and it may not have been evident on a highway in the late evening."" Marta Romero said her husband made a mistake when he didn't stop when the officer tried to pull him over. But she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in. ""He was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer, and in the video you don't see any of those things,"" she said. ""You see the opposite, a man who is scared, who is simply trying to calm the situation, who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands."" Now she said, she's seeking justice, hoping the police officer will face the appropriate charges for killing her husband. But she knows the family's search for answers won't be easy. In addition to the doubts swirling in her head, she is faced with questions from her children, even as she tries to explain to them that their father won't return. The most devastating of all, she said, is, ""Mommy, when is my Papa going to wake up?"" Police in Euless said they're also asking plenty of questions. Investigators have interviewed more than two dozen witnesses and are searching for more people who might have seen what happened, Euless Police Lt. Eric Starnes said . Clark, who's worked for the Grapevine Police since May 2014, is on administrative leave pending the investigation. Grapevine Police did not respond to CNN's request to speak to Clark about the incident. The burglar alarm that spurred the officer's initial response, police later said, turned out to be false. As for the video,Grapevine Police said they still want the public to see it, but for now, they're holding off on releasing it because prosecutors have asked for evidence not to be released to the public while an investigation is pending. ""While we understand the interest of the community in the requests to release the video, we must balance those needs with the direction from the District Attorney's Office and the respect for the judicial process,"" police said Thursday. ""We recognize that much of the sentiment being expressed is based on the understandable grief concerning Mr. Villalpando's death. We appreciate the support of our citizens and the fact that they are keeping an open mind and waiting for the results of a complete and thorough investigation.""

"(CNN)Wedding bells are on the horizon for Bristol Palin and 2011 Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer. Meyer, 26, proposed to Palin, 24, Friday night at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas, Palin said on her blog. ""The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated 'Bless the Broken Road' to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!"" she wrote. ""It's amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God's hands."" Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer's Instagram, ""This is so 'MERICA that my mind is blown right now."" Meyer received the nation's highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient -- and the first Marine -- to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother's failed vice presidential bid through appearances on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and a Lifetime show about raising her son, ""Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp."" She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, ""Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far."" She was previously engaged to Tripp's father, Levi Johnston. The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film ""Amazing America,"" Sarah Palin's show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. ""He met Tripp during that time, and I've seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He's visited us in Alaska, and I've visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,"" she wrote. ""He's wonderful with Tripp and I'm so proud to be marrying him."" The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. ""I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever,"" Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes. Bristol Palin shared an Instagram picture of a ring and another of the happy couple smooching. ""Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!"" she said. The couple started recently began sharing images on social media of themselves together. Palin posted a photo last week of the couple out in the snow with Tripp. Meyer has also shared a few pictures of him with Sarah Palin. ""Thank you for being the amazing person that you are. I appreciate your leadership and dedication to our country!"" he said in a post on her birthday in February. Sarah Palin also congratulated the couple, noting that Meyer ""flew up North"" to ask Bristol Palin's father and grandfather for her hand in marriage. ""Our families couldn't be happier for Bristol and Dakota! We're honored to welcome Dakota into our family.  He's an American hero and patriot whose service to our country -- like all his fellow Medal of Honor recipients -- has been above and beyond the call of duty; but even more important is he's a good and kind man who loves Bristol and Tripp, and is loved by them,"" she said on Facebook. ""Yes, God working behind the scenes to turn beauty from ashes. Had tough circumstances in their lives not occurred, and had they reacted differently to those circumstances, they'd have never met.""","U.S. Marine Dakota Meyer won the 2011 Medal of Honor for rescue in Afghanistan .

"(CNN)On Friday, ISIS claimed responsibility for Yemen's deadliest terror attack. A day earlier it claimed responsibility for the worst terror attack in Tunisia. Last week it welcomed into the fold Boko Haram, a Nigerian terrorist group with thousands of fanatical fighters that dominates territory the size of New Jersey. All this came in the wake of the group's rapid expansion across Libya, its assimilation of a powerful Egyptian terrorist group, and the founding of small chapters in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Algeria, where its new affiliate last year beheaded a French hiker. The group's momentum may have stalled in Syria and Iraq, but its supporters from the Atlantic to the Hindu Kush appear to be heeding its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's call to ""erupt volcanoes of jihad."" By far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in Houthi-Shia mosques in Sanaa, Yemen, on Friday and another attack in the north. ISIS was only thought to have a fledgling presence in Yemen and had only claimed one previous attack, the assassination of a Yemeni security official north of Aden earlier this month. Al Qaeda in Yemen, or AQAP, has for years been the dominant Jihadi group inside Yemen, but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks, saying it was against its principles to target mosques, bolstering the ISIS claim. This indicates ISIS has very quickly built up an operational capability inside Yemen in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to Baghdadi last November. Only two developments could explain this: defections from AQAP or the return home of Yemeni ISIS veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives. There is no love lost these days between the two groups. Since Baghdadi declared ISIS had expanded into Yemen late last year there has been an escalating war of words between them, with ISIS claiming AQAP was not doing enough to target Houthis and AQAP declaring that the ISIS caliphate was illegitimate. While AQAP has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support ISIS, there have been relatively few defections. Its charismatic leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, al Qaeda's global number two, is extremely popular among the group's rank and file. In recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from Sunni tribal anger over the Houthi takeover of Sanaa, allowing it to expand its operations across Yemen. But ISIS appears now to have laid down the gauntlet, declaring its attacks Friday were the ""tip of the iceberg."" In targeting the Houthi mosques in Sanaa, ISIS would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who launched a devastating suicide bombing on Golden Mosque in Samarra in February 2006, which plunged Iraq into a full-blown sectarian civil war. Al-Zarqawi correctly calculated that the Shia, infuriated by the attack on their most sacred shrines, would violently retaliate, driving Sunnis into the embrace of the jihadis.  Yemen appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war. The terrorist attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunisia on Wednesday that killed 23 was the worst terrorist attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor, Egypt. It would also be ISIS' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on American and international hotels in Amman, Jordan, in 2005. But Tunisia is right on Europe's doorstep, just 30 miles across the sea from the southern Italian island of Pantelleria. ISIS has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible. Yet several factors give the claim credence. Firstly, as of late Friday no other group had claimed responsibility. Secondly, Tunisian investigators have established that two members of the cell that carried out the attack trained in the Derna and Benghazi region of Libya late last year. In November, CNN reported that ISIS was running several training camps in the Green Mountains between these two eastern Libyan towns where it was instructing recruits from across North Africa, including Tunisians. Thirdly, up to 3,000 Tunisians have traveled to Syria and Iraq, many to fight with ISIS. Five-hundred are believed to have returned home, including a significant number of trained killers, skilled in handling automatic weapons. The three most powerful new ISIS affiliates are in Egypt, Libya and Nigeria. Last November the Egyptian Sinai-based jihadi group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to ISIS. Bolstered by the return home from Syria of Egyptian ISIS veterans, in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the Sinai and across Egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos. The threat it poses to Western tourists was underlined last summer when it killed an American oil worker in the deserts southwest of Cairo in a carjacking. In Libya, ISIS is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand. Last autumn it established a foothold in eastern Libya, bolstered by the return of 300 Libyan ISIS veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al-Baghdadi. It is now the dominant force in Derna, has a presence in Benghazi and controls part of the town center in Sirte, on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen Egyptian Christians in February. It also has a growing presence in Tripoli, where its fighters in January carried out an attack on the five-star Corinthia hotel that killed several Westerners. In Nigeria, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of Raqqa, ISIS' headquarters town in Syria. Boko Haram hopes it will bring a recruitment, fundraising and propaganda windfall. ""The merger with the Islamic State was a strategic, calculated, and long-term decision coming from the top of the Boko Haram leadership and communications structure,"" wrote Jacob Zenn, an expert on the group, in a just released West Point Combating Terrorism Center study on ISIS' growing array of affiliates. Though military operations by Nigeria and Chad have eroded Boko Haram's safe haven in northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks, the group still has formidable capacity to terrorize the region. A signature tactic: beheading its enemies with chain saws. For reasons of geography, there appear to be fewer organizational ties between ISIS and Boko Haram than between ISIS and its affiliates in Libya and Egypt. ""The numbers of Boko fighters who have fought or trained with ISIS in places such as Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Libya and returned to Nigeria is believed to be small: fewer than 20 fighters and video-propagandists,"" Zenn, who was recently briefed by Nigerian intelligence officials, told CNN. ISIS' expansion into the southern shore of the Mediterranean has alarmed European governments. Italian fishermen operating off the south coast of Italy are so concerned they could be targeted by ISIS gunmen launching from Libya in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the Italian navy. Then there is the threat of trained European fighters returning home from the killing fields of Iraq and Syria. Over 3,000 Europeans have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, many with ISIS. More than 750 have returned. Among their number, according to Belgian counterterrorism officials, was a Belgian terrorist cell dispatched by ISIS from Syria to carry out a major terrorist attack in the heart of Europe. The plot was thwarted when several of the cell were killed in a gunbattle in eastern Belgium in January. European officials told CNN ISIS is increasingly pivoting toward plotting attacks in Europe. There is also concern ISIS could infiltrate non-European Union passport holders into Europe. Last year more than a hundred-thousand refugees arrived in Italy from Libya, according to the United Nations. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned Thursday that Europe faced the greatest terrorist threat in its history, the starkest warning yet from a head of a European government since ISIS set up its caliphate in Syria and Iraq. ""The problem is not if there will be another attempted attack in France and in Europe, but to know when and where,"" he said.","ISIS was only thought to have a fledgling presence in Yemen, but claims responsibility for bombing there .

"(CNN)The United States and Great Britain have pulled their last forces out of strife-torn Yemen, raising fears that the failed state will become even more of a breeding ground for terror groups plaguing the Middle East and the West. Over the weekend, the United States evacuated the last of its special operations forces -- including Navy SEALs and Army Delta Force troops -- amid the deteriorating security situation in the country, the U.S. State Department said. On Monday, a security source in the region familiar with the situation in Yemen told CNN's Nic Robertson that British special forces had also left Yemen in the last few days. The British Ministry of Defence declined to comment. The U.S. move came a day after terrorists bombed two mosques in the capital, Sanaa, on Friday, killing at least 137 and wounding 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. The terror group ISIS, based in Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack. It also followed months of fighting between government forces and Houthi rebels, who on Sunday seized the international airport in Taiz. The rebels now control both the airport and Sanaa. Yemen has been a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, allowing U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk terrorists in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the Middle Eastern nation. While State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said Saturday that the United States would continue to ""take action to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the United States and our citizens,"" the move left some wondering what role the U.S. could play with no forces on the ground. The country closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. ""I don't think there is an active role for the U.S. other than intelligence and trying to see where the dust is going to settle,"" said U.S. Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent who serves on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees. That raises the possibility of the already unstable country becoming an even more fertile environment for terror groups to collaborate, grow and export violence, according to Robin Wright, a security and defense analyst with the Woodrow Wilson Center. ""It's becoming much like Syria, much like Afghanistan was at the peak of its instability,"" she said. On Sunday, U.N. officials said the country appeared to be on a ""rapid downward spiral."" The Security Council again deplored the violence and called for an end to the fighting and for Houthi rebels to return government facilities to the elected government of President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But officials said recent events ""seemed to be leading the country further away from a peaceful settlement and towards the edge of civil war."" In addition to counterterrorism issues, all sorts of geopolitical influences are at work in Yemen -- chief among them the regional power play between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Houthi rebels are Shiites with ties to Iran, who have long felt marginalized in majority Sunni Yemen. Sunni Arab countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council want to limit the influence of Iran, particularly Saudi Arabia, said CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona. ""They believe now that Iran is in control in Beirut, in Damascus, in Baghdad and now on their southern border in Yemen,"" Francona said. ""So the Saudis are beginning to feel a little threatened here and are hoping the Yemen situation doesn't spiral out of control."" The Saudis and other Gulf Arab nations have called for every effort to be made to roll back the Houthi gains and hand full control back to Hadi's government. On Monday, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi criticized regional governments over their stance on the fighting. Al-Houthi said his group was striking back at al Qaeda and ISIS in self defense, and said he found it ""very strange"" that nearby governments would condemn the group for such acts while welcoming the United States, which he called ""the umbrella of tyranny in the world."" Yemen: What you need to know about how we got here . There's little reason to believe the Security Council's calls for peace will have much impact. Last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest, with little effect on the fighting. Last week, a Yemeni jet commanded by the Houthi fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. That same day, Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, Aden Gov. Abdul Aziz Hobtour said. The fighting is taking a huge toll on Yemen's people and economy, said Rafat al Akhali, the country's former youth minister. Aside from the direct impact of fighting, people are losing jobs and businesses are closing, he said. There's still time, he said, to implement a political solution to the crisis. ""I don't think we're past the point of no return yet,"" he said. Francona was less sanguine. ""I don't see anything stopping a major war going on,"" he said. CNN's Hakim Almasmari, Catherine E. Shoichet, Richard Roth and Stephanie Halasz  contributed to this report.","""Saudis are beginning to feel a little threatened here,"" CNN military analyst says .

"(CNN)She stood there, injured and holding a knife, outside her Florida home. That image is horrifying enough, but nothing compared to what police say they found inside. All three of that woman's children were unresponsive when officers encountered them Friday evening, including a 7-year-old girl who was reported dead soon thereafter, according to the Palm Bay police department. One of them, a 6-year-old boy, died later. A 5-month-old boy is seriously injured. Their mother, identified by police as Jessica Lacey McCarty, didn't comply to officers' request that she drop her knife. So officers fired several ""less lethal"" bean bag rounds at her, after which she was taken into custody, according to police. And on Saturday, Palm Bay police announced on the department's Facebook page that McCarty was being charged with two counts of murder in connection with her children's deaths. The 33-year-old woman is also facing an attempted murder charge regarding her infant son, who was in critical condition at a nearby hospital. After initially being taken to a hospital after suffering what police called ""non-life threatening injuries,"" McCarty was moved to the Brevard County Detention Center, where she's being held without bond. She will face a judge within 24 hours to address the charges, according to the Palm Bay post from around midday Saturday. ""A crime like this is beyond words,"" police Capt. Josh Resh said. ""It is unthinkable that someone could do this to innocent children."" Authorities' first indication of trouble came in a 911 call just before 6 p.m. Friday from a woman claiming to have killed her three children. McCarty's boyfriend -- the father of one of the children -- placed his own call to police seconds later, after arriving home to the grim scene. How and why did the children die? Authorities are waiting on results from an autopsy, scheduled for Sunday, to definitively figure that all out. ""We are still trying to verify the sequence of events, how and why they occurred,"" Palm Bay police Lt. Mario Augello said. ""... This is still a very active criminal investigation."" Regardless, the episode shook those in the victims' neighborhood in Palm Bay, which is about 70 miles southeast of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic coast. It started with the sirens and about 10 armed officers coming down the street, telling him to get inside, neighbor Davion Lewis CNN affiliate WESH.

"(CNN)Latest developments: . • Transponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data. • Police searched Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, the city's police spokesman said in televised comments. A team of five investigators went ""through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down,"" police spokesman Markus Niesczery said. Full story: . The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, officials said Thursday. ""We at Lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot,"" said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot, 27-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz, apparently ""wanted to destroy the aircraft."" It's unknown whether Lubitz planned his actions, Robin said. But he ""took advantage"" of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and ""activated the descent,"" which can only be done deliberately. New details released Thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course. Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data. The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds. The captain, somehow locked out of the cockpit, can be heard banging on the door, Robin said. And screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight. For those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains, Robin said, death was instantaneous. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Police searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive. A search is underway for the plane's second ""black box,"" the flight data recorder, which could shed more light on the plane's final minutes. And the French government has asked the FBI to help investigate the crash, a law enforcement official said. Investigators so far say they're baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane . Lufthansa does ""not have any clues,"" Spohr said. The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder. The pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight, Robin said. When the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom, he asked Lubitz to take over. It's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned, or whether Lubitz ""put the lever on lock,"" which would have prevented the code from working, Spohr said. The most plausible explanation of what happened next is that Lubitz, ""through deliberate abstention, refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot, and used the button"" to cause the plane to lose altitude, Robin said. The disaster is not being described as a ""terrorist attack,"" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a ""suicide"" either, Robin said. Spohr agreed: ""If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide,"" he said. Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known, Robin said. 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing . He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the company said. Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen, Germany. He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying, but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone, the prosecutor said. He had passed medical tests, Spohr said. The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady, with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue. Lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired, Spohr said.  The company considers an applicant's psychological state when hiring, he said. The co-pilot was ""fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own,"" Robin said. A man in Montabaur, Germany, who belonged to the same flight club as Lubitz, said he couldn't believe it. ""The way I know Andreas, this is inconceivable,"" Peter Ruecker said. An 8-minute descent to death . Relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished. Seyne-les-Alpes, a nearby town, is serving as a staging post. Mayor Francis Hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area Thursday. Most are not expected to stay overnight, he said. But in case they do, he said, local residents have offered accommodations for them. Lufthansa is providing ""financial support"" to relatives of the victims, Spohr said. He declined to go into details. The families of the two pilots are also in France, Robin said, but they are not in the same place as the passengers' relatives. The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks, he said. While some human remains have been recovered, many have not. The task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather. Workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . The doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday. Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for about eight minutes. The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of about 6,000 feet. Then it crashed. The 144 passengers and six crew members came from 18 countries.  About half were from Germany, and 35 were from Spain. Students, singers among victims . CNN's Catherine E.

"Jerusalem  (CNN)Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as Israel's Prime Minister, declaring victory Wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters. For weeks, Netanyahu's Likud party trailed in opinion polls to the Zionist Union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary Israelis better. Those polls turned out to be wrong. Instead, the Likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee, based on 99% of the vote. Its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government. The Zionist Union came in second, with at least 24 seats. ""Against all odds, against all odds, we achieved this huge victory for Likud,"" Netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed Tuesday. ""We achieved the huge victory for our people.  And I am proud, I am proud for the people of Israel that in the moment of truth, knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things."" Rather than courting voters in the middle, Netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning Israel's security. Two weeks ago, he made a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress warning of any deal with Iran on its nuclear program. Then, a few days ago, he declared there would be no Palestinian state so long as he's Prime Minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the Obama administration's support for a two-state solution. On Tuesday, he released a video on Facebook claiming leftists were bringing ""huge amounts"" of Arabs by bus to vote against Likud. Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. ""The right regime is in danger,"" Netanyahu said. ""We have an urgent wake-up call. Bring your friends, bring your family, vote for Likud."" Those appeals appear ""to have energized that right-wing base,"" according to CNN's Elise Labott. Netanyahu still has to form a new government, a process that President Reuven Rivlin said he hopes will start Sunday. If the Likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave Israel not much different than it was before the election, with a conservative Netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory . Isaac Herzog, who led the Zionist Union, called Netanyahu to concede defeat. But he and fellow opposition leader Tzipi Livni won't go away, with Herzog insisting that ""nothing has changed."" ""This is not the time for coalitions and governments,"" Herzog said, apparently ruling out joining forces with Netanyahu as the Labor Party has done before. ""I think what Israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth. ""And I'm telling everyone, 'Believe, a change will come.' "" Official results will not be released until next week, with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer. No party has ever won a majority of seats in the Knesset, meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of Israel. The victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority. Aaron David Miller, an ex-adviser to the U.S. government on Arab-Israeli negotiations now with the Wilson Center, predicts former Israeli Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon will be the ""kingmaker"" in any coalition government deal based on the support his Kulanu party got Tuesday. How does Israel's parliament work? There's no guarantee Netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister. But he's got a better chance than anyone, and overnight he vowed to work ""quickly and responsibly to form a new government."" ""Our country's everyday reality doesn't give us the luxury for delay,"" Netanyahu said. If he does lead the next government, he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in Israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins. Many woke up Wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that Netanyahu's latest six-year term could be coming to an end. Israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the Zionist Union would win the vote or, at least, finish in a dead heat with Likud. Exit polls from Israel's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck, not the apparent five-seat advantage that Likud appears to have secured. So what happened? Pollster Avi Degani, who predicted a Likud win all along, said other pollsters relied too heavily on Internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone. ""The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,"" Degani said, referring to modern statistical methods. ""It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center."" As Netanyahu's win reverberates, one question remains: Did he gain extra seats because of an 11th-hour surge, or were the major polls skewed from the beginning? Why were the election polls so wrong? Netanyahu maintained hard-line positions on settlements and negotiations with Palestinians, but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic, social and other issues within Israel. Saeb Erakat, the Palestinian chief negotiator with Israel, said, ""The results of the Israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people. ""Such a result would not have been possible had the international community held Israel to account for its systematic violations of international law,"" said Erakat, who works under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The post-election view from Hamas, the Islamist political and militant movement that controls Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, appeared more resigned. ""Hamas doesn't see any difference between the Israeli parties because they all share the denial of our people's rights and keeps assaulting them (people),"" said Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, suggesting that it didn't matter much who prevailed Tuesday. ""We assure that the Palestinian resistance is strong and can impose the facts."" Miller, the Wilson Center scholar, says he doesn't think that Netanyahu will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the Palestinians forming their own state if and when he starts his next term. But that doesn't mean an elusive peace deal is coming anytime soon. ""I think the two-state solution, sadly, is in a Bermuda Triangle, sandwiched between a situation that's too hard for it to be implemented and too important for all of the parties -- including the Prime Minister, despite what he said,"" Miller said. Opinion: The danger of Netanyahu's win . CNN's Oren Liebermann reported from Jerusalem, and Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Larry Register, Dana Ford and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","Expert: Israeli politician Moshe Kahlon may be ""kingmaker"" in coalition government .

"New Delhi (CNN)The quest to be educated in India has literally scaled new heights. Images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair. The incident took place on Wednesday in the state of Bihar, where students were writing their year-end grade 10 examinations. Examples of cheating incidents are not hard to find in India. But, even compared to previous events, this seems to be unprecedented in its blatancy. Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi told reporters that children won't learn if they're constantly helped by family members. ""Government can only hold fair examinations with the help of the parents, society and the children,"" he said. ""This is a collective responsibility."" In a developing economy like India, education is a precious commodity. With more than 1.2 billion people, proper schooling could hold the key for much of the population to get out of a vicious cycle of poverty. Earlier this week, a father in the city of Mathura was caught strapping his 8-year old daughter to a motorcycle after she refused to attend school to take her assessment. Tied with a multi-strand rope to the back of a bike, onlookers captured images of the trussed girl, her bare feet hanging low, scraping the asphalt. According to local police officials, the girl's parents offered her several incentives, such as chocolates and toys to entice her, however when the girl was still reluctant, her father decided to take matters in his own hands. After photos started making the rounds on social media, police officials took the man into custody and charged him with ""breach of the peace."" He is now out on bail. ""Even after he got out, the father showed no remorse. He has five children to feed and he believes the only way they can get out of this poverty trap is through education,"" a senior police official handling the case told CNN. The flaws in India's education system are well-documented. The country has a literacy rate of only 74%, compared to 95% in China. Women suffer particularly badly here; only 64% have formal education. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children, especially daughters, to school and properly educate them. According to the United Nations, India has the largest youth population in the world, with more than a quarter of citizens aged between 10 and 24.","Images of parents sneaking their children cheat sheets have dumbfounded many in India .
Education remains the way out of poverty for millions of young Indians, but the state is failing many of them .

"(CNN)Robert Durst appeared to be prepared for life on the lam when FBI agents arrested him in New Orleans. The millionaire heir, according to court documents, had more than $40,000 in cash with him -- and a neck-to-head latex mask to alter his appearance. The new details about Durst, who's been charged with first-degree murder, emerged Wednesday in court documents supporting a search warrant for his Houston home. It's the latest twist in a whirlwind week for Durst, the subject of HBO's true-crime documentary ""The Jinx."" He's gone from a man battling suspicions that he killed three people to a frail 71-year-old on suicide watch. Durst, whose real estate developer family is among New York's wealthiest, has a net worth of about $100 million and had been withdrawing large sums of money from various bank accounts, including daily withdrawals of $9,000 over 35 days since October, the court documents said. He's being held on drug and weapons charges in Louisiana as he awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face charges in the 2000 killing of his close friend. It's not the first time he's been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. And while he's never been charged in his first wife's 1982 disappearance, her family members say they believe she's dead and that he's the one to blame. FBI agents are also investigating whether Durst could be connected to other unsolved murder cases. The agency is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look. Durst's apparent plans to flee began to unravel on Saturday, after an FBI agent approached him from behind at a New Orleans hotel and said, ""Mr. Durst?"" Although Durst had checked into the hotel under the name ""Everette Ward"" and carried a Texas ID card with that name, he turned around when the agent called him by name, according to court documents. In his hotel room, agents found more than $40,000 in cash, mostly in $100 bills packed into small envelopes, a loaded revolver, the rubber mask that covers the head and neck, his actual birth certificate and passport, and marijuana. On Tuesday, authorities made it clear they weren't done looking into Durst, even though he's behind bars. At the Houston condominium building where Durst owns three units and lived for many years, authorities seized compact discs, bank statements, handwritten notes, credit cards and checks, stationery, a cell phone, boxes of court documents, photos and a trash bag of court transcripts. They also left with copies of books that detail the disappearance of his first wife and his legal troubles: ""Without a Trace"" and paperback and hardcover copies of ""A Deadly Secret."" Journalist Matt Birkbeck, who wrote ""A Deadly Secret,"" said he'd heard Durst read his book, but didn't realize he still had two copies. ""When I first heard that, I was somewhat shocked,"" Birkbeck told CNN, ""and a little disturbed."" The Los Angeles County district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst on Monday. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, in 1982. Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. He's confined to a Louisiana prison's mental health unit after being deemed a danger to himself. On Tuesday, an appeals court granted a request from the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office to move Durst to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center's mental health unit in St. Gabriel, about an hour's drive from New Orleans. Lawyers for the sheriff's office argued that the jail where Durst was being held until Tuesday night can't accommodate inmates with acute mental health conditions. The appeals court agreed. Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin said he ""did not believe"" his client was mentally ill, and that he should remain in Orleans Parish to give the legal team better access to him before a evidentiary hearing scheduled for Monday. DeGuerin has said it's no coincidence authorities arrested Durst the day before the HBO documentary's final episode aired. He said he wasn't surprised about the search of his Texas condo, either. ""They're acting like a bunch of Keystone Kops, particularly after being embarrassed by the TV program,"" he said. ""And I'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever."" Authorities have been mum about what evidence led them to arrest Durst on Saturday, the day before the finale of ""The Jinx"" aired. Court documents reveal some details about their case against him. Four forensic experts concluded a letter sent to police telling them to search for a cadaver in Berman's home was likely written by Durst. For viewers of the HBO documentary, that might not come as a surprise. In ""The Jinx,"" Berman's stepson stumbles upon a signed letter from Durst to Berman's home in Beverly Hills. The handwriting looks similar to the ""cadaver"" letter that tipped off police to the killing, and both letters misspell the word as ""Beverley."" In the documentary, Durst denies he has anything to do with writing the ""cadaver"" letter, and that he has anything to do with Berman's death. Court documents mention another anonymous letter, sent from New York in January 2001, to a Los Angeles police detective. It was titled ""Possible motive for Susan Berman murder"" and stated that Berman suspected Durst of being involved in his wife's disappearance. It also said Durst planned to visit Berman around the time of her death. In a 2003 murder trial, Durst admitted he'd killed neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, and chopped up the body. He was acquitted after his attorneys argued he had acted in self-defense, though he later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case. DeGuerin told reporters Monday that his client didn't kill Berman. ""He's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial,"" DeGuerin said. It's not clear when a trial would take place. Durst waived his right to fight extradition to Los Angeles, but because prosecutors in New Orleans are pursuing charges against him, he remains jailed there. Investigators believe he planned to travel from New Orleans to Cuba, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators found a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and about 147 grams (5.2 ounces) of marijuana in Durst's hotel room in New Orleans, according to court documents. He was booked on charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance. Court documents filed Tuesday say Durst will receive medications while imprisoned, ""including but not limited to hydrocodone as needed for pain."" CNN's Evan Perez, Chandler Friedman, Jeremy Grisham, Dave Alsup, Holly Yan, Chris Welch, Shimon Prokupecz and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","The FBI is looking into unsolved murder cases in areas where Robert Durst has lived .

"(CNN)The death of the founding father of Singapore last Monday is an appropriate occasion to reflect on nation building. As prime minister for its first three decades, Lee Kuan Yew raised a poor port from the bottom rungs of the third world to the first world in a single generation. As it prepares to mark its 50th anniversary as a nation, Singapore is today an ultra-modern metropolis of almost six million people with higher per capita GDP than the United States, according to the World Bank. Lee's achievement in building a successful nation contrasts sharply with the results of Washington's expenditure of over $4 trillion and nearly 7,000 American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. Some say Singapore's story is sui generis: Something that could only happen in that time and place. But its remarkable performance has less to do with miraculous conditions than with Lee's model of disciplined, visionary leadership. Leaders of other aspiring-to-develop nations, and even the U.S., should take pages from Lee Kuan Yew's playbook to address current challenges. We know many of Lee's lessons on the role of government leadership in development because my co-authors and I asked him directly two years ago to reflect on them -- points we captured in our book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World. Five stand out. First, Lee insisted that governance was first and foremost about results. In his words, ""the acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts, but whether, in fact, it is able to produce order and justice."" About the core purposes of government, he was crystal clear. In terms America's founding fathers would recognize, he believed that ""the ultimate test of the value of a political system is whether it helps that society establish conditions which improve the standard of living for the majority of its people, plus enabling the maximum of personal freedoms compatible with the freedoms of others in society."" Second, superior performance requires superior leadership. Lee demanded of leaders both intellectual and moral superiority. Contrary to modern Western democratic theory that emphasizes citizens' participation in governance, his views were closer to Plato's conception of the ""guardians,"" or China's historical Mandarins. Good government requires most of all leaders who put the public good unquestionably above their own personal interests. He was disappointed by many of his counterparts who failed that test. Third, successful societies guarantee strict equality of opportunity for all individuals, but are realistic about the fact that this will yield substantial inequalities in outcomes. For Lee, the essence of a successful society was intense competition on a level playing field that allows each individual to achieve his or her maximum. Few things offended him more than denial of equality of opportunity on the basis of caste (India), class (Europe), race (the U.S. during segregation), sex, or other irrelevant attributes. As he put it, the leader's objective was to ""build up a society in which people will be rewarded not according to the amount of property they own, but according to their active contribution to society in physical or mental labor."" Fourth, about democracy, particularly Western liberal democracy, Lee had serious reservations. In part, this attitude stemmed from his own experience, but it also reflected a deeper philosophical aversion to ideologies. As he liked to say, ""the acid test is performance, not promises. The millions dispossessed in Asia care not and know not of theory. They want a better life. They want a more equal, just society."" Lee enjoyed engaging American critics who insisted that without democracy Singapore could not develop an advanced economy. In contrast, he argued that what most countries needed was more ""discipline,"" rather than democracy. He noted that the U.S. had been building democracy and giving aid to the Philippines for over a century. But, he asked, how many people from Singapore sought to leave it for the Philippines? Many people in the Philippines, he noted, wanted to move to Singapore. On one occasion, with a broad smile, he continued, ""and you will notice that since the Vietnam War and the Great Society, the U.S. system has not functioned even for the United States."" Fifth, which leaders did he most admire? From the recent past, he focused on three: Charles de Gaulle, Deng Xiaoping, and Winston Churchill. ""De Gaulle, because he had tremendous guts; Deng, because he changed China from a broken-backed state, which would have imploded like the Soviet Union, into what it is today; and ""Churchill, because any other person would have given up."" On the current scene, the leader who impressed him most was the new president of China, Xi Jinping. As he said just before Xi took office: ""I would put him in Nelson Mandela's class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings to affect his judgment. In a word, he is impressive."" As China's leaders attempt to follow in Lee's footsteps in building a Mandarin-Leninist led nation that overtook the U.S. last year in GDP (measured by PPP) to become the world's largest economy, and democratic India seems poised to grow at rates that will compete with China, we can reflect on lessons from Lee Kuan Yew and place our bets. Governing a nation in which two of every three citizens believe their country is headed in the wrong direction -- and have believed so under Democratic and Republican Presidents for all of the 21st century -- American leaders should ask whether it is time to focus on the acid test of performance rather than the litmus test of ideology.","In Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew had remarkable success in creating a prosperous modern state .
His lessons should prove instructive to other leaders in a time of great instability, writes Graham Allison .
Lee passed on his insights on the role of government leadership in development to Allison ."
"(CNN)Stylists, a fashion commentator and a luxury-brand exec are speaking out about a movement that sneers at Hollywood's implicit deal: gratis gowns in exchange for money or mentions. Not surprisingly, fashion designers providing free couture dresses don't exactly feel the same way. ""Because it has now become a thing where people spend months and make five dresses for them,"" Tom Ford has said. ""If you wear one of those dresses and a company has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars or has paid you, then yeah, you say who it is."" In other words, ladies who look like a million bucks (and have been paid that much or more from deals with brands like Dior or Chanel) can't expect not to be asked about what they're wearing. Reese Witherspoon supports #AskHerMore: ""It's hard being a woman in Hollywood"" Notes Hollywood stylist Cristina Ehrlich of awards-season red carpets: ""These women in many cases are being paid a great deal of money to wear these dresses. It's serious business. Is this the venue to get into baby seals or Save the Whales? I'm not sure it fits."" One vice president of a major European fashion house asks: ""If you asked these actresses straight out, 'Which is more important to you, the money you're paid to wear these dresses or talking about issues?' They'd take the money any time, believe me."" Is red carpet coverage sexist? Battle lines drawn at Oscars over #AskHerMore . Stylist Karla Welch suggests a two-pronged response: ""How about ask her both? Feminism and turning it out on the carpet shouldn't be mutually exclusive. There needed to be a backlash to mani-cams and, to be honest, there could be some better journalism from fashion experts."" Outgoing Fashion Police host Kathy Griffin agrees: ""Any actress can choose to steer the conversation. The worst [media] can do is nervously cut to commercial. I support any movement that gives women increased power from where their only recourse was just to wear Spanx and smile. Men, however, should be asked exclusively about their penis size.""

""We are glad the court has granted the stay because it provides current stability in Nebraska's marriage licensing process,"" Attorney General Doug Peterson said in a statement.

"(CNN)Three teen British girls suspected of traveling to Syria to join ISIS appeared on surveillance video in Turkey before they went to their destination. Images show the teens boarding a bus in Istanbul, Turkish HBR television reported. It's the first sighting of the girls since they left London almost two weeks ago. Authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in Turkey and believe they have crossed into neighboring Syria, parts of which have been taken over by Islamist terror group ISIS. The three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. A British counterterrorism officer said police had tried to reach out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media to persuade them to return home. The girls' parents have also publicly begged for them to come home. Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. An attorney for the Mahmood family said the family was ""surprised, horrified"" that the contact had not prompted police action ""because they understood that Aqsa's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services."" ""And the real concern that arises is that if a known member of ISIS who's now a poster girl for ISIS, seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda, is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families, to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to Syria,"" Aamer Anwar said. The Mahmood family condemned their daughter's actions, describing them ""as a perverted and evil distortion"" of Islam. But they also said the UK security services ""have serious questions to answer"" over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls got in touch with her. Turkey has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join Syria's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted  more than three years ago. Initially, Ankara maintained an ""open door policy,"" allowing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to flee to safety in Turkey. Turkish border guards looked the other way, taking few steps to stop activists, volunteers and journalists from crossing into Syria. But with the rise of the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS in Syria, the Turkish government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through Turkey to get into Syria. Some critics have accused Ankara of actively supporting ISIS against rival Kurdish rebel groups, charges the Turkish government has angrily denied. Last year, the Turkish government showed CNN new barricades, thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border. Historically, the Turkish-Syrian border, which runs more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), has been notoriously difficult for Turkish security forces to control. Before the Syrian civil war, both smugglers and Kurdish separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries. Turkish government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining ISIS. Millions of tourists visit Turkey every year, where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries.","The teens are believed to have made it to war-torn Syria .

"London (CNN)Archaeologists have started excavating about 3,000 skeletons from the Bedlam burial ground in London, used from 1569 to at least 1738. Also known as Bethlem and the New Churchyard, more than 20,000 Londoners are believed to have been buried there. The ground was used by ""a varied cross-section of society throughout the years since the burial ground was open,"" Nick Elsden, project manager from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) told CNN. And they include those who could not afford a church burial or chose to perish there for religious or political reasons. The ground also contained the overflow of bodies when other cemeteries became full. Bedlam, now a synonym for chaos, took its name from the Hospital of St Mary of Bethlehem in London which nursed the mentally ill. Among the deceased are victims of the English Civil War, the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in the following year. The site was found at an entrance of the city's new Liverpool Street Crossrail station -- part of a £14.8 billion ($22 billion) project that will expand London's railway network. A team of 60 archaeologists will work six days a week on the project, expected to finish in September this year. Hundreds of skeletons found under Paris supermarket . Elsden said the excavation reveals a great deal about how Londoners lived from the 16th to the 18th century. ""A large sample of the population from that period will enable us to look at the lifestyle, looking at Roman London and what the Romans were doing in the suburb area, outside the city walls."" He said the skeletons will be cleaned and closely examined by experts who will assess their remains to determine their diseases, ages and sexes. ""Specialists will look at the DNA of the disease that killed the person rather than their own DNA,"" he added. Roman skulls unearthed deep beneath London . The findings are timely as well -- this year marks the 350th anniversary of the Great Plague in London. ""1665 was the very last recorded episode of plague. There were 400 years of regular plague, and suddenly it stops,"" Jay Carver, Crossrail's lead archaeologist, said. ""And what we want to be able to find out, from sampling the graves of that date, is why that is. And what it is about the bacteria that causes bubonic plague that suddenly changed at that point."" Londoners also assisted in the research by helping to search parish records to identify people who were buried in Bedlam. ""And that was a huge exercise which couldn't have possibly been done by our own team,"" Carver said. Skeletons found holding hands after 700 years . The result is a database of more than 5,300 names and backgrounds of those buried at Bedlam, including political activists John Lilburne and Robert Lockyer -- part of a movement known as the Levellers --as well as Ambrose Nicholas, the Lord Mayor of London in 1575. A Roman road that runs underneath the site has already produced artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns. Carver describes the Bedlam dig as a personal career highlight. ""[It's a] great use of an engineering scheme, but at the same time addresses the historical importance of each these sites.""

"(CNN)Racist emails -- like one that depicted President Obama as a chimpanzee -- resulted in three Ferguson, Missouri, city employees resigning or being fired, the city spokesman said Friday. Police officers Capt. Rick Henke and Sgt. William Mudd resigned Thursday over the emails discovered during the U.S. Department of Justice investigation of racial prejudice in the city's police and judicial system, city spokesman Jeff Small said on Friday, citing the city attorney. The city's top court clerk, Mary Ann Twitty, was fired earlier this week in connection with the emails, Small said. Several employees forwarded the emails but until now none had been disciplined, the report said. Examples of the racist emails include one sent in October 2011 that showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption ""Michelle Obama's High School Reunion."" A June 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were ""mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no ... clue who their Daddies are."" Some critics have called for the department to be disbanded and for Police Chief Thomas Jackson to resign. In a Friday interview with CNN's Sara Sidner, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Jackson was not copied on any of the emails. When asked if Jackson and the city manager may be fired, Knowles said, ""We're going to do our due diligence and hold people accountable."" Knowles also said he doesn't think the department will be disbanded. When asked about what happens next in Ferguson, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday, ""We are prepared to use all the power that we have, all the power that we have to ensure that the situation changes there.  And that means everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure."" When a reporter asked if that included dismantling the police force, Holder replied, ""If that's what's necessary then we are prepared to do that."" Holder ordered the investigation after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown last summer, setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside St. Louis. The DOJ declined to bring charges against Wilson, who has since left the force. No state charges were filed either. In a separate report, the Justice Department described what it said was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans by the Ferguson police and municipal courts. That discrimination included racist emails. Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67% African-American. Among the findings in the report: . From 2012 to 2014, 85% of people subject to vehicle stops by Ferguson police were African-American, 90% of those who received citations were black, and 93% of people arrested were black. In 88% of the cases in which Ferguson police officers reported using force, it was against African-Americans. From 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. President Obama said Friday that although he doesn't think the abuses of power in Ferguson are typical of America, there are individuals and possibly whole departments in American law enforcement that may struggle to prevent prejudice in their ranks. ""I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,"" Obama said in an early morning interview on SiriusXM's Urban View channel. ""I think there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement has broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure they are protecting, serving all people, and not just some."" Knowles has outlined a number of reforms the city implemented to address some of the Justice Department's concerns, and said the city ""must do better"" to address racism. ""We must all work to address issues of racial disparity in all aspects of our society,"" he said Wednesday. Ferguson police chief mum on federal report .

"(CNN)You would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as Alexander McQueen. A favorite with A-listers and fashion editors alike, he was renowned for his Gothic sensibilities, innovative textiles (think shells, horns and hair) and highly conceptual runway shows, as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes. (Along with the usual drinks, drugs and parties, he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for Prince Charles.) Five years after his death, interest in the designer hasn't waned, least of all in his home town of London, where, starting this month, he's being commemorated with an extensive, expensive retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, a re-staging of the 2011 exhibition at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, summarizes and contextualizes McQueen's 18-year career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories. ""Savage Beauty at the V&A is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged,"" said curator Claire Wilcox at a press preview. The V&A has already sold 70,000 advanced tickets, and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand. At the Met, Savage Beauty attracted over 660,000 visitors by the end of its four-month run, making it one of the museum's top 10 exhibitions of all time, up there with a King Tut stop in 1978 and a Mona Lisa loan in 1963. Bringing Savage Beauty to London can be seen as a ""homecoming,"" as it was described by V&A director Martin Roth at the press preview, if not an act of repatriation. The son of cab driver and a school teacher, Alexander ""Lee"" McQueen grew up in London's East End. After dropping out of school at 16, he honed his tailoring skills on Savile Row, graduated with an MA in fashion design from the city's prestigious Central Saint Martins college, and used the V&A's archives to research his collections. He once said of London: ""It's where my heart is, and where I get my inspiration."" That love was largely reciprocated. In 2011, thousands of British devotees petitioned to have Savage Beauty brought to London after its spectacular New York debut. Fashion journalist Melanie Rickey was one of the most vocal proponents. A longtime fan, she has coauthored the upcoming release Inferno: Alexander McQueen (Laurence King), a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer Kent Baker, which documents March 1996 collection Dante. ""I was agitated because (Savage Beauty) really is meant to be in his hometown,"" Rickey says. ""Everything about him is London, so to not have it in London would have been a crime."" Along with hounding the brand's corporate honchos and the V&A itself, Rickey started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city, and instigated the Twitter hashtag #BringMcQueenExhibitionHome. ""It's like the (Elgin) Marbles: They're probably a lot more powerful in Greece than they are sitting in the British Museum."" Ultimately, such advocacy may have been unnecessary. According to Kate Bethune, senior exhibition research assistant for Savage Beauty, it had been Roth's ambition to bring the exhibition to London since he assumed the directorship in September 2011. The V&A exhibition, which was announced last April, even begins with a newly added London gallery dedicated to McQueen's roots in the city and his early shows. Curators called on Sam Gainsbury, who produced all of McQueen's shows from 1996 on, to act as the exhibition's creative director and bring McQueen's pieces to life. ""A lot of (McQueen's) colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show,"" Bethune says. ""He always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going."" The most theatrical highlights include the Romantic Primitivism gallery, covered with fake bones like an ossuary, and a blacked-out room where a Kate Moss hologram floats in a diaphanous dress, trapped in a glass pyramid. The room-sized Cabinet of Curiosities has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows: women walk on water, a model's gown is spray-painted by robotic arms, a church is converted into a catwalk. But Bethune believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials, which blur the line between fashion and art. Fairytale gowns feature throughout and there's a whole section dedicated to McQueen's tailoring skills, but it's the garments made from razor clam shells, pheasant feathers, and synthetic hair; or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout. The accessories -- extravagant headpieces, Swarovski mesh chain mail, impossible shoes -- seem like sculptures. ""McQueen was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion,"" she says. ""He absolutely changed the way we look at fashion."" Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty runs from March 14 - August 2, 2015 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

"(CNN)Scientists have raised concerns about a large, rapidly thinning glacier in Antarctica, warning it could contribute significantly to rising sea levels. They say they've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge Totten Glacier and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting. The glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in East Antarctica. It contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by at least 11 feet (3.4 meters), according to researchers from the University of Texas at Austin who were among the authors of a new study published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience. Scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier. But until now, they had found no evidence that it could threaten coastal ice. ""We now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in East Antarctica to access the most sensitive areas of Totten Glacier,"" said Jamin Greenbaum, a University of Texas Ph.D. candidate and the lead author of the study. The two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why Totten Glacier has been melting so fast. Scientists have already warned about the consequences of melting ice in West Antarctica. NASA said last year that glacial retreat in some areas ""appears unstoppable."" The increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in Totten Glacier is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The United Nations' report on climate change last year estimated sea levels could rise between 1 foot and 3 feet by 2100. Such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world. But that calculation doesn't factor in the latest research on Antarctica. ""While the Totten melt may take several centuries, once change has begun our analysis reveals it would likely be irreversible,"" Greenbaum said in comments cited by the Australian Antarctic Division. To prevent the process from becoming unstoppable, atmospheric and oceanic conditions would need to change so that snowfall outpaces coastal melting, the researchers said. The scientists gathered their data through a series of aerial surveys using technology that can scan the ice and seafloors in areas that are inaccessible to icebreakers. The team included researchers from the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.","New study reveals openings that threaten huge glacier with warm water .

"(CNN)Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, ""First and foremost I am,"" consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on ""the beauty and diversity of mankind"" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. ""I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world."" The title of the series, ""First and foremost I am,"" comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. ""I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora,"" Jonsdottir writes. ""I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies."" Jonsdottir goes on to say, ""Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?"" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects ""to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together."" The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot. ""My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness.""","Sigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old .

"(CNN)England footballer Adam Johnson has been suspended by his club Sunderland until a police investigation has been completed, the Press Association reported Monday. Sunderland's statement made no mention of why Johnson had been arrested, but earlier on Monday, a northeast England police force confirmed a 27-year-old man was in custody ""on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16,"" though Durham Constabulary would not confirm if the individual in question was the Sunderland player. ""He remains in police custody and is helping officers with their inquiries,"" added the statement, referring to the 27-year-old man. ""Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation.

English Premier League club Sunderland refused to comment when contacted by CNN over the arrest of the 27-year-old Johnson. The last of his 12 international appearances for the senior England team was in August 2012. He started his career with Sunderland's local rival Middlesbrough, making his debut at the age of 17, and was sold to Manchester City for a reported fee of £7 million ($10.8 million) in early 2010. Johnson helped City to win the 2011-12 Premier League title but was bought by his hometown team Sunderland for a reported £10 million ($15.3 million) at the start of the following season.","A 27-year-old man arrested on ""suspicion of sexual activity"" with a 15-year-old girl .

"(CNN)""Completely false."" That's how police are responding to allegations that they beat the man arrested for shooting two police officers during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, last week. Jeffrey Williams, 20, has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity. Police have said he admitted to firing the shots that struck the officers. But Williams' lawyer says he has little confidence in such statements. ""He's scared. You know, this has been pretty traumatic for him,"" attorney Jerryl Christmas said about his client on Monday. ""One thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that I noticed that I'm very concerned about. It appears that whatever statements he made, he was without the advice of counsel, and when I look at the bruising, it's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made."" Christmas told CNN that Williams has bruising across his back, and a knot on his head. ""He said he was bruised by the police when he was taken into custody. And he was in a lot of pain when he was being questioned,"" Christmas said. ""They used a lot of force on him."" Opinion: Why would you want to be a cop? Police deny the accusation. ""With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was 'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls these allegations completely false,"" Sgt. Brian Schellman said in a statement. ""Immediately following the arrest, arresting officers transported Williams to St. Louis County Police Headquarters where he was interviewed by Crimes Against Persons Detectives. This entire interview was video and audio recorded."" Schellman also said that Williams was seen by a nurse, who released Williams as ""fit for confinement."" Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, according to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who said it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, ""which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered"" at the scene of the shooting. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they ""buy"" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. The tough task ahead for Ferguson's next police chief . After speaking to his client, Christmas said that it's clear to him there was no intent to target police. For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted. According to his attorney, Williams was not part of the protest community, and does not have a history of violence. ""I clearly think that we don't have the right person in custody,"" Christmas said.

"(CNN)The campaign to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, involves a curious mixture of Iraqi forces -- the army and air force, federal police, powerful Shia militia  as well as Sunni tribal fighters. It's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure. And that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army. A CNN team that's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that Iraqi army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the Shia militia, notably Hadi al Ameri, leader of the Badr Organization. Iranian military advisers are on hand, and highly influential on the battlefield. As ISIS fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands, it might seem odd that the Iraqi army is unable to take them on alone. After all, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of U.S. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment, bases and training. So just why are the ISF incapable of reclaiming territory seized by ISIS? And how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet? The answers go back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003; Iraq's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade. One of the most controversial acts of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein, was to disband the Iraqi army. The decision, taken in May 2003, ""immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the U.S. occupiers,"" as James P. Pfiffner put it in 2010. President George W. Bush told his biographer Robert Draper in 2006: ""The policy had been to keep the [Iraqi] army intact; didn't happen."" The reasons have been disputed ever since. In some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers; at the same time training of Iraqi police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency. In 2004, as in 2014, the security forces buckled as a Sunni insurgency spread through northern and western Iraq. Billions of dollars were spent creating a new Iraqi army from scratch. But it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions, so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away. Over a seven-year period, more than $4 billion was spent on renovating and building Iraqi bases. Logistical and maintenance support: $2.6 billion. Supply of equipment: $3.4 billion (in addition to what the Iraqis bought themselves.) Training and staffing the Iraqi police: a cool $9.4 billion. With U.S. assistance and the ""Sons of Iraq"" program to coax Sunni tribes into fighting al Qaeda in Iraq, violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010. But once U.S. forces left at the end of 2011, and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs, things began to unravel. By then, the Iraqi security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty. The only effective units were special forces such as the Golden Division. Sophisticated U.S. equipment, such as M-1 Abrams battle tanks, was not maintained. Corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially. As then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013, the high command of the Iraqi military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-Maliki prized above competence. He bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies. The Institute for the Study of War reported in 2013, ""the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-Maliki to choose his preferred officers (nearly all Shia) to head the most significant command positions in Iraq."" Al-Maliki also began integrating Shia militia into army units. At the same time, the phenomenon of ""ghost soldiers"" went unchecked -- men who were either dead or AWOL but whose wages were still being paid, often to corrupt commanders. So the army, in numbers, looked much stronger than it was. In fact, by the time ISIS rolled south, the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000. Nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as ISIS fighters stormed south from Syria in the early summer of 2014. ISIS used speed, discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the Iraqi army didn't have. It had also cultivated allies among members of Sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column, and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee. The desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to Shia shrines in Samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of Shia militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the Badr Organization and the Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-Assad regime in Syria. In June, the most respected religious authority among Iraqi Shi'ites, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed to Iraqis to mobilize against the enemy.  The call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of Shia, determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. The militia -- called al Hashed al Shabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) -- were trained, equipped and most importantly led by Iranian military advisers and quickly became battle hardened. What they lacked in military skills, they made up for in determination. The Iranians have invested heavily in the PMUs. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, seems to have spent more time in Iraq than Iran since last summer and has been photographed around Tikrit. According to several analysts, it is Suleimani that has been organizing and directing the Shia militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations. Christopher Harmer of the Institute for the Study of War says the role of both the Iranians and the Shia militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the ISF. And he says that ""if the Tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the Iraqi government's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the Iranians and the PMU are going to demand payback."" The role of Suleimani and al Quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in Washington's view -- means that US airpower has not been made available. ""The U.S. may not like Iranian influence in Iraq,"" says Harmer, ""but what it absolutely cannot do is provide direct support to an Iranian-led military operation."" The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, alluded to the dilemma when in Baghdad on Monday. ""What I'm trying to sort out, actually, is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they're receiving from Iran is a reaction to the existential threat [posed by ISIS], or whether it is something longer-term,"" he said. Soon after taking office, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement. At the time a statement on his website stressed ""the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels."" U.S.-led efforts to train a new Iraqi army designed to defeat ISIS are well underway. The aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of Kurdish peshmerga. These should be ready for operations by the end of this year; the first brigade has already completed basic training. But as Harmer notes, ""the Iraqi Security Forces are yet to go head-to-head with ISIS and win without help from the PMUs. ISIS is demonstrably more capable than the ISF."" Clearing ISIS from well-entrenched defenses around Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, seems well beyond the army's capability. In November, Gen. Dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city. That's problematic for several reasons. Kurdish officials told CNN last month that the longer the battle for Mosul is delayed, the tougher it will be. They claim that they cannot maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely. The Iraqi government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there. But above all, the need for Shia militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely Sunni cities is fraught with peril. Human Rights Watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against Sunni communities by the militia. Tikrit is an especially sensitive area: in June last year, ISIS massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority Shia, at Camp Speicher. Some families of the murdered recruits, and a few survivors, have claimed local Sunni tribes may have helped ISIS or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage. HRW Middle East Deputy Director Joe Stork says that ""past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter."" Tit-for-tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides. ISIS' use of children: Propaganda and military training . During the Tikrit operation, both Prime Minister al Abadi and Hadi al Ameri of the Badr Organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected. Only when the city is taken, will we know whether their appeals were heeded. Harmer says he believes a majority of Iraqis want to see their country survive; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war. But it remains a possibility. One of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the Shiite militia and Sunni tribal brigades into the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than have them operate as independent armies. They are meant to constitute a new National Guard, but the mechanics and timing remain problematic. The leaders of these militia have tasted power; their men have shed blood. They are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when ISIS are beaten. And they won't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come.

In a remote part of Central Australia, the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on Earth, spreading over an area 400 kilometers (250 miles) wide. ""The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time,"" said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University. The team published its research in the journal Tectonophysics this month. The crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago. But Glikson said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research. Traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the Earth's crust, under an area near the borders of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. ""There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below,"" Glikson said. The researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened. The surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old, according to the team, but they haven't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes. A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks. But the researchers say they haven't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago. ""It's a mystery -- we can't find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years,"" Glikson said. The discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the Earth's history. ""Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought,"" Glikson said. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report.","Two pieces of asteroid crashed into Australia many millions of years ago .

"(CNN)In the past eight months, ISIS has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe. Indicative of this was the announcement on Saturday that the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram had pledged its ""allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims,"" ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. The global spread of ISIS raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror. It also has important implications for the debate in Congress over Obama's request for a new authorization to fight ISIS. Lt. Col. Michael Waltz, a U.S. Special Forces reserve officer who has just returned to the States after advising the Nigerian Ministry of Defence in its fight against Boko Haram, told me, ""So far the pledge (to ISIS) seems to be legit."" Waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge, because Boko Haram has recently come under effective attacks by Nigerian forces allied with the armies of neighboring African countries that are also threatened by the group: ""Some folks in the region are saying it's a sign of desperation, as the regional offensive by Nigeria and its neighbors has knocked Boko Haram on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries. The Chadians have been particularly effective."" But Waltz also says there is some evidence that the Boko Haram pledge to ISIS ""has been in the works for some time."" The group's increasing alignment with ISIS is demonstrated by Boko Haram's recent beheadings of its victims and its more professionally edited video releases of recent weeks that have mimicked ISIS' slick videos. Virginia Comolli, whose book ""Boko Haram: Nigeria's Islamist Insurgency,"" will be published next month, agrees that the more sophisticated Boko Haram media releases of the past couple of months point to ""some sort of inspiration"" that Boko Haram is drawing from ISIS and that recent beheadings ""might also be a form of copycat but, I shall note, they are not completely new"" for Boko Haram. Comolli also emphasized to me, ""lately the government had been able to take back a number of towns under Boko Haram control. Boko Haram has always been very resilient and adaptable, changing and upping its game when needed. The pledge might be exactly that: Boko Haram has recently suffered some serious blows and feels it needs to try something different to strengthen its position."" Some 5,000 have died in Boko-related violence during the past half-decade, while more than 1.5 million have been forced out of their homes, but Boko has generally not attacked Western targets. Its affiliation with ISIS could change that although, for the moment, it's not clear how the Boko-ISIS alliance would work from an operational standpoint. Hilary Matfess, a researcher at the Nigeria Social Violence Project at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told me, ""Boko Haram would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to ISIS, but it's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that ISIS could provide an African affiliate."" Since August, Boko Haram is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for ISIS or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter, a Virginia-based company that tracks terrorist organizations. Of most concern are the groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS, since this allows ISIS some measure of command and control over these organizations and also means that these groups will likely more closely align with ISIS' goal of creating a caliphate across the Muslim world as soon as feasible and use the most reprehensible of tactics to do so. In addition to Boko Haram, terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen have pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter. What could this mean for the wider jihadist terrorist movement? It's worth taking a closer look at how the Libyan branch of ISIS, which affiliated with it in November, has played out on the ground in Libya. A senior U.S. government official told me that there is some debate in the U.S. intelligence community about whether ISIS' Libyan affiliate is more of a ""wannabe"" ISIS, and a ""rebranding"" of a local group that wanted to take advantage of ISIS' fearsome brand, than a group that takes orders from ISIS central command in Syria and Iraq. On January 27, ISIS gunmen attacked the Corinthian Hotel in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, killing 10. Five of the victims were foreigners and one was an American. And last month ISIS released a video showing members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority being beheaded on a Libyan beach, apparently by members of ISIS' Libyan affiliate. The video showed the victims in the orange jumpsuits that ISIS forces its victims to wear. Both the attack on the Corinthian Hotel and the beheading of the Christians do suggest some measure of command and control by ISIS' core of its Libyan affiliate, according to the U.S. government official, who says Libyan fighters frequently go back and forth between Libya and Syria and Iraq. The increasing globalization of ISIS raises some interesting questions for the Obama administration and for Congress. Last month Obama put forward a proposal for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force specifically targeting ISIS. Obama's AUMF proposal mentions combating ISIS in its heartland of Syria and Iraq, but it doesn't mention the dozen other countries where ISIS now has a presence or foothold. Interventionist Republicans will likely want to see an AUMF that specifically targets other groups allied to ISIS that are outside of Syria and Iraq. Many Democrats will be uncomfortable about such an expansion. The ball is now in Congress' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against ISIS should be. It will be an interesting debate: on one side, those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already America's longest war, against jihadist terrorist groups like ISIS that have affiliates from Algeria to Afghanistan; and, on the other, those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space. Given the fact that a broadly written AUMF that was passed in the days after 9/11 has allowed the United States to conduct military operations in half a dozen Muslim countries over the course of the past 14 years, a new authorization that specifies both a sunset provision and also a specific geographic scope would be a useful check on executive power. And such an authorization could be amended if a substantial new threat from an ISIS affiliate emerges.","Bergen: Boko Haram is the latest of terrorist groups in 12 countries to pledge allegiance to ISIS .

"Manila (CNN)Forty years ago, one of the greatest boxing matches in history took place in an unlikely setting: the capital of the Philippines. Muhammad Ali's epic win over great rival Joe Frazier in 1975 became known as the ""Thrilla in Manila."" Four decades later, and a crowd is gathered at the same venue in this sweating, sprawling city -- known as the Araneta Coliseum -- for a very different contest: a basketball game between two of the country's pro teams. And yet, the Coliseum cannot seem to escape its boxing legacy. The most famous athlete on court today just happens to be a boxer. Manny ""the Pacman"" Pacquiao is the coach, as well as one of the shortest players on the roster at just five foot, six inches (168cm) tall, of team Kia Carnival. But the Filipino is best known around the world as one of the greatest boxers of his generation, the first fighter to win championship belts in eight different weight divisions. But despite his on-court distraction, he's not finished in the ring. Pacquiao is little more than two months away from the most highly anticipated battle of his career.  On May 2, he will finally go toe to toe with American welterweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in Las Vegas -- the fight most boxing fans have wanted to see for years. But for today, he seems more concerned that Kia Carnival trails several points behind the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters. In the locker room, Pacquiao, who only played for a few unremarkable minutes in the second quarter, gives a short half-time speech to fire up his players. He speaks mostly in Tagalog, the main language of the Philippines, peppering his locker room speech with English expressions like ""offense"" and  ""man-to-man defense."" Seemingly inspired, the team charges back on court shortly after. Surprisingly, Pacquiao says he gets more nervous on the basketball court than when he faces a barrage of punches in the ring. ""My hands [get] cold!"" he says with a laugh, while rubbing both hands together in the air. ""I believe in my heart that my second sport is basketball,"" he says later, explaining that it is a vital part of his cross-training for boxing. But he adds that he's choosing to spend fewer minutes playing in professional basketball games these days to avoid injuries ahead of the Mayweather showdown. ""I can say [this will be] one of the most important fights in my career,"" Pacquiao says, during an exclusive interview with CNN. We speak at his cavernous home in a wealthy, gated community in Manila. He is dressed in shorts, flip-flops and a red Nike t-shirt with his photo on it accompanied by the slogan ""Spirit. Soul. Body.""  A diamond-crusted gold watch glitters on his wrist. Several giant paintings bearing quotations from the Old Testament decorate the walls. The Mayweather fight ""has been five years in the making,"" he says. ""And finally it's happening.  I think the fans deserve it."" In fact, if it wasn't for a chance encounter at another basketball game, the Mayweather and Pacquiao camps may never have agreed to a fight. Last January, the two boxers happened to attend the same Miami Heat game in Florida. Pacquiao says the meeting in Miami gave both sides ""confidence to push"" for the fight. In doing so, the 36 year old says he's fulfilling the wishes of the two eldest of his five children. ""My son and my daughter, they really wanted this fight to happen,"" he tells us. ""Three years ago [they said] 'Daddy, I want you to fight Mayweather.  I want you to fight Mayweather.'  I said, 'Why? It's not my fault.  He doesn't want to fight.'  And now finally now it finally happened. They really, really want to watch the fight."" Of course, the battle in Vegas will be much more than the fulfillment of the dreams of fans and Pacquiao's children. There is serious money riding on this fight. It's estimated that the May 2 bout will break all financial records in the history of professional boxing. The Pacman is believed to be earning around $80 million for the fight, while  Mayweather -- who is undefeated -- is expected to earn 20% more. Asked how the whopping paycheck makes him feel, Pacquiao replies ""I feel blessed and I owe a lot to the fans.  First to God but also the fans because of their support."" The Philippines' most famous son has come a long way from a childhood mired in poverty and hunger. His rags-to-riches story explains part of the enormous appeal he enjoys in a country where a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. ""He is a receptacle of hope,"" says Recah Trinidad, a veteran columnist at the Philippines Daily Inquirer. ""Everybody believes Manny should win. They are joyful because they see themselves in Manny, because Manny comes from deep, deep down in the soil,"" Trinidad adds. As a boy Pacquiao eked out a living selling donuts in the street, recalls his childhood friend and member of his corner, Buboy Fernandez. The two were neighbors in General Santos City, a city on the southern island of Mindanao. It was there that Pacquiao was introduced to boxing.  As a teenager, he earned extra money to feed his family by battling in underground boxing fights. ""I remember when I started boxing, I earned two dollars, only two dollars,"" Pacquiao recalls. He says two of his friends died competing in these unofficial bouts. Now a multi-millionaire and superstar, Pacquiao says he and his wife are trying to teach their children to appreciate the life of comfort they now enjoy. To prove the point, he says he transferred his children from an academy for international students to a school with no air conditioning. ""I want them to experience, so they can meet hungry families,"" he says. ""So they will not mistreat other people or treat other people different,"" he adds, making a slapping gesture. When Pacquiao travels through the perpetually grid-locked traffic of Manila, he moves in a black armored Escalade with the license plate ""8"" on the front.  A pair of motorcycle cops escort his convoy. His gym, located in the working class neighborhood of Sampaloc, is decorated with huge posters of the champion, as well as an undeniably cute cartoon statue of the goateed fighter that could be described as ""Pacman Junior."" Cameras from more than a dozen Filipino television crews click and whir as Pacquiao spars in the ring for an hour with Fernandez, the stocky trainer who winces when he occasionally takes hits to his round belly. Some of the younger neighborhood boxers who have gathered to watch appear to have adopted haircuts and goatees similar to the man whose rapid-fire punches helped earn him the local nickname ""Pacific Storm."" But Fernandez says Pacquiao hasn't started the most intense period of his training yet. This will begin in the next few days when Team Pacquiao flies to Los Angeles to work with Freddie Roach, the American coach who helped the Filipino achieve global stardom over the last decade. ""My relationship to Freddie Roach is amazing,"" Pacquiao says.  ""Since I met him, that was in 2001, and until now, I didn't change my trainer because we understand each other.  We communicate."" But Roach will not be available to work with Pacquiao until after March because he is in China training another boxer. As for Pacquiao, he has at least one more professional basketball game to coach in Manila before he flies to the U.S. Since his rise to superstardom, Pacquiao's activities and interests have multiplied.  In addition to basketball and scuba diving off the beaches of Mindanao, he has dabbled in singing, acting and politics. Several years ago, he won an election to a seat in the national Congress. Pacquiao proudly points to legislation he says he helped pass aimed at curbing the scourge of human trafficking in the Philippines. But one local newspaper has also highlighted that Paqcuiao has one of the lowest attendance rates in the entire legislative body, pointing out that the boxer could boast more championship belts than days physically spent in Congress. Pacquiao insists that instead of networking in the capital, he focuses on helping poor people in his electoral district. ""If you compare my accomplishments to other Congressmen, I think I did a lot,"" he says. Some critics argue Pacquiao's boxing has suffered due to his many other distractions. ""He's spreading himself thin,"" says Recah Trinidad, the newspaper columnist. Trinidad points to Pacquiao's knock-out at the hands of Juan Manuel Marquez in 2012. ""I hope Manny could win [on May 2], I've been praying,"" Trinidad says. But the journalist fears Pacquiao may not be able to break through Mayweather's much-vaunted defense. ""He's got to adopt a more mature style of boxing.  He cannot rely on what we call an explosive, kamikaze style,"" Trinidad tells CNN. Back on court at the Araneta Coliseum, Pacquiao's Kia Carnival still trails by several points. But they soon manage to pick up some momentum and for the first time, take the lead. The boxer stalks the sidelines, watching closely, exchanging high-fives when his players come on and off the court. When the final horn sounds, Pacquiao's underdogs have beaten their better-ranked opponents -- an upset unlikely to be lost on him as he plots his own success against a more fancied opponent in the ring.","CNN meets the Philippines fighter on court in Manila, where he coaches a basketball team .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A coalition of Middle Eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in Yemen from the air on Friday, the second day of a campaign aimed at the Houthi group. While it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction, the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around Sanaa on Friday night suggested that the Saudi-led strikes were taking a toll. The strikes' target is Houthi rebels, a Shiite Muslim minority group that has taken over the capital and, on Wednesday, captured key parts of the Yemeni port city of Aden. Aden was where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had moved because of the rebel advance. Hadi has since left Yemen, and on Friday he'd arrived in Egypt for a summit of Arab League representatives. Many nations in the Arab League are now participating in the armed effort against the Houthis and presumably to return Hadi to Yemen as its leader. While he's not in Yemen, the fierce fighting there continues. Not surprisingly, the Houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in Sanaa. That includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of Saada, home to the Houthi's leader Abdul Malik Al Houthi, Houthi commanders said. More than a dozen more people were wounded, as 15 locations saw airstrikes. Five Houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to Hadi on a Houthi post about 6 miles (10 kilometers) outside Al Anad airbase, two security officials in Lahj province said. That's where U.S. Special Operations Forces involved in fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had been based as recently as this month. Hadi has also ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV. The Houthis, though, responded by raiding two TV channels and the prominent Al Masdar newspaper. Al Jazeera's office in Sanaa was also targeted, with Houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment, the Qatar-based network said. The nations stepping into Yemen's civil war are predominantly Sunni Muslim, and they are working to rescue a government that has strong Sunni support. The Houthis are allied with majority Shiite Iran. Saudi Arabia, the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-Hazm Storm, considers the Houthis to be proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. ""What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,"" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The kingdom says Hadi, who is out of the country, pleaded for military intervention in a letter. ""I ask you, based on the principle of self-defense in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and on the basis of the Charter of the Arab League and the treaty of joint Arab defense, to provide instant support by all necessary means, including military intervention to protect Yemen and its people from continuous Houthi aggression,"" read the letter, which was posted by Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, a senior State Department official said. The other nations participating in the military action are the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and Egypt, a Saudi adviser has said. The adviser also included Pakistan, saying its military was offering naval support. But on Friday, that country's Defense Ministry said it had only vowed to defend Saudi Arabia, according to a local media report. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops. Saudi Arabia has blockaded the Houthis, effectively cutting off their supply lines. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. Supreme leader Al Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, ""If any army tries to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us."" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's months-long internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. ""This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,"" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. At least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People's Congress, which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out. The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties. The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table, the group said.

"(CNN)Ashley Judd is taking on Twitter trolls, who she says make social media an unsafe space with violent threats. Her vow  to fight online harassment came after she says she was attacked for expressing an unpopular opinion about a basketball game on Twitter. Judd, a diehard Kentucky Wildcats fan who regularly attends March Madness games, told MSNBC that her tweet to the effect of ""I think Arkansas is playing dirty"" was met with vile language and sexually charged threats. Judd retweeted messages that are too explicit to include here. ""Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to persist,"" Judd said. ""And by the way I'm pressing charges."" The actor, who is also an advocate for women's rights, added: ""The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary, and a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me on social media."" Twitter, trolls and sports collided recently in another high-profile social media fight involving former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. Schilling had congratulated his daughter on joining her new college's softball team in a tweet that was met with sexually menacing replies. He tracked down some of the men who sent inappropriate tweets, resulting in one reportedly being fired from his part-time job with the New York Yankees. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has admitted the company has a less than stellar track record for cracking down on abusive tweets. ""We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years,"" Costolo wrote in a February memo. He told employees that he was embarrassed and took ""personal responsibility"" for the company's failure to address abuse. Costolo said he was committed to addressing the issue. This month the company updated its terms of service to directly combat so-called ""revenge porn"" that is posted to the site. Revenge porn is sexually explicit material posted online without the consent of one or more participants. Just today, the company debuted a new feature it says will make the process of reporting abusive tweets to law enforcement more seamless. The site will now email a report that can be shared with law enforcement after a user reports an abusive tweet. ""While we take threats of violence seriously and will suspend responsible accounts when appropriate, we strongly recommend contacting your local law enforcement if you're concerned about your physical safety,"" Twitter says. David Goldman contributed to this report.","Ashley Judd says she was attacked by Twitter trolls after a critical tweet about basketball .

"(CNN)Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has taken delivery of the Izumo, the largest Japanese military vessel to see service since World War II. The warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the Yokusuka naval base near Yokohama, also home to the U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet. The Izumo has a crew of 470, and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones (24,000 tonnes at full load, according to military publication Jane's), it is as large as the storied Yamato-class battleships which fought U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater of World War II. The wreck of one of the two Yamato-class battleships, the Musashi, was discovered early in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. At 241 meters (791 feet) in length, the Izumo is 51 meters (167 ft) longer than the Hyuga, another helicopter carrier which was, until now, the MDSF's largest vessel. Regional neighbors and rivals questioned the legitimacy of such a ship for purely defensive purposes, pointing out that, due to its size and deck configuration it could be repurposed as an aircraft carrier -- a class banned under Japan's pacifist constitution. ""The Izumo proves that Japan has the technical capabilities and demand to develop aircraft carriers. It's also possible that Japan may explore the possibility during the Izumo's service,"" Li Jie, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper. However, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters in Yokohama that the MSDF did not intend to use it in this way. ""We are not thinking about using this as an aircraft carrier,"" he said, saying that the lack of hangers and service bays, along with a deck unsuitable for takeoffs and landings, meant that the Izumo wasn't designed for fixed-wing aircraft. He said that it needed to be as large as it is so it could host joint operations and act as a command center. He insisted that the new addition to Japan's maritime forces was designed for peaceful purposes. ""The vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peacekeeping operations, international disaster relief and aid."" He added that its helicopter capabilities -- it can host seven anti-submarine patrol helicopters, plus two rescue and transport helicopters, the Japan Times reported -- would aid in the detection of sophisticated Chinese submarines. Japan, along with the Philippines and Vietnam, is engaged in territorial disputes with China over the sovereignty of islands in the South China Sea, and Kazuhisa Ogawa, a defense analyst at the Strategic Research Institute of International Change in Japan, says that, in combination with Japan's other helicopter carriers, the Izumo could be used to ""regain remote islets."" He also downplayed China's suggestions that the size of the Izumo represented an escalation of Japan's military ambitions, telling CNN that although it is the biggest Japanese military ship since World War II, it is only a fifth of the size of the USS George Washington. ""It would cost five times Japan's current defense spending for the SDF to have an independent operational capability. The Japanese public would not take that kind of risk,"" he said. The commissioning of the Izumo comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and its neighbors China and South Korea. In July. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe allowed for a reinterpreting of Japan's constitution, paving the way for more active military engagement overseas. The Chinese government has also invited the Japanese leader to attend a ceremony in the Chinese capital in September to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Japan's handling of its wartime aggression is frequently criticized by China and other Asian nations -- it is often accused of downplaying its actions during the war. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the Chinese government had contacted ""all relevant countries"" with a view to attending. The Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said that, as the celebrations will feature a military parade, Abe is ""unlikely to attend."" It quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying: ""While the Japanese government is demanding China improve the transparency of its defense spending, attendance of the prime minister is impossible."" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has previously said that China should work on developing a future-looking cooperative relationship with Japan, rather than highlighting Japan's previous, 70-year-old indiscretions. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.","Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force takes receipt of newly-commissioned helicopter carrier .

"(CNN)I like to think I'm a pretty optimistic person. Even at dark moments for this country -- after 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, for example -- my tendency is always to scout out the sliver of hope for future progress. But I've got to be honest with you, sometimes that optimism only goes so far. The morning after the 2004 election, when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality,  I never thought I'd see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in Alabama of all places. What's more, I certainly never thought that, 50 years after a march for voting rights went from Selma to Montgomery, that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous African-American couple, Tori Sisson and Shanté Wolfe, who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line. They slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state's probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling (which supersedes a state ruling) and to refuse to treat LGBT people equally under the law. Even today, more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday, Chief Justice Moore even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision (which upheld the legal status of slaves as property). I'm not a trained lawyer, but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law. That logic is not only faulty (restricting rights is not similar to expanding them) but offensive. The 13 states that still ban same-sex marriage . Many are highlighting the echoes of the past in Alabama right now; of Gov. George Wallace actually blocking two African-American students from entering the auditorium of the University of Alabama as they tried to desegregate the school; of civil rights battles come and gone. Me? I'm focused on the future. In just a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court could end this chapter of our history once and for all. Even with Alabama entering the marriage equality column, there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights. That's why this spring, the Supreme Court will hear a case that will determine whether the U.S. Constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination. Federal judge: Alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses . We've all got to raise our voices in support of couples like Tori and Shanté. But, after Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby v. Holder, the case gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013, sometimes it seems like the voices of the American people don't get heard by those nine Justices. That's why I'm so inspired and excited about a new idea from the Human Rights Campaign and Robbie Kaplan, the lawyer who represented Edie Windsor in the case that famously struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Together, they've launched the People's Brief. The idea behind the People's Brief is an original twist on the legal concept of the ""amicus curiae"" (Latin for ""friend of the court."") The legal system allows those who are not party to a case, but who have interests in the case, or information relevant to it, to submit their opinions, information, or testimony on the matter at hand. It's a way of guaranteeing that the court is not missing any relevant facts or opinions just because those who hold them are not parties to the litigation. The People's Brief marks the first time that the American people -- the 58% of Americans who support marriage equality, anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices. The People's Brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the Court that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight, of those who are the family, friends, and loved ones of gay people, and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity. By going to www.thepeoplesbrief.com, you can sign your name, review the brief -- and it'll be bundled up with thousands of others and sent to those nine Justices for review. The number of people who sign the People's Brief will make that point in a way that no legal argument could. In past civil rights struggles, such as the one that took place half a century ago in Selma, Alabama, well-intentioned people far from the fray had no easy way to express their support. Now modern technology is being harnessed in a creative way to allow people to do just that in the struggle for marriage equality. I think that's pretty forward-thinking for a Court that still doesn't allow cameras or online case filings. In fact, I think it's long overdue. I've signed my name to the People's Brief, and I hope Americans from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality. No one said progress is easy, but true social change is worth fighting for. Today, I'm optimistic that if change can come to Alabama, there is no reason why it can't come to all 50 states. Fair-minded folks shouldn't be silent at this moment. It's time to put your name on the right side of history. Lend your voice to a chorus too large to be ignored.","Some judges in Alabama are opposing same-sex marriages .

"(CNN)Chelsea's good week continued when the Blues beat West Ham 1-0 in the English Premier League to maintain a five-point lead over Manchester City atop the table. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho -- who picked up another trophy Sunday in the League Cup final -- had never lost to West Ham in the top flight and Belgian attacker Eden Hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half Wednesday at the Hammers' Upton Park. ""The game was very difficult,"" Hazard told Sky. ""One big battle against a good team with very good players. ""It's always difficult when you don't score the second goal to kill the game. But one goal was enough. It's not always like this. ""The goalkeeper, the defense we have are very strong. It was very good."" Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but West Ham boss Sam Allardyce lamented his team's finishing -- plus the refereeing. He felt Hazard's goal was offside. ""When you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out, that's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard,"" the under pressure Allardyce told Sky. Nigel Pearson, manager of last-place Leicester, also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2-0 to reigning league champion Manchester City. Leicester didn't get a penalty when City striker Wilfried Bony appeared to foul Jeff Schlupp in the  box in the first half or when Fernando fouled Andrej Kramaric in the second. Leicester struck the woodwork, too. City -- reeling following back-to-back defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool -- only really came to life after David Silva's opener in first-half stoppage time. Leicester's veteran keeper Mark Schwarzer thwarted City to keep it close but could do little on James Milner's 88th-minute effort. The win was ""very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against Liverpool and Barcelona,"" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who rested club captain Vincent Kompany. Elsewhere, four teams vying for Champions League spots all won. Manchester United claimed all three points at Newcastle when Ashley Young took advantage of keeper Tim Krul's error in the 89th minute; Arsenal doubled third-last QPR 2-1; surging Liverpool shut out second-last Burnley 2-0; and League Cup finalist Tottenham defeated Swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsing to the turf. United defender Jonny Evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at St. James' Park, since he appeared to spit in striker Papiss Cisse's direction when they clashed in the first half. Cisse then appeared to spit back at Evans. Arsenal remained third, with United in fourth on 53 points, two better than Liverpool, four better than Southampton and six better than Spurs, who have a game in hand. In Wednesday's other match, Stoke extended Everton's league slide by blanking the Toffees 2-0 at home. Barcelona reaches Copa del Rey final . In Spain, meanwhile, Barcelona reached the Copa del Rey final by easing past Villarreal 6-2 on aggregate. Holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg, Barcelona won away by the same score Wednesday, helped by Neymar's double. Barcelona faces familiar foe Athletic Bilbao in May's finale. Bilbao advanced 3-1 on aggregate over Espanyol, prevailing in the second leg 2-0.

"(CNN)Mention the words ""sand"" and ""golf"" together, and the chances are you'll leave many players shuddering at the memory of being trapped in bunkers after another wayward shot. But in other parts of the world, sand golf is a version of the game in its own right. The idea of playing a round without verdant fairways to stride down or lush greens to putt (and, of course, miss) on seems strange, even wrong. Sometimes needs must, though. Half a century ago, expat oil workers with an enthusiasm for golf had nowhere in Abu Dhabi to play. In the baking desert heat, with little or no irrigation possible, the equation was simple: they either had to adapt to the surroundings or there'd be no golf at all. The result was an incarnation of the game in which the only grass to be seen is artificial, found on a mat carried around by players to serve both as a tee and a surface from which to strike when the ball is on the fairway. Fairways? They consist entirely of sand and are indicated by marker posts. If the ball lands outside them, it's in the sand golf equivalent of the rough -- stony terrain that the unwary player may soon find is home to a few snakes and a lizard or two. Greens? Well, they're known as ""browns,"" built from clay and topped with a mixture of sand and oil to provide a true putting surface, a formula arrived at through trial and error. It's an odd environment, this golfing world with a palette of golden-brown colors. And with rapidly developing irrigation and growing techniques enabling grass courses to be built in desert climes, it's an increasingly unusual one. Back in 1961, determined British oil workers created a sand course on an atoll known as Das Island, around 100 miles off Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf. It was the country's first-ever golf club. As the expat population grew, so did the demand for the game, and in 1971 sand golf moved into Abu Dhabi proper with the opening of a course near the Sea Palace. Its success brought a move to the Equestrian Club, attracting close to 500 members. In the 1990s, the sand game's fortunes took a dive as the site was earmarked for a nine-hole grass course. But although many sand course players changed surface and took up the more conventional game, several battled on and the 18-hole Al Ghazal sand course was created near Abu Dhabi airport, with its front nine occupying part of an archaeological site, in 1997. Sand golf also exists in parts Australia and Africa but Al Ghazal (which translates as ""gazelle"" -- gazelles peer from behind a fence by the second brown,) is the only one that can be described as ""world class,"" says Dennis Cox, an expert on the game, because the scale and scope of its layout rivals its grass counterparts. The course found a place in the international spotlight when a World Sand Golf Championship, boasting star names including Colin Montgomerie was played in 2004 and 2005 (won by Greg Owen and Thongchai Jaidee,) but the tournament fizzled out as showpiece events went to showpiece grass courses. Maybe that's understandable when you consider some of the extra elements involved in the sand game -- the browns, for example, must be swept for a few minutes after use so that they are left smooth and footprint-less for following players, while unexpected hazards can include burrows dug by desert lizards. Cox warns that a tradition is under threat, with a form of golf that was once commonplace in danger of becoming just a memory. Other, smaller clubs have fallen by the wayside, while Al Ghazal's location near an expanding airport presents an obvious threat to its future. But even if the sand game were to fade into obscurity in the emirate, it is still played in parts of Africa. In Libya, still racked by instability following the ousting of Muammar Gaddaffi, courses -- the bulk of which can be found in the capital, Tripoli -- are of sand, with no grass versions existing. Once smart and well-kept, they have now slumped into neglect, with few people to play on them or look after them. David Bachmann, who formerly worked at the Austrian embassy in the city, wrote on his In Tripolis blog about the experience of playing sand golf in and near the city. Recounting his experiences of Tripoli's tattered nine-hole Ghargharesh course, he wrote that it was one for diehards only, ""golf fanatics that would come every weekend to play a round on this challenging course."" And he imagined that the skeleton of the clubhouse, on which work had long since stopped, might one day boast ""marble, chandeliers and state-of-the-art locker rooms... overlooking the deep blue Mediterranean with the sun setting over the sea."" For now, and against the odds, fans of this form of the game will just have to make do with being kings of their very own sand castles.","Expat oil workers in Abu Dhabi built sand golf course in 1961 .

"(CNN)If it were easy, any company or government could do it. But flying an Ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive, and everyone safe -- is complicated. Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States. ""We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,"" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air. He described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements: . Once the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours. Everything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed. ""We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,"" Thompson said. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu. It took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again. He got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment. And on and on and on. Thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to Phoenix Air's, including the U.S. government. But so far, none has flown. ""Other organizations have built systems, but we're the ones still doing it,"" he said. More than 10,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.","Georgia company equips plane to transport Ebola patients .

"(CNN)If the wheel was man's greatest invention, putting two wheels together comes as a close second for Dani Foffa, CEO of Foffa Bikes. His eponymous company builds bespoke urban bicycles with a stylish design that has been lauded by magazines like Vogue and GQ. London-based Foffa tracks his passion for cycling back to his childhood in Venice, Italy, where biking in the city's winding narrow streets was a rare treat. He spent his early professional career as a business analyst, before a nagging feeling that there was more to life encouraged him to start designing and building bikes, initially from his office garage. ""I started refurbishing vintage bikes up and reselling them online. And the demand just grew very gradually, steadily, to the point that it was time for us to get our own brand in the bikes, and open up our first shop. I took my chances, I quit my job, and clearly I have no regrets,"" says Foffa. His company has built over 5,000 bespoke bikes since 2007, and they were named as one of the ten best commuter bikes by The Independent, a UK newspaper. Foffa says that he was encouraged to start the company when he saw a gap in the market for comfortable bicycles designed for cycling in the city, which also looked good. ""In the same way that we decide what to wear, we think that the bicycle should be an extension of your personality,"" says Foffa. He adds that he always relished the sense of liberty that biking afforded him, and wants to introduce the simple pleasure of a bike ride to as many people as possible. ""Bikes are great for the environment, great for the health, they are the quickest and probably the cheapest way of commuting around town. And they link with that sense of adventure, that freedom that comes with it, which no other invention, as far as I'm concerned, was able to offer me.""","Dani Foffa was a business analyst before starting a bike company .

"Jerusalem (CNN)A newly released ISIS video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an Israeli spy. The video identifies the man as 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. In the video, ISIS shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS. ""Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him,"" according to Said Musallam, his father. ""They sent him money through the Western Union. They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing."" It wasn't long before Musallam's family members didn't recognize him when they talked to him on Skype. The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle. His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross. But his son never made it back to Israel. About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border. A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit. An adult ISIS fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him. The adult, speaking French, gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing. The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead. The man immediately falls forward to the ground. The child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body. Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death. ""I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work,"" he said, crying. ""Mohamed is not a brother. He is a son."" But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead. An issue last month of ISIS' English-language propaganda magazine, Dabiq, included a purported interview with Musallam and described his alleged work for the Israeli spy agency. In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS. Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence. ""Mohamed is not an agent. Mohamed  doesn't have a shekel. If he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life,"" his mother, Hind Musallam, said. ""We could have been living a different life and I would not be working cleaning houses so we can live."" This isn't the first time ISIS has used children to drive home its message. An ISIS propaganda video released in January -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. Last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, ""That's my boy."" ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the ""cubs of the caliphate"" (the adult jihadis call each other ""lions"") and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families. It has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups ""have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions."" CNN's Stefan Simons, Cynde Strand, Ben Wedeman, Kevin Flower, Catherine E. Shoichet, Faith Karimi, Greg Botelho and Jessica King contributed to this report.","A video claims to show the killing of Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam .

"(CNN)From the sweltering heat of the Sahara Desert to the subzero temperatures at both North and South Poles, Fiona Oakes' running obsession knows no bounds. Dubbed the ""Queen of the Extreme,"" the record-breaking runner has completed more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons, but she remains determinedly modest about her feats. ""I don't keep my medals, I don't know where they are. I don't have trophies -- people have cabinets of trophies -- the dogs have chewed most of mine,"" Oakes told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I don't have cuttings from newspapers ... I'm not interested. I would never say to people: 'I am this' or 'I am that' -- it's not something that I'm predisposed to shout about. I don't think I'm very special at all, to be honest."" Perhaps the 48-year-old needs to rethink her definition of special given her punishing schedule is religiously maintained despite her suffering from a potentially crippling knee complaint -- a legacy of reconstructive surgery during her teens. ""I had a tumor (in my right knee) when I was 14 years old, it wasn't discovered until I was 17, by which time I had lost an awful lot of weight -- I think I weighed around five stone,"" she explains. ""In the end I had radical surgery to remove the kneecap and knee joint. It was in plaster for about three years. I was told that I wouldn't walk properly again, let alone do anything like running. It's painful when I run, but I can manage it because I know what to expect."" Oakes started running properly just over a decade ago and soon found her stride, winning her first half-marathon in a course-record time before stepping up to compete over 26.2 miles and beyond. Today, she routinely finishes conventional marathons in around two hours, 50 minutes and has a personal best of two hours, 38 minutes -- a shade over the A standard required to qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games. When she's not pounding the tarmac in city marathons, Oakes competes in some of the world's toughest endurance races counting the Volcano Marathon in Chile's Atacama Desert -- an 150-mile ultramarathon run at altitudes in excess of 4,400 meters (14,600 feet) -- and the similarly challenging Marathon des Sables where competitors run six marathons in six days through the Sahara Desert among her conquests. She still winces at the memory of competing in that 154-mile Saraha event, dubbed the world's toughest footrace. ""The Marathon des Sables in 2012 was appallingly tough. The week before I went I broke two toes -- a horse stood on my foot. ""Trying to complete the Marathon des Sables is a tough ask, but trying to complete it with broken toes was brutal. For the whole week I lived on painkillers ... it was just appalling, but it did toughen me up,"" she says. The following year, Oakes broke three world records becoming the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent -- clocking an aggregate time of 26 hours, 18 minutes and 43 seconds -- as well as recording the fastest aggregate and elapsed times for running marathons on all seven continents plus the North Pole -- a place she remembers warmly. ""I think my favorite marathon has to be the North Pole, purely because it's a marathon on the top of the world. It's such an unrealistic place to be actually running a marathon, and also I caught a glimpse of a polar bear -- which has to be one of the highlights of my life."" There is no let up in her schedule when she's crosses the finish line -- once she's got her breath back it's straight back to the day job running an animal sanctuary at her home in Asheldham, Essex. With 400 animals including horses, pigs, sheep and dogs to care for around the clock as well as keeping up her training routine of 100 miles every week, it's no surprise that Oakes has little time for anything else. ""My life is very, very regimented, it's hard to fit in the running around caring for the animals. I have to get up at 3.30 in the morning and I work through till probably nine or 10 o'clock at night,"" she says. ""People forget that if you train for something very, very hard it has a detrimental effect on the people around you. I have no personal or family life. Every minute of my time that is not spent caring for my animals is spent dedicated to running. ""It might be that whenever someone else is having a Christmas day lunch, I'm putting my running shoes and going out to run 30 miles."" Running has helped her raise money for the animal sanctuary and also allowed her to promote a positive image of veganism, though Oakes, who hasn't eaten animal products since her teenage years, is keen not to sound too preachy. ""I don't like to dwell on the vegan thing because (you) quickly gets marked as some sort of fruitcake or an animal rights extremist and I don't want to appear to be telling people what to do -- it's a personal thing,"" she says. But she cannot deny feeling a deep sense of satisfaction about helping change the perception that vegans somehow lack energy because of their diet. ""I became so frustrated by constantly being told you can't do (running) as a vegan (and that) vegans are weak, vegans will keel over if they try to do something extreme. I wanted to prove my point. ""I just want to be an example to say that if these people are considering this lifestyle, it can be done on a plant-based diet."" As if to hammer home her point, Oakes recently attempted to run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents -- running in a ""cow costume"" to raise awareness of animal cruelty. Her hopes of completing the Triple 7 Quest were dashed at the last though when poor weather prevented her flying from Chile to Antarctica to complete the final leg of the race. ""It was really devastating at the finish, but I couldn't wait, I had to come home for the animals. I'm not at an extendable budget with time so I had to leave,"" she said. Next month, Oakes will be off on her travels again, returning to Morocco to compete in her third Marathon des Sables, before heading back onto the road to compete at the Berlin Marathon later in the year where she aims to better her 17th-place finish achieved in 2006. ""I'm always focusing on what I'm about to do next,"" she says, before quietly conceding running isn't always her favorite activity. ""I don't particularly enjoy running. The training is extremely difficult and I do push to the absolute limits. I enjoy the results that are achieved from the running ... I like to take on challenges that would be almost impossible and prove that I can do it.""","British amateur runner competes in marathons and ultramarathons .

"London (CNN)Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, are to spend the next four days in the United States, visiting the nation's capital and Louisville, Kentucky. The couple arrived in Washington on Tuesday evening. Many people will remember Charles from the day in July 1981 when, as a dashing young prince, he kissed his shy bride, Diana, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in front of the eyes of the world. But many things have changed since then, including their divorce, Diana's death in a car accident in 1997 and his marriage to Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall. Here are five things to know about the Prince of Wales: . While a lot of attention in recent years has been focused on his sons, Princes William and Harry, Charles is next in line to the British throne. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, has ruled for more than 60 years (in fact, in September she is expected to overtake her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria for the title of Britain's longest-reigning monarch.) Her longevity is welcomed by her subjects, but it means that Charles, at age 66, has spent a long time as a monarch-in-waiting. He's also now a grandfather, thanks to the birth of Prince George in 2013. Charles and Camilla tied the knot on April 9, 2005. The couple first visited the United States together as newlyweds, and Camilla was confronted by hard-core Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%. But there's been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by ComRes for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago. In an exclusive interview with CNN royal correspondent Max Foster, Charles opened up about the couple's relationship. He met Camilla years before he wed Diana, who famously said in a 1995 BBC TV interview that ""there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."" Reporter's notebook: Interviewing the royal couple . The prince has admitted talking to his plants in past TV interviews, inviting ridicule from some quarters. But as part of his interest in sustainability, he has championed organic farming and gardening for many years, including on his large country estates. He has a fully functioning organic farm at Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, England, and founded his own organic food brand, Duchy Originals, which now turns a healthy profit and helps fund his charitable foundation. According to his official website, he's an advocate of traditional rural skills and enjoys hedge laying. Charles has riled some people over the years with his outspoken views on architecture, which prioritize the traditional over the modern. In 1984, he made headlines when he described a proposed modern extension to the National Gallery in London as ""a monstrous carbuncle,"" according to news reports from the time. He's also invited controversy by reportedly writing to ministers -- and even the Prime Minister -- on subjects close to his heart. This intervention in the public sphere has troubled those who believe the royals should not get involved in such debates and worry that, once king, Charles may not remain above politics in the way that his mother has. In a piece published by The Architectural Review in December, Charles explained his thinking on architecture, saying ""designing places according to the human scale and with Nature at the heart of the process has always been my central concern."" The future king has often been photographed on the ski slopes of Europe and in the past has also tried his hand at water skiing, surfing and scuba diving. He was a keen polo player for more than four decades, only retiring from the sport in 2005. This is despite breaking his arm in two places when he fell off a pony during a polo match in 1990. He also climbed in the saddle as a jockey on a number of occasions. His website also describes him as an ""experienced watercolourist"" who likes to paint in the open air at home and on his travels.","Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, are visiting the United States .

"Baghdad (CNN)About 75% of the besieged Iraqi city of Tikrit is now back in government control, the head of a key paramilitary force taking part in the attack told CNN on Thursday. The other 25% is in the hands of about 150 ISIS fighters who continue to hold out, said Main Al-Kadhimi, commander of the Hashd Al-Shaabi militia. There has been no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the Iraqi forces. But they have been making progress in recent days. ISIS' spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, called reports of coalition-member victories ""delusional and fake."" He spoke of the coalition's use of fighter jets, heavy artillery and tanks, saying it is a ""nightmare and will go eventually."" On Wednesday, joint Iraqi forces gained control of Tikrit Military Hospital, a few blocks south of the presidential palace. It's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from ISIS, which captured the city last year. The predominantly Shiite militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salaheddin province. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from front-line positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, Iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that the consensus was that Iran's involvement was positive in military terms. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" he said. But Dempsey also voiced concern over what might happen after ISIS is defeated. A key question, he said, is ""whether the government of Iraq will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the groups"" in Iraq. Tikrit could act as an important testing ground, with some observers concerned that if the predominantly Shiite militias seize control, thanks in part to the support of majority-Shiite Iran, they could carry out reprisal attacks against the remaining Sunni population there. Such attacks could inflame already simmering sectarian tensions within Iraq and make future efforts to retake Mosul and bring peace to the country yet more difficult. In a possible sign of the problems to come, a number of posts on social media appear to show Iraqi soldiers in extremely graphic ""selfies"" with the heads of alleged ISIS militants, or striking odd poses with bodies behind them. Most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the Iraqi military offensive to retake Tikrit  and other areas in Salaheddin province, which started 10 days ago. Two senior security officials in Samarra told CNN, on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media, that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents. They did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the images. Anthony Cordesman, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said sectarian division was an issue to be ""extremely concerned"" about as Iraqi forces gain ground in Tikrit. ""It's already been very clear to Iraqis that this is an Iranian-led operation and not one which has the support of the coalition,"" he said. As some Iraqis question why the United States has not taken more decisive action, he said, ""this may be a case where Iran may be gaining very serious influence."" If there are reprisals in Tikrit and it becomes a ""Shiite-on-Sunni struggle,"" Cordesman said, then not only will Iran's influence increase ""but you can see the country divide and Islamic State (ISIS) be replaced by a conflict between Iraqi Shiite and Sunni."" Strong leadership will be needed from the government in Baghdad, headed by al-Abadi, militia leaders and senior religious figures to prevent this outcome, he said, with a lot already being done on this front. The top Iraqi Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, he said, ""very clearly says that Iraqis must act as Iraqis, not divide along sectarian lines."" The challenge will be ensuring that fighters on the ground, some angered by the killings of their relatives by ISIS, do not seek vengeance against Sunni communities whom they suspect of supporting the group. While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province, where it is finding a support base among the predominantly Sunni population. More than 40 Iraqi soldiers were killed when ISIS blew up the Iraqi army headquarters just outside Ramadi, an Anbar provincial leader told CNN on Thursday. Militants dug a tunnel and detonated hundreds of homemade explosives, said Sabah Al-Karhout, head of the Anbar Provincial Council. ISIS launched a new offensive on Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the council, said in a statement. The city is being attacked ""from all directions,"" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets, he said, and explosives-laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge. Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north,"" al-Issawi said. U.S.-led coalition forces carried out 13 airstrikes in Iraq between Wednesday and Thursday morning, a statement said. Five hit ISIS targets near Kirkuk, and three struck ISIS units and a vehicle near Falluja. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma, near Falluja, from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council, on Wednesday. Iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with Shiite Hashd Al-Shaabi units and local tribesmen, Al-Karhout said. ISIS is also battling in many places far from Tikrit, including Syria, where the militant group is more on the offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Clashes continued Thursday between the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or Kurdish YPG, and ISIS fighters in Ras al Ayn, a Syrian strategic border town with Turkey, the Syrian Observatory  said in a statement. Hundreds of ISIS militants launched a large-scale offensive Wednesday in the town, the group said. Dozens have been killed from both sides.

"(CNN)Russian police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects, all of them Chechens, in the killing of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. They tried to arrest a sixth suspect, but he reportedly threw a grenade at the arresting officers and then blew himself up. Yet that speed has only raised more questions about who wanted Nemtsov dead -- and why? Conspiracy theories are rife, but so far, none seem totally convincing. • The Kremlin did it. Some members of Russia's opposition -- and Nemtsov's daughter -- are convinced Russia's government was behind Nemtsov's killing. But why? And why now? Nemtsov, 55, had been an opposition leader for years and had recently been overshadowed by younger members of the opposition such as Alexey Navalny. So killing him now doesn't seem to make sense. Some of Nemtsov's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the Kremlin, pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on Russia's military role in Ukraine that could undermine the Kremlin's claims that its forces fighting in Ukraine have been just ""volunteers."" But the dramatic staging of the killing -- he was shot in the back on a famous Moscow bridge against the backdrop of Red Square and the Kremlin, where Putin has his office -- seems a bit too obvious. And how exactly does it help Putin to look like a killer? • The West did it. Some Russian politicians and media personalities close to the Kremlin charge that Putin's foes in the West orchestrated the killing to damage the Russian President's image and ignite a civil war in Russia. But why would Washington want to destroy someone who was championing democracy and who is friendly to the United States? (Conspiracy theorists reply: to create a ""sacrificial lamb"" and blame the slaughter on Putin.) • It was the Chechens. Here, the plot thickens. The key suspect, Zaur Dadayev, reportedly initially confessed to being involved with the shooting. But then, Russian media reported, he denied involvement. Russian officials have alleged that Dadayev, a former security officer and fervent Muslim, decided to punish Nemtsov for supporting the rights of the French Charlie Hebdo journalists to publish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. But Nemtsov's allies point out that he was not anti-Muslim and rarely spoke of the cartoons -- he was by no means a central figure in the cartoon story. To make things more complicated, the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, praised Dadayev as a brave soldier, a religious man and a ""real patriot."" But on Tuesday, Putin awarded Kadyrov the Order of Honor, and the Chechen leader pledged he would die for Putin. A further twist is that Chechens reportedly are fighting in Ukraine -- on both sides of the battle line (for the Ukrainian government and for the Russian-allied separatists.) That's led some back to the theory that Nemtsov was killed because of his allegedly explosive information on Russia's role in Ukraine. • The Ukrainians did it. Many Russians are convinced that what they call the ""fascist"" Kiev government would stop at nothing to frame Putin. After all, a significant number of people, fed by domestic propaganda, still believe the Ukrainian air force shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine despite much of the evidence pointing to Russian-backed rebels as the culprits. • It was domestic extremists. Supporters of this theory are mainly in the opposition camp. They accuse the Kremlin of whipping up hatred against the so-called Fifth Column -- ""traitors"" who are trying to undermine Russia from within. Photos of opposition leaders labeled ""traitors"" have been posted in Russian cities, while at an anti-Ukraine rally in Moscow just days before Nemtsov's assassination, Russians loyal to Putin carried signs and placards with pictures of those ""traitors,"" including Nemtsov. But whatever the reality of what happened in Moscow, high-profile killings in Russia, especially ones with a political connection, are rarely solved. Chechens were convicted of killing journalist Anna Politkovskaya, for example, but there still is no explanation of why they did it or who organized the murder. Now, with Nemtsov's killing, Russian officials and Kremlin-friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories, confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth. Will things play out any differently this time?","Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was killed last month .

"(CNN)In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian-based Boko Haram has been accepted by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated ""our jihadi brothers"" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. ""Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,"" Zenn said. ""It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. ""ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate."" Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. What Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance to ISIS means .

"(CNN)It's a golfing paradise forged from the ashes of the space race. And, according to owner Dave Pelz, it might just be the best back garden on the planet. One thing is certain, no self-respecting golfer would emerge from a stint patrolling the perfectly coiffured turf at Chez Pelz in Austin, Texas any worse around the greens. ""They say it's the world's best backyard,"" one of golf's most renowned short game coaches, and former NASA employee, told CNN's Living Golf show. ""It's my dream. I have a dream job and I live in my dream house. I live with my dream girl. I'm a happy guy."" It's no wonder Pelz is content. His named is etched in the evolution of golf. His students, including five-time major champion Phil Mickelson, have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf's most fertile brains, Pelz has 26 golf patents to his name. The 70-year-old still works with Mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as ""Lefty""credits Pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level. ""I was 0-for-43 in majors before I met him, and I've won four, plus a Players Championship since,"" Mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the British Open -- in 2013. ""That says it all about him, in my book."" The septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s, his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15-year stint working for space agency NASA. His insistence on short game practice, and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department, have informed the modern professional's approach. ""I did space research and golf research on my own time,"" explained the brains behind the two-ball putter, one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately. ""NASA has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race. Sputnik had just gone up. ""We were trying to catch the Russians in terms of space exploration. And I got in a wonderful group of scientists and learned to do honest to God research."" Pelz banked a place at Indiana University thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics. He famously played the legendary Jack Nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion, but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for NASA. Using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists, Pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he'd picked up at the Goddard Space Flight Center. And gradually, piece by piece, he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make. ""I started measuring my own putting,"" he said. ""I started measuring my short game. I started measuring my driving. ""I learned how to measure things at Goddard Space Flight Center because they had the best instruments in the world and I learned the practical application of the scientific method. ""I finally started understanding my game after 10 years of research. It's funny to say from a person who went to college for four years on a golf scholarship. ""Those thousand lessons that taught me virtually nothing ... they might not have been teaching right but it was also partly I wasn't listening and I wasn't looking for the things that I needed to look for. ""All of a sudden I qualified again for the U.S. Amateur (America's leading competition for amateur golfers) and I'm not practicing at all like I used to but my game was better. I was a better player."" Despite this spike in quality, Pelz was still hesitant when it came to the prospect of throwing his lot in on the PGA Tour with other professionals. ""I had a serious thinking period,"" he explained. ""And I thought the game really doesn't need another good player. ""I believed by now that if I really worked hard I could be a really good player and I might be able to make it on the Tour, but I'd never be the best player in the world. ""I didn't have that kind of practice time in me. At this stage I'm 35 now and I got so involved in the research of golf, in finding out about my own game, I thought 'I could help a lot of players.' ""What the world really needs is for somebody to tell them what they're doing wrong so they can score better and enjoy the game more. ""That's really what golf is about. It's really not what you shoot, it's whether or not you are improving."" While Pelz's brain power is not in question, his business acumen is -- by his own admission. After taking a year-long leave of absence from Goddard and securing funding from a group of friends, he embarked on a journey that would eventually lead to his space age backyard in Austin. But it was a bumpy ride to say the least. ""I'm a terrible businessman to this day,"" he joked. ""I don't do anything in my company except teach golf and do golf research. My wife is the CEO. She runs the company and makes all the decisions. Of that first year in business he recalls: ""I spent all the money and lost every dime. And they said 'Well, here's some more.' I lost that the second year. ""Then they said: 'We're out. That's all the money we have. We're not going throw money down a rat hole. You don't know what you're doing in business.' Which is true, I did not."" However, by this time Pelz had hit upon the idea that would help him make an indelible mark on golf -- the importance of the short game. After three years studying players on the PGA Tour he deduced they were neglecting one of the most important areas of the game -- from 100 yards in. His calculations underlined the short game accounted for as much as 65% of golf, and also happened to be the one area in which most professionals struggled. Most players had a range of clubs that essentially fulfilled the same function -- to hit the ball long distances -- while they relied on just one club to take care of business from 100 yards out or closer. Pelz said: ""Thirty five years ago nobody even talked about short game -- the term wasn't used. It was golf. ""When I was taught golf I was taught that it was a drive and a shot to the green and then you putted. ""But if you can't get to the green you can't play golf so everybody practices the long game and they didn't even call it the long game. That was just the game. ""But I did my research and I measured how many shots people hit and it turns out everybody does hit the first two shots. ""They hit the ball off the tee, then they hit the ball at the green -- most people miss the green -- then they hit a chip shot or a pitch shot, sometimes it's not very good and they do another one and then two or three putts. ""So the truth is there are two long shots and three or four or five short game shots every hole and people don't think about these. They just think it looks like it's easy to do. ""It is easy to do if you know how to do it but it's not easy to do right if you don't know how to do it and you never practice it. ""If all you practice is the long game, practicing that for the rest of your life will not help your short game because they take different swings. They are truly different games."" Pelz's breakthrough came just at the right time. With money running out he had mortgaged his house, resigned from his role with NASA and was relying on the players he was working with to fund his fledgling start-up. At year five he had reached break even point, and would continue to do so until year 21, when he finally started making money. By this time his portfolio of players was ever expanding, and grew to include Mickelson, widely regarded as one of the finest short game exponents ever. ""I've worked with over 100 players now on the tour and Phil Mickelson and everybody says, 'oh he has a natural god-given talent with a short game,"" Pelz said. ""No he's not. He's very talented but he also works very hard. He has practiced and practiced and tested and experimented."" The pair still work together, but it is often missed by the mainstream media as they tend to meet two weeks out from a major tournament. Pelz is still as enthusiastic about golf as he ever was, especially about the dynamics of the short game and how important it is to keep practicing. While some players will never be able to match the game's power hitters no matter how hard they train, short game is one area pros and amateurs can make huge strides in. ""I will never hit it as far as Rory McIlroy,"" Pelz said. ""I can't do it. Now you give me that kind of (extensive) practice and I will kill him in the short game and putting. ""That's saying a lot because he's good at short game and putting. He's not bad but he's not practicing it 12 hours a day, every day, seven days a week. ""So I'm saying no matter what you do you'll never conquer the full power game as much as you can conquer the short game and putting for amateurs. I think there's a lot of potential for amateurs. ""I want them to focus there and enjoy the game more.""","Renowned short game coach Dave Pelz has turned his backyard into a golf paradise .

"Bethlehem, West Bank (CNN)In the biblical city of Bethlehem, Sana Jamaani is warmed up and ready to run. This isn't her first race, but she says it is her most important. ""I'm running in the Holy Land,"" Jamaani smiles. ""I'm running in Palestine."" More than 3,000 runners came to the West Bank for the Palestine Marathon on Friday. For Jamaani, this isn't just a race for time. It is a run for recognition. ""It means that you run for peace,"" Jamaani says. Two weeks before this marathon, more than 25,000 runners took part in the Jerusalem Marathon. The race was a celebration of sport in a citywide event that drew international attention and competition. The course took runners through old and new Jerusalem. They were free to run. But in Bethlehem, runners say they run to be free. ""We are trying to inspire people to take their own rights,"" says organizer Signe Fischer, ""and the right of movement is the only right that you can physically just claim. You can put on your running shoes and just take it."" The Palestine Marathon is put on by the Palestine Olympic Committee and the Right to Movement, a nonprofit organization that uses running as a means of activism. They focus their efforts on what they see as one of the most basic rights: movement. Many of the runners are Palestinian, and their movement is limited, Israel says, for security reasons. The marathon course took runners along the West Bank separation barrier, into the Aida refugee camp, and under guard towers. Nader al-Masri won the marathon. He is from Gaza, and he says he had to wait five hours at the Erez border crossing to compete. He arrived in Manger Square at the finish line to a hero's welcome. ""I saw parts of the wall all over. It's very hard, but I'm still proud of myself as a Palestinian,"" says al-Masri. In its third year, the marathon drew runners from all over the world, pilgrims of a sort making a journey to the holy land, not for religion, but for sport. ""It's an achievement,"" said Jamaani after finishing. ""Everyone looks for an achievement in life, and one of them was crossing this line, especially in the Palestine Marathon.""

"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)As nuclear talks with Iran neared the endgame, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shied away from predicting success. Difficult issues remain on the table as the world's most powerful diplomats meet in Switzerland with Iranian nuclear negotiators, Kerry told CNN on Monday. ""We are working very hard to work those through. We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow. We are working with a view to get something done,"" he said. ""There is a little more light there today, but ​there are still some tricky issues. Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow."" Negotiators have set Tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal. A comprehensive deal, including technical additions, is supposed to be negotiated by June 30. World powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years. In exchange, Iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy. Kerry's comments to CNN came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, made headlines. The assertion: Iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb. On Sunday, an Iranian negotiator told journalists that Tehran would not send fissile material to Russia, which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb-making materials out of reach. ""The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to send them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,"" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. But on Monday, a senior U.S. State Department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down. Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, the official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks' progress earlier Monday, saying that the diplomats were ""narrowing down"" their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points. ""These marathon-like negotiations have reached the final stage,"" he said. Things have been tense in Lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms, with talks snagged on three important points: . • How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement. • How quickly crushing U.N. sanctions will go away. • Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the deal. Iran wants them gone for good. But international negotiators want merely to suspend them, so they can reapply them as leverage if Iran does not keep the bargain. Agreement on the points is crucial, a Western diplomat said. ""There cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions,"" the diplomat said. In the background, a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again. Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the deal he believes is taking shape. ""This agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse,"" he said after a meeting in Israel with visiting U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Netanyahu also attacked Iran for its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have overtaken many parts of that country. He said Iran was trying to take over the whole Middle East with the nuclear deal and its influence in Yemen. Conservative Washington lawmakers are threatening new sanctions if Tehran doesn't comply with demands, which could throw a wrench into negotiations. U.S. negotiators are working to reach an agreement in part to prevent this kind of congressional punishment. They fear it could prompt hardliners in Tehran to push for killing the talks, which would scuttle the chances of a deal altogether. Aside from the three tough points, negotiators on both sides have shown optimism. U.S. officials have said most of the other elements were solvable if those three major hurdles could be overcome. Iran's Araghchi agreed. ""Getting to an accord is doable. Solutions have been found for numerous questions,"" he said. Iran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed. But diplomats says it's not so simple. Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, but sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlock. He said he believes the world powers ""have realized that sanctions, pressure and an agreement will not go together. It's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating."" U.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. New machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15-year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, which would be relaxed over the last five. ""We are not asking them to do nothing (in technology development), but they want to do more than we want them to do,"" a Western diplomat said. But the diplomat added, ""After 15 years, they can do what they want."" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium. That figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted. Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is not that important, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the ""breakout time""  -- to at least a year. While the focus this week is on the March 31 deadline, it's important to note it isn't the final deadline. Even if a pact is reached Tuesday, it's unclear what form it would take, and the United States and Iran have varying needs. The parties are seeking to reach what's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal. But if they're able to come together on the big issues, they still have until the end of June when the Joint Plan of Action expires to iron out the details. So that means the talks won't be finished this month. Officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders. The United States would prefer a written accord, but Iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached. U.S. officials say they will need to quantify Iran's commitments before submitting the agreement to Congress. But U.S. and Western diplomats say that Iran is looking simply for an ""understanding"" of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Nimet Kirac and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","China's foreign minister says ""marathon-like negotiations have reached their final stage""

"(CNN)Lionel Messi has set the stage for a potentially season-defining week for Barcelona, scoring both goals as his team went four points clear at the top of the Spanish league on Saturday. The 2-0 win at tiny Eibar, a side playing in La Liga for the first time and which has now lost eight games in a row, may not seem like an unexpected achievement. But, with a European Champions League last-16 decider at home to Manchester City on Wednesday and then the ""El Clasico"" crunch clash with bitter rival Real Madrid next Sunday, every win is vital at this stage of the campaign. ""We're going into the Clasico as leaders and in perfect form,"" Barca coach Luis Enrique said. ""But first we have to focus on City because qualification is at stake. Then we'll see what happens at the weekend."" Messi has now scored 43 goals this season, first netting a 31st-minute penalty after Borja Ekiza unluckily handled the Argentine's blocked shot and then bulleting in a header from Ivan Rakitic's corner 10 minutes after the restart. ""Eibar didn't look like a team that has just lost seven in a row,"" said Enrique, who welcomed back Brazil star Neymar from suspension to resume his role up front with Messi and Luis Suarez. ""They played good football and they fully deserved their great start to the season. I don't think they'll have any trouble avoiding relegation."" The result puts even more pressure on second-placed Real Madrid to win Sunday's home clash with Levante. The European champion's coach Carlo Ancelotti has been criticized after a poor run of results since the turn of the year, while world-record signing Gareth Bale has particularly been vilified by national sports paper Marca following Tuesday's home defeat by Schalke. Real can take some small consolation in the fact that city rival Atletico Madrid could only draw 0-0 at Espanyol, meaning the defending champion stayed fourth in the table following Valencia's 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna on Friday. Atletico defender Miranda was sent off in time added on at the end of the first half for a foul on Abraham. Diego Simeone's side hosts German club Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday as it seeks to overturn a 1-0 deficit and seek to match last season's achievement of reaching the Champions League final. Barca, also looking to join Real in the quarterfinals, faces a City side reeling after Saturday's 1-0 defeat by relegation-threatened Burnley. It left Manuel Pellegrini's team five points behind English Premier League leader Chelsea, which has two games in hand ahead of Sunday's home clash with Southampton. ""We must continue to fight but the chances of winning the title are far as things stand,"" said Pellegrini, whose team must overcome a 2-1 deficit at the Nou Camp next week. ""There is still a chance, but it is more difficult after this result. We needed to create more chances than we did and find more space in and around their defense."" The Chilean refused to blame the referee for not awarding what appeared to be a clear penalty for City in the dying minutes, when Pablo Zabaleta was brought down in the box. ""Was it a penalty? Maybe, but the referee decides these moments and I don't think that was the most important thing in this game,"" he said. ""The issue for us at present is that we are not winning the games that we normally do, especially against teams we are expected to beat, and that is because we are not scoring goals."" City, seeking to retain its EPL title, is only one point ahead of third-placed Arsenal after Arsene Wenger's team won 3-0 at home to West Ham on Saturday. The London side has now won four games in all competitions since suffering a shock 3-1 home defeat by Wenger's former club Monaco in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie last month. ""We have to believe that we can do it,"" the Frenchman said of Tuesday's trip to the principality. ""This time Monaco are favorites so we have to go there, give absolutely everything and come out of the game with that feeling."" Monaco moved up to fourth in the French league on Friday, beating nine-man Bastia 3-0 as Anthony Martial scored twice and Lavyin Kurzawa missed a penalty. Italian club Juventus, another side in Champions League action next week, went 14 points clear in Serie A with a 1-0 win at mid-table Palermo on Saturday. Spanish substitute Alvaro Morata ended Palermo's six-month unbeaten home run with a curling winner to maintain the Turin team's momentum ahead of Wednesday's trip to Borussia Dortmund. The German side, which trails 2-1 after the first leg thanks to goals from Morata and Carlos Tevez, drew 0-0 at home to Cologne Saturday to remain in mid-table after a second successive scoreless draw in the Bundesliga. Defending champion Bayern Munich moved 14 points clear at the top with a 4-0 win at Werder Bremen, as Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored twice to add to his goal from the midweek Champions League thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk. Thomas Muller, who netted twice in the 7-0 routing of the Ukrainian side, opened the scoring while David Alaba bagged the second goal. Third-placed Leverkusen, meanwhile, triumphed 4-0 over Stuttgart on Friday, with Josip Drmic scoring two. Wolfsburg, eight points ahead of Leverkusen, hosts second-bottom Freiburg on Sunday.

"(CNN)When Chinese photographer Wang Wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed Soviet camera in 1967, he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. ""I made rolls of film out of a motion-picture reel I found. The photographic paper was left over from printing Mao's portraits,"" Wang told CNN. Five decades later, Wang, 61, is one of the country's top photojournalists. His work is a rich chronicle of China's fast-changing society. ""Still images are fragments, sections and points that connect the history,"" Wang says. ""The whole process of China's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- I've been determined to and have managed to document it all."" One of his most famous series of photographs tracks China's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets. Photography was an outlet for Wang during the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, when China was convulsed by violent class struggle. His family were labeled ""capitalist roaders"" and unlike most other kids, he couldn't join the red guards. Despondent, 14-year-old Wang wandered around Beijing with friends in similar situations, snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself. Taking photos turned into more than a pastime in January 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of Mao's excesses. Wang went to Tiananmen Square with his camera, capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief, both then, and again in April that year. ""I was in deep grief,"" Wang said, ""And I felt I should record the collective grief."" He kept the film secret from the military, which then employed him as a photographer, transferring it to friends. The photos were published in the early 1980s. From then on, Wang saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper. ""I didn't get photojournalism until then,"" he said. ""My biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the Cultural Revolution period; it would've been a precious record."" In the decades following, Wang has photographed not only major events -- from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 and the overthrow of the Gang of Four, to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in China's changing countryside and growing cities. From April 3, Wang will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the United States at the University of Iowa. Curator Judy Polumbaum -- a Chinese media scholar and former colleague of Wang -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary China. ""It reflects not only the many changes in Chinese society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition, and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change,"" she said. The clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit — an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and ""the couple's Western wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom,"" she says. Wang has spent most of his career at the China Daily, the country's official English-language paper, which he joined in 1980 before its official launch. Back then, it broke the mold, using large photographs rather than the stamp-sized images used in most other Chinese newspapers at the time, he says. It was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages, rather than national leaders -- something Wang found he excelled at. ""Thanks to the China Daily, I stood out. It was an irreplaceable platform."" Wang finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s, when ideas emerged and collided after the Cultural Revolution ended. ""People thought nothing was impossible,"" he said. ""We reflected on the past and were determined to move on. It was a special time; the air was filled with ideals, enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities."" Today's China is different,  he said. ""The country's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s,"" he said. ""Individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals."" Throughout his career, Wang's focus has changed a great deal as well. He said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography, but now, with smart phones, he says anyone can be a photographer. To Wang, what matters is the perspective, he said, pointing at his head. Wang says he's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years. ""My job isn't to chant slogans."" ""I take photos first. It's great if they can be published; if not, they'll eventually be part of the history."" Next year will mark Wang's 40th year in photojournalism. He is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it ""Unfinished."" The name was inspired by the alternative title of Franz Schubert's Symphony No.8. ""China is unfinished,"" said Wang, who is also fan and critic of classic music. ""It's always a work in progress.""","Wang Wenlan has been a photojournalist in China for almost four decades .

"(CNN)Solar Impulse 2 has landed safely in Oman on the first leg of its quest to be the first plane to fly around the world fueled only by the sun's rays. The solar-powered plane took off from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates early on Monday with pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls for the 400-kilometer (250 mile) flight. The journey was expected to take about 12 hours, but high winds of up to 11 knots delayed its landing, forcing Borschberg to fly in a holding pattern above Muscat until they dropped to safe levels. Once safely on the ground, Borschberg said he was ""extremely happy"" and ""looking forward to the rest of [the] adventure."" Solar Impulse 2's visit to Oman is a short pit-stop on its marathon 35,000-kilometer, five month journey across the globe, via India, Myanmar, China and the U.S. The plane is expected to be on the ground for just eight hours before it takes off again -- this time with pilot Bertrand Piccard in charge -- bound for Ahmedabad in India. The potentially historic flight had originally been due to take off on March 1 but its departure was postponed because of concerns about the weather after strong dust storms created hazy conditions. ""We have had a lot of sandstorms in Abu Dhabi, and also a lot of wind, sea breezes, higher than the limit,"" said the team's meteorologist Luc Truellemans in an interview posted on Twitter and YouTube. By Monday morning, the skies had cleared sufficiently for takeoff, though there was a slight delay while technical checks were carried out, as pilot Andre Borschberg explained on Twitter. Eventually the plane got off the ground, under the watchful eye of fellow pilot Piccard. Monday's journey to Oman was a relatively short one, compared to some of the longer legs, which will take up to five or six days and nights. Borschberg and Piccard will spend a total of 500 hours behind the controls over the entire trip, taking it in turns in the tiny 3.8-square meter single-seater cockpit. Before the takeoff, Piccard admitted the pair ""had ""butterflies in the stomach"" at the thought of getting underway after working on the project for so long. On Sunday, the pair joked about tossing a coin for the right to fly first, before tearfully revealing that they had already decided who would be doing what. ""Andre has worked on this airplane ... for 12 years, from the feasibility study until now; it is more than natural that he takes the first step,"" said Piccard. Borschberg added: ""Bertrand deserves to fly the last leg, and to make the arrival in Abu Dhabi, completing the vision he created 15 years ago."" The pair will also split ocean-flying duties: Piccard will take on the five-day, five-night journey across the Pacific, while Borschberg will tackle the Atlantic. Solar Impulse's 72-meter (236-foot) wingspan makes it wider than a Boeing 747, but the plane weighs just 2.5 tons, lighter than a large SUV. The tiny cockpit will be packed with essentials for the journey -- enough food and water for a week -- as well as a parachute, life raft and oxygen bottles in case of emergencies. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999.","Solar Impulse completes first leg of its round-the-world flight, from Abu Dhabi to Oman .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely formal, yet troubling scene. A room in a far flung corner of Afghanistan where a serious lecture is happening, to an audience that seems part ideological, part curious; some are just impoverished, hoping for a quick job. At the front of this room stands an Afghan freshly back from fighting in Syria, and intent on recruiting other Afghans to fight alongside him for ISIS. ""Brothers, I am here to tell you"", the recruiter begins, ""about the mujahideen in Syria."" All faces are hidden in the footage, yet the motivations are clear. This seems to be part of ISIS's first moves into Afghanistan, a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in Iraq and Syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former Taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause. But it's a troubling move nonetheless. There's no shortage of battle-hardened militants here. And as NATO leaves, the Taliban looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the Afghan government could alienate some of the group's more radical elements. The man is one of five recruiters, he says -- some foreign, others Afghan like him, spread out across the country. His message is broadly ideological. ""Jihad is now obligatory not only in Afghanistan, but also in many other places in the world,"" the recruiter tells the room. ""The Christians and Jews have not only attacked Afghanistan, but they have also attacked Muslims in Syria, Iraq and Palestine. So Jihad is obligatory on us in these places."" His reception is mixed, but to one audience member the ideological appeal is clear. ""My aim is to fight infidels,"" the man says. ""In Syria, or if they ask me to in Afghanistan, I will."" Another man says he would prefer to stay home and go to university, but he is attracted by the recruiter's offer of money. ""I definitely need the money,"" he says, ""but will stay here and hope peace comes."" Concerns are growing about how ISIS may expand into Afghanistan. When asked why ISIS might be on the rise here, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: ""The reason it's happening is because (the) collapse of Yemen, Syria, Iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states, now there are wider spaces."" Ghani added: ""They have -- it's one of the most well-endowed finance -- well-financed organizations. And the techniques are spreading."" The United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan, Nicholas Haysom, told the Security Council that  ISIS's presence in Afghanistan was ""of concern,"" but was most troubling in its ""potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally."" A senior U.S. official told CNN that ""the terrain is there"" for ISIS to grow in Afghanistan. This is ""something everyone is keeping a very close eye on. Afghanistan government is concerned. Pakistan government is concerned,"" he said, before adding that disaffected Taliban might also be attracted to the group. The path to CNN's filming with the recruiter was complex. An Afghan cameraman working for CNN was introduced at first to militants seeking to recruit fighters to assist an al Qaeda-linked group in Syria. Weeks later it emerged they were in fact working for ISIS. The group the militants say they come from -- Khorasan -- is better known as a radical part of the al Qaeda faction of al-Nusra, in Syria, where many Afghans fight. Yet ISIS experts say some of Khorasan's militants have defected to join ISIS, and those defectors in turn sent recruiters to Afghanistan to try to bolster their ranks. At the meeting that our cameraman was permitted to film, the militants produced application forms that bear the logo of the Islamic State -- the name the group prefers to be called -- although they appeared to be using the group's older nomenclature of ISIS on the documents. While these recruiters seek to attract fighters to Syria, their presence in Afghanistan at this pivotal time will fuel fears that the country remains vulnerable to being used as a sanctuary for a new wave of extremists.","There's no shortage of battle-hardened militants in Afghanistan, writes Nick Paton-Walsh .

"(CNN)For the first time, the U.S. Air Force has resurrected a B-52 bomber that had been in long-term storage at the Boneyard, the portion of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona, where the military sends aircraft that have been retired from the fleet. The 53-year-old Stratofortress, tail number 61-1007, nicknamed the ""Ghost Rider"" had been in storage at the desert in the care of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) since 2008. Thousands of aircraft are stored at the Boneyard, where the dry desert environment helps preserve them. Some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet. Others are brought back into service. Ghost Rider, after upgrades, will become the first B-52 to return to duty from the Boneyard. Though the dry desert air inhibits corrosion, the baking heat can have other adverse effects, including causing dry rot in the tires and fuel lines. The lines and fuel bladders in Ghost Rider were completely replaced, Tech. Sgt. Stephen Sorge, a fuels specialist from the 307th Maintenance Squadron, said in an Air Force report on the project. Once that work was done, the plane's engines were tested again in January. On February 13, Ghost Rider flew again, a three-hour flight from Davis-Monthan to its new home, Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, Louisiana. The resurrection process took 70 days, according to the Air Force report . ""I've been flying the B-52s since the '80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems,"" Col. Keith Schultz said in the Air Force report after piloting the eight-engine jet on the 1,000-mile flight. Schultz, who with more than 6,500 hours flying B-52s is the most experienced active pilot of that aircraft in the service, led a co-pilot and a navigator, the minimum three-person crew, on the flight to Louisiana. The B-52 would normally fly with a crew of five. ""Those were the only three seats we had activated for egress,"" he told the Shreveport Times. For safety reasons, Ghost Rider made the entire flight with its landing gear down, at a speed of only 288 mph and at a height of 23,000 feet, well below its top speed of 650 mph and ceiling of 50,000 feet, according to the Times report. It also flew without some of the other things aviators have come to rely on. ""We were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed,"" Schulz said in the Air Force release. Ghost Rider will replace another bomber at Barksdale that was damaged by a fire during maintenance. ""We had an oxygen leak with a spark and it caused a cockpit fire. There was so much damage it was actually more economical to bring this one out of the desert,"" Schultz told the Times. For a time, Ghost Rider will sit beside the damaged B-52 for transfer of usable, updated equipment, the Times reported. It is expected to resume active service next year. As of May 2014, the Air Force reported there were 76 Stratofortresses in its fleet, 58 in the active force and 18 in the Air Force Reserve. Besides Barksdale, B-52s are based at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.","U.S. Air Force resurrects B-52 Stratofortress for return to service .

"(CNN)History has repeated itself at Indian Wells with the surprise withdrawal of Serena Williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury. Williams' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister Venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott, amid claims of racism, that only ended this year. Williams had been due to play Romanian Simona Halep on Friday night, but instead posted news of her withdrawal on Instagram. ""Four months ago I began a journey to play Indian Wells and it was amazing. I never dreamed I could do it. But I would not have been able to do this without my fans. Though it ended early due to injury this year, I have to say I cannot wait to try again next year. Thanks everyone. I love you so much!"" Williams posted. Back in 2001, crowds booed a young Serena as she took on Belgian Kim Clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the BNP Paribas Open. Despite being on home soil, spectators backed Clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster Pam Shriver said were difficult to watch. ""You would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the U.S. player, so it clearly was the exact opposite. Because she was American, because she was so young, because she was African-American, predominantly white audience. It was tough, it was tough to listen to,"" Shriver told CNN's Open Court. Shriver watched as spectators booed Serena's father Richard and sister Venus, as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match. ""That's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals,"" Shriver said. Minutes before the highly-anticipated semifinal between the two sisters, Venus pulled out due to a knee injury. Her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors, which the family denies, that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father, who kept a tight control on his daughters' careers. Despite the booing, Williams beat Clijsters to take the title. But the issue did not end there. Days later, Richard Williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse, Bill Dwyre, who covered the match for L.A. Times told Open Court. ""Richard Williams had said that the n-word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated. ... that was the beginning of Serena never coming back."" After 14 years of refusing to play at Indian Wells, Serena Williams, who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade, said that she was ""following her heart"" by deciding to rejoin the tournament. ""In order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything,"" she told reporters at a pre-match news conference.  Serena said she discussed it with her father in a ""really emotional"" conversation and he agreed. ""He said it would be a big mistake if I didn't go back and I thought that was really admirable,"" Williams said. Before the match, she told reporters that, by returning, she felt like she'd already won. ""I don't think I need to hold the trophy at the end of it. I feel like I'm already holding the trophy. I've never felt that way before,"" she said. ""Just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it's a wonderful feeling.""

"(CNN)Is Philae still alive? The answer to this particular cosmic cliff-hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year. The tiny space probe bounced across the surface of Comet 67P before touching down away from its intended landing zone. It returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there wasn't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since November. In the months since, mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place. But now the comet-chasing mother ship Rosetta -- in orbit around 67P -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark. Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the Sun, believe that if enough sunlight falls on Philae's solar panels it could revive. As the comet gets closer to the Sun and more light illuminates the lander, the chances improve. Lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself, nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two-way communication with the orbiter. Modern energy-saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it doesn't need much to re-establish contact. On Tuesday, @ESA_Rosetta tweeted: ""Excited! I have some opportunities to listen for @philae2014 to find out if he's awake!"" Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter . On the Rosetta mission blog, lander project manager Stephan Ulamec says: ""It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day."" The mission website adds that Philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with Rosetta. It says Rosetta will transmit to Philae between March 12 and March 20, listening for a response. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. However, the mishap could prove to be a happy accident. O'Rourke explained that as the comet nears the Sun, Philae's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics. In that position it most likely would have died by now. From lander pictures, mission controllers think Philae, which is about the size of a washing machine, is tucked up underneath a cliff face, affording it some shade. Beginning Thursday, mission controllers will send what O'Rourke described as ""blind commands"" to Philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it can't respond. Philae will be told to save power for the transmitter. O'Rourke admits that it's a ""long shot"" but the team will try again in April if this attempt fails. If Philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the Sun in August. ""I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point,"" said O'Rourke. Even if Philae never wakes up, all is not lost. The mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface, though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed. And the Rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets. O'Rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being ""an icy dirtball."" He described discoveries of dust and large ""boulders"" circling the comet after they were blown off by the Sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole. ""The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery,"" he said. Scientists have already applauded the mission's success to date.

"(CNN)Students en route to Yangon, Myanmar, to protest an education bill were met with violence from police Tuesday, according to multiple media reports and international watch groups. ""We all watched while a young man was beaten extremely hard and repeatedly by about three or four policemen in heavy riot gear,"" U Zarni, a spokesman for the Cooperative Committee for Trade Unions, told CNN. Students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities, but these have been curbed because of the crackdown. The violence Tuesday occurred in Letpadan, a town of about 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of Yangon, the nation's largest city. The students' march began in Mandalay, about 640 kilometers (400 miles) north of Yangon. Zarni said the students had been ""given the red light"" on proceeding to Yangon. ""They had decided they would drive into the city, meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse,"" Zarni said. ""But within about an hour of being given this information, they were told that wasn't the case."" ""Some students decided they would try, thinking the police would just take them away, but the police were so brutal."" Police arrested about 40 to 50 people, according to Zarni. ""They broke a reporter's camera and cheered about it. They hit women. They hit monks who were also there. They went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there,"" Zarni said. Human rights issues have been at the forefront in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule, with elections planned for late this year. ""The public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions,"" Zarni said. Khin Lay, director of the Triangle Women Support Group, agreed. ""Students, human rights, women's rights -- we're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years,"" said Lay. ""But we've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement, and we're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote. So they should show us some respect, too.""","Police in town north of Yangon, Myanmar, crack down on students marching in protest of an education bill .

"Jerusalem (CNN)In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction. But this powerful new face in Israeli politics is not Jewish. While he is an Israeli citizen, the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of Palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. Under Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. Come election day on Tuesday, they are poised to take as many as 15 seats. This could potentially make them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. It is a game-changer, giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. His most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the ""most racist government in history."" ""Netanyahu says the danger to Israel is not Palestinians in the West Bank, but rather Arabs in Israel. What is that telling me as a citizen of Haifa?"" he asked in an interview on Saturday. ""With 15 seats in the Knesset, no one will ever be able to ignore us again."" Until now, Arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences. They run the spectrum from communist to Islamist. But a law passed by the last Knesset, sponsored by the right-wing party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the Knesset. Many believed Lieberman's goal was to push the Arab parties out of the Knesset. It's a theory that was given credence when, in recent televised debate, Lieberman warned Odeh, ""You are here for now."" ""Why are you even here?"" Leiberman said to Odeh. Baiting him by accusing him of ""representing terror groups,"" Lieberman turned to Odeh and said, ""You're not wanted here."" Odeh politely noted that his Joint List was polling well ahead of Lieberman's party. ""I'm very wanted in my homeland,"" he said. ""I'm part of the scenery. I resemble it."" With that calm, dignified response, Odeh attracted political star status among Jews and Arabs alike. At the Hebrew University forum, event students campaigning for the Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party wanted to take selfies with him. More importantly, he has given hope to the 1.6 million Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality. In the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa where Odeh grew up, the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son. Odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician, speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the Joint List gets enough seats to change the face of the Israeli government. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. Growing up, he says he identified with Malcolm X. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. ""What makes people vote is the hope of change,"" he said. ""We have been ceding hope again and again. But we are 20% of the population. We can prevent the right from forming a government."" There is some skepticism here that Arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run, but most are hopeful. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. ""We've asked for so many rights we don't we won't get,"" Abuilat says. ""The big eat the small. But united, we can be strong. This is a good first step."" If, as many expect, Likud or Labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government, they may be forced to join together in a ""national unity"" government. That would make the next biggest group of parties, and Odeh, the official opposition. It's a position he says he would prefer over joining an Israeli government, which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the Palestinians. The Prime Minister is required to brief the leader of the opposition at least once a month on diplomatic and security matters. Odeh would be entitled to a seat on Israel's foreign affairs committee in the Knesset and is obligated to address the Knesset after every speech by the Prime Minister. He would also protected by the Shin Bet security service. He would have the ear of foreign leaders, who would reach out and meet with him to hear his views. Odeh says he needs the help of Israeli Jews, who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all Israelis. ""Arabs alone cannot make a democracy strong. It has to be Arabs and Jews,"" he says. ""My dream is one day we will build a real Arab-Jew party, and I tell Jews to come join us and build a true democratic party in this country."" It's a message that resonates back at Hebrew University, where some Jewish students are joining the fight against what they call institutional discrimination in Israel. ""It is not only a struggle of the Palestinian minority living in Israel. It is the struggle of the Palestinian minority together with democratic Jews like myself,"" says Ofer, a student with the Jewish communist Hadash party. It's not a vision shared by most in Israel, but Odeh's message to students is ""this is your chance."" By finding their voice and using their vote, he says, they can make the dream of equality a reality.","Ayman Odeh is a new face in politics: He is an Israeli citizen and a charismatic lawyer of Palestinian descent .

"(CNN)It has been one of the world's longest and deadliest civil conflicts. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. It has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. Whatever it has been to the parties involved, the leader of the militant group at the forefront of the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey says it is time now for it to be over. ""Our struggle came to the point it cannot continue as it is,"" Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), said earlier in March from his jail cell. In a letter read to thousands gathered in the southeastern Turkey city of Diyarbakir to mark Persian New Year, Ocalan called for ""a new era"" with Kurds gathering as ""a democratic society with the right to a democratic identity -- within Turkey and on the constitutional citizenship basis."" He urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Ocalan's letter is nothing less than historic. As recently as 2012, the long-simmering war between the PKK and the Turkish government had heated to the point that the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization monitoring the conflict, counted more than 700 dead over 14 months. ""We're seeing the longest pitched battles between the (Turkish) army and the PKK, we're seeing a widespread campaign of kidnapping, suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the PKK. They're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides,"" Hugh Pope, chief author of an International Crisis Group report, told CNN in 2012. Perhaps vocally underscoring the cultural split between the Turkish government and the country's Kurdish population, when Ocalan's letter was read to crowds March 21, it was read in two languages -- Kurdish first, then Turkish. The letter was read by Sirri Sureyya Onder, deputy of Turkey's pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party. Onder is one of the few people regularly allowed to meet Ocalan at the prison where he is held on Imrali Island. ""Saturday officially showed us all that we have moved on to the negotiation period from the dialogue period we've been working on,"" Onder told CNN in a phone interview. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey. By 1998 -- 14 years after the insurgency began -- Turkey counted up to 18,000 PKK guerrillas living in the mountains. The next year, Ocalan -- a hero to some, a villain to others -- was captured in Kenya by Turkish authorities, reportedly with the help of the CIA. The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist group. Ocalan was sentenced by the Turkish government to life in prison for treason, and for years, he was the sole prisoner of Imrali. It's an Alcatraz-like island fortress best known in the West as the locale for the 1970s book and movie ""Midnight Express."" Now, he gets to choose fellow inmates. Ocalan began the PKK in 1978 as a Kurdish separatist group in Turkey, part of a larger separatist movement by Kurds scattered throughout the region. Northern Syria, southern Turkey and northern Iraq have been home to millions of Kurds for thousands of years. There are also millions of Kurds in Iran, where they make up about 10% of the mostly Persian nation's population. Violence flared in August 1984 when fighters from the PKK, which has a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, killed two Turkish soldiers.  As the years passed and the death toll mounted, the PKK proved to be a militant leg of a regional ethnic struggle to carry on the Kurdish culture. But there have been periods of calm and times of talk. In 2009, Turkish intelligence officials allegedly met with high-ranking PKK members in Oslo, Norway, to begin a series of secret talks. In mid-2011, the talks were interrupted by new clashes. The armed fights were followed by a hunger strike by Kurdish political prisoners in 2012, who ended the strike after 67 days upon Ocalan's request. Things picked back up when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced talks with the imprisoned Ocalan in December 2012. Since then, the Turkish government has lifted language bans, released political prisoners and continued talks with Ocalan despite opposition criticism. In return, the jailed leader notably pronounced disarmament intentions and called for a ceasefire in his Persian New Year's letter in 2013. On May 8 of  that year, the PKK announced a slow withdrawal from Turkey. But tensions between the sides sparked again when the predominantly Kurdish-populated city of Kobani was invaded by ISIS in October and Turkey didn't directly intervene. Talks between the PKK and the Turkish government continued, though. But at Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace last month, senior government officials met with pro-Kurdish parliamentarians and declared a ""road map"" accord on the way to a stable solution. Onder said that Ocalan's letter ""shows us that the ... road map decided at Dolmabahce is now a concrete step -- one that suits the spirit and the context of the resolution period."" But the government view over the accord seems to be divided. Erdogan told reporters that he does not fancy the declaration. Erdogan was not present at Dolmabahce either. Onder said, ""Despite the President's opposing remarks, the Turkish government took responsibility about its Kurdish problem for the first time.""","Kurds make up about a fifth of Turkey's population .
Since 1984, the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has fought the Turkish government .
Now, the leader of the PKK says it's time for the fighting to stop ."
"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces now have control of Tikrit Military Hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from ISIS. The joint forces raised the Iraqi flag from the hospital premises Wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides, the Hashd Al-Shaabi paramilitary force said. The predominantly Shia militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit from ISIS. The hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, Iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that the consensus was that Iran's involvement was positive in military terms. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" he said. But at the same time, Dempsey said, the United States is concerned about what role Iran might seek in the longer term once ISIS is defeated. While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province. ISIS launched a new offensive on the city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, said in a statement. The city is being attacked ""from all directions,"" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it, he said. Some 17 explosives-laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center, he said. One vehicle targeted a bridge that provides access to the city from the north. This is ""the fiercest attack by ISIS"" seen on Ramadi, al-Issawi said. Iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city. Al-Issawi said the Iraqi air force was urgently needed. ""We need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the Iraqi air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target,"" he said. Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north,"" he added. He said there had been 10 casualties among Iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured. In the 24 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday morning, there were 13 airstrikes in Iraq and two in Syria, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said in a statement. The strikes in Iraq were concentrated near Mosul, Al Qaim and Falluja. There were none in the Tikrit or Ramadi areas. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council. Al-Karhout, speaking to CNN by telephone, said 80% of Karma, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Falluja, was now under the control of Iraqi security forces after a large-scale operation that started Tuesday at dawn. Dozens of ISIS militants were killed in clashes with Iraqi soldiers, he said. The second phase of the operation is to clear any remnants of the ISIS force from the town and to remove any mines and bombs left behind. Iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with Shia Hashd Al-Shaabi units and local tribesmen, Al-Karhout said. Health officials in Falluja told CNN that the Falluja general hospital received the bodies of 25 ISIS militants killed in the Karma battle. ISIS is also battling in many places far from Tikrit, including Syria, where the militant group is more on the offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based nongovernmental organization. ""Hundreds of ISIS militants launched a large scale offensive on Ras al Ayn, a Syrian strategic border town with Turkey on Friday,"" SOHR said in a statement Wednesday. ""They made some advances there and seized Tal Khanzir."" Clashes are still ongoing between the Kurdish People's Protection Units (Kurdish YPG) and ISIS fighters, with dozens killed from both sides, SOHR said. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Baghdad, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Jamie Crawford and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","A major offensive by Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit was launched just over a week ago .

"(CNN)Forget the pyramids, Tahrir Square and the Nile. Egypt is ready to ditch Cairo and build a shiny new capital  if the government has its way. Fed up with pollution, traffic gridlock, a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure, Egypt is teaming up with a developer in the United Arab Emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure programs. The yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles, or roughly the size of Denver, and could eventually be home to 7 million people, the developers and government announced Friday. The current capital of Cairo, while full of history and vibrant charm, is home to more than 18 million people, and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating. The government says the idea is to reduce congestion in Cairo, which is projected to double in population in the coming decades. An exact location was not announced, but the city is expected to be built east of Cairo. It will be closer to the Red Sea -- between two major highways -- the Suez and the Ain Sokhna roads. The ambitions are big. In addition to the new embassies and government buildings, it plans to have an international airport bigger than Heathrow, solar energy farms, 40,000 hotel rooms,  nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals --  all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads. But if the dream is big, the bill will be bigger. The total cost is estimated at U.S. $45 billion, Minister of Housing Mostafa Madbouly announced at an economic development conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools. The plan is backed by a group that describes itself as ""a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships"" led by Emirati developer Mohamed Alabbar. Alabbar made his name as the founder of Dubai's Emaar Properties, primarily known for developing the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures.  Myanmar has only recently completed its move from crumbling Yangon to the new city of Naypyidaw. Nigeria moved to Abuja in the 1990's, and Brazil carved its capital Brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago. And then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time. That city? Washington, D.C.","The yet-to-be-named city will be roughly the size of Denver .

"Montabaur, Germany (CNN)On the surface, Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz seemed, in the words of those who had known him, normal, capable, even fun. But, German prosecutors said Friday, he was clearly trying to hide something in the days before he sent Germanwings Flight 9525 plowing into a mountain, killing himself and 149 others aboard. Investigators searching Lubitz's Dusseldorf apartment said they found documents revealing he'd been declared unfit for work. The letter,  Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa, said, was found ""slashed"" in a dust bin. The revelation only adds to the myriad questions swirling around Lubitz, 27, whom authorities say deliberately destroyed the plane. The biggest question of all, still, is why? Lufthansa CEO 'speechless' That's the question police were hoping  to answer as they searched Lubitz's apartment. Police spokesman Markus Niesczery said a team of five investigators went ""through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down."" They didn't find a goodbye note or anything directly explaining the crash, the public prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf said in a statement. They say it will be a few more days before they can say anything more publicly about what they found. Outside the apartment, neighbors contacted Friday said they didn't know Lubitz and are simply flummoxed by all the attention to the quiet suburban neighborhood featuring a handful of businesses, restaurants, running rails and a lake. Meanwhile, about 85 miles (136 kilometers) away in the town of Montabaur, the house where Lubitz's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police. A group of men, perhaps investigators, were the only ones granted access on Thursday. On Friday, there was no activity at all. Montabaur, in western Germany, is where Lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age. At a club on the outskirts of town, pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said. They said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane. Between age 14 and age 20, Lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club. ""(He was) a very normal young person, full of energy,"" Klaus Radke said. ""What can I say? He had a bright future. He made his hobby into his job. What more can you hope to achieve?"" The authorities' explanation doesn't ring true for Peter Ruecker, another pilot who knew him from the flight club. ""Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me,"" Ruecker told the Reuters news agency. ""He was a lot of fun, even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet,"" Ruecker said. ""He was just another boy, like so many others here."" An acquaintance said Lubitz was health conscious. He was a recreational athlete and didn't smoke. ""I can't imagine that he was mentally ill, depressed and sad. He doesn't seem like that,"" Johannes Rossbach told CNN. ""So I was shocked when I heard that."" An 8-minute descent to death . Before Tuesday's crash, Lubitz appeared to have a ""clean bill of health,"" according to a Germanwings representative. Then came Friday's announcement of the discovery of documents revealing an illness that apparently made him unfit to fly a plane -- in the eyes of at least one doctor. Prosecutors didn't reveal what the illness was, but said the discovery ""leads to the preliminary conclusion, that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment."" The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported that Lubitz suffered from mental illness. Meanwhile, a Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently 17 days ago, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. Lubitz had been with Germanwings, a budget airline owned by Lufthansa, since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the airline's media office said. Officials say he passed a psychological test when he was hired, had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters that Lubitz ""interrupted"" his training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr said he couldn't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training. If it was for medical reasons, he said, then that information would have been private before the crash, but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation. Reuters reported that a German newspaper , Bild, said Lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago. Citing internal documents forwarded by Lufthansa to German authorities, Bild reported that Lubitz had suffered a ""serious depressive episode"" around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009, Reuters reported. The Bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment. Lufthansa officials and German prosecutors declined to comment on the Bild story, Reuters said. Most of Lubitz's training took place at the Lufthansa flight training center in Germany. He also trained in the United States, spending six months at facility in Arizona as part of a required program to get his license, a Lufthansa spokesperson said. A former trainer at the facility said the training is ""extremely stressful."" ""What made the hairs stand up on my neck in this case is that the co-pilot took some time off during training. For me that is very inexplicable and highly unusual,"" Oly Olson said. ""Usually the pilot trainees either progress or wash out, I never saw anyone take a break."" He clarified his remark, saying some people left due to a death in the family. Spohr said Lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying. However, the airline does consider an applicant's psychological state, along with other factors, when hiring pilots, he said. ""We don't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities,"" Spohr said. ""He was 100% set to fly without restrictions,"" he added. ""His flight performance was perfect. There was nothing to worry about."" Students, singers among the victims . 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing . Diana Magnay reported from Montabaur.

"(CNN)British military advisers are training Ukrainian troops in Ukraine, the UK said Thursday, as part of efforts to support the government in Kiev as it combats pro-Russian separatists in the east. Prime Minister David Cameron announced last month that Britain would send military advisers to Ukraine and provide an additional 15 million pounds ($22.3 million) in humanitarian aid. An uneasy truce has been in place since last month between the Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Last month, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Parliament that Britain was ""providing additional nonlethal support"" in the form of advisory and training teams. ""This support, provided at the request of the Ukrainian government, will help their armed forces develop and maintain the capacity and resilience they need, and help reduce fatalities and casualties,"" Fallon said. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has been monitoring the ceasefire, said Wednesday that its observers had witnessed continued fighting in areas around Donetsk airport and Shyrokyne, east of the port city of Mariupol. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the presence of foreign military instructors in Ukraine did nothing to reduce tensions, Russian state news agency Sputnik reported. ""Obviously, this is not helping in the building of trust or in easing the tensions in the conflict. It can be simply said that this is not aiding in the settlement, that's a fact,"" Peskov is quoted as saying. The United States has promised to support an upcoming training program for Ukraine's National Guard forces. Russia is under continued pressure from the West to end its support for the separatists. Moscow denies claims by Kiev and the West that it has trained and equipped the rebels, as well as sending Russian troops to fight alongside them. In what Kremlin observers may see as another sign of defiance, Russia signed a treaty Wednesday with Georgia's breakaway territory of South Ossetia. Russia sent its tanks into Georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged separatists in its South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions to declare independence from Tbilisi. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the ""so-called treaty on alliance and integration"" in a statement Wednesday, and repeated NATO's call for Russia to reverse its recognition of the territories as independent states and to withdraw its forces from Georgian soil. ""This so-called treaty is yet another move by the Russian Federation that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region,"" he said. ""It violates Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law, OSCE principles and Russia's international commitments. ""It does not contribute to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in Georgia.""

"(CNN)Pablo Picasso once asked: ""Are we to paint what's on the face, what's inside the face or what's behind it?"" Jessica Todd Harper's photo book ""The Home Stage"" does all three simultaneously. ""The Home Stage"" contains intimate, psychological portraits that Harper has created of herself, her family and friends, and their children. The book weaves in some photos of other people's families as well, and includes writing by Alain De Botton and Alison Nordstrom. Using her camera like a paintbrush to stroke the canvas that is her environment, Harper explores the experiences of parenting and childhood. As a mother to twin sons and a daughter, her photos contain a wide range of raw emotion, ranging from comfort and conflict to sleepiness and satisfaction. Harper's first photo book, ""Interior Exposure,"" focused on the early years of her marriage and adult family life. She says her latest book is like a natural segue, as ""The Home Stage"" includes many photos of children. The title -- ""The Home Stage"" -- has more than one particular meaning or reference. ""One is to convey that stage in life when you're anchored to the home with young children,"" Harper said. ""It also references how the home is the first stage in which children learn how to live in every situation. In my particular pictures, many of them have a stage-like quality. There's reference to tableau vivant of the past, these constructed images."" Harper's mother was a big fan of the arts, and she would take young Harper and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand, progressing from crayons to charcoal and, eventually, to pastels. ""I wanted to be just like Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent; those were the artists that I would copy a lot as a child,"" she said. ""I think those images got very much stuck into my deep psyche."" She emphasizes that her photos are not the everyday snapshots that many parents post on Facebook -- the photos of children at various stages in their lives, attending birthday parties or riding tricycles. The book's pictures ""aren't documents,"" Harper said. ""They're making everyday moments have an eternal quality. It reminds us of our more general purpose in life, the meaning in everyday small things."" The combination of Harper's color palette and the use of natural light fills every inch of her photos with rich detail. Many of Harper's photos contain several generations of her family, highlighting connections between the present, past and future. While the people Harper photographs are predominantly those most familiar with her, she makes an effort to not allow her camera to completely consume the lives of her subjects. ""I try to do a very good job of not being overbearing. ... I bring out the camera only when I have a very specific idea in mind. My children know that I'm an artist, I'm a photographer. They know that, but I don't think that they see that even in the top 10 of the ways that they relate to me, it's not as subjects,"" she said. ""I want to keep it that way because otherwise they become so self-conscious and they start doing things which are not natural or genuine."" Each photo draws the curtain to reveal Harper's home stage -- Harper lying in bed with her son Marshall, her husband playing in the backyard with their children, her daughter sitting in a high chair. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Regardless of the subject matter of the photos, Harper says there is one thing that ties all of them together: light. Throughout ""The Home Stage,"" Harper also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments. While Harper recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome, she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments. This is evident with the self-portrait she made holding her son Nicholas, stopping her family in the midst of their dinner preparations. ""At the time, I felt like so many parents. I felt tired and distracted and busy trying to get things done. I felt a little bit of guilt about making this picture,"" Harper said. ""And yet I knew somewhere in the back of my head that there was an imperative that I must take moments. ... You're just so busy that if you don't purposefully force it, then it wouldn't happen."" In one photo, viewers are witnesses to an intimate familial relationship as they simply see a mother as she lays her hand gently on her son's back. ""It's a universal mother-and-child gesture,"" Harper said. ""It doesn't even matter particularly who that individual mother or that individual child is because of the way they're framed and photographed. You can't see their faces. It's just the way that her hand is resting on his back. It's ownership and protection and love."" Jessica Todd Harper is an American photographer based in Philadelphia. Her book ""The Home Stage"" is available on Amazon, and the photos are on display at The Print Center in Philadelphia until March 28.","In her photo book ""The Home Stage,"" Jessica Todd Harper explores parenting and childhood .

"(CNN)The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday's Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel's Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday's parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn't always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's peace proposal -- a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 -- and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public's skepticism -- the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel's Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon's centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon's team has been advised against even mentioning the word ""peace"" for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.","Israel holds parliamentary elections on Tuesday .

"(CNN)How can I describe life in Crimea after a year under Russia's control? You start saying things like ""Let's not talk about this on the phone"" and become careful about the Facebook pages you ""like."" Because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the Soviet Union. In just one year so much has been lost and many Crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone's life. There is a growing level of censorship, inequality and political repression of those who don't agree with the government. In everyday communication, Crimeans, including those who support Putin and Russia, have to think about what they do and say. Thanks to the activities of the FSB (Russia's secret police) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again. In the Soviet Union, especially in the late 1930s, denunciations written by Soviet citizens about their neighbors, friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and Gulag camps. Now in Crimea, no one feels safe. Anyone who doesn't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a ""joyful"" conversation with the security services. Significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights, like freedom of movement. Now, there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass. For ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland Ukraine in the first months after annexation. Their fears were confirmed when Ukrainian activists and young Tatars began to disappear. Some were later found dead, others are still missing. Ukrainian patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula. The next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules, but could not. They started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically. They have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from Russia: Officials, police, FSB and other authorities. After annexation, many who had worked for the Ukrainian government in the police, army and security services swapped allegiances to the Russian side. The Kremlin was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit's personal files, which say they are ""inclined to betrayal."" One of the main arguments of pro-Russian locals is that the average salary in Russia is much higher. Indeed, since annexation, salaries have increased, especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools. The salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria, which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets. Then wages were cut again, by anywhere from 30% to 70% depending on the industry. Many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts, but no one protested because in Russia, you must obtain permission for a public assembly. Of course, permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the Kremlin. Tourism, a formerly dependable income source for many Crimeans, has been hit very hard. More than half of all tourists who used to visit Crimea in the summer were Ukrainian and last year tourism was down by 50%. Last summer, the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers. Despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation, many of those who were for the annexation of Crimea continue to support Russia. As strange as it may sound, the harder life becomes here in Crimea, the more people support Putin and hate Ukraine. In a little over a year, the Russian propaganda machine has turned Ukraine from ""brother state"" to Russia's main enemy. For some Crimeans 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland. Others saw a dream realized. What things will look like in another year is unclear, but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again.","Life under total surveillance and control now the norm in Crimea, says writer .

"(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says. Jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" he said. The Independent National Electoral Commission is still announcing the final tally in the polls, but early numbers indicate Buhari, now the President-elect, has an overwhelming majority of votes. Buhari ruled Nigeria from late 1983 until August 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup. His 20-month rule was known for what he described as a ""war on indiscipline,"" a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. His campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in Nigeria. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? Violent protests after elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference. Demonstrators fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state on Sunday as they marched to protest the elections amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. After the protests in Rivers, Buhari's All Progressives Congress demanded the elections there be canceled. ""There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,"" party spokesman Lai Mohammed said. But the People's Democratic Party disputed the accusation, saying the election was ""credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan."" Both candidates took to social media to call for calm. ""I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,"" Jonathan said on his Facebook account. ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,"" Buhari said on Twitter. Jonathan and  Buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to ""free, fair and credible elections"" after their signing of  the Abuja Accord in January. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" He advised anyone upset with the results to follow due process and stay away from further violence. ""As I have always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. The unity, stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else,"" he said. Read more: Democracy was the real winner . More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate. Nigeria's vote had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. CNN's Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos, Nigeria, while CNN's Susannah Cullinane and Stephanie Busari wrote from London.","Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan acknowledges defeat, says he delivered on promise of fair elections .

"(CNN)I can't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government, but I will never forget the morning in 1983 when two FBI agents showed up on my parents' doorstep. I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18. A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business. I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team. Two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the FBI. They said they needed to talk to me. Let me start with a little history: I got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school. We had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached. We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing. I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out. The teacher dialed into the central office computer, logged in and started the math program. I felt like a new world opened for me. For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up. That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school. There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM. For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others. We would play with computers at school, in Explorer Scouts, in stores like Radio Shack and at home. Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer. Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own. I purchased a Heathkit H-89, which we built in a friend's basement. At the same time I also bought a Hayes 309 baud Smartmodem. I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances. We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked. We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research. We were really just looking around and playing games on these systems; we didn't want to harm anything. This was pretty easy because computers back then were built with a basic set of login information, all of it written in the manuals. We didn't see any harm in it. We would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and, when we got together for Explorers, we'd talk about exploring, not harming systems. At some point, we started calling our group the ""4-1-4s,"" a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park. We noticed etchings on the tables with numbers like 1-9 and 2-7, gang signatures that came from the streets where they operated. Since we all lived in the Milwaukee area, we more or less jokingly gave ourselves the gang name of 414s for the Milwaukee area code. As the months went on, we started to notice issues staying connected with our modems for any length of time. Then, the FBI showed up at my home. Remember, back then home computers were very new, so there were no computer hacking laws. After about a year of back and forth with the FBI, three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls, which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $500 fine each. As I sat before the judge with my lawyer, he asked why he should not give me prison time. I had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child. So I explained that I would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life. The judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that I could not own a modem during the time I remained on probation. Under the deal, we were charged with misdemeanors that carried two years' probation and a $500 fine. Our records would be expunged under the federal youth corrections act. Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers. Oh, and I'm still married to the love of my life. The things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths: We helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety. It makes me proud as a network engineer working partially in security knowing that, in a way, what we did as a group made for safer computing today. There are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords, companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems. We could have caused some damage to these companies and many were surprised that we just looked around and played games. Today, hacking is a whole different world.","As a teen, Timothy Winslow fell in love with exploring computer systems around the nation .

"(CNN)Lewis Hamilton laid down a daunting marker for his Formula One rivals at Saturday's qualifying for the opening race of the 2015 season. The world champion will start on pole for the Australian Grand Prix, as he did last year and has done on three other occasions in his career. While the British driver failed to finish the 2014 race -- the only time he did not convert first on the grid to first at the checkered flag -- he is more hopeful this time as he seeks his first victory in Melbourne since winning his only other world title back in 2008. Hamilton was over half a second quicker than Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, and nearly 1.4 seconds faster than third-placed Felipe Massa of Williams. ""We had a difficult season last year here, so definitely as a team, as a whole, we're hoping for a better start, for both cars to succeed tomorrow,"" the 30-year-old said. ""So we're going to work as hard as we can to make sure we do that and lots of work to be done tonight for the race tomorrow, because that is going to be a huge challenge still and obviously a good fight, hopefully, with Nico."" Rosberg, runner-up in last year's championship amid considerable tension between the two drivers, said his teammate ""drove like a champ."" ""Lewis was in impressive form today, he did an awesome job and nailed it all the time,"" said the German, who had an engine cutout in the second session and then ran wide in Q3. ""For me, the speed was there but I just didn't get it together today. So it wasn't a great day. ""Lewis was quick but I didn't get my laps together today so I'm not too worried about pace -- I'm not worried about pace at all. On Friday, in the long runs, my pace was very strong so yeah, hopefully it can be the other way tomorrow."" The veteran Massa said he achieved his goal of being the ""best of the rest"" as he finished just ahead of Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettel and the German's teammate Kimi Raikkonen. ""The Ferraris looked strong and were pushing us hard,"" said the Brazilian, who has failed to finish in seven of 12 starts at Albert Park including last year. ""It will be a tough battle tomorrow so we need to get the start right and have a good strategy to secure a podium and really start the season on a high note."" Massa's Williams teammate Valtteri Bottas qualified sixth but will face a fitness test on Sunday morning after experiencing back pain in the first two sessions. Four-time world champion Vettel played down Ferrari's big improvement on last season's speed. ""Let's keep our feet on the ground. So far this weekend, it's gone well and we've had no problems with the car,"" said the former Red Bull star. ""It's a shame that third place escaped us, as that would have made us the first team behind Mercedes, but it wasn't by much. We lost third place because my first run wasn't quick enough: I'm not very pleased with myself, because there was still some performance to be found. ""First and second are a long way in front, but anything can happen during the grand prix. There's not much of a gap between third and fourth on the grid, so I think the podium is a realistic goal."" Last year Vettel was upstaged by new teammate Daniel Ricciardo, who qualified second and then finished runner-up in his home race only to be disqualified for a fuel-flow infringement. On Sunday he will start in seventh place as Red Bull's Renault-powered car struggled to match the Mercedes engines, while Vettel's replacement  Daniil Kvyat was 13th after failing to reach Q3. ""We suffered a bit this time last year, but there are a few more issues this year which weren't expected,"" said Ricciardo, who was third in the 2014 championship. ""I'm really happy with seventh as realistically that's the best we could have done today."" Red Bull's feeder team Toro Rosso had an encouraging start with its two rookie drivers. Carlos Sainz Jnr., son of the former rally champion, qualified eighth while Dutch 17-year-old Max Verstappen -- whose father Jos raced in F1 -- was 12th. Lotus rounded out the top 10 with Romain Grosjean ninth ahead of teammate Pastor Maldonado. Sauber's new pairing of Felipe Nasri and Marcus Ericsson qualified 11th and 16th respectively after they were able to take to the track when last season's reserve driver Giedo van der Garde waived his court-won right to line up in Melbourne. The Dutchman, who was successful in his legal battle to have an agreement for a race seat upheld, released a statement after Friday's practice sessions saying he would continue to negotiate with Sauber to resolve the situation. McLaren, meanwhile, confirmed all the preseason evidence that its new relationship with engine supplier Honda is yet to bear fruit. With Marussia having failed to get its hastily-prepared car ready in time, the English team -- which has won 12 drivers' titles and eight constructors' crowns -- will start at the back of the grid. Former world champion Jenson Button was 17th and Kevin Magnussen -- filling in for new signing Fernando Alonso, who is recovering from concussion -- was 18th. ""This level of performance wasn't a surprise for us: we knew from winter testing that the pace wasn't there, so we knew we weren't going to be competitive here,"" Button said. ""However, there's a good feeling about the car -- I know we're so far off, but the basic car is there beneath me, and we're adding to our experience and learning with every lap we do. ""It's going to be a really difficult race for us -- we haven't done a race distance yet, and my longest run is 12 laps -- but we want to do the best we can because there's so much learning to be had.""

"(CNN)The collapse of marriage in our poorest communities -- and its tragic impact -- is a familiar story. But increasingly, marriage is becoming a marker of class privilege in America, something increasingly reserved for the affluent. If progressives want to tackle the scourge of inequality, then the retreat from marriage is an issue they can't ignore. The reality is that the retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class -- the two-thirds of Americans without a college degree. This is occurring even as in upscale America, marital bonds remain comparatively strong. ""This is the marriage gap, and it's something new in America,"" declares a manifesto on ""marriage opportunity"" unveiled in a recent Washington Monthly cover story. It was penned by four astute social and political analysts, David Blankenhorn, Jonathan Rauch, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and Bill Galston. (Full disclosure: I'm a signer of their statement.) ""Over the past several decades, the norm of marriage has eroded across all economic and educational classes, but much less among the elite,"" they write. ""But for millions of middle- and lower-class Americans, marriage is increasingly beyond reach, creating more fractured and difficult family lives, more economic insecurity for single parents, less social mobility for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder, more childhood stress, and a fraying of our common culture."" True, overall U.S. marriage rates have fallen from 72% of U.S. adults in 1960 to just 51% in 2012, according to The Economist. But drill a little deeper into the data, and a marital class divide emerges. Less than half of men with high school degrees are married, compared with 76% of men with college degrees. The pattern is similar among women, except that those with graduate degrees have somewhat lower marriage rates than those with four-year college degrees. And because the college-educated tend to look for mates with similar education and earning power, their unions push them even higher up the income scale -- further widening the economic gulf between marital haves and have-nots. Marriage in America, it seems, is becoming another luxury item for economic elites to enjoy. So why should we worry? ""Declining marriage rates may not be concerning on their own, but while Americans are forgoing marriage, they are not forgoing childbearing,"" say Isabel Sawhill and Joanna Venator of the Brookings Institution. More than 40% of children are born outside wedlock today (including nearly three-quarters of black children). And a raft of social research shows that children who grow up in married, two-parent families do better in school and in life than those who don't. It's true that more children are being raised by cohabiting couples, but in the United States (unlike some European countries) these relationships tend to be unstable and short-lived. Some see the decline of marriage as stemming from a tectonic cultural shift -- the rise of feminism and the surge of women into work -- that has blurred the old division of familial labor between male breadwinners and female homemakers. But economic changes, mainly the disappearance of manufacturing jobs, automation and wage stagnation, have played a big part in the story, too. Liberals are eager to talk about their favorite economic fixes for inequality: raising the minimum wage, bolstering unions and taxing the rich to pay for new social benefits for families of modest means. But they seem uncomfortable talking about marriage, which is seen as an unwelcome distraction from issues of economic power. It's tempting to blame such reticence on President George W. Bush's ill-fated Healthy Marriage Initiative, which triggered a flurry of new federal marriage promotion programs over the previous decade. A centerpiece of Bush's ""compassionate conservatism,"" the initiative managed to polarize the social policy community while having a negligible impact on falling marriage rates. In truth, though, liberals have a long tradition -- at least since Daniel Patrick Moynihan's warnings in the 1960s of the consequences of family breakdown in black communities -- of shying away from ""cultural"" explanations for poverty and inequality. They need to get over it. Inequality as we know it today arises from the intricate interplay of economic and cultural changes, and won't be reversed simply by redistributing income from affluent to downscale families. High marriage rates in upper middle-class America make the link between family structure and economic success abundantly clear. For example, economists Robert Lerman and W. Bradford Wilcox estimate that the median income of families with children would be 44% higher today if America had the same marriage rates we had in 1980. Today, a record number of Americans -- one in five adults 25 and older -- have never been married. It's probably not because our society is evolving away from a fundamental social institution that has endured for, oh, most of human history. In fact, researchers say aspirations to marriage are as high as ever, but the practical barriers are getting harder to surmount. Which brings us back to the ""marriage opportunity"" manifesto. Rather than actively promoting marriage -- something government has shown it doesn't really know how to do -- the opportunity agenda aims at removing impediments to marriage, especially for non-elite Americans. This includes a raft of familiar policy proposals for boosting the economic prospects of low-income workers and making taxes more family-friendly. Intriguingly, the four authors point to the one cultural shift that's bucking the trend toward diminishing demand for weddings -- the public's dramatic turnaround on same-sex marriage. They envision a possible political bargain in which conservatives accept gays as allies in fortifying marriage, and liberals recognize that family breakdown is magnifying America's disparities of wealth and income. Could expanding marriage opportunity really become common ground in America's intensely polarized culture wars? It seems like an extravagant hope. But Blankenhorn and company are emphatically right that both progressives and conservatives have a big stake in reversing the retreat from marriage.","Will Marshall: Retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class .

"(CNN)Thomas Muller might be a World Cup winner with Germany but at home he has a different title: managing director of carrots. That's because his wife, Lisa, is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves. And the hours they spend at stables just outside Munich seem to be paying dividends, Lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend. While the 25-year-old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses, Thomas takes a keen interest in breeding, as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to. ""I come here to watch if everything's fine,"" he told CNN in the couple's first joint television interview. ""And for the carrots. I'm the managing director of carrots! I watch the dogs. Sometimes I help a little bit but it's her business. ""I enjoy it a lot. They make me feel comfortable, the attitude and what they look like and [the way they] live their lives. It's fun. It's easy to relax around horses."" At 25, Muller is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come. He has a glut of domestic trophies, including three German Bundesliga titles, and claimed the European Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup crowns with Bayern Munich in 2013. Last year in Brazil he landed the ultimate prize when Germany powered its way to a first World Cup triumph since 1990, memorably beating hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semis before edging past Argentina in the final. But you won't hear much talk of that landmark moment in Muller's career around the stables. ""He's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football,"" Lisa explained. ""He knows more about horses than I know about football."" While Muller has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career, Lisa's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one. Though she has been riding horses since her Granddad introduced her to the sport aged four, it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage. And though her recent victory at the Grand Prix in the Bavarian town of Kreuth shows she is clearly in tune with her horse Birkhofs Dave, Lisa says her learning curve is a lengthy one. ""You have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still don't know everything. You always keep learning,"" she said. ""It's not like other sports, you always train yourself, you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself. ""It has its own mind, its own feelings. You have to become a team and that's why it takes so much time. Every horse is different so you have to feel it. ""I want to get better and better. Maybe at some point I will be very good, that's my dream. [The Olympics] would be a dream. ""I think for every sportsman it's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it. Maybe, maybe not."" According to Lisa's coach, Götz Brinkmann, that is a distinct possibility. Last year's qualification for the prestigious Piaff-Förderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential. ""I've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had,"" Brinkmann told CNN. ""She's got the will and she's got the talent and she doesn't stop. She keeps on working. And not so many riders have the ability and that makes her fortunate in a way. ""I think she'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure."" Muller is of the same opinion. Though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and Birkhofs Dave. Both the couple's disciplines rely on a high skill level, but also strong communication, and though the competition is fierce, Muller has high hopes for the pair. ""The potential is there,"" he said. ""He's our best talent I think and the number one in our stable and for Lisa. ""But it's no guarantee for success because in Germany there's a lot of opponents. A lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses. Like in football. ""She has no pressure. I want that she's happy with the horses, with the work and with the competitions. But it's not easy. ""It's very tough to get up in Germany in the dressage sport. She needs time to develop her quality. We're on a good way and we need to go for it."" Muller can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds, whether in racing or dressage circles, while some fall by the wayside. ""There are some talents and they grow up and go to the top,"" he said. ""And some talents don't get to the top. ""It's interesting to watch, the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave. But he [Birkhofs Dave] stays for sure."" Muller has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding. ""Breeding is a little bit for fun,"" he explained. ""For sure I want to breed the best horse I can. But it's difficult and a bit of luck. But I try my best to optimize. ""My dream is one day that Lisa rides a horse that I bred. But that's a long way to go."" Though she often goes to watch Thomas play at Bayern Munich's home stadium -- the Allianz Arena -- Lisa doesn't even remotely fit the WAG stereotype. The wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured, fashion-obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers. But Lisa, who chose not to travel with Thomas to the World Cup in Brazil last year, has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets. ""I don't,"" she said. ""You have the bad sides also. Everyone comes and wants to get a photo, a selfie or an autograph. That would be too much. I can't do that like Thomas can do it. ""He's so easy going. And I want to do my horses by myself. I can groom them the best, I can ride them the best and I love them the most. ""They're my partner, my brother. I can tell them every problem. They're the most important part in my life."" This statement provoked a laugh from her husband: ""I have already accepted it,"" he joked. ""Maybe I'm number five. But it's OK.""","Wife of Bayern Munich Germany star Thomas Muller is an aspiring dressage rider .

"(CNN)Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei on Thursday accused the six world powers involved in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program of ""deception, trickery and backstabbing"" in their dealings with Tehran, according to Iranian state media. He also criticized a letter sent by 47 U.S. Republican senators to Iran's leaders, which threatened to scupper any deal if a Republican President is elected next year, Iran's official Press TV reported. ""Of course, I'm concerned because the other side is into deception, trickery and backstabbing,"" Khamenei is quoted as saying in a speech in Tehran. He suggested that the letter was part of a U.S. strategy of last-minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering Iran's nuclear ambitions, Press TV said. ""This is part of their ploys and tricks,"" said Khamenei. Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal over its nuclear program. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. The six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany, a group known as the P5+1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. The Republican senators' decision to write to Iran's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry denounced the letter Wednesday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, calling it a breach of ""more than two centuries of precedent"" and factually incorrect. Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? ""It purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with America, they have to negotiate with 535 members of Congress,"" Kerry said. ""That is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make."" Sen. Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican from Arkansas, penned the letter, which asserted that a lasting agreement would need congressional support. He wasn't shy about his attempts to undermine the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran and said Tuesday that the letter is ""about stopping Iran from getting a nuclear deal.""

"(CNN)Since Friday, social media debates such as #thedress were silenced. There was more sobering news. Leonard Nimoy, ""Star Trek's"" beloved Mr. Spock, had died. His co-stars, fellow celebrities and fans reacted with heartfelt tributes from around the world and all the way to space, where astronaut Terry W. Wirts flashed a Vulcan salute aboard the International Space Station. As the weekend went on, billboards from the company Outfront Media (formerly CBS, owners of ""Star Trek"") showed up around Atlanta. Longtime friend and co-star William Shatner remembered Nimoy ""like a brother."" George Takei wrote, ""Today, the world lost a great man, and I lost a great friend. We return you now to the stars, Leonard."" And Zachary Quinto, who played Spock in the recent ""Star Trek"" movie reboots, said, ""my heart is broken."" The hashtag #LLAP, which stands for ""Live long and prosper"" and which Nimoy used to sign his tweets,  was trending across several social media platforms after the news of his death. The outpouring on Twitter and elsewhere left no doubt about Nimoy's indelible mark on pop culture. Nimoy's career also inspired some of the most brilliant minds in space and science. NASA posted a 1979 photo of Nimoy and the ""Star Trek"" cast -- some sporting '70s leisure suits -- visiting the space shuttle Enterprise. And then there were the ordinary fans -- Trekkies, aspiring actors and science geeks who related to Nimoy's brainy Spock character -- who posted personal messages and remembrances. Nimoy in 2010: ""I feel very fulfilled"" with my work . Paul Roth, 39, chief information officer at Chesapeake Systems in Baltimore, posted a teary-eyed photo using the #LLAP hashtag. ""Leonard Nimoy showed a young, nerdy, bullied me that not only could science be important and valued, but it could literally save entire ships, planets, and galaxies of lives,"" he said. ""As I grew up, he taught me that reason could be tempered with humor. That learned adults still had more to learn. That feminism and opposing prejudice was vital. And that there is no age too late to reinvent yourself."" Neil Macdonald from Widnes in the United Kingdom wrote on Instagram: ""I have been and always shall be your friend."" And, Molly Desormeaux, an acting student in Montreal, Quebec, said: ""Leonard Nemoy is one of the reasons why I still believe that acting can change peoples' lives."" Nimoy: ""Fringe"" cast impressed me the most . We'll give Nimoy himself the last word. The actor, filmmaker and author, who was an active user of Twitter up until his death, shared a final thought Monday that exemplifies the fleetingness and beauty of life.

"(CNN)There are superyachts. And then there are superyachts for ""ladies."" Introducing La Belle, the 80-meter gold and crystal-encrusted superyacht described as a floating ""boudoir for women,"" by its female designer. ""There will not be any boy's toys -- such as pool tables or beer kegs -- on board,"" Italian designer, Lidia Bersani, told CNN. ""But there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center, large mirrors, and huge wardrobes,"" she said of the concept yacht, which she claims is the first designed specifically for women. Bersani came up with plans for the five-deck La Belle because ""I felt, as a lady, it was my duty to design something especially for us, where we can feel a woman's touch. ""There will only be off-white, ivory, and cream colors. All surrounded by furs, silk, gold, pearls, crystals, live music, aromatics and flowers,"" she added. Not that all women are on board with Bersani's ""warm and romantic"" bejeweled boat. ""I don't know any woman who lives in a dream world where these things are desirable,"" said Maria Jaschok, director of the International Gender Studies Centre at Oxford University. ""It feels somehow remote, like some sort of little girlish dream, traveling in that eternal pink cloud."" Bersani, who also designs apartment interiors, defended the hyper-feminine yacht, saying: ""I don't know a single woman who does not like flowers and is not dreaming of diamonds. ""If you get married, the most amazing day in your life, you want to be dressed in an amazing white long dress, looking like a princess, with a gold diamond ring on your finger, around romantic music, happy people, and plenty of flowers."" In the ultra-elite world of superyachts, female owners are practically unheard of, but that doesn't mean women don't have a huge influence over the spending of their billionaire partners. ""In terms of superyacht owners, I'd say they were upwards of 90% male,"" said Rory Trahair, of superyacht brokers Edmiston. ""That said, superyachts on the whole are designed for the preferences of a couple -- for their interests, design, style, and taste. ""And while the person chartering a superyacht is often male, the person in charge of the holiday is often his wife or girlfriend."" Male or female, Trahair envisioned few clients looking to buy a ""radical, gold yacht"" such as Bersani's. ""It could be regarded as patronizing -- a bit like Barbie, where the assumption is that everything has to be pink,"" said Trahair. Earlier this year, plans were revealed for world's biggest private boat -- the $1 billion, 222 meter Triple Deuce. And they're only going to become more lavish, according to Trahair. ""We've launched yachts in the last few years that have multiple pools, helipads, a squash court. There are few things now a yacht can't have,"" he said. ""Whereas a jacuzzi was a luxury in the early 2000s, now if you've got just one, it's rather frowned upon. You need to have a few and you need to have an infinity plunge pool that doubles as a helipad."" Whether there will also be a market for gender-specific vessels, remains to be seen.

"(CNN)After a handful events in two months, Hillary Clinton has filled her March with a mix of women's events, nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance. In January and February, Clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the United States. But as Clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement, the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of March. Most of Clinton's events are focused on one thing: women. Clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for Emily's List -- a pro-Clinton organization that focused on helping Democratic women win elected office. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group's importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Emily's List has been energized by Clinton's campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a Clinton White House. The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. In that speech Clinton said, ""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all."" On March 9, Clinton teams up with Chelsea, her daughter, and Melinda Gates to release a report through the Clinton Foundation that looks at ""the gaps that still remain"" in women's participation in the economy and politics. The following day -- on March 10 -- Clinton will headline the United Nation's Women Empowerment Principles annual gathering in New York. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and ""reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago,"" the organizers said in a release about the event. On March 16, Clinton will be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New York. Clinton is not Irish -- her family is of English, Scottish, French, and Welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of ""her dedicated work on Irish Peace Process."" ""Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the Irish peace process,"" said Irish America co-founder Niall O'Dowd. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement. The former secretary of state cited her experiences in Ireland during a number of speeches in 2014. O'Dowd is a longtime Clinton supporter, though,and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team. Some Republicans have questioned how active Clinton was in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote in 2008 that Clinton ""seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was more symbolic than substantive,"" but that she did play ""a helpful role at the margins."" On March 19, Clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to Atlantic City for the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference. Susie Lupert, the group's executive director, tells CNN, ""Yes, just like most nonprofits and conferences, she is being paid for her appearance."" But she would not confirm how much she is being paid. On average, Clinton makes between $200,000 and $300,000 per speech. Near the end of the month, on March 23 in Washington, D.C., Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University. Robin Toner, who graduated from Syracuse, was the first woman national political correspondent for the New York Times. Syracuse Dean Lorraine Branham said Clinton is a ""vivid example — like Robin — of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession."" Clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession. In a 1996, according to the diary of the late Clinton confidant Diane Blair, Clinton said the media are ""complete hypocrites."" At an event in 2014, Clinton said ""journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism."" ""A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,"" she said. ""People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it's a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that's just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken."" Clinton's presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and Democrats close to Clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in April.","Clinton currently has seven events in March, with one paid speech and many focused on women .

"Atlanta (CNN)This is a tale of two storms. The one that (kind of) hit Atlanta and the one that hit everywhere else. Atlanta's was anti-climactic. Everywhere else was worse.  Ask folks along a line from Arkansas to Virginia. Unlike last year, when city officials were caught completely by surprise, Atlanta was prepared this time. But the storm stayed north of town. It did do some damage, slicking up roads and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people. Still, Snowmageddon 2015 it wasn't. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal did his part.  He ordered a state of emergency for 51 northern counties. Authorities were ready too. There were more snow plows, more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather. And people helped out by staying home or leaving work early. Still, social media wasn't about to give the governor a break. ""As a stockholder of a grocery store here, I appreciate you guys invoking a false panic again. #ATLsnow,"" tweeted Tommy Sale. North of the city, there was lots of snow, especially in the mountains, but Atlanta mainly got rain. It was a disappointing prospect for those who had their hearts set on making a snowman from a rare snowfall. ""Serious question, how am I supposed to build a snowman with rain?"" asked Angelica Monteon. ""lol, a little imagination and your freezer,"" responded Ashley Hamilton. Other parts of the South found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman. In northeast Mississippi they were channeling ""Star Wars"" and the ice planet Hoth in creating a snowy version of an Imperial walker. In Alabama, the snow inspired a host of Elsas, Annas and Olafs to spread their wintry magic ""Frozen"" style. By early Thursday, the storm system had largely left the Deep South behind, instead spreading a blanket of white on the Carolinas and northward. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory noted that this marked the second time in two years that a major winter storm covered his entire state. There were no casualties or major injuries, thankfully, but the central part of the state got up to 7 inches while a few inches fell in the east. It wasn't just that snow fell, but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines, especially in Durham and Wake counties. That led to some 224,000 Duke Energy customers being in the dark at one point, a number that had fallen to about 78,000 by 6:25 p.m. Thursday. ""The biggest issue for us, especially Greensboro to the east, was power outages,"" McCrory said. ""That is something that ... we didn't anticipate."" Thankfully, though, North Carolinians were ready in other ways. They heeded officials' warnings by stocking up, staying off the roads and staying safe. The storm did leave behind its share of slippery misery. North of Atlanta, Interstate 75 was in gridlock Wednesday afternoon. Catching flights was a nightmare in some southern cities.  Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte were the hardest hit.  Some 1,600 flights were canceled at all U.S. airports on Wednesday.  Nearly 900 have been scrubbed for Thursday. In Alabama, Joe Day and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to Evansville, Indiana, instead of worrying with canceled flights. They didn't make it far. They were stuck on I-65 about 30 miles north of Birmingham. Day says a hill and snow-covered roadways led to backed-up traffic for miles. In Tennessee, 30 weather-related deaths have been reported in the past 10 days. A small child died in Mississippi after the car she was in hydroplaned. And a student from the University of Mississippi in Oxford was killed in a sledding accident Wednesday. The South's fascination with snow is a bit bemusing for those who live north of the Mason-Dixon line. After all, in Boston, they were over winter about 70 inches ago. ""How's the snow treating you, southern US folks? Having fun yet?"" asked Canadian L.M. Murphy on Twitter. ""DON'T MOCK OUR SOUTHERN SNOW PANIC!"" warned Whitney Waddell in Nashville. And then there was this bit of empathy from points north. ""I love all the snow pictures of my southern friends because they actually appreciate the snow,"" tweeted Abby Kreuser.","Unanticipated, widespread power outages the big problem in North Carolina .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Oversized military trucks painted in desert beige hauled tanks in the same camouflage color down a dark highway late Saturday past glowing billboards in the Saudi Arabian town of Jazan. With the border with Yemen little more than 20 miles away, the trucks captured on a video distributed by the news agency Reuters also carried a message: Suggestions of a ground incursion into Yemen, which is in the throes of a Houthi rebel uprising, may be more than just talk. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have both spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground before. And on Saturday, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in Yemen within days. Saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in, they won't leave until they have degraded the Houthis' ability to do battle, CNN's Ian Lee reported. The Houthis are apt guerrillas. A fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy. Politically, the situation appears to be heating up. Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, the son of former Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh, has been removed from his post as ambassador to United Arab Emirates, according to two aides of the nation's current President, Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi fled the country in February amid the Houthi uprising. He went to Aden and declared that he remained the country's leader. Also on Sunday, pro-Hadi fighters took over Aden's airport, according to security officials in Aden, but that airport hasn't been operational for weeks. Yemen's ex-president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Shiite, still holds influence over large parts of the Yemeni army, and his troops are also fighting the government. In a taped speech played on Yemen Today TV on Friday, he called for the airstrikes to stop and offered in return not to run for president in the next elections. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Shiite Houthis, who deposed the Yemeni government and seized territory in a series of offensives, began its military action last week. It answered Hadi's call for intervention with an unrelenting air campaign called ""Decisive Storm."" Hadi slipped out of Yemen last week and has gone to the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the Arab League summit, where he is rallying support with leaders of member nations for operation Determination Storm. Support is already broad. The coalition nations participating in the bombardments make up about a third of the league's membership. On Saturday, Hadi called the Houthis out: ""You violated the sovereignty (of Yemen), and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen."" Dozens have died from the coalition bombardment. Houthi commanders put the death toll at 48. Most of the dead are civilians, they said. Airstrikes have hit Houthi militant groups, smashed their big air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure that links major towns with the capital, Sanaa, a Saudi official has said. The coalition has destroyed Yemeni army weapons caches and military facilities. Saudi naval special forces have also rescued dozens of diplomats, the official said. And many U.N. representatives have fled the unrest. Saudi Arabia has set up a blockade, effectively cutting off Houthi supply lines, and its air force controls Yemeni airspace. They have threatened to attack ships that might supply the rebels. The Shiite Houthis are allied with Iran, a majority Shiite nation. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of beefing up the Houthis' weaponry for their offensive. Hadi denounced them on Saturday as Iran's ""puppet."" ""I say to the puppet of Iran, and those who are with him, you destroyed Yemen with your immature politics, and creating internal and regional crisis,"" he said. The conflict splits the region along religious lines. Determination Storm's coalition comprises the majority Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan. On Saturday, Houthis claimed to have shot down a Sudanese jet and captured the pilot. They distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim. Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter rivals. Having Yemen become an Iranian satellite country on its border would be unacceptable to the kingdom. Iran has sharply denounced the Saudi-dominated armed intervention. And two Arab League members, Lebanon and Iraq, have voiced opposition to Determination Storm, Lee reported. Both countries are majority Shiite. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed to Yemen on Sunday to criticize nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 group of nations. He accused Iran of trying to use the conflict in Yemen to ""take over the whole Middle East."" The United States voiced approval of the airstrikes. It's supporting them logistically and aiding coalition forces in locating targets, but it is not participating in active battle. The unrest in Yemen led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces earlier this month, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters. On Saturday, the coalition struck al Anad Airbase, which was used as the headquarters for U.S. counterterrorism operations, Houthi commanders said. Houthi rebels had taken control of the base. Houthi rebels and the government began doing battle in 2004, but arrived at a ceasefire in 2010, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country has seen much unrest in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising. Arab Spring wasn't supposed to turn out like this . Yemen was plunged into chaos when the Houthi rebels, who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country, began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country last fall. Houthis moved into Sanaa in September, sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called. In January, they surrounded the presidential palace and Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. In February the Houthis took control of military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force. But the chaos is not limited to the Houthi uprising. In the area of the southern port city of Aden, opposing Yemeni military forces -- those allied with the Houthis, and those supporting Hadi -- have fought for more than a week. CORRECTION: Pakistan is not participating in airstrikes over Yemen, the Pakistani embassy in Washington said. CNN previously included Pakistan in an illustration of coalition member countries participating the operation Determination Storm. The illustration said the country was contributing 15 jets. That illustration has since been updated. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Jason Hanna and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","Son of former president removed from post as ambassador to United Arab Emirates .

"(CNN)In 1971, a physicist conceptualized the existence of a fourth fundamental element in the electronic circuit, besides the three that were already in use at the time. His name was Leon Chua and he believed -- for reasons of symmetry -- that an extra component could one day be constructed to join the resistor, the capacitor and the inductor. He called it ""memristor"", a portmanteau of the words memory and resistor. It took 37 years for our engineering abilities to catch up with that idea: the first memristor was built by Hewlett Packard in 2008. And today, many researchers believe it could spark a revolution in computing. Simply put, the memristor could mean the end of electronics as we know it and the beginning of a new era called ""ionics"". The transistor, developed in 1947, is the main component of computer chips. It functions using a flow of electrons, whereas the memristor couples the electrons with ions, or electrically charged atoms. In a transistor, once the flow of electrons is interrupted by, say, cutting the power, all information is lost. But a memristor can remember the amount of charge that was flowing through it, and much like a memory stick it will retain the data even when the power is turned off. This can pave the way for computers that will instantly turn on and off like a light bulb and never lose data: the RAM, or memory, will no longer be erased when the machine is turned off, without the need to save anything to hard drives as with current technology. But memristors have another fundamental difference compared with transistors: they can escape the boundaries of binary code. Initially, the technology will be mostly used to create super-fast memory chips that contain more data and consume less energy. This alone would make regular computers much more powerful, but down the line, the memristor could also take on the processing. Jennifer Rupp is a Professor of electrochemical materials at ETH Zurich, and she's working with IBM to build a memristor-based machine. Memristors, she points out, function in a way that is similar to a human brain: ""Unlike a transistor, which is based on binary codes, a memristor can have multi-levels. You could have several states, let's say zero, one half, one quarter, one third, and so on, and that gives us a very powerful new perspective on how our computers may develop in the future,"" she told CNN's Nick Glass. Such a shift in computing methodology would allow us to create ""smart"" computers that operate in a way reminiscent of the synapses in our brains. Free from the limitations of the 0s and 1s, these more powerful computers would be able to learn and make decisions, ultimately getting us one step closer to creating human-like artificial intelligence. Transistors are based on silicon, a rigid material whose properties are used to manage the flow of electrons, and thus information. In 1975, Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, formulated a famous law which states that the number of transistors in an electronic circuit doubles approximately every two years. This has so far proven accurate and set the pace for the constant increase in computing power, but the trend might soon come to an end. There is a physical limit to the number of transistors that we can pack on a chip, and we are already approaching the miniaturization threshold of this technology. It is inevitable that, one day, we will need to move away from silicon based computing. The memristor technology is a candidate for this crucial step: ""It could mean the end of the silicon era, giving us lower power consumption, the ability  to compute more information, increased data storage and completely new logic patterns for our computers,"" says Rupp. Memristors don't require a silicon layer and different materials can be used as a substrate. This could create a new class of microchips, that could eventually be integrated in everyday items such as windows, clothes or even coffee cups. After manufacturing the first ever memristor, Hewlett Packard has been working for years on a new type of computer based on the technology. According to plans, it will launch by 2020. Simply called ""The Machine"", it uses  ""electrons for processing, photons for communication, and ions for storage."" ""I think there is a race going on,"" says Rupp. ""There is a strong driving force, but at the same time it's very important that there are players like HP, because they want to get to the market, show everyone that this is real."" At the moment, manufacturing costs are still high, but the benefits are worth it: ""Memristors operate at a lower power consumption, with a faster speed, and with a higher volume density of information than anything we have based on silicon microchip transistors,"" Rupp told CNN. Much like a particle in the realm of physics, the existence of the memristor was theorized long before we could actually build one. Now that we have that capability to manufacture it, the ""missing fourth element"" of electronics -- despite its less than catchy name -- might be the key to many further human discoveries.

"(CNN)A statue of a sitting Buddha that made its way from a temple in China to a market in the Netherlands revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000-year-old mummified monk. The mummy was discovered, encased in a cavity in the statue, when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration. It's unclear when or how the statue was removed from China. But it wasn't until a team of researchers and scientists did a CT scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year, did they discover the mummy's organs were missing. ""We thought it would be lung tissue, but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with Chinese characters,"" said Vincent van Vilsteren, an archaeology curator from Drents Museum. The mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in Chinese inscriptions, revealing its identity as a Buddhist monk called Liuquan who may have practiced ""self-mummification"" to prepare for life after death. The process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like Japan, China and Thailand, and was practiced over a thousand years ago. The elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots. The few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered. ""We suspect that for the first 200 years, the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a Buddhist temple in China... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue,"" said van Vilsteren. Researchers are still waiting on DNA analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in China. The statue is now housed in the National Museum of Natural History in Budapest and will move to Luxembourg in May as a part of an international tour.","A mummified monk from China was found inside a Buddha statue .

"(CNN)Brazilian police worked for five months to track down a fugitive American pastor accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was arrested Friday at a home in a gated community, said the Public Security Secretariat of Rio Grande do Norte state. A 33-year-old woman was detained, police said. Both were transported to a federal jail in Lagoa Nova in Natal, awaiting extradition to the United States, authorities said. Barnard is suspected of 59 counts of sexual assault in Minnesota. He is accused of sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church, the U.S. Marshals Service said. The last U.S. sighting of Barnard was last year in Raymond, Washington. The fugitive was featured on CNN's ""The Hunt With John Walsh"" last year and again last week. Barnard was featured on the U.S. Marshal's 15 Most Wanted List along with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. In addition to the sexual assault allegations, he was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. As a pastor, Barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ. ""I had never met anybody that I thought loved the word of God as much as Victor Barnard did,"" said Ruth Johnson, a former member of Barnard's River Road Fellowship. Barnard set up a so-called ""shepherd's camp"" in the mid-1990s in Pine County. Several congregants moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of Minneapolis to be a part of the camp. In June 2000, the pastor allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in a secluded campsite. Lindsay Tornambe's name was called, and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp, called ""The Maidens,"" under Barnard's supervision. She and other congregants said the girls got up early, sewed, cooked and cleaned. ""Everything that a wife would do, they did for him,"" Johnson said. Barnard proclaimed he was Christ on Earth. ""He taught that in the Bible, the church was the bride of Christ and because he was Christ in the flesh, the church was supposed to be married to him,"" Tornambe said. ""At that time, I didn't really understand the fullness of what it meant."" The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. She told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp, the document says. Tornambe told investigators Barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. In fall 2011, Tornambe was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story: She said she was molested by Barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20, although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month. Tornambe and the other woman went to the police in Minnesota. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office told CNN last year. The fellowship left the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry, Blackwell said. Afterward, The Salvation Army started running a family camp there. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","Victor Barnard is accused of 59 counts of sexual assault on two young girls .

"(CNN)At first glance Esther Okade seems like a normal 10-year-old. She loves dressing up as Elsa from ""Frozen,"" playing with Barbie dolls and going to the park or shopping. But what makes the British-Nigerian youngster stand out is the fact that she's also a university undergraduate. Esther, from Walsall, an industrial town in the UK's West Midlands region, is one of the country's youngest college freshmen. The talented 10-year-old enrolled at the Open University, a UK-based distance learning college, in January and is already top of the class, having recently scored 100% in a recent exam. ""It's so interesting. It has the type of maths I love. It's real maths -- theories, complex numbers, all that type of stuff,"" she giggles. ""It was super easy. My mum taught me in a nice way."" She adds: ""I want to (finish the course) in two years. Then I'm going to do my PhD in financial maths when I'm 13. I want to have my own bank by the time I'm 15 because I like numbers and I like people and banking is a great way to help people."" And in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early, Esther emphatically disagrees. ""I actually wanted to start when I was seven. But my mum was like, ""you're too young, calm down."" After three years of begging, mother Efe finally agreed to explore the idea. A marvelous mathematical mind . Esther has always jumped ahead of her peers. She sat her first Math GSCE exam, a British high school qualification, at Ounsdale High School in Wolverhampton at just six, where she received a C-grade. A year later, she outdid herself and got the A-grade she wanted. Then last year she scored a B-grade when she sat the Math A-level exam. Esther's mother noticed her daughter's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three. Initially, Esther's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks, the pair began noticing changes in the usually-vibrant youngster. Efe says: ""One day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said 'I don't ever want to go back to that school -- they don't even let me talk!' ""In the UK, you don't have to start school until you are five. Education is not compulsory until that age so I thought OK, we'll be doing little things at home until then. Maybe by the time she's five she will change her mind."" Efe started by teaching basic number skills but Esther was miles ahead. By four, her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations. And Esther isn't the only maths prodigy in the family. Her younger brother Isaiah, 6, will soon be sitting his first A-level exam in June. A philanthropic family . Not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old, Esther is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called ""Yummy Yummy Algebra."" ""It starts at a beginner level -- that's volume one. But then there will be volume two, and volume three, and then volume four. But I've only written the first one. ""As long as you can add or subtract, you'll be able to do it. I want to show other children they are special,"" she says. Meanwhile, Esther's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in Nigeria. The couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in Nigeria's Delta region (where the family are from). Named ""Shakespeare's Academy,"" they hope to open the school's doors in September. The proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as English, languages, math and science, as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics, public speaking, entrepreneurship and etiquette. The couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning. ""Some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things. Some children have extremely creative imaginations. Instead of trying to make children learn one way, you teach them based on their learning style,"" explains Efe. The educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30% of students being local children offered scholarships to attend. Efe says: ""On one hand, billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical."" While Paul adds: ""(The region has) poor quality of nursery and primary education. So by the time the children get secondary education they haven't got a clue. They haven't developed their core skills. ""The school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something, not just for the sake of acquiring certifications. There is an end goal.""

"(CNN)A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet. Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal. Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira. The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life. ""I am tired of living with this sickness,"" Valentina says in the video. ""Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever."" Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile. Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. ""But what are we doing?"" Elizaldo said last week. ""The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions."" Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media. People took to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide. One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: ""After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?"" Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable."" After her diagnosis, doctors expected her to live to about 17, which would give her three and a half more years to live.","14-year-old Valentina Maureira suffers from cystic fibrosis .

"Caracas (CNN)Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday an unspecified number of Americans were arrested ""a few days ago"" for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities. The President said they included an American pilot of Latin American origin, arrested in the southwest border state of Táchira. He said the pilot was found in possession of ""all kinds of documents"" and was being interrogated by the authorities, though he did not identify him. The Venezuelan government has made many similar claims in recent years, without ever substantiating them. Maduro also announced Saturday a series of measures, including visa requirements for U.S. citizens and the downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, to counteract what he called U.S. ""interference"" in his country. Venezuela has in recent weeks accused the United States of being behind an alleged coup plot. Speaking at an ""anti-imperialist"" rally in the capital, Maduro said visas would now be required for all U.S. visitors and that the U.S. Embassy in Caracas would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings. The Embassy, which he said had more than 100 staff, is to be reduced to a number closer to the 17 Venezuelan diplomats based in Washington. Moreover, a group of prominent U.S. officials, current and retired, will be banned from entering Venezuela because of what Maduro said was their involvement in ""bombing Iraq, Syria and Vietnam"" and other ""terrorist"" actions. The officials include George W. Bush, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, former CIA Director George Tenet and several current members of Congress, including Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Bob Menendez and Mario Diaz-Balart. Following the Maduro's announcement Diaz-Balart reacted via Twitter, saying he has ""always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy. And now Castro's lap dog won't let me!"" The move comes after the U.S. government last month approved a law under which Venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their U.S. assets frozen. A relatively small, but noisy crowd, dressed mostly in revolutionary red, applauded and cheered the measures announced by the President from a platform outside the presidential palace in downtown Caracas. Four missionaries from Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake, North Dakota  were released by Venezuelan authorities on Saturday, a church official said. Pastor Bruce Dick said the missionaries arrived in Venezuela on February 20 and were detained a few days ago. ""We love the Venezuelan people and have served alongside them for over 12 years,"" Dick said. ""We have been praying along with hundreds or thousands of others for their release and for those in Venezuela who also have been affected by this."" It is unclear if the detention and release of these Americans is connected to Maduro's charges of espionage. Journalist Phil Gunson reported from Caracas. CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez, Florencia Trucco and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Four Americans missionaries were released Saturday after being detained a few days ago .

"(CNN)The police may have found the missing dress. You know, the white custom Calvin Klein gown that adorned actress Lupita Nyong'o when she attended Sunday's Academy Awards. The one encrusted with 6,000 white Akoya pearls that Fortune estimated was worth $150,000. The dress that Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar last year for ""Twelve Years a Slave,"" reported stolen Wednesday from her room in the swanky London Hotel off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Yes, that old thing. The L.A. Sheriff's Department got a tip Friday and looked in an abandoned bathroom on the second floor of the same London Hotel, the department said in a press release. The tip, they said, came from ""a media representative"" who got a call from an anonymous caller. The investigators went to the hotel and found a black garment bag underneath the bathroom counter. Inside the bag they found a white dress ""resembling the one"" worn by Nyong'o. Sounds like it would be hard to mistake the dress, but the sheriff's department is working with the dress owners to find out if it's the real thing. Calvin Klein also expressed guarded enthusiasm over the dress's potential return. ""All of us at Calvin Klein are thrilled to know that the dress has potentially been located. This was an amazing collaboration between the brand and Lupita and the dress looked truly exquisite on her,"" Francisco Costa, Women's Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection, said in a press release. ""Once it's returned to us, we will be able to have the dress restored and archived, as it now represents an important moment for the brand.""

"(CNN)It's a controversial question that's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as Jihadi John. Was Mohammed Emwazi, the man with a British accent who's appeared in numerous ISIS beheading videos, pushed toward extremism by authorities? Or was he someone who'd long been heading down a militant path? A London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. And a report from the Daily Mail, also citing emails purportedly sent from Emwazi to the British publication, said the Kuwait-born Londoner saw himself as a ""dead man walking"" and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups. ""You can't start the story at how he's been treated by UK officials. You certainly can't start the story from the email trail,"" said Rashad Ali, director at the counterextremism consultancy CENTRI and a fellow of the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. ""You have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him. Well, because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join Al-Shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in Somalia."" Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE, the human rights and Muslim advocacy organization that worked with him. One email details Emwazi's account of his detention at a British airport, when authorities stopped him from traveling to Kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours. ""I told them that I want to be left alone, as I have an ambition of moving from the UK and settling in Kuwait. That is why I found a job and a spouse!! But they laughed,"" Emwazi wrote in a message dated June 3, 2010. ""One of them got aggressive with me, he pushed me to the wall. ... I was just baffled I did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview, fingerprinting and searching. When I asked for their names they said 'We don't give out our names.' "" Emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by British security and intelligence officials reminded him ""of criminals that you see on TV who have committed a serious crime, only I was a person never charged or arrested for anything. I was a person looking to start a new life in my country Kuwait!"" That's a key detail, CAGE spokesman Amandla Thomas-Johnson said. ""If someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way, then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them,"" he said. ""In the UK, he wasn't arrested once, prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever."" British authorities have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on the case. In the emails, Emwazi pleaded for CAGE's help. ""Please help me as I don't want to stay in the UK because I have found a Job in Kuwait, found a spouse in Kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in Kuwait. Kuwait is where I'm from, I was born their. I just want to go their and start my new life again!!"" Emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the Independent Police Complaints Commission, before going into detail about how he was apparently ""assaulted by the police officer"" as he attempted to leave for Kuwait. But it was a difficult complaint to prove, Thomas-Johnson said. ""The IPCC says there's no camera in the room where this took place, so we can't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer,"" he said.  ""These things happen in the shadows and the dark. So it is very difficult to independently verify once it's taken place. There isn't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability."" Details from court papers reported in British media paint a different picture. They say Emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the ""North London Boys"" who allegedly funneled money and recruits to Al-Shabaab. The Guardian has reported that Emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed London bomb attacks in 2005. To British authorities, his face was a familiar one for more than five years. But authorities lost track of him in 2013, according to friends. He changed his name and made his way to Syria. Analysts who've studied ISIS recruiting say they aren't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned Emwazi into ""Jihadi John."" ""I think it's an absurd claim,"" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. ""It was not the cause of his radicalization. The reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the Shabaab in Somalia."" Ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism. ""People do not turn around, when harassed and have grievances, and become terrorists,"" he said. In addition to the emails released by CAGE, another series of emails from Emwazi came to light over the weekend. The messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the Daily Mail's security editor, Robert Verkaik. The Daily Mail published excerpts from those exchanges, including Emwazi's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website, but only stated his surname. When he met a potential buyer at a London underground station, he says the person he met shook his hand and said ""nice doing business with you Mohammed."" ""I NEVER TOLD THIS PERSON MY FIRST NAME!!"" wrote Emwazi to Verkaik. ""& I NEVER GIVE OUT MY FIRST NAME!! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KNOW MY FIRST NAME!!"" He also hinted at suicidal thoughts. ""Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me. ""Rather, fearing that one day, I'll take as many pills as I can so that I can sleep for ever!! I just want to get away from these people!!!"" Verkaik said he met Emwazi in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence. Emwazi's concerns bordered on paranoia, Verkaik wrote, and he desperately wanted his story to be told. ""Like many young Muslim men at the time, he appeared to have a grievance. But this man was different,"" Verkaik wrote. ""In him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in Syria."" CNN's Brian Todd and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Advocacy group CAGE releases emails between ""Jihadi John"" and the organization's research director .

"(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but ""it's a known issue; no concern."" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. ""Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,"" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of ""sublimator water carryover."" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had ""a high degree of confidence"" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as ""wet and cold."" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.","Spacewalk last more than five hours; crews have spent more than 1,171 hours spacewalking .

"(CNN)ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages on Sunday, according to Rami Abdelrahman, the chief of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in Syria. On Saturday, the observatory -- citing an Assyrian commander -- said that ISIS planned to release 29 Assyrian Christian hostages. ISIS captured at least 220 Assyrians, all Christians, on February 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of Tal Tamer in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release, citing an Assyrian commander. The ""court"" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. The Syrian Observatory said its information indicates ISIS has taken the hostages to the Mount Abdelaziz area, southwest of Tal Tamer. The founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, Osama Edward, puts the number of Assyrian hostages at more than 262. Edward is based in Sweden but has family in the area that was attacked, and says his information is from the network's team on the ground. The number of hostages has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on Monday to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily. Since the declaration of its ""caliphate"" last June, ISIS has killed 1,969 people, the Syrian Observatory said Saturday. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for ""exceeding the limits in religion,"" the Syrian Observatory said. ""We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing"" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September. CNN's Samira Said in Abu Dhabi and Hamdi Alkhshali in Atlanta contributed to this report.","ISIS captured Assyrian Christians in various villages in northern Syria .

"(CNN)Chelsea claimed the first silverware of the English domestic season and Jose Mourinho's first trophy of his second spell in charge with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Sunday. Deflected efforts either side of halftime from Chelsea captain John Terry and leading scorer Diego Costa dashed Tottenham's hopes in the all-London League Cup final. Chelsea had suffered a chastening Christmas defeat to the same opposition in the English Premier League, with Harry Kane starring, but the promising young English striker was kept largely quiet in the showpiece occasion. The first half saw Tottenham edge the possession and carry more of the attacking threat, with Dane Christian Eriksen's free kick rattling the Chelsea crossbar. But chances for either side from open play  were in short supply and it was from a free kick that Chelsea went ahead just before the break. Willian's delivery from the right brushed Danny Rose's head and fell invitingly to Terry whose shot went into the net after taking a deflection off Eric Dier. Tottenham might have felt hard done by and the sense of injustice would have deepened on 56 minutes as Cesc Fabregas found Costa down the left and his firm strike took another wicked deflection, this time off Walker, who was credited with the own goal, to leave goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with no chance. It seemed to take the sting out of the Tottenham challenge and although Kane had a late half chance, it was Terry who typically snuffed out the threat with a timely tackle. It was the fifth time Chelsea had lifted the English League Cup and third under Mourinho. The Portuguese claimed it in his first season with the west London club in 2005 and after returning to the Stamford Bridge hot seat last season has broken his mini-trophy drought. Mourinho, whose side is also well-placed to go through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, was clearly reveling in his latest success, his 21st career trophy as a manager. ""'It is important to feel like a kid at 52 years old,"" he said. Man of the match Terry is hoping it will pave the way for further triumphs. ""It's the first trophy this season and it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us when we won it in Jose's first year in 2005 as well,"" he said. ""That could be the start of something very good. We have to kick on and we have got the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win."" Man City blow . Chelsea was also boosted by an earlier result in the EPL as its nearest title rival Manchester City was beaten 2-1 at Liverpool. City had hoped to cut the gap at the top on Chelsea to just two points with a win at Anfield, but instead suffered a chastening reverse. Jordan Henderson put Liverpool ahead with a thumping shot after just 11 minutes only for Edin Dzeko to draw City, defending the EPL title, level midway through the first half. Liverpool, looking to boost its own chances of Champions League football next season, dominated after the break and deservedly took three points after Philippe Coutinho scored a superb late winner with a curling shot which flew past Joe Hart. Arsenal stayed third by beating Everton 2-0 with Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky scoring late in each half to give the Gunners a boost after a Champions League defeat to Monaco in midweek.","Chelsea wins English League Cup at Wembley .

"(CNN)In his writings, author Avijit Roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science. He had no place for religious dogma, including from Islam, the main religion of his native Bangladesh. Extremists resented him for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog. They threatened to kill him if he came home from the United States to visit. On Thursday, someone did. As usual, Roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban Atlanta for Dhaka, where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled ""The Virus of Faith."" He has written seven books in all. As he walked back from the book fair, assailants plunged machetes and knives into Roy and his wife, killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger. Afterward, an Islamist group ""Ansar Bangla-7"" reportedly tweeted, ""Target Down here in Bangladesh."" Investigators are proceeding on the notion that Roy's murder was an extremist attack. His father, Ajay Roy, filed a case of murder with the Shahbagh police Friday without naming suspects. No one came to their aid as they were hacked down, a witness said. ""I shouted for help from the people but nobody came to save him."" But at night, secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches; by day, others held a sit-in to protest Roy's killing. The government condemned the attack. Who was the software engineer, a U.S. citizen from Alpharetta, Georgia, who drew such rage from some and adoration from others? Software was his career, but writing and blogging were his calling. And he did not speak alone. Roy founded the religion critical blog Mukto Mona, which served multiple writers. He called it ""an Internet congregation of freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists and humanists mainly of Bengali and South Asian descent who are scattered across the globe."" Its mission was to promote science, secular philosophy, democracy and religious tolerance in articles by academics and activists. Its headers contain quotes by famous scientists, including one attributed to Albert Einstein condemning the doctrine of heaven and hell as a means of enforcing ethics: . ""A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary."" To the most devout and to extremists, Roy's criticisms amounted to blasphemy. He took aim at the sentiment in a blog post headlined,  ""Happy Blasphemy Day, Happy Birthday 'Mukto Mona.'"" Some who felt oppressed by religion said he spoke for them. ""Avijit Roy, your voice of reason and your passion for free thinking will never die. You were a voice to so many voiceless,"" a fan wrote after his death. Very. Roy and the blog's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion, particularly Islam. Roy was a fan of Bill Maher's harsh reproach of Islam and a critic of Reza Aslan, who has countered Maher's  standpoint. His blog called Aslan ""an Islamic apologist, who obviously feels threatened by the growing Atheist movement in the U.S. and worldwide."" Roy likened women in burkas to ""living zombies,"" tweeting out a cartoon of one standing next to a child dressed as a ghost for Halloween. Yes. He began one of his final articles by writing that January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in France was ""a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace."" He doled out scathing criticism after another Bangladeshi blogger was hacked to death outside his home in 2013 by assailants with machetes. ""The virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible,"" Roy wrote. But he also criticized Christianity. ""So, Pope Francis thinks 'evolution is real'! And it is still a major headline news in this century,"" he recently tweeted. To Roy, God was an outdated notion. Roy sought enlightenment in doubt, criticism and reason. Question everything, was a theme in his online posts. Never think you've found the truth. He was a science geek who admired Charles Darwin, evolutionary psychology and astrophysics, according to a Facebook account in his name. CNN could not independently verify it belongs to him. Roy was a fan of ""Cosmos,"" the TV series explaining the science behind the origin of the universe, and of the geek sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory."" Mukto Mona contains sections titled ""Science"" and ""Rationalism,"" but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test, which it invariably fails. ""To me, it is a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief,"" Roy said. That's likely. He regularly attended a February book fair in the Bangladeshi capital, and last year, after he launched ""The Virus of Faith,"" the death threats began streaming in. They landed in his email inbox and cropped up on social media. ""A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous Facebook statuses,"" Roy wrote. His book ""hit the cranial nerve of Islamic fundamentalists,"" Roy wrote. After the Charlie Hebdo attacks, an online Bangladeshi bookstore pulled it after extremists put pressure on it. But is seemed the author was safe in Alpharetta. ""Avijit Roy lives in America and so, it is not possible to kill him right now. But he will be murdered when he comes back,"" the Islamist wrote, according to Roy. He couldn't let that stop him, Roy's friend Michael De Dora said. ""Avijit was very idealistic,"" he said. ""His understanding was that he wouldn't be killed, that if anyone ever tried to attack him or hated him, that they could just kind of have a chat and he would convince them ... that they could at least have a dialogue."" He never had a chance to. They attacked from behind.

"(CNN)A Massachusetts teenager faces a pretrial hearing in April on involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly sending text messages urging a friend to commit suicide, even after he expressed second thoughts, authorities said Saturday. Michelle Carter, 18, was indicted on February 5. Conrad Roy, 18, of Fairhaven and Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on July 13, Sgt. Kevin Kobza, public information officer for the Fairhaven Police Department, said Saturday. At one point the night of Roy's death, he exited the vehicle and communicated to Carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life, Kobza told CNN. Carter then urged him via text message to get back in the car, Kobza said. Upon searching Roy's cell phone, police discovered ""hundreds"" of texts between Roy and Carter, many which contained language from Carter that encouraged Roy to take his own life, Kobza said. ""Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,"" Gregg Miliote, director of communications for the Bristol County District Attorney's Office, said in a statement. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, said Saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that Carter attempted to console Roy on ""many occasions."" ""The facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light,"" Cataldo said. ""My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months."" On a Twitter page confirmed by the District Attorney's Office to be Carter's, several photos and tweets about Roy have been posted since his death. One tweet reads, ""I can't believe today already marks 4 months without you. I love you and miss you always Conrad..."" In September 2014, Carter organized a softball tournament in Roy's memory and raised $2,300 for mental health awareness, according to Kobza. Carter was arraigned on the indictment on February 6 in New Bedford Juvenile Court, released on $2,500 bail and told not to use social media, according to Miliote. Carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred. Youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public, Cataldo said. Because of a familial relationship he has with the victim's family, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case, the District Attorney's Office said. Carter's pretrial hearing is set for April 17.","Conrad Roy, 18, was found dead of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, police said .

"Moscow  (CNN)This was supposed to be a rally led by Boris Nemtsov, had he lived two more days to see it. But after the Russian opposition figure was gunned down Friday night, Sunday's rally in Moscow took on a different theme. Instead of gathering to criticize Russia's policies on Ukraine, thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister. And as they united near the site of Nemtsov's death, conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin as he walked near the Kremlin with his Ukrainian model companion. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists' fire by saying Saturday that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, according to Ukrinform, the state-run news agency. ""A few weeks ago I had a conversation with him on how to build relations between Ukraine and Russia, as we would like them to be. Boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of that. Boris was not afraid, the executioners were afraid. They killed him,"" Ukrinform quoted Poroshenko as saying. Russian authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally. But they agreed to allow the procession honoring Nemtsov, said People's Freedom Party leader Mikhail Kasyanov. Nemtsov was a top official in the party. The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with a companion, 23-year-old Anna Duritskaya, when he was killed. The model later called Ilya Yashin, a  friend and political colleague of Nemtsov's, and said several men had pulled up in a car, and one opened fire, Yashin said. Russian TV station LifeNews spoke with a snowplow driver, who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying. He was identified as ""Sergey B."" ""I got on the bridge, looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground. I immediately realized he didn't feel well. I drove a little bit further and pulled over,"" the driver said. ""I realized we needed to call the ambulance and police."" In a statement on its website, the Investigative Committee for the Russian Federation said the shooter likely used a Russian-made Makarov pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene. Police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-9, Russia's Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. Several possible motives were being investigated, the committee said, including the prospect that the shooting was a ""provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country."" The committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris or Nemtsov's business activities, it said. The committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information about the crime, several media outlets reported. Investigators interviewed Duritskaya, who was not wounded. She was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment, and Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has requested that Duritskaya be allowed to return to Ukraine, according to TASS, a Russian news agency. Putin quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. But some of Nemtsov's fellow critics suspect involvement by either Putin's administration or a supporter of the President. ""It's clearly a political murder. It's definitely a contract one,"" Yashin said. ""I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it. They've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who doesn't support their course and thinks different."" Putin had a different theory: that the killing was a contract hit, but one meant to fire up political strife, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Nemtsov himself had said he was at risk for assassination. He told the Russian newspaper Sobesednik last month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid his mother's fears Putin would have him killed would come true. But, he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Last year, Nemtsov spoke to CNN's Anthony Bourdain. ""I'm (a) well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,"" he said then. Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011, when he protested the results of parliamentary elections, and in 2012, when tens of thousands protested against Putin. While Nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in Russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the Ukrainian conflict --  many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed. ""To Boris Nemtsov,"" one letter read, ""Thank you for your example of courage and honesty."" Human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for Nemtsov's murder. Tweeted Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council: ""If you are popular your critics don't have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin. Putin is just food in a prison, eat it or starve."" In a column on how Nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the Kremlin, Human Rights Watch's Tanya Cooper lambasted Peskov, the Putin spokesman, for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize Russia -- a statement Cooper said could prejudice the investigation. ""Russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president's office,"" she wrote. ""A country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in."" Frederik Pleitgen and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow; Holly Yan and Eliott C. McLaughlin reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.","Ukraine's president says Boris Nemtsov was about to release information .

"(CNN)Prince William arrived in Beijing on Sunday -- the first visit to China by a senior member of the British Royal Family in  three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock. But chances are he'll feel right at home. From television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock Tudor housing developments, China has been embracing British culture with a passion. Chinese viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Downton Abbey,"" with the former's star, Benedict Cumberbatch, so popular he has his own Chinese nickname -- Curly Blessing. The fascination with Edwardian England depicted in Downton has created a growing demand for butlers, and the country's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking. ""Downton Abbey depicts traditional British, high-class lives. It something that I and many other Chinese are curious about,"" said student Cherrie Zhang. It's not just television shows. Affluent Chinese parents are sending their children to British schools after some of the most notable names in British education have established campuses in China. Harrow, Wellington College and Dulwich College have all opened sister schools in the country. And the obsession with British culture has taken a bizarre turn in Thames Town, a housing development on the outskirts of Shanghai that resembles a quaint English town, complete with replica red telephone booths. It's crucial that Prince William capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high-profile visit, which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills. ""It will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne,"" said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney and a former British diplomat. ""And I think China will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician, who come and go, but (someone who) will be around for quite a while."" Cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote. China spent 17 million pounds on UK TV programs and formats in 2013, a 40% increase on the year before, but they form a small part of the overall trade balance. And while London has been successful in attracting Chinese investment, UK companies have not thrived in China the same way as some of their U.S. and German counterparts. Previous trips by Royals have been gaffe ridden. When the Queen and Prince Philip spent time in China in 1986, the Queen's husband caused offense when he told a group of British students: ""If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."" Prince Charles, William's father, has never visited China but described the country's leaders as ""appalling old waxworks"" during his visit to Hong Kong in 1997. His close ties with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, have also angered China's leaders. Prince William will visit Beijing's Forbidden City, attend the Chinese premiere of the British-produced children's animated movie ""Paddington"" in Shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate British innovation during the three-day trip. Before China, he is spending three days in Japan. The prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife --  when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern China . ""If he can make some kind of link in China, if he can instinctively show he gets it, that could be an important thing,"" Brown said. But the relationship between the UK and China comes laden with ""stacks of historic baggage,"" Brown adds, and the prince will have to tread carefully, particularly over the former colony of Hong Kong, where the push for a free vote has strained ties between Britain and China, the current landlords. British lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a ""fact-finding"" mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests. What's more, it's not clear how much ""star power"" Prince William has in China, especially without his glamorous wife Kate, who at eight months pregnant won't make the trip, and his young son George. An informal survey conducted by the UK's Telegraph newspaper in Beijing showed that many struggled to recognize the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- one thought the couple were in the movie ""Titanic"" -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary Chinese. ""The Royal Family are not really a big deal to me,"" said Zhang, the Downton Abbey fan. Serena Dong in Beijing contributed to this report .","Prince William arrives in China on Sunday after visiting Japan .

"(CNN)Victor Arden Barnard, an American pastor wanted for 59 counts of sexual assaults in Minnesota, was arrested by Brazilian authorities on Friday, the office of the governor for the State of Rio Grande do Norte said Saturday. The 53-year-old suspect was wanted by the Pine County, Minnesota, Sheriff's Office for allegedly sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church, the U.S Marshals Service said. Barnard -- who was featured on CNN's ""The Hunt With John Walsh"" in 2014 and again earlier this week -- was last seen in the United States in Raymond, Washington, in 2014. In April of that year, prosecutors in Pine County, Minnesota, issued a criminal complaint that accused him of 59 felony counts of criminal sexual conduct. The manhunt began after a two-year investigation into allegations from two women about Barnard's alleged conduct while he was preaching to a religious group in Finlayson, Minnesota. Barnard was featured on the United States Marshal's 15 Most Wanted List along with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. He was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. A 33-year-old woman was also arrested, Brazilian authorities said. As a pastor, Victor Barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ. ""I had never met anybody that I thought loved the word of God as much as Victor Barnard did,"" Ruth Johnson, a former member of Barnard's River Road Fellowship, told ""The Hunt."" David Larsen, a former leader of the River Road Fellowship, said he helped Barnard set up a so-called ""shepherd's camp"" in the mid-1990s in Pine County to help bring more people into the church. Several of his congregants, including Johnson, moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of Minneapolis to be a part of the camp. In June of 2000, the charismatic religious leader allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in the secluded campsite. Lindsay Tornambe's name was called and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp, called ""The Maidens,"" under Barnard's supervision. She and other congregants said the girls got up early, sewed, cooked and cleaned for Barnard. ""Everything that a wife would do, they did for him,"" Johnson said. Barnard proclaimed he was Christ on Earth. ""He taught that in the Bible, the church was the bride of Christ and because he was Christ in the flesh, the church was supposed to be married to him,"" Tornambe said. ""At that time I didn't really understand the fullness of what it meant."" The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges that she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. Tornambe told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp, the document says. Tornambe told investigators that she estimated that Barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. In fall 2011, she was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story: she said she was molested by Barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20, although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month. Tornambe and the other woman went to the police in Minnesota. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office told CNN in 2014. The fellowship vacated the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry, Blackwell said. The Salvation Army now runs a family camp there, he said at the time. CNN's Florencia Trucco and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Victor Barnard is accused of 59 counts of sexual assault on two young girls .

The Julie Andrews film, about the von Trapp family and its ""problem"" governess, Maria, is beloved enough to have spawned audience singalongs. The performers who played the von Trapp children remain close, doing joint interviews and publishing a book. The film even prompted a live NBC musical, which -- though it was roasted by critics -- still managed stupendous ratings. Of course, there remains one notable dissenter: Christopher Plummer, who has long had a grudging opinion of perhaps his most famous role. ""It was so awful and sentimental and gooey,"" he told the Hollywood Reporter in 2011. That may have been its charm. The movie, which premiered on March 2, 1965, went on to earn five Oscars -- including best picture -- and grossed more than $110 million in its initial run, equal to about $800 million in today's money. That made it one of the most successful movies of all time at the box office, up there with ""Gone With the Wind,"" and it wasn't truly surpassed until ""The Godfather"" came out in 1972.

"(CNN)Pleading innocence, immunity and ignorance, the city of Cleveland responded to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice's family by saying the 12-year-old's death was his own fault. In November, Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann fired the fatal shots at Tamir within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the sixth-grader was playing with a pellet gun. In the 41-page response to the family's lawsuit filed Friday, the city says that Tamir's injuries ""were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury."" The response further says that ""Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant."" The city also claims it is entitled to all ""full and qualified"" immunities under state and federal law. As to the scores of other allegations in the lawsuit, the city responds by saying that they are untrue, that the independent investigation by Cuyahoga County is still going on, or that the city ""is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth."" Cuyahoga County's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy's death constitute a crime. Cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that Loehmann mistook Tamir's fake gun for a real one. A witness called 911 on November 22 to say there was ""a guy with a pistol"" and that although the weapon was ""probably"" fake, Tamir was scaring people. It doesn't appear the dispatcher relayed the information to Loehmann and Officer Frank Garmback. Video of the incident shows the two pull up on the snowy grass near a gazebo where Tamir is standing. Within two seconds of exiting the police car, Loehmann shoots the 12-year-old. The boy died the next day of injuries to ""a major vessel, intestines and pelvis."" In the video, neither Loehmann nor Garmback appears to provide medical assistance to the boy, and Police Chief Calvin Williams has said that Tamir did not receive first aid until an FBI agent arrived on the scene four minutes later. An attorney for the Rice family says the city's response to the lawsuit is indicative of well-documented problems within the Cleveland Police Department. ""The Rice family maintains that Tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by Cleveland police officers,"" Rice family co-counsel Walter Madison said in a statement. ""Their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the Cleveland Police Department. The Rice family's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community."" Rice family co-counsel Benjamin Crump said the family was ""just in disbelief"" after reading the response. Crump went on to attack the police department's assertion, put forth in December, that Loehmann gave Tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up. ""It is just incredible that the police officer, based on what we see on the video surveillance recording, gave Tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up and drop the weapon, based on what we see in the video. It was less than 1.7 seconds. The car hadn't even stopped. It's unbelievable."" CNN could not immediately reach the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department for comment. Cleveland Police Department spokesperson Ali Pillow declined comment and referred questions to a city spokesman, who couldn't be immediately reached. In December, the U.S. Justice Department released the results of a two-year investigation that found Cleveland officers use guns, Tasers, pepper spray and their fists excessively, unnecessarily or in retaliation. The police force has used unnecessary and unreasonable force at a ""significant rate,"" employing ""dangerous tactics"" that put the community at risk, the investigation stated. It was also reported in December that Loehmann's previous employer, the Independence Police Department in a Cleveland suburb, had numerous complaints about the officer, including that he was ""distracted and weepy"" and ""emotionally immature"" and had demonstrated ""a pattern of lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions."" He also showed ""dangerous loss of composure during live range training"" and an ""inability to manage personal stress,"" the department said. In December, Crump called for Loehmann and Garmback to be charged and decried what he said was a police tendency to let grand juries determine whether to charge officers involved in shootings.

"(CNN)A man suspected of killing two people during a ""street race"" has turned himself in to Los Angeles Police. Henry Gevorgyan, 21, surrendered to authorities Saturday night in connection with the fatal hit-and-run that left two onlookers dead. He was charged Sunday with murder, according to LAPD spokesman Officer Jack Richter, and held at the LAPD jail in Van Nuys with bail set at $2 million. The crash happened Thursday in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Chatsworth. Gevorgyan was driving a gray Ford Mustang and was allegedly racing another vehicle ""and struck several pedestrian spectators,"" police said. Authorities said he fled the scene of the accident along with the driver of the other car. One man died at the scene, another died at a local hospital from his injuries. A third pedestrian is hospitalized in stable condition. ""Many view this as an entertainment, glamorous activity. I think it's important for the public to know that this is illegal, dangerous and an all too deadly activity,""  Capt. John McMahon told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. Video from the scene showed the smashed Mustang on a sidewalk. The car reportedly spun 180 degrees before landing between a fire hydrant and a utility pole. The driver of the other vehicle involved in the crash has not been found.","Suspect in hit-and-run that left two onlookers dead is charged with murder .

"(CNN)A volcano in Russia led to the cancellation of flights in Alaska over the weekend. ""We canceled two roundtrip flights between Anchorage and Bethel, and Anchorage and Nome after an advisory of low visibility,""  Alaska Airlines  spokeswoman Halley Knigge said. Ash from Russia's Shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions Saturday,  said Jeff Freymueller, a scientist at  the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The volcano erupted Friday, shooting ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet.  Winds blew the ash cloud across the Bering Sea and into western Alaska, Freymueller said. Shiveluch, which has been erupting consistently, caused a similar incident in January, he said. The airline will only operate flights when it's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash. Alaska Airlines was uncertain if additional flights would be canceled, but said it's monitoring the situation. Three volcanoes are erupting on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula: Shiveluch, Klyuchevskoy and Karymsky. Volcano grows Japanese island .","Volcano shoots ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet .

"(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo reached 30 La Liga goals for the season but could not prevent Villarreal from grabbing a share of the points in the Bernabeu Sunday in an entertaining 1-1 draw. Ronaldo put Real ahead with a second half penalty after being pulled down and had 13 shots of goal in a lively display, but his team was unable to secure a fourth consecutive win. Gerard Moreno's thumping low strike 26 minutes from time spoiled the home party and Real has seen its lead at the top cut to two points after Barcelona's win Saturday. The arch rivals meet in El Clasico on March 22, with the title very much up for grabs. Villarreal, coached by Marcelino, even fielded an understrength side as it bids to progress in the Copa del Rey and the Europa League, but should have been ahead early when Iker Casillas made a fine save from Moreno and then Dani Carvajal spectacularly headed Moi Gomez's follow-up effort off the line. Real was turning up the heat and Gareth Bale went close for the European champions with a header, while Raphael Varane went even closer with a header that also just missed the target. Ronaldo was a constant threat and after the break he was pulled down inside the area by Eric Bailly and converted from the spot. Bale and Ronaldo should have doubled the scoreline, but Real was made to pay for its wasted chances when Moreno stunned the home crowd with the leveler. Champion Atletico Madrid missed the chance to close to within five points of Real at the top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Sevilla earlier Sunday. Valencia moved to within a point of Atletico after beaing David Moyes's Real Sociedad 2-0 with a double from Pablo Piatti. Wolfsburg wins thriller . In the Bundesliga, VfL Wolfsburg kept up its dogged pursuit of Bayern Munich with a 5-3 win at Werder Bremen in a thrilling eight-goal encounter. Wolfsburg striker Bas Dost scored a double to make it 14 goals in his last nine appearances but his side still trails Bayern by eight points despite its impressive recent form. The match had been under threat due to a security alert in the north Germany city of Bremen, but it was downgraded with extra police on duty at the 42,000-capacity Weserstadion stadium. Earlier police had made two temporary arrests and searched an Islamic cultural center. Monaco holds PSG .

"(CNN)California's Silicon Valley is one of the most prosperous places in the United States -- home to tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Yet even this region isn't immune from the scourge of child poverty. I visited Silicon Valley in November for CNN's Change the List series. Readers of this website voted for me to do a story on child poverty. There, I found children living in tents, homeless shelters -- even a garage, which I found particularly ironic given that Google and Apple link their company origins to garages in this valley south of San Francisco. Instead of going on about all that's wrong with Silicon Valley and this country as a whole, where one in five kids lives below the poverty line, I want to bring some good news: We can fix this. Child poverty isn't inevitable. It's a choice. And we can choose to end it. Here are four ways we can start to do that. If you don't like these, go to this Google Form (yeah, Google) and suggest a solution of your own. Your ideas may end up in a future column. (Side note: Google declined to comment on ""The poor kids of Silicon Valley."" Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment.) The idea: Housing is too expensive for poor families, especially in markets such as Silicon Valley. But making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden. Evidence it works: Increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce U.S. child poverty by 20.8%, according to a 2015 Children's Defense Fund report. That would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty. The annual cost would be $23.5 billion. For more info, read this report: ""Ending Child Poverty Now."" What you can do: Support vetted California organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low-income families, including Family Supportive Housing and Samaritan House. Or: Petition Facebook, Apple or Google to fund subsidized housing projects in their own backyard. The idea: Working families can't afford to raise their kids, and better wages would help them do it. The federal minimum wage is worth considerably less now than it was in the 1960s, adjusted for inflation, according to the Congressional Research Service. The federal minimum wage was worth $9.27 in 1963, using July 2013 dollars. Now it's $7.25. Evidence it works: Raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and boosting the tipped worker wage to $7.07, could reduce U.S. child poverty by 4%, according to the Children's Defense Fund report. That would help lift 400,000 American kids out of poverty. To see how something like that plays out, I visited the Idaho-Washington border. Idaho's minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Washington's is $9.47. The difference is $4,618 per year. On my visit, I met Amanda Palmen, a 27-year-old gas station worker. She told me that that wage difference is enough to help her two girls more comfortably -- and get off the SNAP program. What you can do: Petition for a $10.10 federal minimum wage. And learn more about minimum wage laws in your state. The idea: Kids who attend high-quality preschools are more likely to graduate from high school and tend to earn more as adults. Every child should have that chance. Additionally, expanding child care subsidies could help. Spending $5.3 billion would reduce U.S. child poverty by 3%, or 300,000 kids, according to the Children's Defense Fund report. Evidence it works: Meet the poorest kids in Iceland, a country with a low child poverty rate and nearly universal enrollment in early education, starting at age 2. In America, meanwhile, despite advances in many states, only 40% of 3-year-olds are enrolled. (Rates do go up for 4- and 5-year-olds, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.) Petition in favor of ""preschool for all."" Or support these vetted groups: . The idea: The thing poor families lack is money. Give it to them and let them decide how to spend it. Evidence it works: Cherokee, North Carolina, pays tribal members a biannual stipend, just for being alive. And social ills have declined. The money comes from a casino, which the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation owns. In 1996, the tribal council voted to distribute 50% of the casino profits evenly among its 15,000 members, according to Vice Chief Larry Blythe. A Duke University researcher has been studying the impact of these payments for two decades. She follows 1,420 kids, comparing the lives of those who get the casino money with those who don't. The results are startling. For the poorest families, a yearly $4,000 payment reduced by 22% the odds that children would commit minor crimes by their late teens. The poorest kids were one grade year ahead when researchers checked in with them at 21. Mental health also improved. Kids who were lifted out of poverty by the payments saw behavioral problems decrease by 40%. For more info, read this op-ed: ""The argument for the basic income.""

"(CNN)As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads to the United States, some former security leaders from Israel have come out against his speech to Congress, set for Tuesday. Speaking at a Tel Aviv press conference, retired Maj. Gen. Amnon Reshef, one of the founders of Commanders for Israel's Security, said the speech -- expected to take a hard line on Iran's nuclear ambitions -- is ""a terrible mistake"" that will further damage the relationship between the U.S. and Israel. He also said the speech could harm Israel's security by damaging Israel's relationship with other countries. On Friday, Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, told one of the leading Israeli newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth: ""The person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to Israel on the Iranian issue is the prime minister."" Dagan, who was the director of Mossad from 2002 to 2010, continued, ""I've seen leaders who made decisions and then later admitted that they had erred. Nobody is immune from mistakes. The difference between him and others is the willingness to take responsibility. He is strong on talk, not in action."" Recent polling by CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel shows Israelis split on the speech, with 38% supporting it and the same percentage opposing it. The remaining 24% are undecided. But another poll from Panels Politics, an Israeli polling institute, indicates 53% of Israelis believe the speech will have no effect on the negotiations between six world powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Another 30% believe the speech will affect the negotiations. Reshef said this year's elections, which will take place on March 17, exactly two weeks after Netanyahu's speech, are crucial for the peace process. Even after years of failed negotiations, Israel has the opportunity now to restart negotiations with the help of moderate Arab states, he said, while warning that going the wrong direction could push peace further out of reach. Reshef would not specify which political leaders would be the best for negotiations, but he said he trusts Israeli voters to decide for themselves in the upcoming elections. Commanders for Israel's Security is a nonpartisan group of nearly 200 veteran senior security members from the Israel Defense Forces; Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency; and the police. It is committed to a regional political-security initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group also seeks to normalize relations with moderate Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. 6 questions about Netanyahu's visit .","Retired general says Netanyahu speech will damage Israel-U.S. relationship .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's effort to bridge the trust deficit between African-Americans and law enforcement, the money wars heading into 2016, a little CPAC history and a ""do not reply"" mandate fill our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table: . 1. Winning CPAC once meant little, but are Rand Paul's multiple wins just the ticket? Rand Paul won his third consecutive CPAC presidential straw poll this weekend, and most political journalists yawned -- and understandably so. There have been 20 previous CPAC straw polls, and only in four of those cases has the winner ended up as the Republican presidential nominee. And in all four of those cases, it was in the actual election year. Never has a winner in the year before the presidential vote -- like this year -- gone on to win the nomination. So Sen. Paul shouldn't rush to measure the White House drapes. But he is now in special company: He's in a tie for CPAC wins (three) with Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp. Mitt Romney is the all-time leader with four CPAC wins. Ron Paul has two. So winning once is more or less meaningless, but winning twice or more? The Pauls -- Rand and Ron -- are the only two men with at least two CPAC wins who have not appeared on the GOP ticket. (Kemp was Bob Dole's VP nominee.) It's one more way, we can assume, that Rand Paul hopes to get some separation from his dad heading into 2016. 2. POTUS hopes for action -- and legacy item -- in law enforcement arena . Washington will be consumed this week with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress and the continuing fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security. But Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside another big event: a report from the task force Obama established post-Ferguson to study the tensions between law enforcement and African-Americans. ""The White House has said that they have been surprised by so many areas of commonality between these activists and law enforcement officials who were on this task force,"" said Henderson. ""Other people say the gulf is as wide as you might imagine."" Henderson adds that the President doesn't want this report to gather dust on the shelf but casts doubts over whether this will be part of Obama's record. ""Whether or not it will be a legacy item, we'll have to see. That will probably depend on legislation, and that seems fairly unlikely."" 3. The super PAC campaign: Millions are OK, but billions rule . There is always a money race in presidential politics. But the times are changing. Candidates need to raise cash for their actual campaign committees, but that effort is taking a back seat to the bigger money chase. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times shared some reporting on the race to win over big -- as in billionaire -- support for the super PACs that now dominate the world of political finance. Martin noted it's March 1, and ""not a single candidate has set up an actual campaign committee."" ""They have, though, set up super PACs, and this has dramatically changed politics. The donors most coveted now are billionaires with a 'B,' those [who] can stroke seven-, eight-figure checks and the year of the bundlers who can raise a few hundred thousand dollars is seemingly passe."" 4. Go West: The states are blue, but the money chase is bipartisan . It's not really a risk to say California, Oregon and Washington will go blue --Democratic -- in the 2016 presidential race. So why, then, are many Republican hopefuls heading West, especially to Silicon Valley? It's all about the cash. Obama dominated high-tech fundraising in 2008 and 2012. Bloomberg's Lisa Lerer traveled West recently as Hillary Clinton made a pitch for help this time around. She reports that Clinton has many friends, but that there is a fierce and bipartisan competition for money out West. ""This time she'll ... have competition from an unlikely source, Rand Paul, who's opened an office there. He's hoping to tap into the libertarian vein of some of the Silicon Valley money. Jeb Bush has also been meeting with tech executives."" ""It's not clear who's going capture this new and growing source of wealth for elections that are supposed to cost over $1 billion on each side, but one thing's sure. We'll see lots of candidates and staffers making many trips down the 101."" 5. DO NOT REPLY: Your government's guide to a partial shutdown . A temporary fix keeps the Department of Homeland Security running at full steam this week, but Congress will be trying to find a longer-term solution next. So department workers still have to prepare and sort out whether they would have to work -- or would be furloughed -- in the event funding expires. Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post gave us a glimpse at the contingency planning, obtaining a memo sent to relevant workers as it appeared Congress might not reach even a temporary deal before the Friday night deadline. ""Buried deep in there on page 23--- a little note to the 15% of DHS workers who might have been furloughed: you can check your email but you cannot hit reply,"" said O'Keefe. ""You were allowed to check for the status of the furlough but to hit reply or to engage anyone on email might result in severe penalties."" ""So you would get paid after a shutdown, but you weren't allowed to check your email. Perhaps a silver lining to the possibility of the shutdown.""","Could President Obama's legacy include fixing Ferguson?

"(CNN)In his first interview since Islamic State militants burned alive a Jordanian pilot, the King of Jordan spoke to CNN's Fareed Zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group. Last December, ISIS captured Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the United States-led coalition to defeat the group. For more than a month, al-Kasasbeh's family, hailing from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to Jordan's royal family, implored ISIS to let him go. Hope that he could be spared ended in early February when a video emerged showing the 29-year-old pilot in a cage, being burned alive. King Abdullah II, an instrumental supporter of the global coalition, then said Jordan would be relentless in retaliating against ISIS. The country unleashed airstrikes. To Zakaria, Abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop ISIS. He called its fighters ""outlaws"" who twist Islam and use ""intimidation"" as their biggest weapon. The King told Zakaria that he didn't watch the video of the pilot's slaying. ""I -- many of us refused to see what I think is propaganda,"" Abdullah said. He felt ""disgust, sadness for the family"" and his ""heart went out to the father, the mother, the brothers, the sisters,"" the King continued. ""His wife, they'd only been married for five months. (I felt) anger as the son of the Arab army, Jordanian armed forces. God bless his soul. He's a brother in arms. ""All soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what Moath was put through,"" Abdullah said. During his interview with Zakaria, the King repeatedly referred to ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as Daesh. That's an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Many in the Middle East prefer to use Daesh because, to them, the acronym ISIS suggests the terror group is a legitimate state. They refuse to give the militants that much credit. ""I think if ISIS, or Daesh as we call them, try to intimidate Jordanians ... just (has) the reverse effect,"" Abdullah said. ""If you look at our history, we're a country that's used to being outgunned and outnumbered. We've always punched way above our weight. I think, if anything, Daesh has us as a tiger by the tail."" The pilot's killing ""just motivated Jordanians to rally around the flag,"" he said. ""The gloves have come off."" ISIS is ""always trying to intimidate, scare, put fear in people's hearts,"" the King told Zakaria. ""They are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate, link to our history in Islam that has no truth or bearing to our history."" ISIS is recruiting ""deluded young men and women"" who ""think this is an Islamic nation."" U.S. President Barack Obama has caught flak for saying he didn't want to refer to ISIS members as Islamic extremists because their actions are not Islamic. ""I think he is right,"" Abdullah said. ""This is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform. (ISIS) is looking for legitimacy (that) they have inside of Islam."" ""I'm a Muslim,"" the King said. ""These people (ISIS members) ... are on the fringe of Islam."" ""The barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero (the pilot), I think, shocked the Muslim world, especially Jordanians and people from this region,"" Abdullah said. In the wake of the pilot's death, a Jordanian government spokesman vowed an ""earthshaking retaliation."" Zakaria asked Abdullah if Jordan's action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric. ""Earth-shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight,"" he answered, saying that airstrikes have continued. ""There are continued operations going on in Syria. We are coordinating with our friends in Iraq."" He said there is a ""long-term approach"" to fighting ISIS but didn't give any more details. The war against ISIS is as much Jordan's war as that of any other country in the coalition, he said. ""It is our war. It has been for a long time,"" he said. ""These are outlaws, in a way, of Islam, the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over Muslims."" ISIS cannot argue that Jordan and other Muslim nations should not attack them because they're fellow Muslims, he said. The militants ""try to make themselves look as victims,"" he said. ""What about the hundreds if not thousands of Muslims they have killed in Syria and Iraq over the past year and a half?"" Jordan has a ""responsibility to reach out to eastern Syria"" and to western Iraq where people have been ""executed in large numbers"" by ISIS, Abdullah insisted. ""So this is our war,"" he said. ""We have a moral responsibility to reach out to those Muslims to protect them and stop (ISIS) before they reach our border."" Zakaria asked Abdullah what he thinks about the perception some have that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is interested in combating ISIS, meaning al-Assad and Abdullah have common enemies. ISIS has gained strength by exploiting the unrest in Syria during its ongoing civil war. That war is the result of unrest in Syria that originally started in 2011 within the context of the Arab Spring, protests for democracy or changes in government that raged in parts of the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. Syrian protesters, in 2011, wanted to bring change to the government which they said stifled expression in the harshest ways. The al-Assad regime violently cracked down on the demonstrators, chaos erupted throughout Syria, and eventually many on the international stage came to believe al-Assad should go. The King told Zakaria that the ""history of dealing with"" the al-Assad regime and the ""history of dealing with"" ISIS are two separate things. ""What has taken prominence at the moment is ISIS, Daesh,"" he said. Abdullah rhetorically asked whether both issues can be dealt with at the same time. ""This has to be decided by the international community,"" he said. ""We believe there has to be a political solution"" in Syria, and that has ""not been clarified at the moment.""","The King of Jordan gives his first interview since the slaying of a Jordanian pilot .

"(CNN)Cleveland's mayor apologized Monday for the city's ""poor use of words and our insensitivity"" in the Tamir Rice case. Mayor Frank Jackson told reporters the city was apologizing to the Rice family and the people of Cleveland for the wording of a legal filing last week, which said the death of Tamir, a 12-year-old who was shot by police in November, was the sixth-grader's own fault. ""We did something that ... is hurtful to the family, that is disrespectful to them and the victim as well as the city of Cleveland,"" he said. The wording in the legal filing, Jackson said, was standard language used in legal defense, and the insensitivity ""was not intended."" But now, he said, the city will be rewording its filing -- a decision he pushed for as soon as he found out about it. ""What I care about right now is that the family of Tamir Rice and the people of the city of Cleveland understand and realize that we are sorry for what we have done and that we apologize to them,"" Jackson said. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Rice family, said the mayor's apology didn't go far enough. ""I don't want him just to apologize for the poor word use and the grammatical phrases,"" Crump told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. ""I want him to apologize for the death of this 12-year-old child, one of his citizens, at the hands of what we believe were police officers who were improperly trained."" Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loehmann fired the fatal shots at Tamir in November within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the 12-year-old was playing with a pellet gun. ""They never even gave him a chance,"" Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" The whole world has seen the same video like I've seen, and I'm sure the whole world is saying, 'You guys never gave him a chance.' With that being said, it can never be justified."" Cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that Loehmann mistook Tamir's fake gun for a real one. Cuyahoga County's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy's death constitute a crime. In its 41-page response to the family's lawsuit filed Friday, the city says that Tamir's injuries ""were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury."" The response further says that ""Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant."" Another attorney for the Rice family has said the city's response to the lawsuit last week was indicative of well-documented problems within the Cleveland Police Department. ""The Rice family maintains that Tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by Cleveland police officers,"" Rice family co-counsel Walter Madison said in a statement.  ""Their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the Cleveland Police Department. The Rice family's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Tamir Rice's mother: ""They never even gave him a chance""

"(CNN)After spending much of her 2008 campaign seemingly running away from the fact that she is a woman, Hillary Clinton is showing signs that 2016 is going to be a different story. It seems that Hillary has found her outer woman, which is to say, she's found the person that she wants to present on the campaign trail, and that person is resolutely female. This time she seems to have decided to fully embrace her womanhood as an asset in her quest for the White House and to trust that the voters will do the same. Of course, Hillary hasn't officially announced that she will be running for president -- and Universal Studios has not officially announced that there will be a sequel to the blockbuster ""50 Shades of Grey."" But it's hard to imagine 2016 happening without both of those things, seeing as how they both have such excellent prospects of success. Hillary recently spoke at a Silicon Valley conference for women in the tech field with the theme of ""Lead On."" That lent itself nicely to the professional goals of the members of the audience as well as to Hillary's own leadership goals. She spoke of the dearth of women not only in the tech field, but in the ranks of Fortune 500 CEO's. In fact, one recent diversity study found that the major S&P 1500 company boards had more men with the name John, Robert, William, or James on them than women of any name combined. Left unsaid in her speech was any reference to the complete lack of a female occupant of the Oval Office thus far, but the thought could not have been far from anyone's mind, let alone Hillary's. Clinton was comfortable talking at length about her own experiences being pregnant and giving birth while working as a partner in a law firm, and using that as a launching pad to discuss the importance of women in the workforce both here and around the world. And from there she highlighted her own work on behalf of the women of the world as secretary of state. She segued into the discussion of the plight of working middle-class families that will be so central to the 2016 race, and the centrality of women's economic issues to those struggles of the middle-class. From there it was a natural progression to talking about 21st century families and the importance of things such as paid leave. And all of that dovetailed perfectly into closing remarks about the future that revolved naturally around the birth in September of Clinton's first grandchild, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. That brought up Hillary's new role as a grandmother, and the perspective it has given her on the future and what needs to be done to guarantee that it's the best possible future. The Silicon Valley address could serve as a template for how Clinton intends to approach her career goals from the vantage point of being a woman seeking her own place in the workforce. In the coming weeks, which serendipitously happen to be part of Women's History Month, Hillary's speaking schedule is heavy with events and gatherings that center around women. If she's not running for president, then she could be gearing up to get a talk show on the Lifetime network. All of which stands in stark contrast to Hillary's last presidential campaign. In 2008, she seemed to think that she had to reassure voters that a woman could be president, primarily by not accentuating the fact that she was a woman. This time around, there seems to be a shared assumption that, of course, a woman would make an excellent president, in part simply by virtue of being a woman. In that previous campaign, Hillary ran as the most experienced candidate, primarily to draw a distinction between herself and her relatively less experienced challenger, Barack Obama. But now, almost eight years later, Clinton can let her experience speak for itself. She has more of it -- almost too much, from one perspective: She'll be 69 by the time the 2016 election takes place. So this time instead of highlighting her experience, she's highlighting the experiences she has in common with the women, mothers and grandmothers out there. Of course, Hillary's message will have to resonate beyond female voters. Fortunately, the dynamics of the 21st century economy and the place of the family within it lend themselves to a family-friendly feminism. We live in a society where women are necessary breadwinners whose income is counted upon for families to make it. Gender pay equality and supportive work environments benefit spouses, children, extended families and entire communities. Today, feminism, family and economic issues intertwine like never before. Hillary's stressing of the importance of women's workplace issues both to the family and to the struggles of the middle-class puts the Republicans on the defensive as they try to co-opt middle-class economic issues. Potential GOP presidential candidates are already trying to position themselves to steal the thunder of the Democratic nominee when it comes to issues of wage inequality and middle-class stagnation. But how exactly do they propose to reinvigorate a middle-class that is overwhelmingly composed of families with two wage-earners if they don't fight for women's workplace issues? For instance, child care may be thought of as a woman's issue, but it's really a family issue, virtually by definition, and an economic issue on top of that. Among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women's issues such as family planning, access to birth control and the right to choose, Hillary has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear, based on her life experiences as a woman. It's the Republicans with extremist views on these issues who have to dance around their real beliefs and avoid making outrageous and absurd statements such as embarrassing pronouncements about rape and pregnancy. If Hillary seems more comfortable running as a woman, it's partly because society at large seems more comfortable with a populist-tinged feminism than it was in 2008. Patricia Arquette's Oscar night speech in support of equal pay for women -- although predictably dismissed by right-wing media such as Fox News -- was enthusiastically received by the public in general. In fact, far from being thought radical, Arquette's statements backstage were thoroughly deconstructed by the left for not being progressively correct enough. Women have been steadily making strides in the years since Hillary's 2008 campaign, and as they did, they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender. Hillary is now wisely embracing her gender as a way of capturing the same ""hope and change"" historical quality of Obama's presidency. Voters always want change, and Hillary Clinton has been a constant on the political stage for decades now. She's certainly no stranger to Washington, or to the West Wing of the White House. But electing her president would still represent massive change on a fundamental level. Hillary Clinton wants 2016 to be the Year of the Woman. And she wants to be The Woman.","Donna Brazile: In 2008, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized gender and ran on her experience .
Now Clinton is positioning her potential campaign to focus on history-making election of a woman president ."
"(CNN)Rafael Nadal lifted his first trophy since last year's French Open and closed in on a long-standing ATP Tour record Sunday by claiming the Argentina Open crown. Argentina legend Guillermo Vilas leads the way with 49 wins in clay-court tournaments, but today's ""King of Clay"" drew nearer to the leading mark by winning his 46th title in Buenos Aires. He also claimed his 65th title from 93 tour-level finals, breaking out of a tie with legends Pete Sampras and Bjorn Borg for fifth place in the all-time list. Nadal has been hampered by injury and illness since his Roland Garros triumph last June and lost out to Fabio Fognini in the semifinals of the Rio Open last week. It was a dispiriting defeat -- his first in a clay-court semifinal for 12 years -- but, moving from Brazil to Argentina, the Spaniard was largely untroubled in reaching the final and duly swept aside home player Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in the Estadio Billoch Caride. Nadal was playing in the first event for the first time in 10 years and his victory is a morale-booster after going out early in Qatar and exiting the Australian Open ahead of his clay-court swing in South America. The 28-year-old from Mallorca took his career record against Monaco, who was playing his 20th career final, to 6-1 and was never seriously troubled in the title match. The only thing to delay him was multiple rain delays which had the players scurrying on and off the court. A single break of service gave him the opener but he pulled clear immediately in the second and three further breaks saw him wrap up victory in just short of an hour and a half of action. Nadal is the seventh successive Spanish winner of the ATP 250 event, and it is a boost for his preparations for his challenge for a remarkable 10th French Open title in May.","Rafael Nadal wins ATP tournament in Buenos Aires .

"(CNN)I think back to 56 years ago: What if? If my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in America, there would be one fewer public administrator, one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family. Had so many young people not given their youth, their energy, their strength and their love for this country, the America we know would not exist. I owe the America I know to my father and the many men that toiled long ago in the fields of our past. I owe my success to my father Herminio, mother Juanita and countless others that dreamed of a better tomorrow. They dreamed of a better tomorrow never knowing if they would reap the slightest of benefits from their hard work. Today I stand as a testimony to that dream. As a teenager, my father left his life of poverty in Mexico for the promise of a new life in the United States in 1959. The hard, physical work of picking crops in the fields of California, Arizona and Texas, earned him less than a dollar a day, once room and board was subtracted. The Braceros program granted him a work visa and when he finished the program, he began his path to citizenship. My father did not complete any formal education past fourth grade. In that era in Mexico, you had to pay for school past a certain grade and my father's family couldn't afford it. He was limited to menial work and low wages. Unlike my father, I wasn't born into a life destined for backbreaking labor. My dad brought us into a world with endless possibilities. The sky was truly the limit and for the first time in his life, my father had hope -- for us. Our upbringing was humble, but my parents provided for all 12 of us children. They taught each and every one of us the importance of education. Our childhood was filled with the joys of love, laughter and belief in God. My father created paradise in a modest, two-bedroom home in the inner city of San Antonio, Texas. Our eggs came fresh every morning from the miniature chickens we raised. We were raised to live off the land, just like our father did as a younger man. We had a goat, a turkey, a potbelly pig, ducks, geese and chickens. Many of my fondest memories were of feeding and tending to our animals. One would assume that we lived on a farm. But balancing a life of dual identities was not an easy feat for either my siblings or me. I recall having to wake up early on Sunday mornings to feed the chickens and collect the eggs, while my friends were going to the zoo, water park or the mall. When Mondays came around, I dreaded talking about what I did that weekend. I didn't want to be judged, so I always made something up. The frustration of not being able to fit in gave way when I started getting positive feedback at school. I was outperforming my peers in English and writing, and I was finally getting recognition by my teachers and classmates. I felt that I finally was doing something like everyone else. I excelled at school. I decided to take a chance and apply for college. I started at the University of Texas at San Antonio in fall 2002 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English and a Master's in public administration. I was the first in my family to get a college degree -- I'm the seventh out of 12 children. All of my siblings after me went to college and today we have a public administrator, a teacher and a medical school student in the family. Now, I work in an urban school district as a site coordinator for the federal initiative Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. The program sets out to make a college education a reality for underrepresented students and communities experiencing high poverty. I work to remove those barriers so that every one of my students has a chance at a life like the one that was given to me by my parents. I have given myself to a life of service. I am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of. I am the dream. I am an American. And I am the proud son of an immigrant.

"(CNN)""There's a baby. There's a baby."" The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. The 18-month-old girl hangs upside down after her mother's car crashed and flipped into a frigid Utah river some 14 hours earlier. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life. The car landed on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. From the murky waters, the rescuer hands baby Lily to a police officer. He dashes up the rocky banks of the Spanish Fork, pressing the infant close to his chest for warmth. ""Got it,"" the officer is heard saying. Lily is freezing. ""Come on, baby,"" he says. ""She's definitely hypothermic."" In the ambulance, the officer pats little Lily on the back in an attempt to get her breathing. Lily is on her side. She looks pale, her tiny arm appears stiff. ""Come on, sweetie,"" the officer implores. ""Come on, sweetie."" On the ambulance to a hospital, rescuers perform CPR. They try to warm her. ""We're almost there,"" one rescuer is heard to say. ""Are you getting a pulse?"" ""I can't feel anything,"" says another. At the hospital, as Lily is rushed into the emergency room, she vomits. ""We've been doing CPR on her,"" the officer tells emergency room personnel. ""She's been throwing up a little bit."" Those moments captured by the body cam video -- which first aired on CNN affiliate KSL -- were crucial. ""If anything had been different, she might not have made it,"" emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. In the ER, Lily opened her eyes as CPR was performed to get her heart pumping, Royall said. Another important factor was a car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age, and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside-down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but even more dangerous if the baby had gotten wet. ""She seems to be doing great,"" said Officer Jason Howard of the Spanish Fork Police Department. ""We were able to get together with her and her family. She was happy and smiling. Seemed to be a normal and happy, healthy baby."" Howard said the toddler temporarily was staying with an aunt and uncle. Her father, Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. ""(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home."" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. ""She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,"" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: ""I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that."" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. ""I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,"" said Trafny.

"(CNN)Waiting for Benjamin Netanyahu to arrive at Ben Gurion Airport, there was a whole Winston Churchill aspect to it all. Many Israeli analysts believe Netanyahu sees his speech to Congress warning of the dangers of a nuclear Iran akin to that of the late British Prime Minister's famous address to parliament in 1939 warning of the pending danger of Nazi Germany. Indeed on the tarmac, Netanyahu, with his wife, Sara, at his side, somberly declared his visit to Washington a ""crucial"" and ""historic"" trip and himself the ""messenger"" of all the Israeli people, even those who don't agree with him. ""I fear for the fate of the State of Israel and therefore I will do everything I can to ensure the security of our future,"" he told reporters before boarding. 6 questions about Netanyahu's trip . In the days leading up to the trip, Netanyahu laid the symbolism for embarking on what aides believe he views as his date with destiny, starting with a visit to the grave of his father, who he often says warned him about the dangers of missing threats to the Jewish people before it is too late. On the eve of his trip, he vistied the Western Wall, the holiest site of Judaism. There Netanyahu declared his solemn obligation to protect Israel, saying ""we must unite"" against the nuclear deal shaping up with Iran ""that could endanger our very existence. "" On board the El-Al 767 to Washington, Netanayhu holed himself up with aides working on his speech. A pilot told us he heard the Prime Minister several times yelling from the cabin, ""No, no -- stronger, stronger."" I sat in the back cabin with about 50 journalists -- print reporters, TV correspondents and crews and photographers. I'm told that's about double the number of press who normally travel with him. Obama and Netanyahu: A clash of world views . With 12 hours to kill, the journalists chatted about Bibi, the visit and how his planned address to Congress has morphed into an international showdown of mythic proportions. We even found the movies on the plane steeped in symbolism: ""The Imitation Game"" -- an Academy Award-winning story about how a lone genius mathematician defeated all odds to crack Nazi codes and help save Europe from Hitler's grasp. Then there was ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" a tale of a group of oppressed people led by a brave revolutionary who hopes good will triumph over evil. Okay, maybe that""s a stretch. I did say it was a very long flight. Bibi, as he is called, never came back. Officials traveling with him said it was because he was busy with the speech. I never thought I would come to appreciate the access the American diplomatic press corps gets aboard the Secretary of State's plane. A senior official did come back to brief the reporters just before landing, telling us the Prime Minister would be laying out the details he understands to be part of the nuclear deal shaping up with Iran and urge Congress to press the Obama administration to push back the March 24 deadline for a political framework. Netanyahu, the official said, saw the speech as a ""last chance"" to avert a bad deal with Iran, which could threaten Israel's future. We arrived at Andrews Air Force Base to a snowy evening and took the motorcade to Washington. Time will tell if this was indeed a historic flight or a flight of fancy.","Netanyahu worked on his speech while on the way to Washington .

"(CNN)Texas is nearly out of its lethal injection drug. If scheduled executions this Wednesday and the next go forward, the state will have completely exhausted its supply of pentobarbital. ""We're exploring all options,"" said Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, "" including the continued use of pentobarbital or an alternate drug(s) in the lethal injection process."" In recent years, states across the country have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Tennessee has said it will electrocute inmates if it can't get the drugs it needs. Other states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Texas gets its pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which are not subject to Food and Drug Administration oversight, something opponents of the death penalty have decried. The state leads the nation in the numbers of executions. Last year, it put to death 10 people. This year, it has executed three so far.","States have struggled to maintain supply .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Photos published in Cuba's state-run press on Monday show Fidel Castro meeting with five Cuban intelligence agents who served lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Castro reportedly met the agents Saturday at his home in Havana, ending speculation over why the former Cuban President had not yet seen the men, who are referred to as ""the five heroes"" by Cuba's government. The last of the agents returned to Cuba in December following a prisoner swap that also freed U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross, who was jailed in Cuba. The swap coincided with an announcement of a change in U.S. policy toward Cuba. Castro's wife, Dalia Soto del Valle, is also shown, as is his nephew Alejandro Castro Espín, the son of Cuban President Raul Castro and a colonel in Cuba's Interior Ministry. These ""anti-terrorist heroes never did any harm to the United States,"" Fidel Castro wrote in an article published in the daily Communist Party newspaper Granma on Monday, which said he met with them for five hours. ""They tried to prevent and impede terrorist acts against our people."" U.S. officials have said the men were part of a spy ring that monitored the anti-Castro Cuban exile community and military installations in Florida. Castro on Monday though said the men were not spying on U.S. military capabilities, stating that a now-shuttered Russian spy station allowed the Cubans to be aware of any impending U.S. attack on the island. ""That center allowed us to be aware of any object that moved thousands of miles from our country,"" Castro wrote, referring the Lourdes spy base in Cuba, which Russia closed in 2001. The men were arrested in 1998 and charged with carrying out a slew of intelligence gathering activities. Seven other agents agreed to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors, but five of the agents refused to switch sides. The men were lauded as heroes by the Cuban government, which held large demonstrations demanding their release in front of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Agents Rene Gonzalez, 58, and Fernandez Gonzalez, 51, returned to Cuba in 2014 after serving their prison sentences. The remaining three agents -- Gerardo Hernandez, 49; Antonio Guerrero, 56; and Ramon Labañino, 51 -- were transferred to Cuba a part of a prisoner swap after serving 16 years in U.S. prisons. Last month, all five were presented with the Hero of the Republic award, the highest honor presented by the Cuban government. Many Cubans though wondered why the men had not yet met with Fidel Castro, who had championed their cause during his final years as President. In the article published on Monday, Castro said he had not seen the men previously to allow them time with their families and to undergo extensive medical checkups.","Pictures released Monday show Fidel Castro meeting with five Cuban intelligence agents .

"(CNN)Riding the crisp green waves that break into a whirl of foam on Costa Rica's Pacific shore, Rupert Hill looks like he could surf before he could walk. However, for the 37-year-old owner of Surf Simply, a surfing resort in Nosara, the sport was an early love that blossomed later in life. He first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager, but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in London. In the end, the pull of the waves was too strong and Hill decamped to Costa Rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference. ""I wanted to create a really intimate space that was a long way away from the putting the lots of people in the water kind of business model that surf schools often are. I wanted to just have a few people, 12 people each week, and then this area is somewhere where they can completely decompress and just focus on being coached how to surf better,"" he says. A large chunk of the school's training is devoted to theory classes, and Hill also films his students while they're surfing so that he can show them what aspects of their technique they need to improve: ""The first time you see yourself surfing, it's kind of mortifying. It's a little bit like hearing yourself sing for the first time. But, like most sports, it's the best coaching tool we have,"" he says. Hill's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though, as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo. While following his passion for surfing was important, Hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant. ""The business side of it has to work, the numbers have to make sense. Otherwise, what you've got is a brilliant hobby that's not a business,"" he says. Hill says that, while he feels fortunate that his work fulfills him, it still involves ordinary tasks that can sometimes be mundane. ""I don't think anyone is going to find a job that they love all the time, but if you can find something that you love most of the time, you're luckier than most people in the world.""","Ru Hill trained in fine art in London .

"(CNN)Its famous Yellow Wall -- the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe, with a capacity of 25,000 -- has helped enable German football club Borussia Dortmund achieve the rare feat of transcending the relationship between a club and its fans. So special is this club that 3,000 of its own supporters dipped into their pockets as part of a crowdfunding exercise, started in 2013, to help finance a new documentary based on one of Dortmund's founding fathers. These Dortmund fans, along with sponsors, raised €250,000 ($265,000) in the process -- the biggest sum at the time ever raised for a film through crowdfunding in Germany. ""This fan-club relationship is a legacy from our fathers, who made it clear that we have to engage and we have to fight for our club. It's part of our story,"" Marc Mauricius Quambusch, one of the film's three creators, told CNN. One of those fathers, and seen as the most important, was Franz Jacobi, who in 1909 along with 17 others helped found the club -- and it is ""Am Borsigplatz geboren: Franz Jacobi und die Wiege des BVB"" (""Born at the Borsigsquare: Franz Jacobi and the cradle of BVB"") that tells his story. Founding fathers . Mention Dortmund and images are conjured up of back-to-back German Bundesliga title wins in 2011 and 2012, the Champions League triumph of 1997 or how it became the first German side to win a European competition with the Cup Winners' Cup in 1966. Without 21-year-old Jacobi and his disciples, however, none of that success may have ever materialized. For it was those brave 18 that gathered inside a pub called Wildschutz just off Dortmund's Borsigplatz, with the aim of establishing their own football club in response to the Catholic Holy Trinity chaplain Hubert Dewald's refusal to allow his youth group members the chance to kick a ball around. Jacobi and co. managed to resist Dewald's overtures and so ""Ball Spiel Verein Borussia"" (""Ball Games Club Borussia"") was born. ""When we started making the film I was aware of our story but not so deeply,"" Dortmund fan Quambusch says of a film inspired by a similar crowdfunding project dreamed up by Fortuna Dusseldorf supporters in 2012. ""It's so interesting -- one so deep and with so much drama."" ""It's also a love story, it has everything you need,"" Quambusch adds, referring to Jacobi having originally dragged his friends to the city as he was in love with the pub owner's daughter, who he would later go on to marry. ""If you were to try to write something, it would be exactly the same story as this."" A legacy . Jacobi's DNA today still runs through the club that he helped to establish. Dortmund president from 1910 to 1923, Jacobi laid the foundations of a club which prides itself on harboring a real sense of involvement and belonging for its supporters. Permitted to stay at home in Germany during World War I as he was the oldest son of the family and his father had died, Jacobi wrote postcards to those club members who were away fighting, while also helping to take care of their wives and children. Heinrich Unger, Dortmund's maiden president and Jacobi's best friend, was one of those fighting, and he would go on to write what turned out to be the club's first ever song during his time in the trenches -- part of that song is still included in one of Dortmund's official anthems, ""Wir Halten Fest Und Treu Zusammen"" (""We are standing together""). ""This was the beginning of the so-called 'Borussia Family,' where it was more than a club,"" Quambusch says, recalling a term used by Jacobi. ""We have always been democratic and I think he always wanted the club members to have rights and votes, and to engage. I think Jacobi would be proud of the club today."" The Borussia Family . Jacobi's ""Borussia Family"" is not a term used officially by the club and its supporters now, but its meaning continues to resonate. With Dortmund dangerously close to bankruptcy just a decade ago, fans came together to do all they could for their club, while as well as donating to fund the new film, supporters also contributed old photographs to help shed light on Jacobi's story. ""I thought it was a great idea to make the film by our own people so I donated,"" Dortmund fan Jorn Pansch, who also donated for his mother and brother, tells CNN. ""We've had so many more new members in recent years and it's great to bring them our history because what is the future without the past? ""The film remembers many, many people, where we came from, which way we've grown up -- it made me proud to be a part of it and it shows fans and supporters stand behind the club."" This relationship is no one-way street, though, with Dortmund in response offering up €50,000 ($53,000) towards the project, while providing it with valuable exposure via its social-network sites. All the money raised from the film will go into social projects in Dortmund -- historically an industrial and working-class area -- where the club was founded. ""Today's fan engagement has partly come about from all those years ago with Jacobi, but also because Borussia is located in a city that is very emotional when it comes to football,"" Quambusch says. ""Borussia has always had fans that have traveled for the club and tried to struggle with the club officials and are engaged. It's a typical Dortmund thing."" ESPN FC German correspondent and Dortmund fan Stephan Uersfeld adds: ""The core of the fans are very close still and the club as well is close to the fans. ""Everyone still has the feeling they can do stuff and actually change things at the club."" 'Struggle to survive' Boasting the highest average attendance in the world, as well as the Yellow Wall, there are not many more awe-inspiring sights in football than the Westfalenstadion when Dortmund fans are in full voice. In an age when one bad performance from the likes of Barcelona or Real Madrid can bring with it a chorus of boos from its supporters, Dortmund fans have stood by their team for the most part this season, despite relegation from the Bundesliga having threatened a club that was German champion in 2012. ""We always need to struggle to survive in different periods, and I think maybe that's a legacy from Jacobi's time,"" Quambusch says of a club that was relegated in 1972 and narrowly escaped the same fate in 1986. ""The ups and downs make the club more exciting, and there have been so many extreme emotions in every direction. ""I think it makes the good things much more enjoyable and wonderful because if you always win and are always top of the table it becomes boring. ""When you are a Dortmund supporter you never know what you are going to get."" Pride . That sentiment most likely applied to Jacobi himself, whose body today lies buried in Dortmund following the club's decision to move it into the area after originally being located 300 kilometers away in Salzgitter. Fifty-seven years after helping to form ""Ball Spiel Verein Borussia,"" Jacobi found himself in Glasgow, having put aside his fear of flying aged 78 to watch his team beat Liverpool in the 1966 European Cup Winners' Cup final. ""That was a very special moment for him -- he said it was a big moment for him and he was really proud,"" Quambusch says of Jacobi, who died 13 years later at the age of 90. ""If you're planning a club 57 years ago, and 57 years later you are top of Europe and you are the first European cup winner in Germany, that must be a fantastic moment.""

"(CNN)All of these women left a mark on the world that would change people's thinking for decades -- in some cases centuries -- to come. They wrote books that revolutionized people's view of society; made scientific discoveries that transformed medicine as we know it; and brought about laws that shook up the establishment. In celebration of International Women's Day on March 8, Leading Women takes a look at just seven of the many females throughout history who changed the world for the betterment of all. The American author's best-selling 1852 novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" helped popularize the anti-slavery movement. Legend has it Abraham Lincoln greeted Beecher Stowe at the White House by saying: ""So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war,"" in reference to the civil war. Her novel followed the life of black slave Uncle Tom, and was the second best-selling book of the 19th century after the Bible. British suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a group known for extreme forms of protest such as chaining themselves to railings and going on hunger strikes. ""We are here, not because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers,"" she said during a court trail in 1908. Sadly Pankhurst never lived to see her dream become reality, dying three weeks before a law was passed giving women equal voting rights with men. ""What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again"" -- Anne Frank's ""Diary of a Young Girl."" The wisdom and wit of 13-year-old Jewish schoolgirl Anne Frank, written while hiding in Amsterdam during the Second World War, is one of the most widely-read books in the world with over 30 million copies sold. Her story of life under German occupation is a powerful record that has been translated into 67 languages and adapted for both film and theater, with her home itself turned into a museum. Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, just weeks before it was liberated. French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 book ""The Second Sex"" became a landmark feminist work. It analyzed the treatment and perception of women throughout history, and was deemed so controversial that the Vatican put in on the Index of Prohibited books. ""All oppression creates a state of war; this is no exception,"" said De Beauvoir, who along with partner Jean Paul Sartre was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. British chemist and x-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin's research was key in revealing the structure of DNA. Her x-ray photographs of the double helix were used by scientists Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins, who in 1962 were jointly awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the DNA model. However Franklin missed out on a Nobel Prize herself, dying from ovarian cancer in 1958 at 37. American Billie Jean King was one of the greatest competitors Wimbledon had ever seen, taking home a whopping 20 titles. But she is perhaps best known for a one-off match dubbed ""The Battle of Sexes"" against Bobby Riggs in 1973. The bespectacled 29-year-old King beat 55-year-old Riggs in front of a worldwide television audience of 50 million. She later went on to form the Women's Tennis Association and has campaigned for equal prize money for female players. ""When we plant trees, we plant the seeds of peace and hope,"" said 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winning environmentalist Wangari Maathai. The Kenyan political activist founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977 in an effort to empower rural women who had started reporting their streams were drying up, their food supply was less secure, and they had to walk further than ever before for firewood. The movement has since spread across the world, campaigning on climate change and teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme.

"(CNN)Adi Shankar had the idea for ""Power/Rangers"" when he was 7 years old. ""This was before the Internet, and my access to TV and video games was pretty limited,"" the producer recalled Thursday, in the midst of the ""Power/Rangers"" frenzy. ""So all you really had was (to) tell people stories. So I'd tell people 'Captain Planet' stories, and then I started telling them these dark 'Power Ranger' stories. ""And I got into trouble,"" he added. ""Because the parents were like, 'This guy, he's ruining our children!' "" That was more than 20 years ago for Shankar. But the producer, now 30, got his wish when his dark version of the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" directed by friend Joseph Kahn, made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on YouTube in less than two days. Fans buzzing over bloody 'Power/Rangers' 'bootleg' In some ways, Shankar is still getting into trouble. Not only did the video explode the Power Rangers mythology, showing the impact of serving as ""child soldiers,"" in Shankar's phrase, but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise, Saban Entertainment, claimed infringement. First it was taken down from Vimeo and then YouTube. However, it was reposted in both places late Friday after lawyers reached agreement, Deadline reported. Among the additions: a disclaimer from Shankar that his ""bootleg"" is ""my take on the FAN FILM. Not a pilot, not a series, not for profit, strictly for exhibition. This is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by Saban Entertainment or Lionsgate nor is it selling any product. I claim no rights to any of the characters (don't send me any money, not kickstarted, this film is free)."" Saban Entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular '90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016. 'An interesting experiment' So who are these guys, anyway? Kahn is a famed music video director, probably best known for Britney Spears' ""Toxic,"" Eminem's ""Without Me"" (for which he won a Grammy) and Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space."" He's also handled a number of commercials and the films ""Detention"" and ""Torque."" Shankar is a producer of such films as ""The Grey,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" and ""Dredd."" This isn't the first time he's made a ""bootleg"" short. Previous videos have included one featuring Marvel's Punisher character and one drawing from Marvel's Venom character. In a Reddit AMA, Kahn said that ""Power/Rangers"" was ""self-funded."" A special effects house, Ingenuity Engine, ""worked six months on this and took a bath financially,"" he added. Shankar declined to give a budget for ""Power/Rangers,"" which was shot over a few days last year, but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals' money. ""It was all favors,"" he says, noting that star James Van Der Beek ""is one of my best friends."" The film also starred ""Battlestar Galactica's"" Katee Sackhoff. Both Shankar and Kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches. Kahn said he was drawn to ""Power/Rangers"" because ""it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control. ... I didn't come into it to please a fan base, per se, but to experiment with pop culture."" And Shankar? Even his look tries to upset stereotypes. In the video he made to explain ""Power/Rangers,"" he's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s Alice Cooper, a look he adopted ""because I don't want to be (an Indian) stereotype,"" he told CNN. 'Kind of a war brewing' Shankar comes by his outlook honestly. The Indian-born producer had an itinerant childhood thanks to his father's job, traveling frequently -- various Indian cities, China, Singapore -- before moving on to the next place. He came to the United States at 16. He says he thinks of his childhood as ""jarring,"" with the only constants comic books, movies and television. ""Just moving around so much, literally every two years,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like I had a friend until I was 18. If you're moving to a different school, let alone a different country every couple years, it's kind of jarring as a kid. There was no consistency for me in a cultural context"" except for American movies and pop culture. He attended school at Northwestern University in Chicago, where he founded a successful ad agency, and then moved to Hollywood, which he describes as ""a dream of mine."" Though both men were successful before, ""Power/Rangers"" has given them new visibility -- partly thanks to the bottom-up enthusiasm for the project. Both filmmakers wax philosophical about the impact. ""Internet changes things,"" Kahn tweeted after congratulating supporters. ""New world, new rules."" Shankar observes that ""Power/Rangers"" is just another marker in a continuing debate between creativity, intellectual property and fan-driven culture. ""There's kind of a war brewing between the old world and the new world,"" he said. ""The Internet has kind of been a nuclear warhead on a lot of businesses and a lot of industries. ... It's kind of bizarre to be thrown in the middle of it. I'm literally just a fan making a fan video."" It's not about dollars and cents, he added: ""Is that what we're about? We're one massive consumerist mosh pit?"" In the meantime, he's got plenty of other projects cooking, including a crime thriller set in a world of both puppets and humans that's like ""a really dark, violent 'Muppet Movie.' "" It all comes down to the same impulse that drove him to tell stories when he was 7, he says. ""I'm just a creative dude,"" he said.","""Power/Rangers"" became an Internet craze last week .
Its producer and director like to subvert pop culture ideas .
The film was a legal football for a time, highlighting creativity and financial issues ."
"(CNN)The Chinese government has declared the Internet to be the new battlefield in its fight against ""pornography and unlawful information."" The chilling reality is that the main casualty of this cyberwar is freedom of expression. China's Internet model is one of extreme control. The authorities use an army of censors to stifle dissent. In January, the Orwellian ""State Internet Information Office"" announced it had shut down scores of websites and more than 100 social media accounts for ""distorting history of the Communist Party and the nation."" Under the guise of a campaign to ensure social stability, the Chinese authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues. Dozens of phrases are censored on social media including any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or the recent Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter remain blocked. While the new battlefield is virtual, the impact on people's lives is real and devastating. Since President Xi Jinping came to power, hundreds of people have been detained solely for expressing their peaceful views online. It is women's rights activists, anti-corruption and environmental campaigners, and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors. Su Changlan was detained by police in October 2014. Her apparent ""crime"" was to have posted comments online in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. She faces charges of ""inciting subversion of state power,"" and a potential sentence of life imprisonment. Liu Ping, a 45-year-old mother and grassroots activist, languishes in jail right now. Last June, she was sentenced to six years in prison on the charge of ""picking quarrels and provoking troubles"" for publicly calling on the Chinese government to step up the fight against corruption. Liu Ping's online posts of photos of her holding banners calling for transparency, and transcripts of Skype chats with foreign media, were used to condemn her at her trial. The paradox is that President Xi has made great mileage out of his own anti-corruption drive. The persecution of Liu Ping, and many others that raise these issues only underlines the hypocrisy of the current leadership. This online attack is part of the worst crackdown against freedom of expression in China in more than a decade. Under President Xi, it is an assault on all fronts: in academia, in the media, civil society and online. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Central University for Nationalities in Beijing and the founder of the ""Uyghur Online"" website was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014 on charges of ""separatism."" The charge was based on his online articles, university lectures and interviews with foreign media. He worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and often criticized government policies that promoted discrimination. I have not seen evidence that his words did otherwise. The Chinese authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices, yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action. Far from relenting, the government is introducing a swath of regressive legislation and regulations in a further assault against online privacy and freedom of expression. A new, vaguely worded draft anti-terror law lacks sufficient safeguards and gives the authorities virtually a free rein to collect information on individuals' online activities. All Internet and telecommunication service providers operating in China would be required to give the government backdoor access to their systems and details about the encryption used. Yes, the government has a responsibility to ensure national security and to combat serious crime, but such measures must be targeted and proportionate to the threat. Internet companies doing business in China must also take all possible efforts to avoid contributing to human rights abuses. At the international level the Chinese government looks to legitimize its actions. China's charismatic ""Internet Czar,"" Lu Wei,  extolls the concept of ""internet sovereignty"" and promotes it as an acceptable global model. This initiative must not go unchallenged. Internet sovereignty in China equals censorship and persecution; a web to trap thousands of individuals peacefully expressing different views online. While the immediate outlook is bleak, there is hope. The Internet has proved invaluable to the development of human rights -- revolutionizing access to information and improving transparency and accountability. For every online critic the Chinese authorities imprison, there are scores more prepared to speak out despite the risks. It is with these courageous individuals that those of us who value online freedom must stand united. The battle to promote Internet sovereignty and silence all critical voices is one the Chinese authorities must not be allowed to win. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author .","China's Internet model is one of extreme control, says Amnesty's East Asia director .

"(CNN)For the uninitiated, skydiving can be scary enough: leaping out of a plane, free-falling at 120 miles per hour, keeping your presence of mind as you pull the cord on your parachute. Now imagine having a seizure and losing consciousness more than 9,000 feet above the earth. That's what happened to Christopher Jones, 22, of Perth, Australia. His experience was captured on a video that has more than 4.4 million views on YouTube. ""Halfway through the skydive, he had a seizure and rolled onto his back,"" WA Skydiving Academy business manager and chief instructor Robin O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Instructor Sheldon McFarlane, who was wearing a helmet camera, struggled to catch up with Jones. McFarlane finally managed to grab Jones at about 4,000 feet and pull the rip cord. Jones regained consciousness and landed uneventfully, O'Neill said. McFarlane told the ABC he wasn't concerned. Thanks to two ""AADs"" -- automatic activation devices -- Jones' parachute was going to automatically deploy, he said. Nevertheless, the instructor wanted to make sure the situation was completely under control. ""At no time was I worried he was going to hit the ground without a parachute, but given the circumstances and where we were I thought it would be better to get him under parachute earlier than later,"" McFarlane said. ""I managed to catch him on my second attempt and deploy his parachute."" Jones, who described the incident on YouTube as ""possibly the scariest moment of my life,"" told the ABC that skydiving was a substitute for his dream of becoming a pilot. He had been cleared by his doctor to jump. ""I've always wanted to have the feeling of flight, so I just thought, considering I can't fly a plane due to my condition, I thought I'd give it a go,"" he said. Jones told the ABC that he'd been seizure-free for four years but was not intending to pursue a skydiving career.","Man has seizure at 9,000 feet while skydiving, becomes unconscious .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)For almost a week, avalanches caused by heavy snowstorms have killed 196 people in the mountainous province of Panjshir, Afghanistan, officials said on Monday. Ten new avalanches were reported early Monday morning, without any casualties. Over the weekend, a total of 40 avalanches hit the area, said Bab Jan Hakimi, head of disaster response at the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Rescue operations and emergency assistance by air and ground are still ongoing, Hakimi said. However, authorities fear the toll will grow much higher since rescue personnel have yet to reach the worst affected areas. President Ashraf Ghani, who visited the area on Saturday, declared three days of mourning in Afghanistan for the victims. Panjshir is a small, mountainous province north of the capital, Kabul. Its residents are generally poor, earning their living as farmers, shepherds or operators of small businesses such as groceries. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, Afghanistan and journalist Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.","Authorities fear the toll from deadly avalanche will grow higher .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)Bangladesh authorities say they have arrested the prime suspect in the murder of American blogger Avijit Roy who was hacked to death on a Dhaka street last week. The person, Farabi Shafiur Rahman, had called for Avijit Roy's death in numerous Facebook posts, according to Roy's parents. And within minutes after the Thursday attack, Rahman posted photos of the crime scene, said Col. Ziaul Ahsan of Bangladesh's elite anti-crime unit, the Rapid Action Battalion. In a Facebook comment last year, Rahman allegedly wrote, ""Avijit Roy lives in America. So it's not possible to kill him now. But when he returns home, he will be killed then."" In an earlier post, the same person wrote, ""It's a Bengali Muslims holy duty to kill Avijit."" Extremists resented Roy for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog. They threatened to kill him if he came home from the United States to visit. As usual, Roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban Atlanta for Dhaka, where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled ""The Virus of Faith."" He has written seven books in all. Roy was killed Thursday as he walked back from a book fair with his wife. Assailants plunged machetes and knives into Roy and his wife, killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger. Witnesses said no one came to the couple's aid as they were hacked down. Rahman, the man in custody, also allegedly posted threats against the owner of the online bookstore, Rokomari.com, forcing it to stop selling Roy's books. And last year, he was detained -- then released -- for comments he allegedly made in support of the death of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider. Like Roy, Haider too was hacked to death. He too had written critically about religion on his blog. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Lonzo Cook, Greg Botelho, Farid Ahmed and John Couwels contributed to this report.","Police say the suspect posted photos of the crime scene .

"(CNN)In Washington's polarized political environment, support for Israel has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress on Tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67-year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since President Harry Truman became the first head of state to recognize Israel. Netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about Iran's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations. Israel will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to Washington. Netanyahu is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign. He has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living, an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited. Netanyahu has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue: Iran. A major televised address in Washington concerning Iran's threat, interrupted only by standing ovations from American lawmakers, has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas, reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals' inexperience -- in foreign affairs. Yet Netanyahu's speech, while possibly giving him a short-term boost at home, will harm Jerusalem's relations with Washington, not Iran's nuclear program. Speaker John Boehner's late-January invitation to Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress was coordinated with neither the White House nor the State Department. It was, in essence, a political ploy aimed at undermining President Obama as he strives to reach a historic deal over Iran's nuclear program. In defiance of the Obama administration, and rejecting advice from leading figures in Israel and key supporters of Israel in the United States, Netanyahu accepted the invitation. By antagonizing the White House, Boehner and Netanyahu have put Democratic members of Congress in a bind, forcing them to choose between two unenviable options: either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally, but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to Obama by snubbing the leader of a major U.S. ally. Two senior Senate Democrats with sterling pro-Israel credentials, Richard Durbin and Dianne Feinstein, tried to diffuse this latest crisis between Washington and Jerusalem by offering to meet with the Israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by Netanyahu. Feinstein had previously noted that an invitation to address Congress during the Israeli election period was ""highly inappropriate."" In politicizing his visit to Washington, Netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with Obama to spill over into his government's increasingly complicated relationship with the Democratic Party. Netanyahu no doubt believes that Obama is misguided about the pending deal with Iran. Indeed, there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program. Less than two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons. Yet Netanyahu's move is counterproductive. Democrats on Capitol Hill who were inclined to support additional sanctions on Iran now feel compelled to back the president. In a rare move, five former Israeli ambassadors have publicly called on Netanyahu to cancel his speech. Former Mossad chief Meir Dagan has accused Netanyahu of having caused Israel ""heavy strategic damage on the Iranian issue"" by antagonizing the administration. Netanyahu's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon. He has never hid his preference for the Republican Party. During his first term in office, Netanyahu irked President Bill Clinton by meeting with the Rev. Jerry Falwell, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other detractors of the President a day before coming to the White House. A key Netanyahu supporter is U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a major Republican donor who also owns the pro-Netanyahu newspaper Israel Hayom. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Adelson poured millions into Republican challenger Mitt Romney's coffers, saying he was willing to spend $100 million to defeat Obama. That July, Netanyahu's senior adviser, Ron Dermer, helped orchestrate Romney's visit to Israel in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of Obama's rival. Dermer, a former U.S. citizen who once worked for Republican pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz, is Israel's current ambassador to the United States. It is Dermer who coordinated the invitation to Netanyahu with Boehner but never mentioned the invitation to Secretary of State John Kerry when they met a day before Boehner's announcement. This time, Netanyahu may have gone too far. National Security Adviser Susan Rice did not mince words when she called Netanyahu's latest move ""destructive to the fabric of the relationship""  between the United States and Israel. Although the U.S.-Israel relationship is strong and resilient, rooted in common values and shared interests, Netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics.","Ziv: By injecting himself into U.S. politics, the Israeli prime minister puts at risk a 67-year relationship between two countries .

"(CNN)For the second time, a Georgia woman's execution has been postponed -- this time because of concerns about the drugs to be used. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday. ""Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,"" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. ""Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed."" The 47-year-old was originally scheduled to die on Wednesday, but that execution was called off because of winter weather. A petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree while in prison, had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. Organizers plan to deliver it to Gov. Nathan Deal, though in Georgia, the governor has no authority to grant clemency. Gissendaner has become a ""powerful voice for good,"" the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband's death in 1997. ""While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,"" the petition states. ""Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce."" On Sunday night, about 200 people attended a vigil at Emory University's Cannon Chapel, where they sang her praises. ""Killing her is not going to bring anything back. It's not going to undo what's been done,"" priest Kelly Zappa told CNN affiliate WSB. The pleas did not sway Georgia's high court or its board of pardons. In a 5-2 decision Monday afternoon, the state Supreme Court denied her request for a stay, and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate. And the State Board of Pardons and Paroles said Monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands. Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder and pardoned decades later, has Georgia executed a woman. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before Gissendaner's execution was first postponed. Just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson last Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced it had postponed the execution until Monday at 7 p.m. ""due to weather and associated scheduling issues,"" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. Gissendaner was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. She was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would ""not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,"" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Kelly Gissendaner and Owen planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife, and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but she did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard that Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records.) She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement last week. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death ""because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted."" Her appeal lawyers also argued that Gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They said her death would cause further hardship for her children. For her last meal, she requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. According to the Death Penalty Information Center: . • Between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders. These sentences constitute about 2% of all death sentences. • Five states -- North Carolina, Florida, California, Ohio and Texas -- account for over half of all such sentences. • As of December 31, 2012, there were 61 women on death row. • Women on death row range in age from 28 to 79. They have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner would be the second woman in the state's history to be executed. The first was Baker, an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white, all-male jury in 1944. She claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will, threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot. Sixty years after her execution, Georgia's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that ""it was a grievous error to deny (her) clemency."" Such pardons are rare, but so are executions of women. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977. CNN's Holly Yan, Tina Burnside, Greg Botelho, Tristan Smith and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","The execution is postponed because the drugs ""appeared cloudy,"" Georgia says .

"(CNN)In 1796, in his final annual address to Congress, President George Washington called for the creation of: . ""...a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your attention to them."" The Military Academy was soon built at West Point. But despite leaving $22,222 for its establishment (a lot of money back then) in his last will and testament, Washington's National University never came to pass. Instead, lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities. Today, the American higher education system is in crisis. The price of college has grown astronomically, forcing students and parents to take out loans that now exceed $1.2 trillion in outstanding debt. Many of those loans are falling into default as graduates struggle to find work. The latest research suggests that our vaunted universities are producing graduates who haven't learned very much. The time has come to revive George Washington's great idea, in 21st century form. Advances in information technology that would have seemed like pure magic in colonial times mean we can now create a 21st Century National University that will help millions of students get a high-quality, low-cost college education — without hiring any professors, building any buildings or costing the taxpayers a dime. To see how, it helps to understand the three ways the federal government currently supports higher education. Two of them are well known. First, the Defense Department, National Institutes of Health, and other federal agencies spend hundreds of billions of dollars financing university-based research, contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs and commercial innovations. Second, the U.S. Department of Education provides $150 billion annually in grants and loans to help students pay for college. As tuitions rise and states continue to slash funding for public universities (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recently proposed $300 million in new cuts), the federal government has become the college financier of last resort. But there is a third essential federal role in higher education that is far less well known. In many ways, it's the most important of them all, and the key to creating a 21st Century National University. In addition to funding colleges, the federal government approves colleges. It does this through a little-understood process called accreditation. To be eligible for those billions of research and financial aid dollars, colleges must be accredited. Technically, accreditors are nonprofit organizations run by consortia of existing colleges. But in order to make a college eligible for federal money, accreditors must first be approved by the federal government. Without that approval and the money that goes along with it, both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop. In other words, Uncle Sam ultimately decides who gets to be an American college and grant college degrees. So, here's the big idea:  In order to build a 21st Century National University, all the federal government has to do is something very simple: Approve itself. In George Washington's days, this would have been only the first step of a process subsequently involving the construction of an actual university. Doing this today would accomplish little in solving the higher education crisis, because physical universities cost billions of dollars to construct from scratch and can still only enroll a handful of the many students who can't afford a good education. Fortunately, there's no need for new buildings — or, for that matter, administrators, libraries, faculty, and all the rest. Existing colleges and universities, flush with federal dollars, have already created all the essential building blocks for National U. Anyone with an Internet connection can log on to Coursera, edX, saylor.org, and many other websites offering high-quality online courses, created by many of the world's greatest universities and taught by tenured professors, for free. Tens of millions of students have already signed up for these courses over the last four years. Yet enrollment in traditional colleges hasn't flagged, and prices have continued to rise. The reason is clear. The free college providers can't (or won't) give online students the one thing they need more than anything else: a college degree. Elite universities like Harvard and Stanford don't want to dilute their exclusive brands. Nonelite universities don't want to give away something they're currently selling for a lot of money. That's where the federal government comes in. With some authorizing language from Congress and a small, one-time start-up budget, the U.S. Department of Education could create a nonprofit, bipartisan organization with only two missions: approving courses and granting degrees. Don't worry, federal bureaucrats won't be in charge of academic matters. Instead, National U. would hire teams of leading scholars to evaluate and approve courses. Some of the decisions shouldn't be difficult. For example, this week, edX is launching a free, nine-week-long online course called ""Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science."" It will be taught by Dr. Eric Grimson, who is the chancellor of the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. John Guttag, who leads the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's Data Driven Medical Research Group. The course materials mirror those taught to some of the smartest students in the world on MIT's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It seems likely that this is a good course. National U., moreover, wouldn't be limited to courses from existing colleges. Any higher education provider, public or private sector, could submit a course for approval. Those that aren't already accredited would pay a fee to cover the cost of evaluation. National U. would also map out which courses students need to take to earn an associate or bachelor's degree. This won't be difficult, since existing colleges have already established a standard set of requirements: a certain number of approved lower- and upper-division courses, plus an approved sequence in an academic major, adding up to 60 or 120 credits. Once students complete the credits, National U. will grant them a degree. While many of the courses will be free, students will bear small costs for taking exams through secure online channels or in-person testing facilities. (Textbooks will be free and open-source). Students will also pay a modest fee of a few hundred dollars for the degree itself, enough to defray the operating costs of National U. Lower-income students will be able to pay for those expenses using the same federal grant and loan programs they currently use to pay tuition at accredited colleges. Since National U. will likely be much cheaper, this will actually save the taxpayers money in the long run. If it all sounds too good to be true, keep in mind that free online courses from the likes of MIT are a very recent phenomenon. Higher education policies just haven't adapted to them — yet. The federal government's higher education approval powers are long-established. Now it just needs to use them on behalf of students, instead of traditional colleges and universities that are charging far too much. George Washington was right all along.","In 1796, Washington called for a national university and even left money behind to fund it .

"Beijing (CNN)If you live in China and haven't watched -- or at least heard about -- ""Under the Dome,"" you must have been living under a rock. The almost two-hour documentary on air pollution in China produced by a famous TV journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release Saturday, clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across Chinese cyberspace. The air pollution that's choking Asia . Here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context: . The slickly produced video shows journalist Chai Jing presenting a comprehensive slide show, intercutting with fast-paced footage of her travels across China and the rest of world, to find answers to three questions: What is smog, where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it? As shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of China regularly, the video has struck such a chord with the audience that, in two short days, it's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world's most populous nation. Many Internet users have compared it to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Chai, 39, was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at China Central Television, the state-run national broadcaster. As a long-time CCTV anchor and investigative reporter, Chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines. Her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her ""the Goddess"" for her elegance and intelligence on air. Plenty of detractors, however, consider her a leading elitist voice for the country's liberal intellectuals. After writing a best-selling autobiography chronicling her time at CCTV, Chai quit her job last year to take care of her daughter, who had been born with a tumor. Declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother, Chai tries to dig deep in her self-funded documentary. With her former CCTV connections opening doors, she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in China -- and received surprisingly candid responses. While there is no obvious hero in the video, the villain seems to be clear. A former chief engineer of the state-owned oil conglomerate Sinopec brushes off Chai's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible. Tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in China to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use, Chai sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters. Admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately. In countless reposts of the video links, people praise Chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses. One text message of gratitude to Chai from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government PR move. They point to the positive coverage of the video's massive online launch across state media, including an in-depth interview with Chai on the website of People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. Also, the timing: The video was released just days ahead of China's annual parliament session, during which legislators are expected to rubber-stamp the Communist leadership's policy agenda. President Xi Jinping had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority. Some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target, as Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector. Others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy. Questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including Chai's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter's tumor. And the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even China's seasoned censors off guard. Heated arguments have raged online, including blaming pollution on China's political system due to its lack of accountability. By late Sunday night, although the video remained online, all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites. With discussions on the video shifting to social media, a common consensus seems to have emerged: Love it or hate it, Chai's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the U.S. embassy as recently as November. Some internet users have compared ""Under the Dome"" phenomena to the discussion over ""the dress""— you can fight over the color but what's important is that it's being talked about.","Two-hour documentary on China's air pollution goes viral .

"(CNN)It's outrage time again. This time it's over a ""Saturday Night Live"" commercial parody that aired over the weekend. The subject (take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked): ISIS. Yes, that barbaric terrorist group was ridiculed in a parody of a Toyota Camry commercial. The original Toyota ad depicted a father driving his daughter to the airport. He then tearfully says goodbye as his daughter heads off to join the U.S. Army. In the ""SNL"" parody, the daughter is played by Dakota Johnson, star of the hugely successful S&M film ""50 Shades of Grey."" (Good to see America has gotten over being offended by the mainstreaming of S&M.) As the parody commercial ends, however, it's revealed that the daughter is not joining the Army, but ISIS. We then see a pickup filled with ISIS fighters drive up as a worried Dad comments to his daughter: ""You be careful, OK?"" Johnson replies reassuringly: ""Dad! It's just ISIS."" The father then turns to an ISIS fighter and says, with emotion, ""Take care of her."" In reply, the militant whispers: ""Death to America."" And ... cue the outrage!! Twitter lit up instantly. Twitter user @ematrudo called NBC and ""SNL"" ""Tasteless Scum!"" And Steve Bucci of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation even went as far as to tweet: ""SNL ISIS skit also draws a moral equivalence between ISIS murderers and the U.S. Military (based on the spoofed commercial), that is wrong."" Some, apparently in the minority if the media coverage is any indication, also praised ""SNL"": . But my favorite tweet was this one: . @kmorrison is 100% correct. The sketch mocked ISIS and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch, like, perhaps, the three young British girls who reportedly headed to join them. Comically skewering ISIS is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more. In fact, in Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and even in Iraq, where ISIS is slaughtering people, brave Muslim comedians are ridiculing ISIS on TV, in YouTube videos and in cartoons. And I can assure you that if ISIS were to catch these comedians, it wouldn't just tweet about its outrage, it would kill them. So why do these comedians take the chance? Because, they say, it undermines ISIS, and also, for many, it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists, as opposed to shivering in fear about them. This is the same reason Mel Brooks featured ""Springtime for Hitler"" in his hit musical comedy, ""The Producers"":  It was a way of using comedy as revenge. Brooks saw it as a way to rob Hitler of his power (even if posthumously) by causing audiences to laugh at him. What's more, the ""SNL"" parody makes an important but subtle point. On the side of the ISIS pickup, the Arabic writing does not state a religious expression. Rather it says, ""I love cats."" As someone who worked at ""SNL"" for eight years, I can assure you this was not happenstance, but rather was by design. To me, the ""I love cats"" line shows that ""SNL"" grasps what many on the right refuse to. As I heard firsthand when I attended the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism two weeks ago, ISIS will despicably use any means to recruit people. Consequently, as ludicrous as it may seem, saying ""we love cats"" to young girls is not beyond ISIS. When I look at the outrage over this ""SNL"" political parody, I have to wonder: Weren't we all ""Je suis Charlie Hebdo"" just a few weeks ago? Remember when we stood firmly with political satirists. Well, apparently that sentiment ended for some as soon as they saw political satire they didn't like. I understand that some will be offended by political comedy with which they don't agree. But in a time when freedom of expression is under attack, if you are offended by political satire on TV, then change the channel.","Dean Obeidallah: Twitter blew up over ""Saturday Night Live"" skit about girl joining ISIS .

"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Thirty years or so ago, the synagogue in Washington DC where I was attending Yom Kippur services received a bomb threat. As we evacuated the building, I was concerned that people didn't seem to be taking it seriously. I was visiting from Europe, where terrorism was a fact of life, and I was scared. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s in Europe, and even beyond, far-left and far-right extremists, the IRA, radical Palestinians, and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks, big and small, that left thousands dead or injured. Jewish, Israeli -- and American -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks: from the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, to plane and cruise ship hijackings, to attacks on airports, synagogues, and simply places where Jews congregated, such as the Jo Goldenberg kosher deli in Paris, where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in August 1982. In Rome, where I lived for parts of the 1970s and '80s, we tended to avoid certain streets where El Al and U.S. airlines had their offices. The first big story I helped cover as a young reporter was a bloody attack at the city's Fiumicino airport in December 1973. A dozen years later, the daughter of friends was killed in another Palestinian attack there. The main synagogue in Rome has been under tight guard since Palestinian attackers threw hand grenades and sprayed machinegun fire at worshippers after services in October 1982, killing a toddler and wounding dozens. I don't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against Jewish targets in Europe, such as in Copenhagen and Paris. I just want to add some perspective. Many things have changed over the decades. Post-Cold War power vacuums and Middle East upheavals have given rise to radical Islamism and globalized Jihadist terror networks whose message, fanned out via the internet and social media, strikes a chord in disaffected youth. To be sure, Jews are being targeted. But it is important to recognize that Jews are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general. Today's victims of Islamist terror include Christians and Muslims as well as Jews. In the Middle East and Africa, women, children, students, and cultural heritage -- history -- are also directly targeted. In some ways, today's Jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades: the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel terrorism of radical Palestinian groups and the anti-establishment, even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system. Anti-Semitism takes many forms. Criticism of Israel is legitimate (and sometimes necessary), but it can, and sometimes does, cross the line. This isn't new either, however. Jews in Europe have been regarded -- and scapegoated -- as surrogates for Israel for decades. In 1967-68, after Israel defeated Arab states in the Six-Day War, Poland's communist regime staged an ""anti-Zionist"" campaign that forced most of the remaining Jews out of the country. At least 13,000 Jews emigrated, according to Dariusz Stola, who is now the director of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Other experts put the figure as high as 20,000. This was -- and remains -- by far the most widespread episode of anti-Semitism in post-Holocaust Europe. Twenty years later, in 1988, a report by the Anti-Defamation League warned that a significant number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States now reflected ""a politically-related anti-Israel component."" A JTA news report at the time quoted ADL National Director Abraham Foxman as noting that the phenomenon was new in the United States, but ""it's been a common occurrence in European countries."" Particularly worrisome, the report said, were Israel-related anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses. Sound familiar? After the Holocaust, it was common to view Jews in Europe as sitting with their suitcases packed, just in case. But -- unlike Poland's ""anti-Zionist"" campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to Jews and did not prompt a mass exodus. Nor should -- or will -- it now. The Nazis, followed by Communist rule in half of the continent, almost succeeded in making Europe Judenrein. Following the most recent terror attacks, Jewish and European national leaders have made clear that this is not an option. Moreover, despite the terrorist threat, European governments have refused to budge in their defense of democratic values. It is wise to be on guard, of course, and there is indeed ample cause for alarm -- even fear. But we should also be on guard against something else -- against a facile temptation to cry wolf that can all too easily distort alarm into alarmism -- and fear into fear-mongering.","Ruth Ellen Gruber says the victims of today's Islamist terror attacks include Christians and Muslims as well as Jews.

"(CNN)Real Madrid's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front. Sunday's 6-1 demolition of Rayo Vallecano put the Catalan side one point above Real at the top of Spain's La Liga, with Lionel Messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward Luis Suarez also scored twice. Even without suspended Brazil star Neymar -- the third prong of Barca's striking line -- Enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in Madrid wounds following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. ""We're elated, but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season. I already said that everybody could lose a game, so we have to keep playing well and win every match,"" he said. ""It's heavy having to win every single match. Each game is more important than the last."" By contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against Villarreal. ""There is no link-up play, our play is too based around individual play, we need another way of attacking, with faster play and fewer touches,"" said the Italian, who must rouse his troops for Tuesday's European Champions League last-16, second-leg tie at home to Schalke. ""It is quite confusing to see what we're doing at the moment in attack. The ball doesn't move around quickly."" While Real's front trio of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season, Barca's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams' ""El Clasico"" clash at the Nou Camp in a fortnight. Messi's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a Spanish club player, and took him past Ronaldo as the La Liga leader on 24 trebles. The Argentina star also drew level with the Portugal captain as the Spanish league's top scorer this season on 30 goals. It's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals, with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign. Suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games, and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from English club Liverpool after a World Cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. ""Suarez and Messi are having more and more chemistry, and today we all saw what they bring to the team,"" Enrique said. ""I like (Ivan) Rakitic wherever he plays on the field. He always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we've ever had."" ""(Gerard) Piqué has always known how to score, above all on set plays. It's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively."" Both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000, Barca's best this season: Rayo defender Tito for a foul on Suarez in the 55th minute that allowed Messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty; and Dani Alves for tripping Alberto Bueno, who also netted the resulting spot-kick. Barca's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid after the defending champion's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed Valencia later Sunday. Koke put Atletico ahead in the first half but Shkodran Mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left, while Valencia teammate Javi Fuego received two late yellow cards. Sixth-placed Villarreal beat Celta Vigo 4-0, while Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash. In Italy, second-placed Roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader Juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling Chievo Verona on Sunday. It left Rudi Garcia's team eight points adrift of Juve, which hosts Sassuolo on Monday. Third-placed Napoli also drew, blowing a two-goal lead against Inter Milan as Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi, with an 87th-minute penalty, canceled out second-half goals by Marek Hamsik and Gonzalo Higuain. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win at Paderborn as South Korea striker Heung-Min Son scored two late goals after a 73rd-minute opener from Greece defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos. In France, Lyon restored a one-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win at Montpellier, as young midfielder Nabil Fekir scored twice. In England, Premier League side Liverpool faces an FA Cup replay after being held 0-0 by second-tier Blackburn.","Barcelona reclaims Spanish league lead with 6-1 win at home to Rayo Vallecano .

"(CNN)Slain Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov knew criticizing the Kremlin was dangerous, but thought his fame would protect him. The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with his girlfriend Anna Duritskaya when he was gunned down in Moscow on Friday. Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. In an interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year, Nemtsov spoke of the deaths of other Kremlin critics, but said his fame offered some protection. ""I'm a well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,"" he said then. After Nemtsov was shot, Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. But critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. In their 2014 interview, Nemtsov told Bourdain he believed Russia's existing power structure was like 19th century Russia, with one person in control and no real freedom of press, real competition or elections or an independent judiciary or rule of law. ""You are in the typical country of crony capitalism,"" he said. ""If you have a good relationship with Putin and his people around, you will have a good relationship with governor or mayor -- it doesn't matter. If you are in the city you have a chance to raise money, to be successful ... you know, to buy real estate in the south of France or Switzerland, to open accounts in Swiss banks. ""But, if something happened between you and Putin and you are governor, you will be in jail."" Nemstov said in most places around the world, wealth provided opportunity and independence, but said that it was different in Russia. ""To be wealthy, you must be loyal. If you want to be independent, forget about business, forget about raising money,"" he said. ""If you are rich, you are a slave. If you are rich, you are very much dependent."" Many people preferred to be able make money and not speak out, he said. ""This is a country of corruption,"" Nemtsov said. ""For Putin's Russia, this is a system. This is not a problem."" ""If you are corrupted, but you are loyal, and you serve the Kremlin, you are first of all rich and secondly you are in a very safe position.""","Kremlin critic and opposition figure Boris Nemtsov was fatally shot in Moscow on Friday .

"(CNN)ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages Sunday, an activist group said. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The ""court"" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. ""ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,"" he told CNN. ""They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law."" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its ""caliphate"" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for ""exceeding the limits in religion,"" the Syrian Observatory said. ""We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing"" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

"London (CNN)Britain's Royal Mint has unveiled a new portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, which will gradually appear on coins in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth portrait of the British monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign. Production of the new coins began Monday, and they will appear in circulation later this year, the Royal Mint said. The new design depicts the Queen wearing the royal diamond diadem crown from her coronation. Artist Jody Clark said he researched images online when deciding which crown to use. ""I think it's the most familiar and I wanted to make some clear distinctions between the (most recent) portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS, as Her Majesty really hasn't aged too much in the years since."" ""FRBS"" refers to Rank-Broadley's fellowship in the Royal British Society of Sculptors, a professional organization that advances the art of sculpture. A panel selected Clark's design from a number by specialist designers across Britain invited to submit anonymous work. The design was then submitted to the British chancellor and the Queen for final approval. Clark is a member of the Royal Mint's team of designers and engravers. He is the first mint engraver to produce a definitive royal coinage portrait in more than a century, the organization said. ""Jody's achievement is something that we can celebrate as a proud moment for The Royal Mint. Capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill, and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer's art,"" chief executive Adam Lawrence said. ""This change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for UK coins, and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day."" Royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years, the Royal Mint said. The last portrait was created by sculptor Rank-Broadley in 1998.","Britain's Royal Mint unveiled a new coinage portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday .

"(CNN)The estimated number of people killed in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 now exceeds 6,000 ""in spite of successive ceasefires,"" the UN Human Rights Office announced in a statement on Monday. The escalation in fighting in recent weeks, particularly near Donetsk airport and in the Debaltseve area, resulted in hundreds of deaths, both civilian and military, according to a new report. The report paints a picture of ""merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure,"" said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. He called for all sides to adhere to the Minsk agreement, which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict's hotspots. The fighting has inflicted extreme humanitarian hardship on civilians. ""Many have been trapped in conflict zones, forced to shelter in basements, with hardly any drinking water, food, heating, electricity or basic medical supplies,"" Zeid said in a statement. The notion that civilians remained in the conflict zone of their own will is ""misguided,"" he said. ""Many people stay because they fear for their lives if they try to move. Many others stay to protect children, other family members, or their property. And some are forced to stay against their will, or are simply physically unable to leave,"" Zeid said. A series of terror attacks in Mariupol, as well as in Kharkiv and Odesa, which are outside of the conflict zone, have set a bad precedent, he said. ""Should this trend continue, this would represent a new and very deadly chapter in this conflict, expanding the areas where the rule of law and the protection of human rights are effectively absent,"" Zeid said. The UN arrived at the new estimated death toll of over 6,000 by tallying 5,809 documented deaths and assessing that many more must have been killed in recent fighting in other areas, particularly Donetsk airport and around Debaltseve.","Fighting in recent weeks at Donetsk airport and in Debaltseve has killed hundreds, UN says .

"(CNN)She grew up in Kenya under colonial rule, when women didn't get an education. Now in her 90s, Priscilla Sitienei is changing that, attending elementary school -- and inspiring a generation. She started five years ago as a kindergartner at a boarding school near Eldoret. She's in fourth grade today. ""I had grandchildren and great-grandchildren who shunned school,"" she says by phone from Ndalat. ""That made me mad. I decided I have to show them that education is important."" During colonial times, some Kenyan hospitals did not keep birth records. Sitienei's exact age is unclear, but she says she was born around 1923, when a famine plagued her hometown. Growing up, relatives told her she barely survived that famine as a toddler,  which gave her a rough estimate of her birth year. If confirmed by the Guinness World Records, she would be the oldest pupil in elementary school. The last such honor by the Guinness World Records went to another Kenyan, Kimani Maruge, who in 2004 was named the oldest person to begin primary school. Five years later, he died at age 90. Though Sitienei  worked as a traditional midwife for decades, she says there's still a lot to learn. ""My favorite subject is math,"" the nonagenarian says. ""Now that I'm in school, I know the right dosage to give the women who I help deliver their babies."" Sitienei got married at a young age and focused on raising her 10 children. ""I could not go to school even if I wanted,"" she says. ""In my time, educating a woman was considered a waste of time and money."" She enthusiastically describes her love for school and her fellow pupils, some of whom she helped bring into this world. ""They call me 'Gogo,' "" she says, using the word for grandmother in her local Kalenjin tribe. ""We play in swings during recess, we talk. I like school."" Sitienei has a special dorm room tucked away in a corner, where she doles out wisdom to her proteges. Outside her door is a sign that says ""education has no age limit."" David Kinyanjui, the principal of Leaders Vision Preparatory School, describes her as a model pupil. ""She advises our girls, she advises our boys,"" Kinyanjui says. ""She participates in everything, including PE (physical education). She's also good at math and science, and she's such a good storyteller."" Sitienei's enthusiasm is already paying off. Her three great-grandchildren are her classmates. They have friendly competitions on who'll make the best grades. Last year, Sitienei was the leading student in third grade. ""Her great-grandchildren could not believe she did better than them. That really motivated them; one of them even cried,"" the principal says. Now they work even harder to beat her.

"(CNN)Around 2002, I was browsing in a used book store in Pittsburgh, and there it was: ""The Ethics of Star Trek"" by Judith Barad and Ed Robertson. Coincidentally, I was working at that time on integrating ethics into engineering education at Penn State University. I immediately bought the book, and after reading it through, realized that it could be the basis for an engaging course for our first-year engineering students. I first offered the course, The Ethics of Star Trek, in the fall of 2003 -- and I've been teaching it ever since. My children grew up watching the shows that followed the original series, which continued the tradition established by ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry of tackling current events like war, genocide and pollution. It was good family entertainment that also prompted reflection on issues of the day. And it was this exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students. First there was the friendship between Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy, aka Bones. Plato described the human soul as composed of three aspects: spirit, reason and emotion. Internally, we each strive to balance these three forces. If we manage to do this well, we become a more virtuous person and attain a fourth virtue: justice. By placing Kirk (spirit), Spock (reason) and Bones (emotion) into challenging situations, we get to observe this interplay of these forces, and we get to hear them say what would otherwise be an internal dialogue. Why is Spock so critical here? Because Vulcans worship logic and rationality. Even though he's half human, he suppresses his emotions. It's no surprise that he is the science officer, since science is founded on rationality. Mr. Spock, then, can be trusted to give reasoned scientific analysis in any situation, uninfluenced by emotion or spirit. And since they wouldn't even be in space without science, Spock may be the most important character for the success of the adventure. So, how was all this applied in a classroom? The ""Star Trek class"" is a one-credit seminar for first-year students that meets once a week, one of about 60 different seminars offered by the College of Engineering. Students read relevant chapters in the book, and then every other week we watch a related ""Star Trek"" episode. In the other weeks, we sit in a large circle and have an open and often lively discussion about the ethical ideas and their application to the students' lives. One of the recurring plot elements in ""Star Trek"" is the discovery of new creatures. This often raises the question of the proper relationship and attitude toward these entities. Are they intelligent? Is their intent malicious? In one episode, ""Arena,"" the Enterprise engages in battle with an alien vessel, flown by the Gorn, that has attacked an Earth colony. In the heat of the battle, another unknown species, the Metrons, transports Kirk and the Gorn captain to a barren planet. They are told that because of their violent tendencies, they must battle to the death, with the ship and crew of the loser to be destroyed. As the two captains battle, the Metrons project the scenes onto the Enterprise's main view screen on the bridge. As the crew observes the battle, and thinks more about it, Spock realizes that the Earth colony may have been the invader, and the Gorn vessel may have been justified in its attack on the colony. Kirk also begins to see this as a possibility. When he finally subdues the Gorn captain, Kirk decides to show him mercy and spare his life, even though it may result in the destruction of the Enterprise and her crew. Surprised by this action, the Metrons decide that there may be hope for humans after all, and that we are not primarily savages. This episode has been used in the following week's discussion in various ways, depending on the current events that form the backdrop to the semester. One of my favorite approaches is to have the students consider the ethics of eating meat. I supplement the ""Star Trek"" background with arguments by other philosophers and commentators. It always makes for great discussion because the question hits home, literally, in the gut. At the heart of this question is: What is it about another creature that qualifies it for ethical consideration? Is it rationality? Is it power? Is it utility to humans? Many of the students' arguments are essentially biological -- we are omnivores. They argue further that we are at the top of the food chain and can therefore do whatever we want. For these students, I often start by asking them if they have a pet. If they do, I ask them if I can eat their pet. Or better yet, under what circumstances might it be OK to eat their pet? A key issue that arises from this is that we humans see ourselves as more than just animals; we have reason and a sense of right and wrong, a sense of justice. As the discussion evolves, various indicators of other species' moral standing are investigated, including rationality, ability to experience pain and suffering, utility to humans, and perhaps that these other creatures have intrinsic value regardless of their use to people. Often, students come away with a commitment to reduce animal suffering, and to reduce their consumption of meat overall. My favorite Spock-centered episode is a two-parter, ""The Menagerie,"" which uses scenes from the original pilot, ""The Cage."" Here we see Spock's human side at its best. Captain Pike, whom Spock used to serve with, has been injured to the point where he can live only as part of a machine, and he can only make a device beep once for yes, and twice for no. (OK, admittedly it's a flaw in the technological imagination.) Spock kidnaps Pike and commandeers the Enterprise, all for as yet unclear reasons. What we find out is that Pike and Spock had visited a planet (in the pilot) where aliens could make you experience any reality they dreamed up for you. They narrowly escaped, and the planet was placed off limits by the Federation. Spock intends to deliver Pike to this planet so that he can live out his life in a reality unconfined by his physical impairment. Along the way, Spock faces a court-martial where a guilty verdict would result in death. Yet his loyalty and love of Pike override his awareness of the irrationality of his actions. (In the end, the court-martial is dropped, and Pike lives long and prospers.) Nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemma like this, meaning that not only was ""Star Trek"" great entertainment, but a show that could really make you think. That's why I was saddened to learn of Leonard Nimoy's passing Friday. But it is also something that allows me to take some comfort, because I know that his legacy as Mr. Spock, science officer of the starship Enterprise, will live on.","""Star Trek"" actor Leonard Nimoy died Friday at age 83 .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)North Korea has fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were fired from North Korea's west coast into the sea, which is also known as the East Sea, around 6:30 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. Monday (4:30 p.m. and 4:40 p.m. ET Sunday), the official said. They were fired from an area near Nampo City, located about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. The two projectiles were estimated to have flown about 490 kilometers (304 miles) before falling into the sea east of the peninsula, according to the South Korean official, who asked to remain anonymous citing government policy. Considering the speed, altitude and distance the missiles traveled, they are assumed to be Scud-Cs, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The missiles were fired as the United States and South Korea began annual military drills, which United States Forces Korea describes as ""nonprovocative training"" that are ""an important component of readiness"" for defending South Korea. The annual joint military exercises, called Foal Eagle and Key Reserve, have long sparked tension between North Korea, South Korea and the United States. North Korea's state-run KCNA slammed the joint military exercises Monday, saying that the drills are ""nothing but a smokescreen"" by the United States and South Korea ""to cover up their surprise invasion of the north."" ""The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war,"" KCNA said, noting that North Korea's military ""will never remain a passive onlooker in this grave situation."" North Korea was informed on February 24 when the joint drills would be held, said Kim Min-seok, the South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman. ""North Korea in the past did fire (projectiles) in a very similar manner,"" he said during a briefing Monday.  ""On several occasions, they fired (projectiles) from the west coast to sea off east of the Korean Peninsula."" He added that North Korea fired about 90 ballistic missiles and rockets during last year's Foal Eagle and Key Resolve drill. ""Our military is strictly warning North Korean military of the reckless and the provocative act. We will firmly and strongly respond to any North Korea's provocation through solid united defense posture,"" South Korea's Kim said.

"(CNN)In the center of China's eastern Zhejiang Province lies Commodity City, which photographer Richard John Seymour says is the largest small-commodity wholesale market in the world. The shopper's paradise, in the city of Yiwu, covers 46 million square feet and has about 62,000 booths, with 100,000 suppliers exhibiting 400,000 kinds of products. The sheer enormity of the place posed challenges for London-based Seymour, who visited Commodity City twice last year. ""I tried to see as much as I could in the days that I was there, and became very quickly exhausted by the constant sensory overload,"" he said via email. ""I spent a total of four days constantly walking around Yiwu and wouldn't say I got near to seeing all of the stalls."" Seymour's ""Yiwu Commodity City"" photo project began in January 2014, when he established both the style and content of his photos: the sellers in their environments in addition to the monotony of the market itself. When Seymour returned to Yiwu in August, he felt well-prepared to begin shooting. During this visit, he also came to better understand the atmosphere and dynamics of the market. ""The atmosphere of the market was quite unusual in that one gets the sense that it really is home to a community,"" he said. ""The second trip I made to the market was during school summer vacation, and because of this there were children in a huge number of the stores who obviously (spent) the day in the market with their parents. There were also children running and playing throughout the market, riding scooters along its vast corridors, chasing each other around, etc. It gave the impression that this was more than just a place of business, but a place of life, something that took me by surprise."" The photos are like an endless delivery of presents, as each and every shot unwraps an assortment of contents within the identically square-shaped booths of the sellers. ""Shooting Yiwu in a repetitive way, for me, becomes a very interesting way of describing the place, as each store becomes describable only by the items for sale within it,"" Seymour said. An estimated 40,000 visitors make their way into Commodity City every day. Many of them are retail buyers. Because of the large number of visitors and their diverse backgrounds, buyers and sellers typically communicate utilizing translators that work in the market permanently. ""There is a broad mix of people in Yiwu, buyers and sellers come from all over the world. However just from my own experiences and those of others I spoke to, the fastest growing markets are of Middle Eastern and African buyers,"" Seymour said. There are thousands of orders placed at Commodity City that are later sold to consumers in many different countries. ""I learned a great deal during this project,"" Seymour said. ""If there was one thing that particularly stands out, it was the scale of production in China. ... Everything in Yiwu is a one-of-a-kind sample. Orders are made in Yiwu, but the factories nearby manufacture the items, so what you're seeing in the market is actually not for sale. This is why the stores are so visually rich, because there is no need for multiple samples, every item is different."" What makes Seymour's photos so striking is how they encompass a mixture of familiar sights with unknown wonder. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""Possibly the most interesting aspect of this project was when I occasionally encountered an item that was very familiar to me in such a strange place,"" he said. ""We tend to adopt quite personal emotions to our belongings, and if we see something in our own home every day then it naturally fosters quite an intimate relationship. What was interesting was then seeing one of these items halfway across the globe, a constant reminder that we have a connection with places around the world (that) we know next to nothing about."" Many of the items shown in the photographs are very ordinary. There are woolen hats, artificial flowers, mannequins and even cooking utensils. But there are also mysterious sellers barely visible in their booths. Just as the city of Yiwu is surrounded by mountains, the sellers at Commodity City are boxed-in by their very own mountains of commodities. ""For me there (is) quite a beautiful metaphor in Yiwu, there is a kind of beauty in the numbness of the expressions in contrast with their colorful surroundings, perhaps highlighting the perils of untapped consumption,"" Seymour said. ""The inhabitants of these spaces become almost swallowed by the objects that make them their living. They are, quite literally, consumed."" The ""Yiwu Commodity City"" photos are part of a larger series by Seymour titled ""Consumed,"" and it was completed in collaboration with the Unknown Fields Division, a nomadic design studio that works to show how distant landscapes connect to the rest of the world. Seymour's photos ultimately leave viewers to reflect upon the possibility that Commodity City may in fact be the origin of many of the products they currently own. ""I definitely view the items I see in many shops differently now that I have seen (Yiwu). I'll often see a particular item whilst walking around London and think to myself, 'I'm sure that came from Yiwu,' "" Seymour said. According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, more than 60% of the world's Christmas decorations are made in Yiwu and wholesaled at Commodity City. The likelihood is relevant well beyond Christmastime, however. Whether enjoying the beach, purchasing clothing or even playing games at the local fairground, consider if the ""Made in China"" label imprinted on those inflatable beach balls, shirt buttons, and cuddly teddy bears perhaps connects all the way to one of the Commodity City booths. ""I believe that more and more, we are defining our environments not as the spaces themselves, in terms of the buildings or architecture, but rather by the objects and devices that we buy and surround ourselves with. ... I would like that message to carry through universally,"" Seymour said. Richard John Seymour is a photographer based in London.

"(CNN)Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition leader slain Friday night a stone's throw from the Kremlin, was a true original, one of the towering figures of his country's post-communist political odyssey. We do not know yet who it was who shot him four times in the back. Various theories have been floated. But by far the most plausible is that his killers wanted to silence one of the most determined and courageous Russian campaigners for personal and political freedoms. Whether Nemtsov offended by attacking the authoritarianism of Vladimir Putin's regime, the jingoistic imperialism of his Ukrainian campaign or even the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo, it comes to the same thing in the end: He stood up consistently for the values of the Western Enlightenment against its motley army of enemies. Born in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Nemtsov began as an atomic physicist but rose to prominence in the early 1990s as the reformist governor of Nizhny Novgorod province. President Boris Yeltsin took a liking to him and brought him to Moscow. ""What a stubborn nature,"" he wrote of Nemtsov. ""Reminds me of myself."" Nemtsov was the first person Yeltsin anointed as his political successor. (Unfortunately, he was not the last.) After Putin's election in 2000, Nemtsov hoped at first that the new President would keep his promise to restore order while preserving democracy. Soon disillusioned, Nemtsov became one of Putin's most biting critics. He was a natural politician -- emotional, gregarious, articulate. Like Yeltsin -- but unlike Putin -- he enjoyed meeting ordinary people and was energized by electoral campaigns. Some snickered at Nemtsov's extravagant personality, his hints of bravado and weakness for the fairer sex. But his determination and talent commanded respect. Yet it is also true that, by the mid-2000s, Nemtsov was widely viewed as a spent force. And when the Levada Center polled Russians in 2013, 6% approved of his actions, while 48% disapproved and 46% claimed to know nothing about him. Along with all other Russian liberals of the 1990s, he failed to forge a connection to the discontented groups outside Moscow. He titled his first book of memoirs, ""The Provincial,"" but to true provincials he looked like the elite. As one analyst told me, when Nemtsov turned up at far-flung rallies in a sparkling, immaculately ironed, white shirt, it symbolized the class divide between him and his audience. By the wave of protests in 2011-12, his generation's day had passed. The new activists in their 30s and 40s had a different sensibility, a new cadence of speech to fit the Internet age. On the stage before the anti-Putin demonstrators, Nemtsov often bombed. He understood this. ""Khvatit!"" he said, in his last interview, when the host tried to tease out of him a confession of presidential ambitions. ""Enough already!"" But the dwindling appeal of Western-style liberalism did not stop him. Nemtsov's doggedness during the last decade -- plugging away despite public indifference or scorn -- makes it the most impressive chapter of his career. Having been chauffeured to his government office in the 1990s, Nemtsov marched in the rain among bedraggled crowds in the 2000s as police wheeled out noise-making machinery to drown out the sound of his bullhorn. He endured the eggs and ammonia hurled at him by pro-Kremlin hooligans. Not shrinking from arrest, he spent more than a few nights in holding cells. Even as the boyish charmer turned into a graying baby boomer with reading glasses that slipped down his nose, Nemtsov refused to slacken. Shut out of national politics, he ran for mayor of Sochi -- and got 13.6% of the vote. (Even had the election been fair, he would probably have lost.) Undeterred, he won a seat as deputy in the Yaroslavl Regional Council. Swallowing his pride, he battled on because he cared about Russia and because, well ... politics was what he did. The killing comes at a time when the Kremlin is clearly nervous. With the ruble and growth rate both plunging, glimmers of opposition have already appeared in unexpected corners. Five deputies in the usually subservient Duma have tabled a bill to repeal the sanctions Putin slapped on European food imports, calling them unconstitutional. If the economic slide continues, Putin's high ratings are likely to fall. In undemocratic states, the killing of a major opposition figure is sometimes the spark that lights the fuse. In the Philippines, after Ferdinand Marcos' military thugs shot Benigno Aquino on the tarmac at the Manila airport, this set off the ""people's power"" movement that eventually swept the dictator from office. The murder of Orlando Letelier by Augusto Pinochet's agents helped to discredit the Chilean leader. And yet Russia is in a poisonous state of division. The country's Westernized fringe may be galvanized into opposition. But as war fever bleeds into economic anxiety, a pervasive resentment and directionless aggression seem more likely in the short run than a united uprising for civil and political rights. Meanwhile, the wait for answers continues. The attack took place in an area saturated with video cameras. Within hours, one television station was showing footage of the killing -- albeit from a considerable distance. Nemtsov was almost certainly under surveillance at the time. If the Kremlin did not know before, it very likely knows by now who the killer was. Its next decision will be how to use the information for its own purposes. Whether or not the actual perpetrators are caught and punished, all know who created the climate of hatred in which liberal politicians are likened to ""jackals who hang around foreign embassies"" and a ""fifth column"" of traitors. Nemtsov in his later years was never a threat to Putin's regime. Hardly a radical revolutionary, he cooperated with the authorities to avoid violence by moving the site of the first major Moscow demonstration in December 2011, and he participated in discussions with then-President Dmitry Medvedev about reforms of the political system. Having come to symbolize for most Russians the disorder of the 1990s, he had little chance of rising to the top again. Indeed, he was the kind of liberal -- unbowed, unabashedly pro-Western, unpopular -- whom the Kremlin loved to hate. Now it will have to find somebody else.","Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was gunned down near the Kremlin .

"(CNN)We can't settle iPhone vs. Android or ""Star Wars"" vs. ""Star Trek"" for you. But we can settle another long-running geek debate: . Those short, animated loops that have captivated the Web for decades? They're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter. Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format, or GIF, while working for Compuserve in 1987. When he received a Webby Award in 2013 for it, and delivered his five-word acceptance speech (that's all the Webbys allow), he flashed a GIF on the big screens at the Cipriani Wall Street in New York. And, in a flash, it all became clear: . ""It's pronounced JIF, not GIF."" Of course, in the grand tradition of heated debate, a flat statement of fact by the creator wasn't enough to sway some partisans. On Twitter, ""GIF"" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back. ""Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg,"" wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm. ""So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT,"" chimed in October Jones, creator of the ""Texts From Dog"" Tumblr and book. ""And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'"" And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way. The always amusing HAL 9000 account (yes, somebody tweets as the robot from ""2001"") posted an ""animated JIF"" -- which is to say, a swirling, animated jar of the tasty, high-protein spread. Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF. They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again. Wilhite has argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years. Yet no less an authority than the White House has posted an image on its Tumblr feed advocating for the hard-G. And the Oxford English Dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable.

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, even uniting Sunni and Shiite fighters in the mission. The Iraqi army, along with Sunni and Shiite militiamen, attacked ISIS strongholds in the area Monday, the state-run Iraqiya TV reported. Iraqi warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around Tikrit. It's part of a wide-scale offensive ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group's capture of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. Tikrit is best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria. Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour. The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared. What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout. Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. While Iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area, it has generally been under ISIS control for the last eight months or so. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the Shia al-Hashed al-Shaabi militia, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades, and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he will ""oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit"" from ISIS. In short, this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to ISIS last summer after a string of dramatic defeats. Last June, Tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by ISIS militants. They captured more than a thousand Iraqi soldiers, who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by U.S. forces. ISIS subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers, and posted the video of the killing online. There is concern that Iraqi forces, eager for revenge, may kill combatants and civilians alike. The U.N.'s envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, urged all armed forces in Tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians. U.S. and other coalition troops have been conducting a crash course to retrain and upgrade the Iraqi army, and several thousand Iraqi troops have passed through the course. This offensive will tell whether that training has made a difference. The offensive also highlights the role played by neighboring Iran in the fight against ISIS. The semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency reports that Qassim Sulaimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Al-Quds Brigade, is helping oversee the operation to retake Tikrit. Iran has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. If the offensive succeeds, it means that retaking Mosul, a city 10 times bigger, is possible. But Tikrit is almost 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Mosul, and much of the territory in between is under ISIS control. Al-Abadi has said the immediate goal is to liberate Salah ad-Din province, of which Tikrit is the capital, and then focus on adjacent Al-Anbar province, a similarly Sunni-dominated province. After that, retaking Mosul is an option. If, however, the Tikrit offensive fails, it could spell disaster for Baghdad. There will be political recriminations, the already fragile morale of the Iraqi army could collapse, the Kurdish autonomous region could decide to break from Iraq, and it would provide ISIS with a victory it hasn't seen since last summer. Ben Wedeman reported from Irbil, and Mariano Castillo reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN)The case of a Georgia woman, whose execution was postponed for a second time Monday, is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face: When do we put our own citizens to death? But it's an issue on which this country is all over the place. ""As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken.""  That was Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008). You might think at first the Department of Justice isn't listening. After all, the U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death, and not all of them involve a victim's life being taken.  They fall into three main categories: 1) homicide offenses; 2) espionage and treason; and 3) nonhomicidal narcotics offenses.  While most of them involve the death of a victim, not all of them do. But what happened to all that ""shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken"" language from the Supreme Court?  Doesn't the Department of Justice have to listen to the Supreme Court? They do, and they have. The Department of Justice has read the high court's fine print in Kennedy v. Louisiana:  ""Our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons. We do not address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State. As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."" Ah.  As with most things, there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions. Apparently, when we are talking about crimes against people, the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide-type crimes.  If it's a crime against the state, well, it's game on. After all, treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, so there's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is ""constitutional"" -- because it's actually in the constitution.  (Yet another reason why federal court is not a place where defendants want to be -- it's no secret defense attorneys would rather be in state court, where the penalties are less severe and where everything isn't illegal). While it varies from state to state, as a very general proposition, the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder.  Murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide, and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder. As another very general proposition in the States, murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime. It would be nice to say that capital murder in the states is always defined as an intentional killing, but even that has exceptions.  In fact, in some states, you can be executed for a victim's death even if you didn't actually pull the trigger and even if you never intended a death to result. If you commit an inherently dangerous felony, and a death results, you can be charged with ""felony murder,"" which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty.  According to the Supreme Court, this is constitutional, as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life. Ultimately, it's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty. Society's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving, and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes. As a general rule, horrific murders qualify, but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies. If you are in the armed forces, even more crimes can get you executed, such as desertion. That's particularly paradoxical that we might order our military personnel to intentionally kill in times of war and then execute them -- as was the case of Pvt. Eddie Slovik -- for refusing to intentionally participate in the killing.  Of course, we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply doesn't. While the husband-wife execution of convicted spies (and nonkillers) Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time, the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died. So what exactly will earn you the death penalty?  The message is anything but clear. For crimes against the person, it has to be pretty awful: A killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide.  If your crime is against the state, however, the Supreme Court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens.","U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses punishable by death .

"(CNN)When Jeb Bush spoke last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, the likely GOP presidential hopeful did better than expected. Of course, that could have been because expectations were so low. You remember ""Bush Derangement Syndrome."" When George W. Bush was president, it afflicted liberals who thought the chief executive couldn't do anything right. Now that Jeb might run for president in 2016, the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the GOP nominee, the former Florida governor is all wrong. During Bush's speech, a few dozen supporters of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky -- wearing red T-shirts with the words ""Stand With Rand"" -- walked out and later blasted Bush as insufficiently conservative. But what should really count for a lot is that Bush is sufficiently competent. He's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to ISIS (Scott Walker) or vow to abolish the IRS (Ted Cruz) or bash the media (Chris Christie) -- seem most interested in applause lines. Bush is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency, something that you just can't say about all Republicans who appear to be running. As someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from Mexico, Bush can hit Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, where it hurts by carving into her Latino support. In his 1998 gubernatorial election, and 2002 re-election, Bush received over 60 percent of the Latino vote. And it's no secret that, for many Latinos who might vote for Bush, the make-or-break issue is immigration. That's because many Latinos see immigration as a way of determining a candidate's character. Latinos will be watching to see if Bush stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the GOP's closed border chorus. They're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice Latinos to gin up support from non-Latinos. And they won't put up with it. So which way is Bush going to go on immigration? For many years, he extolled the contributions of immigrants and expressed dismay that elements of his party are closed-minded and mean-spirited on the issue. He even acknowledged that, to many, the party is seen as ""anti-immigrant."" Lately, though, Bush has injected more nuance into his views -- and turned them mushy in the process. On the question of whether undocumented youth should have a path to citizenship, for example, Bush at first supported the idea, then he opposed it. And most recently, he has said that he could support such a path if Congress mandates it. On the Arizona immigration law, Bush apparently likes the concept of enlisting local police to be ""the eyes and ears"" of the border patrol. But he has also been sympathetic to critics who worry that this will lead to ethnic profiling of Latinos. Too often, Bush leaves the impression that he'll say whatever he needs to say to avoid conflict. So it was actually refreshing to see Bush use his appearance at CPAC -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host Sean Hannity -- to once again speak plainly. In response to questions, Bush emphasized the need to secure the U.S. border, insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high-skilled immigrants, and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver's licenses and in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. The crowd booed that last one. Bush criticized President Obama's executive actions to prioritize deportations, but also bashed Republicans in Congress for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the Department of Homeland Security. Finally, in response to what is often the most contentious aspect of this debate, Bush also stressed the need to create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the United States. ""I know there's disagreement here,"" he said. ""The simple fact is that there is no plan to deport 11 million people. We should give them a path to legal status where they work...and contribute to our society."" More boos. The way Bush sees it, the GOP is good at being against things but ""we have to start being for things again."" In response to a heckler, Bush stared out into the crowd to address his critic. ""I'm marking you down as neutral,"" he told the heckler. ""I'll look forward to being your second choice."" Not even close. In the Washington Times/CPAC presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants, Bush came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote. First place went to Rand Paul, who earned 25.7 percent. Clearly, Bush has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he's their best choice. But his appearance at CPAC set exactly the right tone. Voters in both parties have plenty of candidates telling them what they want to hear just to get their support. What they need are more candidates who tell them what they need to hear: the truth. That won't make the candidates popular. But it does make them credible. Score 1 for Bush.","Jeb Bush attended this year's Conservative Political Action Conference .

"(CNN)She was the first person to contract Ebola in the United States, and now she's suing the hospital where she got infected. Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, filed a lawsuit Monday against the hospital's parent company, Texas Health Resources. She claims the company made her ""a symbol of corporate neglect -- a casualty of a hospital system's failure to prepare for a known and impending medical crisis."" THR ignored Ebola warnings, its chief medical officer ""made numerous patently false statements to Congress,"" and the company ""wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices, procedures, and equipment were in place,"" leaving health care providers untrained, unprotected and at risk for exposure, the lawsuit says. ""I was hoping that THR would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn't do that led to me getting infected with Ebola,"" Pham said in a statement. ""But that didn't happen and I felt I was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help."" The company's CEO, Barclay Berdan, sent a letter to employees Monday night after news of the lawsuit broke. ""Nina and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of Ebola to arrive in a U.S. hospital's emergency room,"" the statement read. ""Texas Health Resources values our strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all employees as part of our family.  That's why we have continued to support Nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team."" According to the suit, the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle Ebola. Pham contracted the disease last fall while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who started showing symptoms after arriving in Dallas from Liberia. ""In a cruel twist, after watching Mr. Duncan go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life, Nina herself was diagnosed with Ebola just two days after Mr. Duncan's life was taken by it,"" the lawsuit states. Because the hospital initially discharged Duncan when he arrived seeking treatment, it hurt his chances of beating the virus, the lawsuit says. ""Had THR heeded the CDC and other warnings and ensured its hospitals were ready for Ebola, Mr. Duncan would have had the best opportunity to possibly survive,"" it says. Pham also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment, despite CDC warnings. ""Based on what she could learn from the Internet, on the first day she cared for Mr. Duncan, Nina put on a regular isolation gown covering her front and back, double gloves, a surgical mask with plastic shield and double booties. Importantly, Nina's neck and hair remained exposed. Nina was not even (provided) disposable scrubs or a change of clothes. She had to wear the scrubs she wore that first day home, taking out of the hospital clothing that was potentially carrying the virus,"" the lawsuit says. When her mother learned she was treating Duncan, she tried to persuade her to call in sick or even quit, but Pham replied, ""Mom, I can't abandon him. He is my patient. It's my job. I'm going back,"" according to the lawsuit. Texas Health Resources spokesman Wendell Watson issued a statement in response to the lawsuit: . ""Nina Pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of Ebola to arrive in a U.S. hospital's emergency room. Texas Health Resources has a strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all our employees as part of our family. That's why we have continued to support Nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team.  As distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina."" Comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country, the suit further states that after Duncan died, Pham was told she was at ""no risk"" for Ebola ""and that she could freely see her friends and family."" Two days later, she found out she had Ebola. ""THR quickly learned that Nina and her dog Bentley had enormous public support and sympathy. So THR began trying to use Nina as a PR tool to save its plummeting image. While Nina laid in isolation, heavily medicated and facing a potentially gruesome death, THR had its PR department calling Nina. The PR Department was trying to release information and use Nina as part of its THR-corporate-driven #PresbyProud campaign,"" the lawsuit says. Pham's lawsuit also says Texas Health Resources violated her privacy by sharing her medical records. In his letter to employees, Berdan said the company had Pham's permission to release information. ""THR was sensitive to Nina's privacy, and we adhered to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) rules in determining what information to share publicly,"" the CEO said. ""We had Nina's consent to share the information about her that was released."" Another nurse treating Duncan, Amber Vinson, also contracted Ebola. Both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle Ebola -- Pham at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, and Vinson at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Pham is still employed and is getting a paycheck from Texas Health Resources, but has not returned to work, CNN affiliate KTVT said. She is still suffering fatigue and body aches, but her lawyer told the affiliate it's not clear whether the ailments are from Ebola or from the experimental drugs Pham received. She also experiences anxiety and frequent nightmares and suffers from the stigma of being the Ebola nurse and she may not nurse again, the lawsuit says . ""Professionally, she doubts whether she can ever be a critical care nurse again -- in part because of the emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in part because of the fear and stigma that follows her. So despite only just beginning to pursue her dream of a career in critical care nursing, Nina is now faced with the possibility of never returning to her passion,"" the lawsuit says. The lawsuit seeks damages for past and future physical pain, mental anguish, physical impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, medical expenses, loss of earning capacity and loss of reputation the lawsuit says. It does not set an amount for damages sought. ""The fact is, I'm facing a number of issues with regard to my health and my career and the lawsuit provides a way to address them,"" Pham said in her statement. ""But more importantly, it will help uncover the truth of what happened, and educate all health care providers and administrators about ways to be better prepared for the next public health emergency. ""I particularly want to express my continued sympathy to the family of Mr. Duncan, as it was my privilege to care for him. I also want to acknowledge my fellow nurses, and the many friends, family and strangers for their ongoing concern and support.""

"(CNN)It's time for leaders in Israel and the United States to call off their war of insults before they cause serious, lasting damage.  Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake.  Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a ""cold"" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known.  But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power.  The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security.  There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown.  The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement.  As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran.  Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. ​ According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose.  This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress.  President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous.  It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East.  Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head.  The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb, unleashing a lethal arms race. This is a moment that demands that leaders in both Israel and the United States lower their voices, take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust.  In private talks, they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them, starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran U.S. diplomats. Dennis Ross, for example, argues that if the U.S. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere, any time in Iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that Iranian violations will bring military action, that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears.  Martin Indyk proposes that, drawing upon ideas embraced by President Clinton in Middle East negotiations 15 years ago, the U.S. could enter a formal treaty with Israel, voted upon by Congress, that would provide a U.S. ""nuclear guarantee"" to Israel in event of an Iranian breakout. In short, the moment is dire but not hopeless.  What is clearly needed is a cease fire.  Secretary Kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction Sunday when he said Netanyahu is welcome to speak in the U.S. on Tuesday.  Others should now take up the cause, recognizing that our real adversaries are not in Tel Aviv or Washington but among those in Teheran who support terror and mayhem across the Middle East.","David Gergen: Netanyahu's speech is a terrible mistake of his making but he deserves a hearing .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Australia's transport safety chief has always described himself as a pessimist. But Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, says that as search teams scour the depths of the Indian Ocean for any sign of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, he is confident they will find the plane, if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking. ""If anything, I'm slightly more optimistic than six months ago, because we have more confidence in the data, and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards,"" Dolan said. But as the first anniversary of MH370's disappearance approaches, with no trace of the missing plane found, not everyone shares his outlook. That includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones. And for many, the decision in late January by Malaysia to officially declare MH370 an accident, enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol, was painfully premature. ""How can they say that, when there is no proof that the plane has crashed?"" asked Wen Wang Cheng, whose son Wen Yung Sheng was one of 153 Chinese nationals on board.  ""We have to get the facts,"" Wen said. What families have been told, they say, simply isn't good enough.  Anger, frustration, and distrust pushed some relatives, including Wen, to fly from China to Kuala Lumpur last month, to demand more. But when families submitted a letter to Malaysia Airlines asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation, a written response from the company's CEO revealed little that hadn't already been said. At 12:41 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, en route to Beijing. Less than an hour later, the Boeing 777-200ER was flying over the South China Sea. Air traffic controllers in Malaysia radioed the crew to contact controllers in Ho Chi Minh City for its onward journey through Vietnamese airspace. The crew acknowledged the request, thanking Kuala Lumpur controllers with a routine reply: ""Good night, Malaysian Three-Seven-Zero.""  Minutes later, the plane disappeared from radar. Malaysian authorities revealed days later that military radar had tracked the plane as it turned back to the west, flew across the Malay Peninsula, and up the Strait of Malacca, before flying out of radar range and vanishing once again. The search area widened, then shifted off the coast of Western Australia, when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or ""handshakes"" between the plane and an Inmarsat telecommunications satellite, that MH370 eventually turned south, and flew for hours into the Indian Ocean. Roughly a week's sail from the coast of Western Australia, ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), work around the clock, methodically ticking off sections of sea floor. In early February a new ship, the Fugro Supporter, joined the search carrying the HUGIN 4500, a programmable unmanned submarine, now scanning areas that other equipment couldn't safely cover, including steep mountain slopes. The ship joins the Discovery and Fugro Equator, both operated by a Dutch survey firm, along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix. ""I asked specifically to come on this job, because it's a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people,"" James Hancock, a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the North Sea, told CNN's Anna Coren, as he prepared to embark on a trip on the Fugro Discovery that could last up to six weeks. Since October, more than 24,000 square kilometers -- roughly 40% of what the ATSB calls the ""priority search area"" -- has been scanned, with the remainder of the work scheduled to be finished by May before weather conditions worsen as the southern winter approaches. For now, teams are searching mostly using devices called towfish, which are dragged close to the ocean floor on cables up to 10 kilometers long. It's tough work, even when conditions are perfect.  A number of cyclones, producing waves of up to 16 meters, put the brakes on the search in early February. Dolan is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations, dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as ""part of the deal."" The current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts, combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range, speed, and altitude. Search ships are focused along the so-called 7th arc, or ""partial handshake,"" where international investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel. ""The thing that really impresses me most about this investigation was how much information we were able to gain through mathematics and science,"" said CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie. But Soucie, a former FAA accident investigator, is not optimistic that the deep-sea search teams will find what they're looking for.  ""I know that they've searched in the most probable areas where it would have been, and it's not there,"" he said. Jeff Wise, a science journalist and author of ""The Plane That Wasn't There,"" took that skepticism a step further, saying it's time to reexamine all the clues.  His latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data, and that MH370 may have instead flown north toward Kazakhstan. ""This is not a normal investigation.  They need to throw out the book,"" said Wise. ""This is unlike anything that's happened in aviation."" But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data ""accurately and unambiguously"" shows MH370 went down near the 7th arc. ""The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy,"" Exner said. ""They are looking exactly where I expect the plane to be found."" The ATSB's Dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone.  ""We haven't given up.  Quite the opposite,"" he said. If search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of MH370, Australia, which has been leading the search at Malaysia's request, will also lead salvage and recovery efforts, according to the ATSB Chief Commissioner. But Malaysia, Australia, and China, which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight, have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur, Dolan said. It is unclear what will happen if search teams complete their current mission without finding any sign of the plane. Australia has allocated roughly $48 million to the current phase of the search, with Malaysia promising to contribute equally to the cost.  In January, the Malaysian government said it is committed ""to continue all reasonable efforts to bring closure to this unfortunate tragedy."" One possibility is that the deep-sea search could be extended outside the boundaries of the current priority area, north or south along the 7th arc. The ATSB would not comment on the likelihood of expanding the search, saying that it was a ""decision for governments."" Malaysia also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into MH370 around March 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have. Aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until MH370 is found. ""Without knowing what caused it, you can't fix it, you can't make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said Soucie.  ""And I think that's really the biggest tragedy of this, if they don't find the airplane."" For the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year, it's about finding answers. ""It's very difficult to hear the world closure, when there is no closure,"" Jacquita Gonzales, the wife of lead steward Patrick Gomes, told CNN's Andrew Stevens. And while Gonzales says she holds out hope her husband could return home alive, she is prepared for a difficult discovery. ""If it's there and there's debris, we can have closure and we can lay him at peace. Because I don't think he's at peace right now."" The search for MH370 continues. CNN's Andrew Stevens, Anna Coren, Tim Schwarz, Felicia Wong, Chieu Luu, and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","Ahead of one year anniversary, search chief says he's confident Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will eventually be found .

"(CNN)Venezuela has given the U.S. Embassy in Caracas 15 days to downsize its staff from 100 personnel to 17. ""With respect to bringing the number of staff at the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela to 17, a period of 15 days will be given to decide which staff will stay in our country,"" said Venezuela's Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez on Monday. Venezuela's official news agency AVN (Agencia Venezolana de Noticias) said the U.S. Embassy has been asked to reduce its personnel to a staff of 17 to match the number of Venezuelan personnel working in their embassy in the United States. Last month, the U.S. government approved a law under which Venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their U.S. assets frozen. Following that decision, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that that Americans will need visas to visit Venezuela. Moreover, a group of prominent U.S. officials, current and retired, will be banned from entering Venezuela because of what Maduro said was their involvement in ""bombing Iraq, Syria and Vietnam"" and other ""terrorist"" actions. The officials include George W. Bush, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, former CIA Director George Tenet and several current members of Congress, including Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Bob Menendez and Mario Diaz-Balart. On Saturday, Maduro also said an unspecified number of Americans were arrested ""a few days ago"" for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities. The President said they included an American pilot of Latin American origin, arrested in the southwest border state of Táchira. He said the pilot was found in possession of ""all kinds of documents"" and was being interrogated by the authorities, though he did not identify him.

"(CNN)NASA's tractor-trailer sized Dawn spacecraft will snuggle up to Ceres on Friday, getting close enough to be pulled into orbit and to complete the first mission to a dwarf planet. ""I'm just delighted that Dawn is now on the doorstep of Ceres,"" Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division said in a news conference on Monday. Dawn is expected to begin orbiting Ceres around 7:20 a.m. ET, but NASA says it may take an hour or two to confirm it. Ceres was discovered in 1801 (Pluto wasn't found until 1930) and was the first object found in our solar system's main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It's about 310 million miles from Earth and was initially classified as planet, then later demoted to an asteroid, only to be reclassified again as a dwarf planet. The early images from Dawn already have mission scientists excited. ""Ceres has really surprised us,"" said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator. ""The first images have produced some really puzzling features."" One of the puzzles -- two bright white spots that showed up in photographs taken by Dawn in February. ""These spots were extremely surprising to the team, and they have been puzzling to the team and to everybody who's seen them."" The spots are in a 57-mile wide (92 kilometer) crater. The spot in the center of the crater is about twice as bright as the spot on the side of the crater. ""This extreme brightness was really unexpected,"" Raymond said. The Dawn team is ""really, really excited about this feature because it is unique in the solar system."" Raymond says the brightness is consistent with highly reflective materials such as ice or salts. This might help add more credence to a discovery made in 2014 by ESA's Herschel infrared space observatory. The telescope detected water vapor around Ceres coming from the same area where the spots are located. ""It might be related to that water vapor emission,"" Raymond said. Herschel's scientists also said their research showed Ceres has an atmosphere. Raymond said her team is keen to confirm that. Scientists expect to learn more as Dawn is gradually lowered to about 235 miles above the surface of Ceres in December. ""The mystery will be solved,"" she said. But Ceres seems to have lots of oddities. ""We see many strange features,"" Raymond said. ""We see smooth areas, some areas that are chaotically fractured and we see craters of all sizes."" One of the other things scientists noticed is how round Ceres is. Being round is very important because it is the main characteristic of a planet -- a title that Ceres had -- then lost. Ceres was demoted to an asteroid because 19th century astronomers couldn't be sure it was round. But it was bumped up to a dwarf planet when that category was created in 2006. According to the International Astronomical Union -- the group that came up with the definition -- a dwarf planet is similar to the eight main planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) except it has a lot of other stuff orbiting with it around the sun. The IAU recognizes five dwarf planets: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake and Haumea. Scientists say there could be many more of these small worlds that haven't been discovered. Dawn was launched on September 27, 2007, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its journey has taken it past Mars and on a short layover at the asteroid Vesta. On Friday, Dawn will make its closest approach yet to Ceres, flying about 25,000 miles from it, according to Robert Mase, project manager for the Dawn mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""That's about 10 times closer than the moon is to the Earth,"" he said. But the beautiful images coming in from Dawn will stop for awhile. ""We're now on the dark side, so we're going to have a blackout for about the next month until we get back over toward the lit side of the body,"" he said. But he says the ""floodgates will open"" when its main science mission starts in April. Dawn will stay in orbit around Ceres for years, even after its primary mission ends in June 2016. But at some point, it will run out of hydrazine, the fuel used to guide the spacecraft. Between now and then -- mission managers hope Dawn will help solve the mysteries of Ceres and add to our knowledge of how our solar system formed.","NASA's Dawn spacecraft arrives Friday at Ceres .

"Moscow (CNN)Four days after he was gunned down by an unknown assailant in the heart of Moscow, former Russian Deputy Prime Minister and outspoken Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov was laid to rest Tuesday in a ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners. His coffin was lowered into the ground at the Troyekurovskoe Cemetery before family, friends and dignitaries, after being carried in procession through Moscow. Mourners laid wreaths, some with ribbons in the colors of the Russian flag, reflecting tributes to a man whom supporters called a true Russian patriot. Earlier, a stream of people took part in a somber memorial service at the Sakharov Center in Moscow. Some held flowers as they filed past the open casket of the prominent Kremlin critic and paid respects to his mother, Dina Eydman, and his children Anton and Zhanna. Hundreds more lined up in the cold outside. Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister under President Vladimir Putin who is now a leading opposition figure and worked closely with Nemtsov, was among the mourners to speak at the service. He said he believed Nemtsov, known for his outspoken views, was killed out of revenge for his politics. He also said he thought the killers would be brought to justice, under the next government of Russia if not the current one. The assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories. Though politically marginalized in recent years, Nemtsov was one of Putin's most vocal critics, and many suspect the Kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement. Putin has vowed to bring those responsible to justice. No one has yet been arrested and authorities have put forward a number of theories, including that the murder was an act of ""provocation"" intended to destabilize Russia, that it was connected to the conflict in Ukraine, that Islamist extremists were involved or that it was linked to Nemtsov's international business affairs. The Moscow Investigative Committee said in a statement on its website Tuesday that ""all scenarios"" are being considered and that it is taking all necessary steps. ""Eyewitness are being questioned, CCTV footage is already being analyzed. Evidence has been collected. A number of tests were carried out -- among them are ballistic, medical examination and trace evidence,"" it said. The memorial service was hosted by Pavel Sheremet, a Russian journalist known for leaving a Russian state TV channel in protest at the Kremlin's current policies on Ukraine. Other prominent Russian figures at the service included Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's spokeswoman Natalya Timakova, and former Finance Minister Alexey Kudrin. Russian economist Yevgeny Yasin, who served as economy minister between 1994 and 1997 and is now an academic, said: ""Nemtsov always said everything that others were afraid to say."" Evgeniya Albats, editor-in-chief of The New Times magazine, described Nemtsov in a speech as an amazing friend and a fearless politician. She added, ""This murder is impossible to forgive. It's on Putin's conscience."" Foreign dignitaries included U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft, who said Nemtsov would be remembered as a Russian patriot, and former UK Prime Minister John Major. Major told CNN: ""It's clearly a very sad day for Russians, it's a very sad day for Boris' family, and I'm personally extremely saddened by what has happened. ""I knew him in the 1990s, I admired him, I admired what he stood for, and I hope now a thorough investigation will determine who is responsible for this outrage."" The opposition politician was shot Friday night as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, 23. Duritskaya -- the only known witness to the shooting -- left Moscow for Kiev late on Monday. She had been staying at the apartment of an aide to Nemtsov under constant police guard. Her mother, Inna Duritskaya, told CNN on Monday that her daughter faces constant psychological pressure from Moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death. The Moscow Investigative Committee said Duritskaya was not detained while in Moscow and that she was offered witness protection, which she turned down. Duritskaya was free to leave at any point but wanted to give her testimony and contribute to the investigation process, ""understanding the important of it for the investigation,"" the statement said. ""It is needless to state how important her testimony is."" Edward Lucas, a senior editor for The Economist and a senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN that the manner of Nemtsov's death was highly suspicious. ""The circumstances of his shooting point very much to official involvement,"" he said. ""If it was some random, ragtag extremist militia from eastern Ukraine killing him, I doubt they would've been able to do it with such precision in the heart of Moscow."" Lucas also said that the recent history of politically motivated killings in Russia suggested that the investigation would come to little. ""One of the signal things that they all have in common is that they are not cleared up. We have a lot of bluster at the time of the death, promises of investigation, but either the culprits are never found or the culprits who are found are very unconvincing ones and the people who gave the orders are never identified."" Meanwhile, he said, the Kremlin continues to pump out propaganda which suggests opposition activists or those critical of Russia's involvement in Ukraine are traitors to their country. Some of Nemtsov's supporters accuse the Kremlin, if not of direct involvement, of creating an atmosphere of hatred which fostered the killing. Not everyone who hoped to attend Nemtsov's funeral has been able to do so. Latvia's former foreign minister and European Parliament member Sandra Kalniete said she was denied entry to Russia on Monday night on spurious grounds. Speaking to CNN by phone from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, Kalniete said she was finally told she was refused entry ""according to Russia's code of law regarding the defense and security of the Russian state and the general health of the public."" She had intended to represent Latvia and the European People's Party -- the biggest parliamentary group in the European Parliament -- at the funeral, she said. ""Like many I admired him, I admired his joyfulness and eloquence,"" Kalniete said. ""My wish was not to cause any danger to Russia. I just wanted to go to pay tribute to a political personality, Boris Nemtsov."" The European People's Party said it was the third time a member of the European Parliament had been stopped at the Russian border. Thousands of Nemtsov supporters gathered Sunday in Moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old, who was deputy prime minister during President Boris Yeltsin's administration in the 1990s. The event took place the same day Nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in Moscow decrying Russia's policies on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said last weekend that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported. Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. Police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches, Russia's official Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. Russia's Investigative Committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information leading to the arrest of the killer. It said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity. CNN's Matthew Chance and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

"(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's ""Finding Jesus,"" which premiered Sunday evening. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions to Facebook during the show. Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. Vance Lipsey: Is there a better way to check the shroud than carbon dating? I've been told carbon dating is very inaccurate. Goodacre:  Actually, carbon dating is an excellent way to ascertain the date of an artifact. Many are disappointed, not surprisingly, that the shroud dated to between AD 1260 and 1390. I recall my own disappointment (but not surprise) on hearing the results back in 1988. But the scientists doing the carbon dating were not amateurs, and the samples were tested in three separate labs. Moreover, the carbon date cohered with other evidence that the shroud was a medieval forgery, like the fact that there is no evidence of its existence until the 14th century. Cynthia Restivo: So I know the carbon dating was off, but wasn't it later shown that the piece of cloth used for the testing was a section that had been repaired after some fire damage or something? Which would explain why it dated different? Goodacre:  No, that's not been established. Those who defend the authenticity of the shroud often say the sample might have been taken from a part of the shroud that was repaired after it was damaged by fire in the 16th century. But this is special pleading. The scientists who took the sample knew what they were doing. Professor Christopher Ramsey noted that the unusual weave on the sample matched the weave on the rest of the shroud perfectly. Beth A Hafele: So were Jesus' wrists nailed or his hands? All shows and movies have his hands nailed. Goodacre: One of the curiosities about the Turin Shroud is that the figure appears to be nailed through the wrists. This has long intrigued those who have studied crucifixion because there is some anatomical plausibility here -- nails through the wrists would support the body better than nails through the palms of the hands. It is just possible that the bones of the only crucified victim we have, Jehohanan, show a nail mark above the wrist, but this is disputed. There are two further factors here. One is that victims of crucifixion may often have been tied instead of (or as well as) being nailed. Also, some dispute whether the shroud figure is nailed through the wrists. (See Antonio Lombatti's graphic.) Virginia McCoy: Once again, Mary Magdalene is totally ignored. They used the Gospel that described Peter as having discovered the empty tomb. When other Gospels describe Magdalene as the one that discovered it and then she called out to others. Goodacre: Well, you will be pleased to hear that there is an entire episode devoted to Mary Magdalene in this series, and her identity and role are fully explored, including her presence at the empty tomb. I think you'll enjoy it. Jacques Lemire: About the @CNN program on Jesus. Good stuff, but I am not sure about Jesus crying out in pain. A psalm: The lamb is silent. Goodacre:  I found Adam Bond's portrayal of Jesus' death in the drama really compelling, and his cry is quite arresting. It's true that Isaiah 53:7 says ""He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.""  Many early Christians saw this as a prophecy of the way that Jesus, their Messiah, died. It is apparently fulfilled in Jesus' silence during his trial (e.g. John 19:9-10), but in all four Gospels, Jesus is vocal on the cross, and in the end he cries out with a loud voice (e.g. Mark 15:34 and 37), so the drama makes good sense there. Thanks again for watching and for all your great questions, and apologies that we could not answer all of them. I was really thrilled to be involved, and I loved working with the production team behind ""Finding Jesus."" I think they have put together a superb series, which blends visually compelling drama and intelligent commentary from a wide range of experts. I look forward to hearing everyone's reactions to the remaining five episodes!","Religion professor Mark Goodacre appears in each episode of the program .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group already blamed for numerous horrific attacks in West Africa, posted a graphic video online Monday showing the apparent beheadings of two men who the group said were suspected spies. The six-minute video shows two men with their arms tied to their backs. They are made to face the camera on their knees, with another man towering over one of them brandishing a knife. The knife-wielding man reaches toward the throat of one of the kneeling men, then the video switches scenes to show what appear to be the bloody severed heads of the two men placed on their headless bodies. The SITE Intelligence group, which monitors extremist activities, released a translated transcript from the video, including what SITE called an ""interrogation"" of one of the two men. The man identifies himself as a farmer from the Nigerian town of Baga. He says he was told by a policeman that if he provided information about ""the residents who live in here ... I will become rich and never go back to be a farmer again."" The apparent beheadings then follow on the video. SITE said the video, which included Arabic, English and French subtitles, was posted online via Twitter and ""borrows certain elements from productions"" of beheadings by ISIS. The video was posted by the media division of Boko Haram, SITE said. Although this is the first purported beheading video Boko Haram posted online.‎ the group has previously issued more detailed and extremely violent beheading videos directly to journalists through intermediaries. Unlike the video posted Monday, previous ones have shown the actual decapitations. ‎In October 2014, Boko Haram handed out a 10-minute video showing the decapitation of a Nigerian military pilot the group said it had seized a month earlier after shooting down his fighter jet during a mission against Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria. ‎In April 2014, the Islamist group released 16-minute video showing what it said was the beheading of a soldier its fighters captured in a battle in Sambisa forest‎, the group's main enclave. In February 2014, another video showing the beheading of an alleged informant who led the military to a Boko Haram camp in Sambisa forest during an offensive was issued by the group. And in February 2010, Boko Haram released a 12-minute video in which two policemen were beheaded in an undisclosed location. Those videos all ended with a speech from an ""executioner"" warning that the group would carry out similar punishment for anyone it captures supporting the Nigerian government against it. ‎Observers of Boko Haram, which has inflicted years of terror on northern Nigeria, note that its actions in the past six months have frequently mimicked those of ISIS -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that's very much in the ISIS ""style."" Jacob Zenn, who follows Boko Haram's operations and propaganda closely, recently told CNN, ""It's clear Boko Haram is leaning toward ISIS in terms of doctrine, ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations."" In terms of ideology, Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, has said that kidnappings and hostage-taking are approved in the Quran, a claim ISIS also makes. ""Our hostages are Christians or corrupted Muslims who follow the Christian way,"" he said last year, referring to schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok, Nigeria, most of whom remain missing. ISIS later referred to the Chibok abductions in its kidnapping of hundreds of Yazidi women and girls. Zenn and other analysts point out that recent Boko Haram videos have resembled the polished media productions of ISIS. Zenn notes they ""have the same choreography and lens angles as ISIS."" Boko Haram has begun using ISIS symbolism in its media productions and operations. The Nigerian press noted with alarm last July that Boko Haram militants had been seen raising ISIS' rayat al-uqab flag along the Nigerian-Cameroon border. Recent videos have featured the same flag. CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","A video posted by Boko Haram shows the apparent beheading of two men .

"(CNN)It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again. House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration. McConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again. Yet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. The ""tea party"" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for ""practical"" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. When House Republicans pushed their ""stop-gap"" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin.","Julian Zelizer: GOP hogs the spotlight with funding deadlines like the battle over money for the Department of Homeland Security.

"Dili, East Timor (CNN)Stacey Addison, who says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine, is headed home. Addison boarded a plane Tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to Oregon. ""I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said. ""This is terrific news for Stacey, for her family, and for all the Oregonians who have followed Stacey's story and helped support her from afar,"" Merkley said in a statement. Addison, 41, was detained in September in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. She was released in December but she still couldn't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. Former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, hosted her temporarily at his home. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Kero told CNN in November that the case was a ""nightmare."" Journalist Wayne Lovell in Dili and CNN's Greg Morrison from Atlanta. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia in New York and Jason Hanna in Atlanta also contributed.","Stacey Addison was detained by police in September during a taxi journey .

"(CNN)As the world digests the shock of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov's brutal murder in front of the Kremlin on Friday, everybody is trying to determine who was behind it. The Russian authorities were quick to throw out a number of theories, which ranged from the CIA to Ukraine, and even to Nemtsov's relationship troubles. While most people have discounted these out of hand, there are a surprising number of people who have bought into the statement, released by Vladimir Putin's spokesman, that ""Boris Nemtsov was only slightly more than an average statistical citizen"" -- implying that the Russian President would have no reason to want him dead. First of all, that is not true. Nemtsov may not have been a significant threat two years ago when oil prices were high and Russians were feeling politically apathetic -- but with oil prices down 50%, the ruble down 50%, the economy shrinking and companies firing people, a charismatic opposition politician like Nemtsov is a real and direct threat to Putin, who is terrified of experiencing a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia, especially when there is an unpredictable economic crisis brewing. Nemtsov's corruption exposés laid out, in damning detail, the truth behind the personal wealth of Putin and his cronies; one doesn't need to be an expert to see the similarities with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Kiev following popular uprisings in February of last year. Nemtsov was also preparing a paper documenting the experiences of Russian soldiers in Ukraine -- one that could have dealt a catastrophic blow to the Russian propaganda machine about the Ukrainian conflict. And he was instrumental in organizing the March 1 anti-war rally in Moscow -- a protest march he would have led, had he not been gunned down just hours before. The benefit of this murder to Putin wasn't just that it eliminated one opponent of the President, but that it will terrorize an entire class of dissidents. READ MORE: Other critics of Putin who ended up dead . Putin has a history of viciously attacking the most important person in any given group of enemies, in order to send a message to the rest of them. In 2003, he did this by arresting and imprisoning the richest oligarch in the country, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. When Khodorkovsky was put on trial in 2004, Putin allowed the television cameras film the wealthiest man in the country sitting in a cage. Imagine that you were the 17th richest man in Russia, and you saw a man more successful and influential than you sitting in a courtroom cage. What would you do? Anything you could to avoid meeting the same fate; in the case of Russia's oligarchs, they all fell into line and were never a problem for the President again. The same thing happened with the murder of investigative journalist and vocal Putin critic Anna Politkovskaya in 2006. Although Kremlin involvement in her killing was never proved, the number of brave, outspoken investigative journalists in Russia dropped to only a handful after her death. Now, in 2015, one of the most vocal opposition leaders has been gunned down directly in front of the Kremlin. In addition to the political benefits of Nemtsov's demise, his killing also sends a clear and chilling message to anyone else who is similarly outspoken against Putin: It doesn't matter how well known you are, how many heads of state in the West know you, or how many people would be outraged by your death. If you cause problems, you can and will be killed. Not only does this have a powerful effect on other opposition leaders, but it puts a primordial fear into the minds of average Russian citizens, who may now think twice before taking to the streets to protest corruption, the war in Ukraine, or the poor standards of living. No matter your agenda, is it worth your life? The West needs to act urgently, with actions, not words. This is the most brazen high-profile assassination of a political opposition leader in modern Russian history. So what can be done? Firstly, create, without any delay, an independent international inquiry into Nemtsov's assassination. No investigation conducted solely by the Russian government would be credible under the circumstances, because it cannot impartially examine the possible complicity of Putin or the Russian secret service in this act. There are statutory instruments in place for this kind of investigation, using the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and the United Nations. Secondly, Boris Nemtsov was a passionate supporter of ""Magnitsky sanctions,"" visa bans and asset freezes targeted specifically at kleptocrats and human rights abusers. It would befit his legacy if European governments would finally impose these sanctions, and stop accepting the billions of dollars which beneficiaries of the corrupt Putin regime are able to keep safely in Western banks. These sanctions will also act as a real consequence if the Russian government refuses to cooperate with an independent inquiry into Nemtsov's murder. The only reason that someone was bold enough to kill Boris Nemtsov was because a string of previous murders were met with words of condemnation, but no real action from the West. Yushenkov, Politkovskaya, Shchekochikhin, Klebnikhov, Estemirova, Markelov, Magnitsky and now Nemtsov. How many others need to die before real action is taken? This is a watershed moment, not just for Russia, but for the West. We have a responsibility to the future Nemtsovs of this world to make sure that these assassinations will no longer go unpunished.","Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov murdered in Moscow on Friday .

"Jerusalem (CNN)At times, he got raucous applause during his speech in Washington on Tuesday. But the reactions to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message that may matter most came in Israel and Iran -- where emotions ran high, both in support and in opposition. In an address before the U.S. Congress punctuated by one-liners, Netanyahu claimed that ongoing talks about Iran's nuclear program ""would all but guarantee that Iran gets nuclear weapons, lots of them."" He portrayed Iran's leaders as untrustworthy and bloodthirsty, intent on annihilating Israel and threatening its allies. That viewpoint, not surprisingly, didn't play well in Tehran. While the speech wasn't carried live, Iranians quickly pounced with heated condemnations of Netanyahu and characterized him as a liar. TV banners labeled the speech an example of ""Iranaphobia,"" with commentators saying that it humiliated U.S. President Barack Obama and deepened the wedge between Israel and its longtime allies. ""This speech was a sign of the weakness and extreme isolation of radical groups,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said of what she called ""a deceitful theater play."" ""... The continued lies of Netanyahu regarding the aims and intentions of the peaceful nuclear program of Iran are repetitive and sickening,"" she said. The reaction in Israel was more diverse, albeit predictable, reflecting the divisions there ahead of its March 17 election. Isaac Herzog -- the Labor Party chairman hoping to become Israel's next Prime Minister  -- said that Netanyahu's speech, ""as impressive as it may be, did not prevent the Iranians' nuclear program"" nor did it impact talks now underway in Montreux, Switzerland, to address it. What the speech did accomplish, according to Herzog, is ""greatly undermine ... the relationship between Israel and the United States,"" with Obama opposing Netanyahu's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks. ""It will not change the position of (Obama's) administration and will only broaden the crisis of our great friend and our strategic ally,"" Herzog said of the speech. ""That price, we will have to pay."" On the other side of the debate are people such as Danny Danon, a former Israel deputy defense minister. ""Prime Minister Netanyahu sounded the alarm for the survival of our country,"" Danon said from Jerusalem. ""We are worried. And I am very proud of our prime minister, ... who said exactly what we feel: It is a bad deal."" The speech and the reactions to it came ahead of a March 24 deadline in which negotiators from six world powers, plus Iran, are trying to reach a long-term deal about Iran's nuclear program. That looming date is why Netanyahu said he was compelled to address Congress at the invitation of House Speaker John Boehner (and without the advance knowledge of Obama). Prior to boarding a plane Sunday in Tel Aviv, the Prime Minister called his foray to Washington ""a crucial trip, even a historical one."" The Iranian nuclear deadline isn't the only one looming for Netanyahu, or even the most immediate one. Because of Israeli elections in two weeks, the man who has called himself the ""messenger of all the people of Israel"" might not be that for much longer. While it happened some 6,000 miles away, his speech in Washington on Tuesday could sway hearts and minds back home -- some admiring his strong leadership in protecting Israel and others, like Herzog, upset over how he has roiled relations with Obama and undermined peace efforts. Given Israeli election guidelines, TV networks pulled Herzog's speech from air for fear it could be construed as campaigning. Netanyahu's remarks were on a 5-minute delay for the same reason. Nachshon Carmi said he is ""totally"" convinced Netanyahu primarily aimed to speak to voters at home as much as to affect the American government's decisions on Iran. ""I think this is a classic move of distracting the voters from domestic issues to foreign policy,"" Carmi said in Jerusalem. A fellow Israeli citizen, Malynnda Littky, disagrees. She thinks that Netanyahu had every right to make his case in Washington if he believes an Iranian deal could affect Israel's future. ""He's giving a speech on a topic he knows a lot about and is important to us,"" Littky said. ""But it's still just a speech."" Given longstanding issues with the Palestinian territories and the fact that Israel is surrounded by nations with predominantly Muslim populations, Israeli leaders have ample experience with being isolated and on the defensive. They've also proven a willingness time and again to act out, if they feel doing so will safeguard their national security. Iran has been a case in point. Netanyahu has been the loudest voice in speaking about international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. If the rest of the world can't act to stop this from happening, he's suggested, then Israel will. There's precedent about how that might be done: Israel bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. At the time, then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin drew a line in the sand, essentially vowing that no Israeli enemy could develop weapons of mass destruction and that Israel would defend itself ""with all the means at our disposal."" That mentality is what appears to be driving Netanyahu, who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of Iran (whose supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted last year that Israel should be ""annihilated."") The Prime Minister has been just as forthright in challenging international efforts to strike a deal with Tehran, an effort that's been accelerated since a more conciliatory Hassan Rouhani became Iran's president in 2013. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. The Switzerland talks aim to bridge ""gaps"" between the various parties, with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif telling CNN on Tuesday that ""we're starting to move forward, but it's a lot of work."" So is Netanyahu having a disruptive effect on these negotiations? ""He's trying to,"" Zarif said. ""But I don't think trying to create tension and conflict helps anybody."" One thing that Netanyahu has certainly done is get the attention of Iranians. News about what happened in Washington was the biggest item in Iranian media and high on the minds of people on the streets of Tehran. In addition to citizens and TV commentators, Iranian officials took notice as well. But that doesn't mean they are taking much stock in what Netanyahu said. Massoumeh Ebtekar, Iran's Vice President for Environmental Affairs, told AFP from Paris that she didn't think Netanyahu's opinion ""carries much weight."" ""They are making their efforts to derail the deal,"" Ebtekar said of Israeli officials. ""But I think the more logical lobbies on both sides are looking forward to a solution."" There is a widespread opinion in Iran that Netanyahu has long been singularly intent on going after Iran, even before he started his second stint as Prime Minister in 2009. His position is often conflated with that of the United States, a view that could be exacerbated by the loud reception Netanyahu got as he entered the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday and all the times cheers and applause interrupted his speech. Of course, just because Iranians are mindful of what Netanyahu said doesn't mean they will change their minds. Changing minds in Israel, ahead of the coming election, is another matter. Whether Tuesday's speech will do that can't be ascertained until there's credible polling after his remarks, or arguably once citizens go to the polls in two weeks. Until then, polls from various Israeli news outlets suggest a tight race. Some project Netanyahu's Likud party winning fewer seats than the so-called Zionist alliance opposing him, though exactly who will end up as prime minister depends on which parties join forces after the votes are cast. Most Israelis don't think that Netanyahu has any hope of impacting opinions and policies out of Iran with his speech, Bar-Ilan University professor Eytan Gilboa said. But many are worried about what Gilboa calls the worst crisis in the decades-long relationship between Israel and the United States, with Tuesday's speech doing little to help change the perception ""there is very little trust between"" Obama and Netanyahu. Speaking from Jerusalem, Carmi said he understands the depth of this division but doesn't think the damage is irreparable. ""The connection between Israel and the United States goes so deep and is on so many levels,"" he said. ""Yes, we're going through a bad time. But we'll get over it.""

"(CNN)Anna Duritskaya, the Ukrainian model who was with opposition politician Boris Nemtsov when he was shot in Moscow, is now the focus of intense interest. A beautiful brunette more than 30 years his junior, she had been his girlfriend for 2½ years. So what is known about her? The 23-year-old had been out for dinner with Nemtsov on Friday night. She had suggested getting a taxi, but Nemtsov didn't want to, preferring to walk, Duritskaya's mother said. As the pair crossed a bridge in central Moscow, the 55-year-old Kremlin critic was gunned down by unknown attackers. His girlfriend was holding his hand and heard what sounded like a clapping sound, her mother, Inna Duritskaya, told CNN. Nemtsov went limp and fell to the ground, fatally shot in the back. Duritskaya is the only known witness to the shooting, which occurred 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin but appears not to have been captured on security cameras. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter called her right after she called police to raise the alarm. ""She was crying and she was saying Boris had been killed and he's lying next to me,"" Inna Duritskaya said. ""She was in such shock she couldn't say anything else. Just, 'Mum, Boris is killed, and he's lying next to me.' "" On Monday, the Russian television station Dozhd published an interview with Anna Duritskaya. She told the interviewer that she did not see who killed Nemtsov, but that when she turned around, she saw a light-colored car driving away. In an interview with CNN, Ilya Yashin, a political ally and friend of Nemtsov's, said that Duritskaya had telephoned him immediately after the shooting and said there were several men in the car containing the shooter. Over the weekend, Russian authorities questioned Duritskaya about what she saw. While in Moscow, the model was staying at the apartment of an Nemtsov aide under constant police guard. But Moscow's Investigative Committee insisted that she was not detained and could have left at any time. ""She said she wanted to give the testimony and took part in investigative activities understanding the importance of it for the investigation,"" a statement released Tuesday said. ""We received no complaints from Anna Duritskaya or her lawyer during her stay in Moscow. Only today, after investigative activities are over she left Russia."" The model left the Russian capital Monday night bound for Kiev, Ukraine, said Yevhen Perebyinis, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry. Inna Duritskaya told CNN that while being questioned, her daughter faced constant psychological pressure from Moscow authorities and that she fears she will be implicated in his death. In a Skype interview with Dozhd, Anna Duritskaya indicated her continued presence in Moscow after the shooting was not from choice -- and seemed to appeal to be allowed to leave. ""Now I have a status of a witness, I gave all evidence possible, I don't understand why I'm still on the territory of Russia. I want to go to my mother who is ill, who is in very difficult psychological condition,"" she said. ""During three days, they have been taking me together with security in police cars to the Investigation Committee and conduct the investigation. They are not explaining when they are going to release me and the reason they are keeping me here."" Perhaps not. According to the Investigative Committee, Duritskaya signed a witness protocol and confidentiality agreement, which is standard procedure in Russia. It states that she will not share information she gave to investigators or any preliminary findings of the investigation, the committee said. ""Leaving Russia, Duritskaya expressed a wish to continue to cooperate with the investigation and to participate in any ongoing investigation if needed,"" it added. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader. ""Of course when I heard she was dating him, it was a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""Then when I met him in person, I liked him a lot as a person. He was straightforward, he treated my daughter very well, she was happy. And I couldn't influence it anyway; my daughter did what she wanted to. Of course, I was worried and scared, but I couldn't change it anyway."" Duritskaya's reported return to Kiev means she was unable to attend her partner's memorial service and funeral Tuesday. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","Anna Duritskaya, a 23-year-old Ukrainian model, was Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend .

"(CNN)A New York man says his smartphone blew up in his pocket and that he wound up in a hospital. Erik Johnson of Lindenhurst says his iPhone 5C spontaneously erupted in extreme heat while it was in his pants pocket, giving him second- and third-degree burnson his leg the size of a football. He was headed to a wake for his cousin in New Jersey on February 14, Johnson said, and he dropped his car keys. ""When I went to bend over, I heard a pop,"" he told CNN. ""I heard a sizzling, and I ended up ripping my pants off to stop it from burning me."" Johnson said he didn't know what was causing the pain at first and there was no warning -- just an extreme burn and a lot of pain. In a panic, he quickly started ripping at his pants as the phone began to melt the edges of his pocket shut, he said. ""I was trying to get it out of my pocket,"" he said. ""It started burning right through my pants. It was burning my leg, and I had to get my pants off somehow."" Johnson's brother, who was with him at the time, decided driving him to the hospital would be faster than dialing 911, Johnson said. They drove to the Bayonne Medical Center in New Jersey. After being evaluated in the emergency room, Johnson was taken by ambulance to the Burn Center at Staten Island University Hospital. The burn center confirmed to CNN that he spent 10 days there receiving treatment. ""I still can't believe it,"" Johnson said. ""I've never dealt with anything like this before."" He works as an operating engineer in New York City, maintaining escalators, cranes and forklifts. He said now he is at home with family in Lindenhurst, and a nurse comes in every day to change his bandage. In the meantime, he said, he hasn't even thought about buying a new phone. Mike Della, a personal injury lawyer on Long Island who is representing Johnson, says despite two phone calls and a letter, Apple had not yet responded to his queries about why his client's phone suddenly exploded in heat. CNN reached out to Apple, and the company stated that it is looking into the incident. Johnson purchased the phone last year and had not been using a battery case or third-party charger, Della said. ""First and foremost, we have to find out how this happened and prevent it from happening ever again,"" Della told CNN. ""That's the whole goal here. Is the product safe?"" Della said because of this case, he now is quick to take extra precautions with his phone. ""Now, every single time I have my iPhone, instead of putting it in my pocket, I put it in the seat next to me because of this case,"" he said. ""My wife does the same thing, and so does everyone else at the (law) firm. It's a little scary."" ""You shouldn't have to worry about your phone exploding,"" he said.","Erik Johnson says when he bent over to pick up his keys, ""I heard a pop""

"(CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. ""Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams,"" says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. ""Most patients do not recover well,"" said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. ""Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was,"" Turk said. ""For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness."" It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. ""I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from,"" said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. ""When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can,"" Arrow, now retired, told CNN. ""But he gets the job done no matter what."" All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. ""I knew my resume was competitive,"" he said. ""I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone."" He began to wonder if ""having a cane and an unusual gait"" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. ""I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them,"" said Turk. ""So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace."" In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he often trips over his athletes' feet. ""It hurts me that there are things that I cannot physically demonstrate -- a lot of the footwork stuff with stops, turns and jumps."" But his players don't seem to mind. ""We don't notice his disability, we see him as a great coach,"" said starter Creighton Avery. ""He is always positive and inspires us.""","Karl Turk, who was told he may never walk again, is coaching in the state playoffs .

"(CNN)An armored truck carrying several million dollars worth of gold was robbed while it was stranded on Interstate 95 in Wilson County, North Carolina. According to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to an armed robbery of more than $4 million in gold, just before 7 p.m. ET Sunday.  The armored truck was paused after experiencing mechanical issues during a trip from Miami to Massachusetts. The two guards, employed by Transvalue Inc., were forced to the ground and robbed at gunpoint by three men driving a white van. The guards' hands were then bound behind their backs before they were instructed to walk into a nearby wooded area, the sheriff's office said. ""Transvalue Inc. deeply regrets the events that transpired yesterday evening,"" Chief Executive Officer Jay Rodriguez said in a statement to CNN. ""We are pleased that our crew was not harmed. At this time we are working with the authorities to try and resolve this matter."" The FBI has also been notified, according to Public Affairs Special Agent Shelley Lynch. The FBI is ""coordinating with our law enforcement partners to determine whether a federal crime has been committed"". Meanwhile Transvalue is offering a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the arrests of the suspects responsible, according to Rodriguez. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Wilson County Sheriff's Office at 252-237-2188.","Bandits made off with more than $4 million in gold during the Sunday night heist .

"(CNN)There's a $30,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a bank robbery trio known as the Black Hat Bandits, suspected in a two-month string of robberies across Maryland and Virginia, the latest coming Monday. They've earned their name for the black hats they wear during their heists, and the feds say they're becoming increasingly dangerous. ""In an escalation of violence, the Black Hat Bandits have become more brazen at each robbery having threatened bank customers and tellers, most recently holding a gun to a customer's head, and jumping teller counters in attempts to gain access to bank vaults,"" according to an FBI wanted poster. An FBI statement last month provided more details: ""During each robbery the black hat bandits have been described as carrying handguns and wearing winter coats, sunglasses, black hats (either a winter knit cap or wide brimmed hat) and facial disguises such as ski masks or a fake beard."" The bandits pulled off their most recent robbery Monday during lunch hour at a Wells Fargo bank in Falls Church, Virginia. It marked the crew's eighth bank robbery this year. ""We now confirm that this is a three-person crew: two who take over the bank and one who waits in the car,"" an FBI spokesperson told CNN affiliate WJLA. No one was injured in the holdup, which unfolded after two black-clad men -- one African-American, one white -- entered the bank with firearms, robbed the bank and fled in a vehicle waiting outside, police told the station. Hours after the robbery, investigators were at the scene gathering evidence, which included a footprint in the snow, WJLA reported. It was the second Falls Church bank robbery in recent weeks, but the February 21 robbery of an Apple Federal Credit Union two blocks from Monday's crime scene was the work of a lone gunman, not the Black Hat Bandits, authorities told WJLA. The robbers who committed Monday's robbery are described as in their 40s and between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall, according to the FBI. Other banks which the Black Hat Bandits are suspected of robbing include a Bank of America in McLean, Virginia, on January 2; a BB&T in Fairfax, Virginia, on January 16; a Bank of America in Vienna, Virginia, on January 20; an Essex Bank in Arnold, Maryland, on January 30; and a SunTrust Bank in Waldorf, Maryland, on February 5. In one of their more audacious undertakings, the robbers hit two banks on February 18. First, they hit a BB&T in Vienna, Virginia, before traveling to a Wells Fargo in Sterling, Virginia, 40 minutes later. ""One of the suspects put his gun to a customer's head while demanding everyone to 'get down,' and demanded money from a victim teller. In both robberies the subjects fled the banks with an undisclosed amount of money,"" the FBI said in a statement. The FBI is asking anyone with information on the bank robberies in Virginia to call 202-278-2000. Those with information on the Maryland heists should call 410-265-8080. The public can also submit anonymous tips at https://tips.fbi.gov.","Latest of 8 robberies came at Wells Fargo bank in Falls Church, Virginia, during lunch hour .

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN)Cameroon's security forces are predicting a drawn-out battle with Boko Haram as evidence filters out that the insurgents are now recruiting there. ""We don't doubt that Boko Haram is recruiting in Cameroon,"" said Col. Joseph Nouma, commander of Operation ALPHA, a special military operation set up by Cameroon's government to fight the Nigerian terrorist group. He says communities bordering Nigeria have been emptied of men between the ages of 10 and 45. ""Many of them are found across the border in Nigeria, training with the terrorists,"" he told CNN. This has made it difficult for the country's defense forces to adequately estimate the power of the terrorist group. Nouma said the number of militants may be greater than is widely believed, though there is no reliable estimate of the group's strength. ""Boko Haram is a permanent metamorphosis, dying every day but recruiting every day as well,"" says Col. Jacob Kodji, interim commander of the 4th Military Region. ""And this complicates a lot of things for us."" Nouma agreed: ""We kill them, but they keep on coming."" Boko Haram is a Nigerian-based Islamic group whose purpose is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. They have carried out a campaign of terror in northern Nigeria, killing thousands, taking hundreds captive, and occupying swaths of territory in Borno state. As many as 200,000 Nigerians have fled to neighboring countries, creating an urgent humanitarian situation, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported last month. For the past two years, Boko Haram fighters have been carrying out cross-border raids on Cameroon, slaughtering hundreds and torching entire neighborhoods. But as the country's defense forces -- later joined by battle-hardened Chadian troops -- turned up the momentum against the insurgents, the terrorists began to swell their ranks with Cameroonians. Nouma said he believes ""most of the worst attacks we have suffered"" were carried out by Cameroonians fighting for Boko Haram. Also, the militants' ability to hit several different places at once, and with precision, suggests that ""there are people over here giving them information,"" Nouma said. In January, Boko Haram struck Fotokol, a Cameroonian town separated by only a bridge from Gambarou, Nigeria, a stronghold of the Islamist extremists. The attackers killed more than 400 people. Cameroonian and Chadian soldiers stationed there managed to kill 150 invaders. Among them was the son of Ahmadou Moustafa, a Fotokol resident. For two months, Moustafa didn't know the whereabouts of his son, Akim, or what he was doing. He didn't find out until the aftermath of the fighting, when locals removed the veil on one of the dead attackers to reveal his 15-year-old boy's face. ""I was really shocked and embarrassed at the development,"" Moustafa said. While it's difficult to fathom the appeal of extreme, violent doctrine among young Cameroonians, ambient poverty and chronic unemployment in the Far North region may explain why some there are lured to Boko Haram pay. The government's 2010 National Population and Housing Census found the region to be the country's poorest, with 60% of the population living in poverty. Joseph Mbah Ndam, an opposition member of Cameroon's parliament, told CNN that the government of President Paul Biya ""has for over 30 years now failed to create jobs for the youths. And in such circumstances, they may be easily manipulated into joining such hate groups."" A senior government official from the region, who would not be named, agreed, saying that ""in a context of such extreme poverty, it couldn't be otherwise."" ""No significant economic project has been carried out there ... the Far North is the most populated in the country, but has been completely abandoned,"" the official explained. ""So it's not surprising that youths should be sensitive to calls by Boko Haram."" Desperate youths aren't the only recruits, however. Very often, police are bribed into collaborating. In January, Abdoulaye Farikou, senior inspector of police in Balaza, was arrested by the military and accused of using his position as head of the Identification Unit in the Far North region town to issue Cameroonian ID cards to militants coming in from Nigeria. Security officials say such a move makes it easy for Boko Haram to infiltrate Cameroon and gather vital security information. Along with the presence of some 6,000 Cameroonian troops and plans to deploy some 20,000 more over the next two years, the government now has come up with a $135 million program to finance 94 development projects. Part of the money will be used to increase cereal production by 30% in the Far North region, where child malnutrition now stands at some 70%, according to Economy Minister Emmanuel Nganou Djoumessi. Other investments will be made in road construction, railway development, mining and social services. ""We can't easily win this war with military means alone,"" said Mijiyawa Bakary, the regional governor. ""The development package government has put in place will definitely keep many young people busy, and therefore will not be charmed by the false promises of the terrorist group."" But development projects can only be carried out in a climate of peace, and officials here hope that the Multinational Joint Task Force -- about 8,500 troops from Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin -- will defeat Boko Haram and lay that groundwork.","Military leader says ""most of the worst attacks"" were carried out by Cameroonians fighting for Boko Haram .

"(CNN)Slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov isn't the first critic of President Vladimir Putin to turn up dead. Some Putin opponents claim it isn't a coincidence that critics of the powerful leader and his government have been killed or landed behind bars. But the Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. Here's a look at some cases of outspoken critics of Putin's government who've ended up in exile, under house arrest, behind bars or dead. The business magnate backed an opposition party and accused Putin of corruption. He spent more than 10 years behind bars on charges of tax evasion and fraud. In statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals in the 1990s. The Kremlin denied the accusation. At the time of Khodorkovsky's sentencing, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that ""allegations about some kind of selective prosecution in Russia are groundless. Russian courts deal with thousands of cases where entrepreneurs are prosecuted."" Due for release in August 2014, he was released nearly a year earlier, in December 2013, after Putin signed an amnesty decree pardoning him. His release, along with the pardoning of dissident Russian punk band Pussy Riot and a group of Greenpeace protesters, was widely seen as an attempt to improve the country's image before the Winter Olympics in Sochi last February. Khodorkovsky is now living in Switzerland. He told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month that he wants to see regime change in his country. ""I think that my country doesn't deserve a new era of authoritarianism,"" he said. ""But at the same time, I don't want a revolution."" She was a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya. Her home was a safe place, until it became the scene of her murder. She was shot four times at the entrance of her Moscow apartment in October 2006. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the killing. Authorities alleged that an unidentified man asked Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, whom the jury found was a mastermind of the slaying, to kill Politkovskaya in exchange for $150,000 because of her reports of human rights violations and other issues, the Moscow city court said. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said her work chronicling human rights abuses in Chechnya led to threats against her and angered Russian authorities. Shortly after her death, Putin denied any Kremlin involvement in her killing, saying that Politkovskaya's ""death in itself is more damaging to the current authorities both in Russia and the Chechen Republic ... than her activities."" The former Russian agent was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium, his tea spiked in a London hotel during a meeting with two former Russian security servicemen. After leaving the Russian Federal Security Service, he blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. In a statement from his deathbed in London in November 2006, he said he had no doubt about who was to blame for his imminent death. ""You may succeed in silencing me, but that silence comes at a price,"" Litvinenko said at the time. ""You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life."" Officials have always dismissed the accusation as ""nonsense,"" but suspicions linger. A Russian federal intelligence service spokesman went as far as to say that Moscow had not carried out any ""physical liquidation of unwelcome personalities"" since the Soviet era. The two prime suspects in the poisoning, Andrei Lugavoi and Dmitry Kovtun, are Russian nationals. Both are former agents of the Russian security services. But both deny involvement, and the Russian government refuses to extradite either to Britain to face trial. In January 2009, a masked man shot and killed Markelov, a Russian human rights lawyer known for his work on abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. The gunman also shot Baburova, a journalist from Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper, when she tried to intervene. Markelov was known for his work on high-profile cases. He represented the family of a Chechen woman killed by a former Russian colonel in March 2000. He held a news conference hours before his death opposing the early release of Col. Yury Budanov, who had been convicted of strangling a Chechen teenage girl and was freed after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence. At the time, Novaya Gazeta Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Muratov suggested that Baburova was killed when she tried to stop the lawyer's killer, but he said he couldn't dismiss the possibility that she was also a target. Russian authorities said members of a neo-Nazi group were behind the killings, and two neo-Nazis were convicted for the deaths. The Chechnya-based human rights activist was kidnapped outside her home there in July 2009 and found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia later the same day. Her body was riddled with bullets, Russian prosecutors said -- several shots to the abdomen, and one to the head. Estemirova had spent years investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. She told CNN in 2007 that she was investigating dozens of abductions and murders that had become the norm in Chechnya, where security forces were fighting a dirty war against separatist rebels. The head of the group Estemirova worked for, Memorial, accuses the Kremlin-backed Chechen leadership of ordering her killing. Her death drew the ire of European leaders. ""How many more Natalya Estemirovas and Anna Politkovskayas must be killed before the Russian authorities protect people who stand up for the human rights of Russian citizens?"" Terry Davis, then the Council of Europe secretary general, said at the time. The Guardian reported shortly after Estemirova's death that Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov and his aides had threatened her. Kadyrov denied involvement in her killing, calling it a ""monstrous crime"" that was carried out to discredit his government. The powerful Russian businessman's falling-out with his government left him self-exiled in England. Berezovsky accused the Kremlin of killing Litvinenko. And for years, he bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. In 2013, he was found dead inside his house with a noose around his neck. Was it a suicide? The coroner's office said it could not say. In 2013, during a phone call to a television show, Putin said he could not rule out that foreign secret services had a role in Berezovsky's death. However, he added that there is no evidence of this. A corruption-fighting lawyer, Navalny famously branded Putin's United Russia party ""the party of crooks and thieves."" He has been a prominent organizer of mass street protests and has attacked corruption in Russian government, using his blog and social media. The Kremlin critic was arrested in December just after hours after he was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial . Navalny was detained after he broke house arrest and went to join a protest against the court's verdict. In court, he got a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for the fraud conviction, while his brother, Oleg, also convicted of fraud, was given a prison term of the same length. The brothers denied charges of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012. Before the December ruling, he was under house arrest after he was convicted in 2013 of misappropriating $500,000 worth of state-owned timber, in what he told CNN was a fabricated case. The Telegraph reported that the Kremlin denies fabricating the case. A spokesman for Putin said the President only learned of the sentence from the media. Nemtsov, 55, was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011, when he protested the results of parliamentary elections, and in 2012, when tens of thousands protested against Putin. Most recently, he had been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. After his death Friday night, opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. In an interview with Newsweek magazine just hours before his death, Nemtsov said Russia was ""drowning"" under Putin's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. ""Due to the policy of Vladimir Putin, a country with unparalleled potential is sinking, an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing,"" he said. The former deputy prime minister accused Putin of using ""Goebbels-style propaganda"" -- a reference to Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Germany's propaganda minister -- to brainwash his countrymen. Nemtsov was scheduled to lead an opposition rally in Moscow last Sunday. But two days before the event, he was shot dead as he walked home from dinner with his Ukrainian model girlfriend. The killing took place just meters away from the Kremlin. The Kremlin suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord. But many Nemtsov supporters suspect Putin's administration of involvement. CNN's Matthew Chance, Ivan Watson, Alla Eshchenko, Laura Smith-Spark, Holly Yan and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Some claim it's no coincidence that critics of Putin and his government have been killed or imprisoned .

"(CNN)A photography teacher at a Southern California high school appears to have committed suicide by hanging herself in a classroom. Jillian Jacobson, 31, was found Monday at El Dorado High School, said Lt. Eric Point, with Placentia Police. There was no indication of foul play, and every indication that she took her own life, he said. According to Steve Concialdi with the Orange County Fire Authority, students had been waiting outside the classroom to get in. Another teacher opened the door. When they went inside the classroom, they found Jacobson hanged. They quickly brought her to the ground and called 911, said Concialdi, but she was declared dead at the scene. If you're in crisis or contemplating suicide, please contact The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Students posted tributes to the teacher on social media, saying she would be greatly missed. One called her caring; another said she was a beautiful soul. Crisis counselors are expected to be on campus all week to support staff and students.

"(CNN)Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has freed a Saudi diplomat it kidnapped three years ago, Yemeni Foreign Ministry officials told CNN. Tribal leaders involved in negotiations with al Qaeda over the last month handed Abdullah Al Khalidi to Saudi authorities on Monday, two Yemeni government officials said. Unknown gunmen kidnapped Al Khalidi, the Saudi deputy consular, in 2012 as he was leaving his residence in the Mansoora district of Yemen's business capital of Aden. He was later handed over to al Qaeda, where he appeared in al Qaeda video last year pleading to the Saudi government to ensure his safe release. Al Qaeda was demanding a ransom for his release and threatened to kill him if the ransom was not paid. CNN was not able to confirm whether Saudi Arabia or his family paid a ransom in exchange for his release. A Yemeni Foreign Ministry official told CNN that his government was not involved in the negotiations for Al Khalidi's release. ""The Yemeni government does not negotiate with terrorists. Ransoms that are paid to terrorists motivates them to conduct more kidnappings,"" said the official on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media . The Saudi Interior Ministry announced Monday that Al Khalidi reached Riyadh safely and is undergoing medical checkups. Al Khalidi had been living in Aden for four years when he was kidnapped. Last week, a Frenchwoman working for an international organization was kidnapped, along with her Yemeni translator, in Sanaa. Two four-wheel drive vehicles were used in the kidnapping attempt, according to eyewitnesses. Their whereabouts remain unknown. Kidnappings of foreigners is common in Yemen with tribes or al Qaeda-linked militants often demanding a ransom for their release or using them as a bargaining chip in their dealings with the central government. Al Qaeda is believed to have been behind most of the kidnappings since 2012. Gunmen kidnapped an Iranian diplomat, Ahmed Bakht, in Yemen in 2013, and his whereabouts are still unknown. Bakht was an Iranian national employed within the Iranian Embassy in Yemen and was kidnapped while traveling through the diplomatic quarter in Sanaa when gunmen blocked the road ahead of him and abducted him.","Saudi ministry says diplomat arrived in Riyadh safely and is undergoing medical checkups .

"McAllen, Texas (CNN)For residents of this town just across the bridge from Mexico, it's hard to understand how a Washington political fight could end up threatening the livelihood of people charged with securing the border. ""What incentive do they have to keep protecting us if they're not getting paid?"" asked Cecilia De La Cruz as she sat at a coffee shop with a friend. ""It is troubling."" The latest example of congressional dysfunction has real world implications here, where thousands of agents monitor the U.S. border with Mexico. The agents, along with other employees vital to national security such as TSA screeners, will have to show up to work without being paid if Congress misses a Friday deadline to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded. Thousands of other agency workers will be furloughed. The employees are caught up in a fight over immigration policy. Republicans want to tie funding for the department to legislation that would roll back President Barack Obama's immigration executive orders -- a nonstarter for Democrats. The battle reached a fevered pitch last week when Congress narrowly missed a deadline to avoid a partial DHS shutdown, giving themselves an extension until March 6 to broker a deal. Speaker John Boehner could try to avert another showdown by holding a vote as early as Tuesday on a DHS bill that doesn't touch Obama's immigration order. But the political intrigue isn't registering for some residents here. Angelea Remorin, a nurse who works nights at a hospital, said she wasn't concerned yet because she hadn't read or heard anything about the potential shutdown. ""Me, personally, I peek into the news every now and then, but it's things like ISIS, you know, those big headline things, that I look at on the news,"" she said. ""None of my friends have been talking about (the shutdown), and I haven't been keeping up with it."" At the coffee shop with De La Cruz, Ronaldo Delacruz said he'd heard of the potential shutdown but didn't feel unsafe. ""I don't know what's going to necessarily happen to the department itself,"" Delacruz said. ""I don't know how that's going to affect the protection of the border or border patrol, but I guess we're going to find out."" Marco Solis said he was mad after hearing that Congress agreed to keep DHS running for only a few days. He said he wonders why lawmakers don't realize how their decisions affect local areas. ""They're a bunch of incompetent men who just can't figure it out,"" he said. ""And I know not all of them are men, but say predominantly, old white men screwing up this country."" Local employees of the Department of Homeland Security stationed along the border said they weren't allowed to speak to newsgroups on the record because of orders directly from Washington. But speaking without attribution, they did express frustration with Congress for defunding their department in 2013 as part of the broader government shutdown and possibly again later this week if a longer term funding bill isn't passed. The agents argued they have families to feed and mortgages to pay, just like anyone else. Chris Cabrera, the vice president of the Local 3307 National Border Patrol Council, a union for border agents, echoed those sentiments. He said that in the McAllen area, about 2,000 agents would be affected by this funding bill. He said the problem is in Washington, where Congress won't feel the direct effect of a possible funding gap. As a border patrol agent for 13 years who also felt the effect of the 2013 shutdown, he remembers how it went down last time. ""It's pretty much out of our hands"" he said. ""The sad part is that we're the football in this political game, and we're just caught in the middle getting tossed around while somebody is trying to push their own agenda, one way or the other."" In the meantime, he said he's working with local agents to help them send letters to their mortgage companies to alert them of the possible problems because most of them are considered essential personnel and will have to continue working without a paycheck. For now, he said that's all that the union can do to help. ""At some point, people will jump ship,"" he said. ""I don't think there's going to be a rush for the door, but we will have some people that are gonna say 'Enough is enough. This is twice in two years, and I'm done with this.' "" If a shutdown were to happen later this week, Cabrera said that nonessential personnel, such as administration positions in the department, would not report to work. Agents would continue to work securing the border, but depending on how long the shutdown lasts, they'd eventually have to work in some of the administrative positions as well to make up for employees who were furloughed. ""Most likely what will happen is that they'll have to pull agents who do frontline work, processing work, or stuff in the station,"" he said. ""They're going to have to backfill them -- you know somebody has to answer the phones at the front of the building."" He added that he believes the cartels in Mexico are keeping up with American news so that they can take advantage in case DHS does shut down. ""They know,"" Cabrera said about anyone across the border hoping to bring people or drugs. ""They scout us when our shift changes. They know everything that's coming along. And when they see stuff like this, when it hits the media, they start mobilizing."" McAllen Mayor Jim Darling agreed and said he believes cartels and gangs are more tuned in about what's going on in Washington than his own constituents. ""I would think there's Gulf Cartel guys listening to Washington right now,"" he said. ""If they think there's a porous border, they're going to come and make some money."" Darling says that Washington's actions have a ""ripple effect"" across the country, of which they should be more aware and considerate. ""I don't know about you, but I seriously doubt a congressman can go without a paycheck,"" he said. ""It's a bipartisan problem, and they have to come up with a bipartisan solution, and they're not.""","The political battle in Washington has real economic implications for McAllen, Texas .

"(CNN)The family of Ibragim Todashev, an associate of Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was killed during an FBI interrogation, plans to sue the agency. Todashev's parents filed a ""notice of claim"" Monday, saying they plan to seek $30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. The claim argues the FBI has given ""no viable justification"" to account for shooting and killing Todashev during a 2013 interrogation in Todashev's apartment in Orlando, Florida. The interrogation occurred about a month after the Boston Marathon bombings and centered around another crime linked to bombing suspect Tsarnaev: a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts. Todashev admitted to his direct role in slashing three people's throats in Waltham and said Tsarnaev was involved as well, a federal law enforcement official told CNN in 2013. It was during that interview that Todashev was shot dead. The Council on American Islamic Relations Florida filed the notice of the Todashev family's intention to sue on Monday. ""We are seeking answers and justice for someone who was shot seven times by an FBI agent in his own home after hours of interrogation,"" said Ali Kurnaz, a spokesman for the civil rights group. Many things that happened that day don't add up, Kurnaz said. ""Todashev was unarmed with any gun, knife, explosive or other deadly weapon,"" the notice says. ""Todashev did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm."" The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials who spoke to CNN after the shooting painted a different picture of what happened during the interrogation. One law enforcement official said Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, gashing his head before the agent opened fire. At the time, the official stressed that the shooting was justified and done in self-defense because the agent felt threatened. A U.S. government official briefed on the investigation rebuffed the idea that Todashev wasn't a threat -- noting, for instance, that he could have taken the agent's gun. ""He was armed. Maybe it wasn't a weapon, but he had a long object,"" the official said. And because of Todashev's martial arts expertise, ""he was a weapon himself."" But from the outset, that argument didn't add up to the Todashev family. ""My son was definitely unarmed, because he never had a gun,"" father Abdulbaki Todashev told CNN in 2013. ""He couldn't attack them or fight them; he couldn't do anything because even two men could easily handle him."" The elder Todashev suggested his son may have been provoked. ""If you question someone for eight hours, you can provoke him into anything,"" he said. Last year, Florida State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton said after an investigation the FBI agent's actions were justified. ""(Todashev) went down, but he was not incapacitated. He came up again in an aggressive manner, and the officer then fired the second volley of three or four shots. Which at that point essentially incapacitated Mr. Todashev,"" Ashton said. ""It would seem almost superhuman, but everything that we have learned in the investigation would show an individual who has a great deal of tolerance of pain and would more or less fight beyond it. ""It seemed to me that if the goal was to get away, he could have gone out that back door and gotten away instead of going towards the officers."" CNN's Susan Candiotti, Evan Perez, Phil Black and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Ibragim Todashev was killed during a 2013 FBI interrogation .

"Los Angeles (CNN)America's Skid Row sits in downtown Los Angeles. This pocket of 2,000 men and women constitutes the nation's biggest concentration of homeless people living and sleeping on public sidewalks, in scattered camps under tarps. Not surprisingly, sanitary conditions are appalling. This quarter of despair is now at the center of national attention for another reason: This week, Los Angeles police and a homeless man in a tent engaged in a confrontation, ending with officers fatally shooting the man known only as ""Africa,"" an apparent reference to his home continent. It was all captured on video by bystanders. Police allege ""Africa"" tried to reach for an officer's gun, prompting the police gunfire against him. ""Skid Row is a 54-block area that has the largest homeless number of individuals in the country,"" said Jerry Jones, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. He's based in New York City. ""New York City has the largest homeless population, but Los Angeles has the highest unsheltered population in the country, which has led to the destitution you see today,"" he added. New York City's unique right-to-shelter mandate ensures ""temporary emergency shelter to every man, woman, and child who is eligible for services, every night,"" the city's website says. But not in Los Angeles, where two-thirds of the county's 40,000 homeless people are unsheltered, Jones said. So many live on the streets of downtown Los Angeles -- and elsewhere. In some American minds, Los Angeles may conjure up images of a great American city cursed with an abandoned urban core. That's an old memory. Today, downtown Los Angeles enjoys a renaissance, right down to the new hotels and mall surrounding the Staples Center, where professional basketball and hockey are played, often to championships. But not on Skid Row. (That's its official designation. Even Google maps label it so.) There are few champion moments here. The only exception may be the everyday heroes who labor in 107 charities and agencies feeding and comforting the lost souls bivouacked on the street. The triple-digit number of social service agencies, however, is often cited as one reason that Los Angeles endures as the nation's Skid Row capital: There's a $54-million-a-year charitable infrastructure anchored to the poverty district. Nobody seems to be going anywhere. That doesn't deter Ryan Navales, manager of government and public affairs for the Midnight Mission, which strives to lift people out of poverty. His work and those of his peers is like that of Sisyphus to the rock, the mythic figure whose endless labor was to push a rock to the top of a mountain and then have to do it all over again after the rock rolled downhill. ""Skid Row has become less transient,"" Navales said. ""The history of skid row goes back to a transient neighborhood associated with the railroad. The true definition of transient is short term. Now it's long term. It's become a neighborhood."" The century-old Midnight Mission now serves 3,000 meals daily to the homeless, Navales said. Navales cites a shortage of affordable housing as a reason for how ""there's no place for people to go."" He asserts his agencies and others offers hope to those who feel hopeless. Navales knows from personal experience. He once worked for Microsoft as a network administrator in the 1990s, but he lost it all, including his family. Drug addiction obliterated his life. ""After destroying my family, in and out of jail, in and out of treatment, I was living on the streets and doing what people have to do on the streets to support a really gnarly heroin habit,"" Navales said. ""In August of 2011, I was brought to the Midnight Mission homeless,"" he added. ""I had a backpack on."" He now wears a suit, on Skid Row's front line, trying to relieve and unravel the nation's Gordian knot of poverty. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Skid Row in L.A. is a 54-block area home to the nation's largest concentration of homeless people .

"(CNN)Workers digging underneath a Paris supermarket have made an unsettling discovery:  as many as 200 skeletons. The grocery store, Monoprix, was doing some renovations in January and workers removing an underground wall discovered the bones. The area was apparently part of a cemetery for the Hospital of the Trinity, according to CNN affiliate, France's BFM-TV. The cemetery operated from the 12th century to around the 17th century. Researchers and archeologists are conducting carbon dating and DNA testing to try to figure out when and why the people died, the affiliate said. It's clear they all died around the same time, lead archeologist Isabelle Abadie told BFM-TV, because of the way the bodies were neatly arranged. ""What's surprising is the bodies were not thrown in (the graves) but were carefully placed there in an organized manner. The individuals, men, women, and children, were placed head-to-toe,"" to fit as many as possible in the grave, Abadie explained. Paris suffered several plague epidemics during the times that the hospital was in operation, as well as a smallpox outbreak in the 17th century. Archeologists working the site have found eight common graves in an area that is 100 square meters, with seven of the graves containing between five and 20 skeletons each and another site with more than 150 skeletons, BFM-TV said. The groupings suggest that whole families were buried together. Abadie told BFM-TV that when the cemetery was shut down centuries ago, most of the remains were moved to the Catacombs of Paris. ""But apparently the job was not done well,"" she said. CNN's Alanne Orjoux contributed to this report.","More than 200 skeletons found under Monoprix grocery store .

"London (CNN)In his teenage years, there was little to set Mohammed Emwazi -- a quiet, hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates. That's according to Joanna Shuter, his former head teacher at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London. Now 26, Emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the ISIS militant nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" who's appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages. But in his school days, it was a different matter. When he joined Quintin Kynaston at 14 or 15, he was little trouble himself but was the focus of some bullying. ""He was bullied a little, but because he was quiet and he was reserved ... generally he was fine,"" Shuter said. ""There were no massive behavior problems with him, and by the time he got into ... (his last years) he had settled, he was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice."" He just didn't stand out as troubled, she said. ""If there had been any concerns about Mohammed, they would have been picked up, and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done."" Born in Kuwait, but brought up in London from the age of 6, Emwazi was one of the school's many students from an immigrant background. The school's intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. But its ethos was one of tolerance and integration, with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community. Staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind, Shuter said. They also reached out to the sometimes insular, conservative Muslim communities that many of their students came from, she said, to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures. Nonetheless, Emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences, most likely outside of school or through social media. And he was not alone. At least two other students who attended Quintin Kynaston also allegedly later turned to Islamist extremism. One, Mohammed Sakr, only overlapped at the school by a few months with Shuter. He was reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia in 2012. ""He was very outgoing, jolly, sporty kind of person and fun,"" Shuter said. Shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today. ""I think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control,"" she said. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos. ""My blood just ran cold,"" she said of when she first heard the news. ""When I hear the name, I just find it incredible to marry what I've clearly seen on the TV with the person that I knew. It literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I can't believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him. ""I think it's horrific, the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for (ISIS). I just think it's shocking."" The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who's watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. CAGE,  a London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi, has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the UK security services questioning him. They asked about his attitude toward the July 7, 2005, terror attacks in London and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, he says. ""We're going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed,"" he alleges they told him. CAGE has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services. It says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups.","Mohammed Emwazi's ex-head teacher says he was a quiet boy, slightly bullied at school .

"(CNN)Tunisia's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on Wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security. Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of ""Islamists."" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. ""All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,"" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to ""follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities."" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: ""There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners."" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. ""Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,"" it said. ""As a precaution however we have canceled excursions to Tunis for the coming days. ""Customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the FCO and the British Consulate to monitor the situation. Tunisia remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal."" In its advisory, the UK Foreign Office points out ""424,707 British nationals visited Tunisia in 2014. Most British tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free."" Indeed, Tunisia's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north African destination for Europeans seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011. In 2010, the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites. In 2011, the year in which an uprising ousted longtime President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- an event credited with triggering the Arab Spring -- that number fell below 4.8 million. With calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring Libya and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise, helped by costly advertising campaigns. Recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10% lower than their pre-2011 levels, but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new ""Star Wars"" film renewing interest in the country's role as a key location in the original movies. In a 2013 interview, Tunisian tourism minister Jamel Gamra said up to 20% of Tunisia's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry. He told the Inter Press Service he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow. ""The sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016, a growth of one million tourists per year,"" he said. ""Tunisia also has more freedom and democracy now, which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry.""","Gunmen killed 17 tourists and two others on Wednesday at a museum in Tunisia's capital .

"(CNN)She is being called Zephany Nurse, though it is not the name with which the 17-year-old South African girl grew up. Zephany means ""hidden by the Lord,"" a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence. South African Police have been mostly quiet about the case. A police spokesman, Andre Traut, confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl's biological mother. Zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a Cape Town hospital in 1997. She is 17 and in her final year of school. In fact, according to local reports, that's how she crossed paths with her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse. According to the South African Press Association, an independent news agency, students at their second daughter's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping. The second daughter, who was born four years after Zephany was kidnapped, started eighth grade at a Cape Town school this year, according to SAPA. Fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her, the news agency reported. The two girls became friends, according to SAPA, and eventually, Morne Nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter's new friend. He, too, was taken by the similarities and contacted the police, SAPA reported. A DNA test was done, and last week police arrested the 50-year-old woman who had raised Zephany. The woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing. The shocking revelation has no easy conclusion. While Zephany's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her, for now, the girl is in the custody of the social services. The Nurses have been allowed to visit Zephany for short periods, South African media reported.

"(CNN)As expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a rousing speech to Congress, rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references. Yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As national security adviser Susan Rice told the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC on Monday, ""Precisely because this is such a serious issue, we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one. Sound bites won't stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."" The Obama administration, on the other hand, is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block Iran's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb from today's estimated three months to at least a year. Without a deal, Iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium, while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track Iran's activities. At the top of the list of questions the Prime Minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of ""no deal"" would actually make Israel safer? As Rice said: ""Here's what's likely to happen without a deal. Iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges. Iran will seek to fuel its (plutonium) reactor in Arak. Iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile.  And, we'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today."" If no deal that the United States and five other powers actually might strike with the Iranians would be acceptable to Netanyahu, how does he propose to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat? He spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against Iran and keeping them in place until Iran ceased regional aggression, sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate Israel. But years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the Iranians to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward. Neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of Iranian scientists. And if the United States was seen as walking away from a possible agreement, the international sanctions regime would likely crumble, not strengthen. Iranian hard-liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver's seat in Tehran, while those would want to see Iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined. It is doubtful that Netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the Iranian nuclear program. That leaves one other option -- military force. Of course, Israel could order a military strike on Iran any time it chooses, but Israel's ability to inflict significant damage on Iran's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited. When the discussion turns to military action, what is really meant is U.S. military action. It is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the U.S. Congress would shy away from openly asking Washington to attack another country, especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Netanyahu also lobbied for. We should recall Netanyahu's September 2002 testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, six months before the U.S. assault on Baghdad began, when he said: ""It's not a question of whether Iraq's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out; it's not a question of whether you'd like to see a regime change in Iran but how to achieve it."" Netanyahu may have learned from that experience. He knows that the U.S. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the Middle East. That's why he advocates policies that would put the United States on a path to military action without mentioning the words ""military action."" This Israeli leader, who faces a tough election back home in two weeks, has mastered the art of policy vagueness. He applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the Palestinians last year, declaring he was in favor of a two-state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter. His biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. This is an Israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words. But words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that's where Netanyahu once again failed himself, his country and his audience.","Jeremy Ben-Ami: Netanyahu's powerfully worded speech is no substitute for a strategy to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons .
He says without a plan, the only option is to put U.S. on path to military action .

"(CNN)Judge Judy Sheindlin's contract has been renewed through 2020, it was announced Monday by Armando Nunez, president and CEO of the CBS Global Distribution Group. The new contract includes a first-look production deal with Queen Bee Productions, which is owned by Judy Sheindlin. This past season, Queen Bee and CBS launched ""Hot Bench,"" a show that quickly has become one of the highest-rated new hits on daytime television, averaging 2.3 million viewers a day (when multiple airings are combined). The show ""Judge Judy"" is already set through the 2017 season. It is typical that the creator's deal is renewed before they renew the show itself. That is expected shortly. Other than the extension through 2020, there were no details announced about the contract for Sheindlin, 72, who has been starring on Judge Judy since September 1996. She is reportedly is among the highest-paid personalities on television, earning about $45 million a year under her old contract (and without factoring in earnings from Hot Bench). ""I'm thrilled to be working with my CBS family for five more years and very excited about this new adventure in production,""  said Sheindlin. ""I loved the experience of creating and developing Hot Bench and look forward to replicating its success with more new, compelling and smart TV."" Said Nunez: ""She is a true television icon who entertains and inspires millions of fans each day on Judge Judy. We look forward to continuing to provide our station partners with her highly successful show and to working with her to create the next generation of hits."" ""Judge Judy"" is the highest-rated regular series in all of TV syndication, regularly outdrawing such iconic shows as Wheel of Fortune and top-rated talkers like Ellen and Dr. Phil. In its 19th season, Judge Judy is averaging 10.3 million viewers a day. Among court shows, it has been the top program nearly since it went on the air. It now has been No. 1 in the genre for 969 consecutive weeks. ""Judge Judy"" is produced by Big Ticket Pictures, a division of CBS, and is distributed by CBS Television Distribution. Randy Douthit is executive producer and director. Hot Bench was created by Sheindlin and is executive produced by Douthit and Maureen FitzPatrick. It features a panel of three judges -- Patricia DiMango, Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman -- who take viewers behind the scenes to share in their deliberations before a verdict is rendered. Hot Bench also is produced by Big Ticket Pictures and Queen Bee Productions and is distributed by CTD, which distributes 10 five-run shows in syndication. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

"Los Angeles (CNN)No one knew him by his real name. But on the harsh streets of Skid Row that became his home, he was known as Africa. Surveillance footage, police and homeless community activists paint wildly different pictures of the man -- one who could be violent, benevolent, troubled and altruistic. Africa was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Sunday after he scuffled with officers. The shooting, caught on video, has renewed accusations of police brutality because it showed him already on the ground. Police say he tried to reach for an officer's gun. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has identified Africa, but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives. Africa came to the United States from the continent about a decade ago, said a friend who would only be identified as Nick G. Like Africa, Nick had also been homeless on the streets of Skid Row -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair. ""He wanted to get away from here, he wanted to go back home,"" Nick said. ""He was very depressed. Very, very depressed. He had a good side to him, a good heart."" Africa kept a tent outside the Union Rescue Mission homeless shelter. Even though the shelter was right in front of him, he didn't want the help. Instead, Africa often helped the shelter's employees. ""Our cleaning guys -- he would help them organize cleaning of (the) sidewalk,"" said the Rev. Andy Bales, the shelter's CEO. He described Africa as gentle and kind -- but with an erratic side. ""I attribute the erratic behavior to this difficult environment out here."" Less than an hour before he was killed Sunday, a nearby security camera showed Africa apparently dealing drugs --  the sad and only real currency of Skid Row's economy. The footage then shows Africa getting into a fight with the man in the orange tent next to him, violently tipping the tent and kicking the man. Police arrive and talk to Africa, but he jumps into the tent -- prompting officers to draw their guns. Africa then jumps out, swinging his arms at police. Los Angeles police say he tried to grab an officer's gun, and that's when he was shot. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck called the incident ""an extreme tragedy."" ""We feel great compassion in the LAPD for people who live in conditions of homelessness, and often mental illness, with no treatment,"" Beck said. ""We prepare our officers to deal as best they can with them, but the reality is this is much more than a problem that the police alone can solve."" Bales said the dismal conditions of LA's Skid Row makes it a tinder box for more problems. ""There is no other major city in the U.S. that has a skid row like ours,"" he said. ""2,000 human beings living on the street. Until we deal with that, we're going to continue to have an explosive situation."" On the sidewalk where Africa was shot, a modest memorial sits atop a small pile of belongings. ""RIP Cameroon,"" one cardboard sign reads ""Rest in Peace Africa."" It's unclear when the Los Angeles County coroner's office will release Africa's real name. From there, it's unclear where Africa's remains will go. CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Los Angeles; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.","The man known as Africa often helped employees at a homeless shelter .

"(CNN)Lake Waban on the southern edge of Wellesley College is best known for its shoreline trails offering a scenic reprieve from campus life. Freshman Katy Ma sees it in a different light after learning about Xie Bingxin, the influential 20th century Chinese writer and activist who attended the Massachusetts single-sex college in the 1920s. In one of Bingxin's poems, she describes the tranquil waters of Lake Waban as her only source of comfort in bouts of homesickness. Now, Lake Waban provides Ma with a tangible connection to a woman from another time, someone who rose to prominence after walking the same grounds as her. And, not just any woman, but someone who shares Ma's cultural roots. ""Knowing that someone lived in the exact spot where you are right now, and knowing that so much came out of her life inspires you to think that you can accomplish just as much,"" she said. It's a big deal for Ma, who says she never learned about a single Asian-American in school. As far as she knew growing in Philadelphia, the white men featured in public monuments were the only people who made noteworthy contributions to history. She knows better now thanks to her involvement with activist group SPARK Movement, which is putting women on the map, with a little help from Google. Ma and a group of girls around the world spent the past five months researching locations of significance in the lives of women who don't always get a mention in history class. Starting this week, their stories will be featured on Google's Field trip app tagged to significant locations in their lives. For Bingxin, it's Wellesley University. For dancer Janet Collins, it's New York's Metropolitan Opera, where she became the first African-American prima ballerina. For 19th century journalist Annie Smith Peck, it's Musho, Peru, the village at the base of Mount Huascarán, which she scaled in 1908 in a record-setting feat. For journalist Nellie Bly, it's the site of Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island, now Roosevelt island in New York, where she went undercover for a story. Most of the women have Wikipedia pages or obits online; far fewer have parks, squares or monuments named for them. ""Every single one of these woman is a rock star,"" Ma said. ""These women have been edited from history not because they didn't make meaningful contributions to society but because someone deemed their stories not worthy of being told."" The initiative started in 2013 when SPARK approached Google with data showing that women and people of color were underrepresented in the popular doodles featured on its search homepage. The Google Doodles team has since made strides toward balance the ratio. The encounter led to talks about another SPARK project on representation of women and people of color in parks, monuments and public spaces -- ""all the places outside a school textbook where we learn about who's important in the world,"" SPARK Executive Director Dana Edell said. The conversations led to Google's Niantic Labs, creator of Field Trip. The app displays geotagged stories within a certain geographic radius created by different publishers. Users can choose to be alerted to locations in a certain category. Google agreed to publish the stories if SPARK created them. After all, SPARK's vision fit into Field Trip's goal to help people ""discover the stories around them,"" said Google's Yennie Solheim Fuller, who worked with SPARK. ""It's one thing to read about a landmark while sitting on your couch,"" she said. Visiting it in person creates a sensory experience that's harder to forget, and telling a story about the place has the potential to create an even stronger connection, she said. ""We're hoping it brings more awareness to those locations and stories,"" she said. ""What I really hope is that people learn something cool about a place and a woman, and feel inspired to do something similar in their community."" The initiative launched on Monday featuring 119 women in 28 countries representing the arts, science and technology. The hard part was not finding women, 15-year-old SPARK member Ajaita Saini said. Pinpointing locations to feature was the greater challenge, sometimes because of lack of information; in other cases, it was hard to choose just one. Take for example, Deborah Sampson, who disguised herself as a man so she could fight in the Revolutionary War. The coordinates of her birthplace will show up for anyone using the app in the vicinity of Plympton, Massachusetts. The app also features Mary Anning, a 19th century British self-educated fossil hunter who was unable to publish her discoveries in her lifetime. The app highlights the British shore where she made some of her most significant findings, including the first complete skeleton of a long-necked Plesiosaurus. Saini, a student at Middlesex County Academy for Science, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies in New Jersey, knows firsthand that women's contributions to science, technology, engineering and math don't usually make it into the lesson plan. Through this project and other SPARK initiatives, she hopes to change that. ""It's time we recognized the female scientists, researchers, musicians who are invisible to us,"" she said. ""They definitely existed, we just don't learn about them.""","Teen activist group SPARK researches history's ""invisible"" women .

"(CNN)Wrapped up in a long brightly-colored scarf, which does little to contain her free-flowing curly hair, Nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music. ""I was a kid,"" the Nigerian singer finally says, her thoughts traveling back to Warri, the Niger Delta city where she grew up. ""While I was doing my domestic work in the house, sweeping, waking up at 5am in the morning, there was this bird [singing] -- and I never forgot the melody,"" she continues, breaking a warm smile. ""Funny wise, like 25 years later I was in Lagos and I heard the same melody -- it was amazing!"" Nneka's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace, but the award-winning singer's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a Nigerian father and a German mother, Nneka moved to Hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology. Whilst attending university, she also started exploring her musical talents, and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip-hop names. In 2005, she released ""Victim of Truth,"" a much-lauded debut that fused soulful beats, tasty hip-hop-and reflective ballads with politically-charged lyrics and black consciousness. Since then, she went on to enjoy further chart success, tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like Lenny Kravitz and Damian Marley. And now, the soulful singer is back with a brand new, self-released album -- ""My Fairy Tales"" is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves, reggae-tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent's most exciting -- and relevant --  artists. CNN's African Voices caught up with Nneka in London to talk about music, memories and the current situation in Nigeria -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the #AskNneka and #CNNAfrica hashtags. CNN: In the past, you've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics, to religion and love -- what are the themes that you're emphasizing at this moment? Nneka: What is happening in Africa at present concerns me a lot. Boko Haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five, six years -- funny wise, there's a track in the album called ""Pray For You"" which I recorded when not too many people knew what was going with Boko Haram in the West. I'm talking about the problems and possible solutions, and what are the reasons for the problems that we have. We as Nigerians, we're not united, that has always been the issue... that's our problem, tribalism, and what belongs to whom. I also talk about children and the future, bringing children into this world... Everyone's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society, where your child is forced to live in fear. People are afraid to express themselves politically, and even in their home -- I remember the way we grew up, I didn't look my father in the eye until I was 22; you call your father ""Sir, Sir, Sir"" -- apparently it's a form of respect, OK, but respect should not be mistaken with fear. I was afraid and that's the thing, that's the colonial mentality: we mistake fear for respect. He [Goodluck Jonathan] says he wants to tackle Boko Haram, obviously every Nigerian is asking why now, he could had done it a long time ago...but I'm not good at the whole blaming game, I don't want to blame anybody but I pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy. But I know that Fela [Kuti] would definitely not be cool with him, Seun [Kuti] is not cool with him, and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him. CNN: What is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change? Nneka: Music is very powerful, music is big; music is even more powerful than politics at present. Beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [Nigerian president] Goodluck Jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if Beyonce is going to talk about Boko Haram, many people are going to listen, and if she had something to tell Nigerians about love or whatever, many people are going to listen. CNN: How do you see the political and security situation now in Nigeria? Nneka: All I can say is that we do need proper leadership. Yes, that's just easier said than done, but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change, we have to show that we want change, peacefully -- I love Malcolm X but I'd rather go for Martin Luther [King] -- peacefully. And be part of it, not just blame our leaders and making sure that you, yourself, contribute to the change that you want to see. YOUR QUESTIONS . Nneka: My personal life always inspires me, in the first place, and then I try to expand it to the world. I try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way. Nneka: I like The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran, I like Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, I like the Bible. Right now I'm reading The Humans by Matt Haig. Read! Just read, educate yourself! Nneka: The way forward is going to be easier said than done, but tribalism is not they key. What we need is unity and to appreciate each other as Nigerians, as Africans, regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil, there has to be another way. Nneka: Being on tour for like five months; I mean you get used to the life, but [it's hard] when you're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you're not around. Nneka: It is successfully already, that's why everybody is in it. That's all I can say to that, it's flourishing and they know it's flourishing and that's why they're all there -- the Chinese, the Americans, the Europeans and the rest of them.","Nigerian singer Nneka releases latest album, ""My Fairy Tales""

"(CNN)After postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of ""cloudy"" lethal injection drugs, Georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, the state said Tuesday. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday, but for the second time in less than a week, it was called off. The state postponed the first planned execution because of ""weather and associated scheduling issues,"" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. ""Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,"" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. ""Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed."" Repeating the ""abundance of caution"" wording, the department issued a news release Tuesday, saying, ""The scheduled executions of Kelly Renee Gissendaner and Brian Keith Terrell have been postponed while an analysis is conducted of the drugs planned for use in last night's scheduled execution of inmate Gissendaner."" Gissendaner, 47, is condemned to die for a 1997 murder plot in which she conspired with boyfriend Gregory Owen to murder her husband. Terrell was convicted in the shooting and beating death of a 70-year-old friend of his mother's after the man called police to say Terrell had stolen checks from him, according to the Georgia attorney general's office. Gissendaner has already requested an extravagant last meal: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. Terrell was scheduled to die between March 10 and 17. Last year, Oklahoma issued a months-long moratorium on executions after murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett convulsed, writhed and lay alive on a gurney for 43 minutes before dying. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs has made headlines since 2013, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols.","Brian Keith Terrell execution halted while Georgia analyzes drugs used for executions .

"New York (CNN)When prosecuting attorneys began their closing arguments in the terrorism trial of an accused al Qaeda operative on Monday morning, they spoke of blood. ""Blood.  Mangled bodies and dead families,"" said Assistant U.S.  Attorney Zainab Ahmad.  ""Abid Naseer was going to place a car bomb in a crowded ... shopping center and watch people die."" Naseer, 28, is accused of communicating with al Qaeda and conspiring to attack the Arndale shopping center in Manchester, England, in April 2009. Naseer has maintained throughout the two-week trial that he is innocent, repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the United Kingdom to find a wife, not to plan an attack. The case is now in the hands of the jury, who began deliberations Tuesday.  Judge Raymond Dearie instructed the jury to ""judge the facts and the facts alone."" Naseer is charged with three criminal violations: providing material support to al Qaeda, conspiring to provide material support for al Qaeda, and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. Prosecutors accuse Naseer of using email addresses with female names to communicate with al Qaeda in planning the bomb attack. The ""female-sounding"" email addresses were created to attract less attention, prosecutors say. Naseer, a Pakistani national, was in the United Kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest.  Prosecuting attorneys pointed to the fact that Naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week as further evidence of his guilt. Naseer had no intention of completing his studies because ""that was never the plan,"" Ahmad said, arguing that Naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack. ""If law enforcement hadn't stopped him, he would be the martyr in heaven he so wanted to be. If he had not been stopped, hundreds of men, women, and children would be dead,"" Ahmad said. The Manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that also included attacks on the New York City subway system and on a newsroom in Copenhagen. The New York plot originated with a man named Najibullah Zazi, who is believed to have corresponded with the same al Qaeda contact as Naseer.  Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in Naseer's trial. Naseer's 2009 arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013. A number of British intelligence agents -- disguised with makeup and wearing wigs -- testified that they tracked Naseer in 2009 as he visited the Manchester mall that was to be attacked. Prosecutors also accuse Naseer of using ""coded language"" in his emails to update al Qaeda on his progress. Email records show that Naseer sent an email on April 3, 2009, to a man named Sohaib, who Naseer says he met randomly in an online chatroom.  Records also show that Naseer used two email addresses to email Sohaib exclusively from public computers and used different email addresses on his personal computer for all other correspondence. The email address belonging to Sohaib has since been identified as one belonging to a member of al Qaeda. The April 3 email reads, in part, ""We both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between those dates."" ""Nikah"" refers to an Islamic marriage ceremony.  Naseer was arrested in Manchester five days after sending the email. Prosecutors allege that the wedding ceremony Naseer mentions was coded language for an attack. The dates mentioned in the email, they argue, were not referring to a marriage, but rather Naseer signaling to al Qaeda when to expect the attack to happen. Naseer, who has been representing himself, denied all charges.  He told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence, with no witnesses offering direct information of Naseer's role in the alleged plot. They also did not offer any outright proof of any link to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization, he said. ""Did anyone come forward, take the stand, and say Abid Naseer is the one responsible?"" Naseer asked the jury. ""We all know the answer. It is a two-letter word: no,"" he said. Naseer argued that he dropped out of school because the courses, taught in English, were too difficult for him.  A 2008 trip to Pakistan, during which prosecutors allege Naseer received al Qaeda training, was really a trip to visit his ailing mother, Naseer said. He said that he had no knowledge at the time that Sohaib was connected to al Qaeda in any way, and simply thought he was chatting with someone he met online. All correspondence mentioning multiple women and the planning of a marriage were genuine, he said. ""[I was] young and a bit desperate and wanted to settle down,"" Naseer said, noting that there was nothing out of the ordinary about his search for a wife. Naseer spent the majority of his closing argument reading from transcripts from earlier testimony, highlighting pertinent quotes he felt supported his cause. ""We're not here to speculate, we're here to prove facts,"" he said. Evidence in the trial included documents seized from a 2011 raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. ""Striking America at home is of the highest and top importance and is the main way to reach what we want,"" one letter said. ""The impact on Americans from a strike inside America cannot be compared with hitting them outside the country."" Naseer is not mentioned by name in any of the seized documents.  He says he ""had no involvement in the activities mentioned."" FBI Agent Alexander Otte, who oversaw the evidence collected in the raid, testified before the jury that he watched as military forces walked off a plane with bags of seized evidence and the body of Osama bin Laden. Other witnesses included multiple police officers and detectives from the Manchester and London police departments, forensic investigators, a linguistic specialist and an al Qaeda expert.  Surveillance officers who observed Naseer for several weeks prior to his arrest also testified. The jury must reach a unanimous vote of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for a guilty verdict.  If convicted, Naseer faces life in prison.","Jury deliberations in the Abid Naseer terrorism case begin after two weeks of testimony .

"(CNN)This has to be one of the least convincing scandals. During the four years that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state she used (brace yourselves) a personal email account! Perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that Barack Obama didn't read her emails. Either way, Republican attempts to turn this into Hillary's Roswell fall short of the mark. On a scale of one to Watergate, I'd give this three. It is true that by using a commercial account, Clinton opened herself up to being hacked. It is also true that the rules of the National Archives and Records Administration stipulate that personal emails should only be used in ""emergency situations"" -- and as a historian I recognize the need for transparency and for keeping a record of everything written and sent for the appreciation of future generations. And we'll recall, by the way, that officials in George W. Bush's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the Democrats for it. But whenever Clinton pinged an email to an official government account, then the conversation would still have been archived, and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway. The suggestion that she thought she might have ""something to hide"" would only make sense if she had used her personal account on some occasions but not others. She would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future. Clinton may be many things, but the Republicans have yet to throw the witchcraft charge. Jeb Bush is angry about Clinton's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters. He is keen that we should know that he has a website that documents all the email exchanges that he had as governor of Florida. Why on God's Earth he's chosen to construct this archive, I can't imagine. It's the kind of grand gesture that politicians imagine the voters will be swayed by but actually leaves us thinking, ""Don't you have better things to do than this?"" Or else wondering if there's been some careful selecting of the emails to put the former governor in a good light. Oh, there are some critical communications in the Jeb Bush archives. But I'm suspicious that he appears never once to have been contacted by a Nigerian prince to say that he has $12 million that he's trying to transfer out of the country or by a Russian lady looking for a husband. Perhaps such conversations took place through Bush's personal account -- in which case, we need to know what he said in reply. Of course there is a serious context to all of this: the Benghazi hearings. There is still much that the public has yet to be told, and Clinton's emails may well be critical to discerning the truth. But there is a far less serious context to ""email-gate,"" too: the presidential election. Literally every small slip that Clinton has ever made is obviously going to be turned into a huge thing -- including such breaches of office etiquette as using the wrong email account. Sources also told me that she sometimes puts her feet up on the desk and may have used the office phone for personal calls.

"(CNN)About 15 years ago, I was doing research on inheritance laws in Malawi and their impact on women. Part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings. In order to do this in any village in Malawi, one has to seek permission from the village chief. And so I did. The chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women, as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion. When I came back the next day, the ""women"" had indeed gathered waiting for me. However I noticed that the ""women"" were not women, as such. They were... kids. Teenage girls. I said to the chief ""I was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls, as I don't think they would understand much about inheritance."" His response was, ""but these are our women; look, they have babies with them and they are all married."" I was shocked. Then it dawned on me, ""aah, girl-child marriages."" After asking, I found the girls' ages ranged from 13 to 18, with two being 24. This then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade-plus journey of understanding girl-child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end. What I found out was disheartening as the statistics came in. I was horrified to learn that Malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. It is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the U.N. Population Fund. On average, one out of two girls in Malawi will be married by their 18th birthday, according to the United Nations. In 2010, half of the women (50%) aged 20--24 years were married or in a union before age 18 (compared to 6.4%of boys), while 12% of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2% of men. Child marriage is in both rural and urban areas. It is also higher than the regional average for sub-Saharan Africa (37%). 'Law, save the girls!' Being a lawyer, I looked to the law. ""My hero the law, save the girls,"" I thought! Yet, I soon found out that this was a complex story. The Constitution of Malawi, which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived, has provided for some measures of protection for all children. However the same Constitution defines children as those aged 16 and below. The United Nations defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the Constitution does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood. The Constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut-off point where marriage is actually prohibited. This means for all intents and purposes, the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi allows child marriages. Alas the law had failed me! False hope? But there was hope in the air. In February, Malawi's parliament passed the Marriage, Divorce & Family Relations Bill of 2015 into law. This law was born amid the outcry against girl-child marriage, as the country had realized the dangers of girl-child marriage. Save for a few areas, it is a very progressive piece of legislation, particularly from a women's rights perspective. Among other things, the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18. So, does it mean that the Constitutional provisions fall away? The spanner in the works is that since the Constitution allows marriage below the age of 18, the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid. So whilst many have celebrated the new law, I haven't, as girls remain shackled by a Constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage. So until the Constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above, and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated, I will remain sad as I was 15 years ago. 'Guarantee for poverty' I will remain sad because I know the cost of child marriage. It deprives girls of education and undermines their self-confidence and self-identity. It also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands. Further to this, girl-child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality. As if this is not enough, studies have shown  that girl-child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men. Girl-child marriages need to be prohibited tough the Constitution because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life, health, education, human dignity and development. What I know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and I want it to end. No ifs or buts. More from African Voices . More from Opinions .

"(CNN)Gen. David Petraeus pleaded guilty Tuesday to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information as part of a plea deal, court documents show. According to the documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. On November 9, 2012, he resigned from his CIA post, citing personal reasons. Petraeus allegedly provided classified intelligence to his lover, Broadwell, while he was director of the CIA. The married mother of two and former military officer was writing a book about the general at the time. During his time as commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks. The classified information including identity of covert officers, war strategy, notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words. David Petraeus fast facts . In August 2011, according to the court documents, Petraeus dropped off the notebooks to a house in Washington, D.C., so Broadwell could access them. He later retrieved them and brought them to his home in Arlington, Va. After Petraeus resigned in 2012 he told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That turned out not to be true when the FBI in April 2013 conducted a search of his house and found the black notebooks in an unlocked desk drawer in a first floor study. When he was questioned by the FBI, he lied and claimed that he had never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to the court documents. The relationship came to light during an FBI investigation into a complaint that Broadwell was allegedly sending harassing e-mails to another woman who was close to Petraeus, a U.S. official told CNN in January. Petraeus now works for New York private equity firm KKR & Co. Lawyers for Petraeus declined to comment.","Petraeus resigned as CIA chief when the affair came to light in 2012 .

"(CNN)It's the day the music died. In the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, a small aircraft carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson crashed a few miles from Mason City Municipal Airport, near Clear Lake, Iowa. Pilot Roger Peterson also died in the crash. The voice of the hit songs ""Peggy Sue"" and ""That'll Be the Day"" was silenced forever. A few months later, the Civil Aeronautics Board blamed the accident primarily on the pilot's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing. (PDF). Now, the National Transportation Safety Board, the successor to the aeronautics board, may be taking another look. The NTSB received a letter from aviation enthusiast L.J. Coon, a self-described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher, asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash. They include the aircraft's weight and balance calculations (for passengers, baggage and fuel), possible issues with rudder panels and possible carburetor Induction icing, Coon told CNN in an email. ""You have gotten our attention,"" the NTSB wrote in February, saying it would examine the information he provided, Coon's email said. The NTSB never fully closes a case, but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect, NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said. The agency has two months to review the petition and decide whether there's new information that would make it revisit the case. In 1959, Holly, Valens and Richardson were part of the Winter Dance Party, a tour that had started in Milwaukee and traveled to small cities in Minnesota and Iowa. The musicians had traveled in subfreezing temperatures in unheated buses, and people were getting sick. Holly booked the four-seat aircraft to fly to Fargo, North Dakota, where he planned to finally do laundry and rest in advance of the group's next concert in nearby Moorhead, Minnesota. Country legend Waylon Jennings, then Holly's bass player, gave up his seat to a sick Richardson. Jennings, who died in 2002 at age 64, was haunted by his decision for years to come. Dion and the Belmonts were also on the tour, but Dion gave up his seat on the plane after hearing the $36 per-person price tag. He was the only headliner not on the plane and the only headliner who didn't die that night. Fans remember 'the Day the Music Died' The crash has inspired generations of artists. Lou Diamond Phillips played Ritchie Valens (originally Valenzuela) in the 1987 hit movie ""La Bamba."" Gary Busey played Holly in the 1978 movie ""The Buddy Holly Story."" Don McLean, who was inspired by Holly's music, memorialized that day as ""The Day the Music Died"" in his 1971 song ""American Pie.""","Pilot error and snow were reasons stated for Buddy Holly plane crash .

""It won't go on forever -- I'm not a believer in that,"" he told The New York Times in a recent interview. ""But I can't immediately now tell you where the end will be.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine, an official said Tuesday. Peshawar Deputy Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud told CNN that the 513 arrests took place Monday and Tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated, according to the deputy commissioner. Pakistan's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons, including attacks on medical workers, the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families. Whatever the reason, the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact. Such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world. But Pakistan is an exception, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership that includes the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The South Asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years, and has nine of this year's 10 reported cases. In 2014, Pakistan had 327 cases. The next closest country was Nigeria, with 36 cases. Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops. They've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago, Mehsud said. Dr. Bilal Ahmad, a UNICEF team leader based in Pakistan, called authorities' unprecedented move a last-ditch effort to clear polio from ""cluster"" zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated. ""First the workers (try to) convince them, then their supervisors, then senior members of the community,"" Ahmad said. ""(This government action) is the final step in eradicating this issue."" Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children, sometimes leading to paralysis and death. The virus is easily preventable through immunization, but there's no cure once it is contracted. It went from being a health issue to a security issue after U.S. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. CIA policy: Won't use vaccination programs as part of operations . Those administering the vaccines have become targets, with the National Emergency Operations Center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since December 2012. And in June 2012, Pakistani Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another Pakistani province -- North Waziristan -- because of drone strikes there. Bahadur called the strikes ""worse than polio."" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta.","Official: Parents who sign affidavit vowing to vaccinate their children will be released .

"(CNN)If the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper, then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the ""plyscaper."" Despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- London in 1666, the Great Chicago fire of 1871 and San Francisco in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material. Next year in Vienna, construction will begin on a 275-foot building made almost entirely of wood, while Stockholm may build a 34-story wooden apartment by 2023. Others are in the pipeline from Canada to Australia to Europe. With faster construction times and a softer environmental impact, could the building material of the past be the future of construction? Vancouver-based architect Michael Green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings. His firm MGA recently completed a 29.5m (97 feet) wooden building, the Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. But he said news of taller wooden structures is sprouting up all the time. ""There seems to be a new announcement every two or  three weeks,"" Green said. ""We've got one in Vancouver for 18 stories and in Vienna there's one for more than 20 stories. ""We've done research in high earthquake zones that show 30 stories is feasible; we certainly think we can go to 40 and higher."" He said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game-changer for construction. Mass timber panels, in particular, cross-laminated timber (known in the industry simply as CLT) are becoming established as a quicker, greener and eventually cheaper alternative to concrete and steel. One great bonus of the material is the speed of construction; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings, windows and doors. While the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it's flexible, robust and easily worked -- Green says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization. ""Wood has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments,"" he said. ""There are a whole host of advantages. ""Steel and concrete have huge carbon footprints. Concrete accounts for about 6-8% of man's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon-neutral buildings."" The energy used to harvest wood, he said, is much less than the enormous amount required to produce concrete and steel. ""There is no other building material that is grown by the Sun,"" he said. ""We've calculated that the North American forests grow enough wood for a 20-story wood building every 8-10 minutes."" Ultimately, building in wood, Green argues, creates an economic incentive to plant more forests. ""The climate story is really happening at both ends of the argument -- by using more wood we encourage countries around the world to plant more trees. ""About 20% of man's carbon footprint comes from deforestation, this creates an important incentive for reforestation,"" he said. In terms of carbon footprint, a 20-story plyscraper put against its counterpart in concrete and steel is the equivalent of taking 900 cars off the road for a year, MGA estimates. But the established nature of concrete and steel means that CLT will not replace urban building materials overnight. Concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities (apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling) have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party. In Vienna, for example, the Austrian fire services are working with architects to test their plans. ""The main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings. An 84-meter-high building in Europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realized,"" fire service spokesman Christian Wegner told The Guardian newspaper. ""A few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet. ""They have to carry out special tests on the correct combination of concrete and wood. We also want to develop a more fail-safe sprinkler system. I expect they will pass the tests but if they develop the building as they say they will, it will be a serious project."" Green counters that CLT is as fire resistant as other new-builds made by traditional means and likens its ability to burn to trying to set a redwood on fire with a lit match, with any charring creating an insulation layer that protects the wood underneath. Even so, the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost. ""It will become cheaper but it's too new to be significantly less expensive,"" Green said, adding that the difficulty lies in competing with a well-honed and century-old system of designing, building and budgeting for concrete and steel. ""The culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative,"" he said. ""The hardest part of my job is not the engineering and the design or the innovation, it's really about changing the public's perception of what's possible."" Ultimately, buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel. However, the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account. ""Clients are missing a trick with wood,"" he said, adding that dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. ""What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset. ""You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes."" Apart from having a sustainable solution, Lawrence says, clients will gain a building that looks good too. ""If you leave the wood exposed, you can have a really nice environment inside the building,"" he says. ""There are studies that show that people are happier inside wood structures.""","Wood is making a comeback as a construction material .

"(CNN)England's abject cricket World Cup record endures. Its team has been eliminated before the group stages of the competition has even finished after a demoralizing defeat to Bangladesh, who qualified for the quarterfinals. It means England, who invented the game of cricket but has never won the World Cup, still hasn't been past the last eight stage of the one-day tournament since 1992. Chasing a target of 276 off its 50 overs in Adelaide, Australia, England slumped to 260 all out, with only Jos Buttler offering any meaningful resistance. The wicketkeeper struck a brisk 65 after England's top order failed to lay a platform for victory, before he was dismissed by Taskin Ahmed. England captain Eoin Morgan failed again with the bat, lasting just three balls before succumbing to Rubel Hossain for no score. It marks another miserable display from one of cricket's supposed powerhouses on the world stage, its only victory in the 2015 competition coming against minnows Scotland. Whereas other teams in the tournament have taken an aggressive approach, some posting totals of over 400, England's modus operandi has looked slovenly and outdated. ""Pretty poor to be knocked out of a World Cup so early, it is very disappointing,"" Morgan said at the post-match presentation. ""I can't put my finger on it at the moment. I'm gutted. We've struggled and fought our way since we arrived -- one of our big things was to fight hard and try to get through to the quarterfinals. ""Our expectations are much higher than this. I've no idea what happens from here -- it's a surprise we're out this early. There will be an inquest over the next few weeks and we'll go from there."" Coach Peter Moores is bound to come in for renewed criticism, and the clamor for the return of one of England's best one-day players -- Kevin Pietersen -- is sure to grow louder. South African-born Pietersen was sacked after the disastrous tour to Australia in 2014/15, the England and Wales Cricket Board saying he was a disruptive dressing room influence. ""It's a hollow feeling at the moment,"" Moores said after England's defeat. ""You feel like you have let people down."" Despite committing a year to prepare for the World Cup, England dismissed Alastair Cook as skipper less than two months before the tournament in Australia and New Zealand began.

"Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says. The deal would require prosecutors to recommend probation for Hilton, who also allegedly called passengers ""peasants"" on a London-to-Los Angeles flight last summer. Hilton, 20, is scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court, but he is not expected to plead guilty at that time, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Hilton, who is free on $100,000 bond, was initially charged with a felony that could have carried a prison sentence up to 20 years upon a conviction. The misdemeanor charge carries up to a six-month prison sentence and a fine of at least $5,000, but federal prosecutors have agreed that they would ""recommend that defendant be sentenced to a term of probation,"" court records said. The class B misdemeanor accuses Hilton of assaulting two flight attendants aboard a British Airways flight on July 31, 2014, ""by intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused (the attendants) to fear immediate bodily harm,"" according to court documents filed last week. Hilton signed court papers last week that state he ""repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco"" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said. Read the plea deal . ""He also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants,"" according to court papers signed by Hilton and his attorney. His attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. At one point, Hilton told one flight attendant multiple times that ""I am going to f------ kill you,"" according to the court papers. Hilton also ""punched at, but missed"" another flight attendant, the court documents said. A more complete description of events aboard the flight was provided in initial court papers filed in early February. Those alleged Hilton threatened and intimidated flight attendants, scared parents and disengaged a bathroom smoke alarm. The court documents alleged Hilton punched the bulkhead next to an attendant's head, missing his face by about 4 inches, and told the crew, ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!"" ""My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time,"" Hilton allegedly told a flight attendant. Hilton's father is Rick Hilton, the grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire's founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton. Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years, Kathy, are parents of four children: Paris, Nicky, Barron and Conrad. Conrad Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff, even though the ""fasten seat belt"" sign was still on, authorities said. Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10½-hour flight, court documents said. Read the initial federal complaint (Warning: profane language) When Hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him, he shouted several times that ""I am going to f------ kill you!"" and used other vulgarities, court papers said. Passengers became frightened and disturbed, authorities said. A French family was seated behind Hilton, and the father got out of his seat and leaned ""over his kids in a protective gesture"" during one of Hilton's rants, a flight attendant told authorities, according to court papers. Hilton yelled several times, saying ""I will f------ own anyone on this flight; they are f------ peasants."" Hilton also accused the flight attendants of ""taking the peasants' side"" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said. He bragged that he was already banned by other airlines. At some point during the flight, the attendant saw Hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it, authorities said. The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, ""noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding,"" court papers said. The pilot later confronted Hilton, and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter, authorities said. Hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep. The captain authorized crew members to form a ""restraint team"" to constrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers. The crew used a blanket and handcuffs on Hilton about 75 minutes before the plane landed, authorities said. He awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities, court documents said. ""As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were 'going to ruin my career,' "" according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates filed in court in early February. Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said. He took a sleeping pill before boarding the flight to Los Angeles, court papers said. Hilton admitted to calling people ""peasants"" on the flight, but he ""denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants,"" the affidavit said. Hilton allegedly told the FBI agent: ""I told all of them I could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds,"" the affidavit said.","Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, will admit to misdemeanor assault .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Thousands of veterans who are patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have been waiting months just for an appointment, CNN has learned. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. What's more, administrators in charge of the massive VA facility in greater Los Angeles may have been hiding wait times, and may have misled Congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care, according to new information obtained by CNN. This revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans, which embroiled the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year and even led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, is apparently not over. And the changes promised by the VA and the Obama administration may not be working. The detailed new evidence comes from the Los Angeles VA's own internal documents obtained by CNN, and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information. It is particularly significant as the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center is the nation's largest VA health care system, caring for hundreds of thousands of U.S. veterans. The VA documents show more than 12,700 appointments, which the VA calls consults, had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed, as of mid-January. Even new patients seeking care at the Los Angeles VA for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there. Records show on January 15, more than 1,600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments. Another 400 veterans have waited up to six months, and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments. The documents provided to CNN show the lengthy wait times are still happening, within the last several months, and sources say the backlog is happening even now. And yet last month, the VA's acting director for the Western region overseeing the Los Angeles VA told Congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments. ""The average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days,"" Dr. Skye McDougall, the acting director of the Desert Pacific Healthcare Network, Veterans Health Administration, testified before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. But McDougall's statement is simply not true. According to the Los Angeles VA's documents dated January 15, the actual average wait time for new patients at the VA was 48 days. A half-dozen medical and administrative sources inside the LA VA system corroborate these waits. The wait times since then have not changed significantly -- coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of March 1, according to another VA document -- and are still roughly 10 times what McDougall testified they were. The delays in appointments are even taking place at Los Angeles clinics for mental health, where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30, 60, even 90 days for treatment. At the congressional hearing, McDougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients, a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year. The uncounted: War's true toll . Asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the Los Angeles VA, McDougall testified that the same number -- a four days' wait for new patients -- applies for mental health. But that is also not true, according to the documents and sources inside the VA who spoke with CNN. A new LA VA chart shows as of March 1, new mental health patients in Los Angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment. Los Angeles VA officials would not talk to CNN about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the ""Greater Los Angeles and VA nationwide continues to work very hard to get Veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve."" The VA sent CNN new ""retrospective data"" showing primary care average wait times of four days, specialty care wait times of 7.5 days, and mental health wait times of 2.5 days, as of January. The VA explained that the chart for new patients obtained by CNN ""does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those Veterans who need care quickly...."" New patients, the VA told CNN, ""typically account for less than 10% of all Veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population."" Despite the ""retrospective data,"" the real truth, say the sources CNN has interviewed, is reflected in the internal LA VA documents obtained by CNN -- that wait times for many patients at the Los Angeles VA Medical Centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem. This news of continuing delays in Los Angeles comes a year after reports of cover-ups and turmoil at the VA, which became a national scandal, where wait times, veterans' deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at VA hospitals across the country. Congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly, as a direct result of the scandal. And since the scandal, Congress has approved $16 billion extra for the VA in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities. The VA removed its 14-day scheduling goal to discourage engaging in ""inappropriate scheduling practices,"" and President Barack Obama also appointed a new VA secretary, Robert McDonald, last summer. Vets not impressed with VA reforms . Sources in the Greater Los Angeles VA say despite the scandal last year, the new secretary, the new laws and all the attention, not much has changed.

"(CNN)In 1984 Margaret Thatcher met Mikhail Gorbachev (before he became Soviet leader) for the first time. Asked of her impressions, she said: ""We can do business together. We both believe in our own political systems. He firmly believes in his; I firmly believe in mine. We are never going to change one another."" ""Doing business together"" might sum up the Washington-Tehran relationship today. They have overlapping interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, perhaps even in Yemen -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on Iran's nuclear program, if not how to reach it. The Obama administration has a keen interest in coaxing Iran back into the ""community of nations"" because it is a regional power, a major player in a volatile part of the world. Were the nuclear talks to leave Iran as a ""threshold state"" -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- Turkey, Egypt and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear. And Israel might carry out its threat of a military strike on Iranian facilities. But U.S. and Iranian interests converge in more immediate ways. Defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- the most high profile and urgent objective of U.S. foreign policy -- requires Iranian help, and quite a lot of it. Beyond coalition airstrikes, ground forces are comprised of the Iraqi security forces, Shia militias and Iranian advisers and officers. In some areas, the Iranian air force has been active. On Sunday, Iraqi troops and the militias began an offensive to retake Tikrit and the province of Salahuddin from ISIS. Next to Mosul, Tikrit may be ISIS' most important holding in Iraq. On the frontlines, according to the Iranian Fars news agency, was none other than the leader of Iran's Quds Force (or Revolutionary Guard Corps), Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani -- often dubbed Iran's spymaster -- has huge influence in both Baghdad and Damascus. And the Revolutionary Guards have influence over the powerful Shia militia in Iraq known as Hashid Shaabi that is an important component of the fightback against ISIS. The Institute for the Study of War observed that ""the presence of an Iranian general, other Iranian advisers, and Shia militias on the ground alongside Iraqi Sunni fighters to retake a major Sunni provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-ISIS operations."" And not only is Iranian help needed in defeating ISIS, but Iranian restraint will be required in preserving Iraq as a single and (dare one hope) stable state thereafter. To many observers, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki set the stage for ISIS' rise through his increasingly sectarian and anti-Sunni policies. But now the excesses of some Shia militia in Iraq threaten to alienate the Sunni tribes that Maliki's successor, Haidar al-Abadi, is trying to woo. In a veiled reference to alleged abuses by Shia militia of Sunni civilians, Prime Minister Abadi ordered all forces taking part in the Tikrit operation to take ""utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property."" But he needs Tehran's help in reining in the Hashid Shaabi. A similar environment may yet produce a U.S.-Iranian ""understanding"" in Yemen. The Iranian-backed Houthi militia -- a Shia sect -- is now in power (at least in the capital, Sanaa). The Houthis are, ostensibly, hostile to the United States, and Washington would rather see President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi back in charge. But the Houthis and Yemeni troops are battling al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which the U.S. regards as one of al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliates. Even so, the same risk as in Iraq applies: Sunni tribes in Yemen may side with AQAP as the lesser of two evils, effectively partitioning the country. There is no clear-cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and U.S.-Iranian co-operation elsewhere. Last week, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Congressional hearing: ""I really don't think that the negotiations, one way or the other, will have much bearing on what [the Iranians] do in Iraq or any place they are trying to exert their influence, meaning Syria or now Yemen."" In any case, a substantive agreement on Iran's nuclear program does not seem imminent. Ahead of yet another meeting in Switzerland with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javid Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that ""unless Iran is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required, there won't be a deal."" And he was at pains to insist the U.S. would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive, watertight agreement. ""No deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure,"" Kerry said. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in the U.S. to tell Congress that the deal being discussed is a bad one -- simultaneously injecting himself into the partisan rancor of Washington and seeking to derail what would be the signature foreign policy achievement of Obama's second term. Netanyahu appears to have accepted he is now part and parcel of the toxic atmosphere in Washington, saying he was going ""because the American Congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and Iran."" David Rothkopf, no fan of Obama's policy on Iran, wrote in Foreign Policy last month that ""Netanyahu's decision to accept [House Speaker John] Boehner's invitation to address the U.S. Congress on the dangers of the Iran nuclear deal is a case of sending the wrong man at the wrong time to give the wrong speech in the wrong place."" In the days running up to Netanyahu's speech, U.S. officials have lined up to warn of its consequences. National Security Advisor Susan Rice said the speech would be ""destructive of the fabric of the relationship"" between Israel and the U.S. Rarely if ever has the U.S.-Israeli relationship become so imbued with such animosity. Last summer, Israeli ministers ridiculed Kerry's efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza; Netanyahu has also repeatedly lectured Obama about the realities of the Middle East. Now Kerry seems to take almost gratuitous pleasure in telling Netanyahu he is wrong. Last week he told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that interim agreements with Iran had made Israel safer, and the Israeli Prime Minister ""was wrong"" to oppose them, just as he had been wrong in his enthusiastic support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some have even suggested that Netanyahu's aggressive opposition has only energized U.S. officials in the belief that ""if they're doing something that really pisses off Bibi, they must be doing something right,"" as Rothkopf colorfully put it. No one would pretend that America has more in common with the Islamic Republic of Iran than with Israel. But right now, Obama may just feel he's more likely to find common ground with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani than with the Israeli Prime Minister. Even so, the opportunities to ""do business"" should not be exaggerated. Iran is still supporting -- with fighters, equipment, training and lines of credit -- Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, which the U.S. is trying to oust. Iran and Syria first bonded over a mutual loathing of Saddam Hussein, but the relationship has been sustained because the Syrian regime was the only non-Sunni government in the Arab world, and Damascus and Tehran see themselves as the ""axis of resistance"" to Israel. Iranian training of militia such as the Jaysh al-Shabi has been critical to the Assad regime's survival. A former Syrian Prime Minister, Riyad Hijab, said after defecting that ""Syria is occupied by the Iranian regime. The person who runs the country is not Bashar al-Assad but Qasem Soleimani."" Sanctions have made it difficult for Iran to afford its hefty subsidies to the Assad regime -- so ironically, a nuclear agreement and the easing of sanctions might have the unintended consequence of allowing Iran to continue its support of Assad. Nor is there any sign that Iran is ready to soften its support for the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah, its frontline proxy in the confrontation with Israel. Eighteen months ago, columnist Ali Hashem quoted an Iranian source as saying that ""Hezbollah to Iran isn't a card to play with. Hezbollah today is the crown jewel of the resistance bloc,"" answerable not to the Iranian President but to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. There's no sign that posture has changed, and it's a reminder that on all these issues, President Rouhani is not the only -- or even the most powerful -- decision-maker in Iran. All the same, the achievement of a nuclear deal - and the gradual lifting of U.S. and international sanctions against Iran -- would surely change the mood music. It might open other doors and enhance dialogue on other issues. And regardless of progress on the nuclear front, the U.S. and Iran will continue to share antipathy for the apocalyptic vision of ISIS, and an interest in buttressing Iraq as a viable state. Even as a candidate for the presidency, Obama set out a vision for engaging with Iran, not least to help bring stability to Iraq. ""My decision making, with respect to military options versus diplomatic options, a containment strategy versus a strike strategy,"" he told the New York Times in November 2007, ""is going to be informed by how is that going to impact not just Iran, but how is that going to impact the stability of the region and how's that going to impact our long-term security interests."" Eight years on, it is diplomacy and containment that are the centerpiece of his administration's thrust for a signature achievement on the world stage. And it can't hurt that the United States and Iran find themselves on the same side, for now, in Iraq.","Longtime foes U.S. and Iran now find themselves on same side of some critical conflicts .
A nuclear deal would loosen sanctions on Iran, and allow it to devote more resources to propping up Assad regime in Syria ."
"New York (CNN)A federal jury Wednesday found Abid Naseer guilty of plotting with al Qaeda to bomb a shopping center in 2009 in Manchester, England, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York said. Naseer, 28, was convicted on three criminal violations: providing material support to al Qaeda, conspiring to provide material support for al Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. The Manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that included attacks on the New York City subway system and on a newsroom in Copenhagen. None were carried out. The New York plot allegedly originated with Najibullah Zazi, who is believed to have corresponded with the same al Qaeda contact as Naseer. Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in Naseer's trial. Naseer, a Pakistani national, was in the United Kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest. Among the evidence presented, prosecutors pointed out that Naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week. Naseer had no intention of completing his studies because ""that was never the plan,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Zainab Ahmad argued, saying that Naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack. Naseer maintained throughout the two-week trial that he was innocent, repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the United Kingdom to find a wife, not to plan an attack. He represented himself. He told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence, with no witnesses offering direct information of Naseer's role in the alleged plot. They did not offer any outright proof of any link to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization, he argued. Naseer's arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013.","Naseer is convicted of supporting al Qaeda, conspiring to bomb a shopping center in England .

"(CNN)What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal judge has struck down Nebraska's ban on same-sex marriage, calling it an ""unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens."" U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon's decision Monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision. And so, beginning Monday the state must ""treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples"" when it comes to marriage rights, the federal injunction reads. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last? The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others -- most recently Nebraska and Alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here's the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages: . The state's constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The other is North Dakota. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state's 2004 ban. The state's ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana's appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no ""legitimate purpose."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June. A U.S. District Court judge ruled last year that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses. That ended when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a stay. The court later reinstated Michigan's ban in the same ruling that reinstated Kentucky's ban. Its fate will be decided by the Supreme Court decision due by June. A state court judge ruled in November that Missouri's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal. Attorney General Chris Koster appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. But that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Just a few days after that state court ruling, a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's marriage ban, but that decision has been stayed pending appeals. While the state ban is in effect, officials in the St. Louis area have issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. A U.S. District Court judge granted an injunction last year against the state's same-sex marriage ban, describing it as unconstitutional. The judge, however, postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal. A federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in January. In the meantime, the same-sex marriage ban is still in effect. Same-sex couples are challenging the state's ban in U.S. District Court, but a federal judge issued a ruling on January 20 delaying the proceedings until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules. U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban in January, but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The state's ban was struck down in January 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves ""no legitimate governmental purpose."" But, as in many other states, enforcement was delayed pending appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the case last month and a ruling is pending. A federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same-sex marriages in  the state. That decision is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case expected to be finalized this summer. In November 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the state's ban. That decision also will be part of the U.S. Supreme Court case.","12 states do not allow same-sex marriages .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A Canadian pastor is missing after going on a trip to North Korea in late January, his family and church say. The Rev. Hyeon Soo Lim, 60, went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for his church, based in Mississauga, Ontario. On January 30, Lim traveled to North Korea from China with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day. Lim was scheduled to return February 4 from what was described as a ""routine"" trip to Rajin, in northeastern North Korea, where his church supports a nursery, orphanage and nursing home, according to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. So far he has failed to show. The church has formally requested help in finding Lim from Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, and has contacted the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which provides consular help for citizens of the United States, Canada and Australia, which do not have diplomatic ties with North Korea. After not hearing from Lim, Pak said they thought he could have been caught up in North Korea's recent Ebola policy. Lim's church and family waited the 21-day incubation period that he would have been under quarantine. In October, North Korea announced it was taking ""preventive measures"" to ""control the infection by Ebola."" Tour groups to North Korea announced that the country would restrict its borders to international tourists because of concerns about Ebola. This week, tour groups indicated that North Korea may be easing its Ebola policy. Tour operators, including Koryo Tours, Young Pioneers Tours and Uri Tours, announced on their websites that the country would ease its ban on foreign tourists. Nick Bonner, Koryo Tour's co-founder and director, told CNN on Tuesday, ""We're pleased to announce that today marks the first time in more than four months that tourism in North Korea begins to resume as normal."" Lim's family released a statement, thanking the Canadian government for its efforts to find the pastor and asking for privacy. In 1986, Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea with his wife and son. He speaks fluent Korean and leads a 3,000-member church. Pak, the church's spokeswoman, said she doesn't believe Lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing, which is prohibited in North Korea. ""He knows the language, he knows the nature of the government, so we don't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained,"" she said. ""We don't believe that's the way he would have behaved. He's very wise about that."" Previously, North Korea has detained Westerners on religious grounds. Cases include American Kenneth Bae, who was detained for two years after North Korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae was released in November. Another American, Jeffrey Fowle, was arrested after leaving a Bible at a club in North Korea and released after five months in detention. Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a Christian activist, was released from North Korea in 2010 after a visit to Pyongyang by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. CNN's KJ Kwon contributed to this report from Seoul, South Korea.","Canadian pastor is reported missing by his family after a trip to North Korea .

"(CNN)Selma, it seems, is everywhere. The Ava DuVernay film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits, while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the Alabama city -- the first two stopped by brute force, the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of Montgomery led by Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Bunche, Maurice Davis and other activists. Now, the events that seared those marches into the American consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York. ""Selma March 1965"" brings together -- for the first time, anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era: James Barker, Spider Martin and the man Kasher calls ""the single greatest civil rights photographer"" -- Charles Moore. The pictures in the gallery above include Moore's work in Selma and from other parts of the South, including some of the riveting, award-winning photos he made in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. (Two weeks after his Birmingham pictures appeared in a landmark issue of Life magazine, a letter to the editor succinctly captured the elemental power of Moore's work. The Birmingham pictures, wrote a reader from Indiana, were ""superb and bone-chilling."") ""The quality, the depth, the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled,"" Kasher said of Moore's civil rights shots. Kasher's own bona fides on the topic, meanwhile, are well-established: He's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid-1990s. ""It's important to remember that Charles was a white Alabaman,"" Kasher said. ""He was the photographer at the Montgomery Advertiser -- hardly a bastion of integration -- who became very sympathetic to the movement. I knew Charles pretty well, and he had many sides to him -- sides he was able to reconcile and that allowed him to shoot with a deep understanding of so many different points of view. He was not parachuting into these marches and protests in the South. He had roots there and was fully engaged. ""Of course, there are lots of really good pictures of the era by, say, Bruce Davidson, Bob Adelman and others, but they're Northerners -- and I think that shows. There's a sense in many of the photos made in the South by Northern photographers that what they were capturing was somehow exotic. For Charles, this was home."" At his very best, Moore invested his pictures with an unsettling intimacy. Whether he was chronicling the overt, graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet Galway Kinnell in Selma -- Moore's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with Robert Capa's famous dictum ringing in his ears: ""If your photographs aren't good enough, you're not close enough."" Moore was always, always close enough. John Loengard, who was a staff photographer at Life and later the founding picture editor for People magazine and for Life, the monthly, in the late '70s and '80s, calls Selma ""a not particularly dramatic event, photographically."" He does, however, have high praise for Moore's Birmingham work, specifically, and his legacy in general. ""There's no question that Charlie made some phenomenal pictures,"" said Loengard -- who, incidentally, took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era: a Life cover of Medgar Evers' weeping widow and son at the slain activist's funeral in June 1963. ""And he did a terrific job, for example, on a cover story on (Alabama Gov.) George Wallace in the first few months of People."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Whatever else Moore might have shot, and however routinely excellent his output over the course of his long career, there's little doubt he'll always be remembered and honored for his work during those fraught years of the early and mid-1960s. ""What's especially significant to me about Charles' civil rights work,"" Kasher said, ""is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists. ""In his famous picture of a police dog attacking a black man in Birmingham in '63, for example, the figure in the photo is a perfect symbol of nonviolence. You know, the man is standing there, taking it, not fighting back, amid this incredible rush of hatred and violence and as another dog is charging right at Moore's -- at the viewer's -- face. It's a terribly complex image, swirling with information, but in the middle of it is this unmistakable emblem of the movement -- an emblem of the power and bravery of civil disobedience."" Charles Moore was an American photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Some of his photos are included in ""Selma March 1965,"" a photography show taking place at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from March 5 to April 18.","The Steven Kasher Gallery will be showing powerful photos from the 1965 Selma marches .

"(CNN)Here are some of the names you might be hearing about as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev goes on trial in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings: . • Dzhokhar ""Jahar"" Tsarnaev: Born July 22, 1993, Tsarnaev and his family immigrated to the United States and applied for political asylum when he was 8. A popular student, Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and was captain of his high school wrestling team. He received a $2,500 scholarship from the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and attended the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Tsarnaev was known on campus for selling marijuana, according to court testimony. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2012, seven months before the bombings. Federal agents say surveillance video captured him near the second blast site, where 8-year-old Martin Richards was killed. After the bombings, Tsarnaev returned to campus and stayed there until the FBI publicly identified him as a suspect. Tsarnaev texted a friend to come to his room and take whatever he wanted as he would not be coming back. He and older brother Tamerlan went on the run, allegedly killing an MIT officer, carjacking an SUV and engaging Watertown, Massachusetts, police in a firefight. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed, and Dzhokhar was discovered the next day, badly wounded, hiding in a boat. • Tamerlan Tsarnaev: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, born October 21, 1986, was an accomplished boxer. He won the New England Golden Gloves heavyweight division in 2009-2010. Known for his flashy clothes and in-your-face self-confidence, Tamerlan aspired to join the U.S. boxing team despite being only a permanent resident and therefore ineligible. In early 2011, Russia asked the FBI to look at Tsarnaev's activities. After interviewing Tsarnaev and family members, the FBI said it ""did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government."" In January 2012, Tsarnaev left New York for Russia. It's not clear what he did while there, but Tsarnaev's father has said his son was with him at all times. He returned to the United States in July 2012. Seventy-two hours before the bombing, he was seen working out at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts gym with his younger brother. He was killed following a gunfight with Watertown police after his brother tried to free him with a stolen SUV but ran him down instead, according to an indictment against the younger Tsarnaev. • Anzor Tsarnaev: Anzor Tsarnaev is the father of the Tsarnaev brothers. Originally from Chechnya, the family was exiled by Russians and settled in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan before seeking political asylum in the United States. The elder Tsarnaev fixed cars for a living, making ends meet through welfare. He and wife Zubeidat divorced in 2011, and he returned to the Russian republic of Dagestan, where he now lives. • Zubeidat Tsarnaeva: Mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva worked as a home health aide before switching to facials and skin care, both at a local spa and in her Cambridge home. She was charged with shoplifting in summer 2012 and soon after moved to Dagestan. If she returns to the United States, she could be arrested for failing to resolve the shoplifting charges. She has phoned several times during her younger son's incarceration. • Ailina Tsarnaeva: Ailina Tsarnaeva is the sister of the Tsarnaev brothers. At age 16, she entered an arranged marriage that produced a son and lasted little more than a year, according to an investigative piece by The Boston Globe. Last year, Tsarnaeva was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment, accused of making a bomb threat against the mother of her boyfriend's child. She denies the charge. Her last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey, near her sister and the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. • Bella Tsarnaeva: Sister Bella Tsarnaev also reportedly has a child from a failed marriage, according to The Boston Globe. She was arrested in New Jersey on marijuana charges, and she entered into a pretrial intervention program. • Katherine Russell: Raised as a Christian in Providence, Rhode Island, ""Katie,"" as she was known in high school, went to Suffolk University in Boston but dropped out before graduating. She married Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2010 in a small, private ceremony officiated by a Boston imam. She worked as a home health aide to support the couple's young daughter. Her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of Ailina and Bella Tsarnaeva, her sisters-in-law. By all indications, Russell has chosen to be near -- and with -- her dead husband's family in New Jersey, rather than with her parents in Rhode Island.

"(CNN)Igniting a live man in a cage; severing the heads of dozens; kidnapping, raping and selling women and children -- ISIS' shocking maltreatment of its captives has become regrettably predictable. But that has made their latest decision on the fate of 19 Christian prisoners all the more surprising to some. On Sunday, ISIS released them. Ten other Assyrian Christians are expected to join them in freedom after a short time in captivity. All but one of the Christians released were part of a group of 220 Assyrians captured last week during offensives on northern Syrian villages, said the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In the shadow of its sadistic mercilessness, the sudden reversal leaves many asking: Why? The group has not explained its decision. Here are some possible answers. It was not a militant commander but an ISIS Sharia judge, said Osama Edward, who heads the Assyrian Human Rights Network, based in Sweden. Some of Edward's family members are among the captured Christians. His rights group keeps contact with local people, via phone and Internet, and has a field team in Syria, he said. The Sharia judge asked the Christians if they were part of any militia, Edward said. Then he pronounced them not guilty of violating Sharia law and ordered them released. The Assyrian Christians were all from the village of Tal Goran. They have returned home but are keeping quiet for now. Can Christianity survive in the Middle East? ""They were so tired,"" Edward said. They had a closed meeting with a bishop, and then ate and went home. ""They were treated well,"" contacts in Tal Goran passed on to Edward. ""Nobody was tortured."" Not to Graeme Wood, who published a detailed analysis on ISIS' religious inner workings this week in The Atlantic. He was pleased to hear about it, but he felt it fit into ISIS' plans. ""ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,"" he told CNN. ""They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law."" It's possible. It did win them points with Assyrian activists. ""It's a good sign to show that 'we can talk,'"" Edward said. ISIS has taken heat even from other Islamists who accuse it of rogue justice, especially against Muslim civilians they've condemned as ""infidels"" out of hand. It's part of the reason al Qaeda has rejected the group, Wood wrote. That reduced some of ISIS' chances of receiving international moral and financial support, leaving the terror group to make up the gap with other funding. And it has led to a violent split with another jihadi group in Syria, the al-Nusra Front, according to The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Other Islamist groups in Syria have frowned on ISIS for not submitting to decisions from Sharia courts. The main issue drawing anger from other Islamist groups revolves around Muslim civilians, who are ISIS' most common victims. And the released captives are Christians. But Christian activist Edward thinks the ISIS Sharia court decision was, in part, a nod to Syrian Sunni Muslim tribal leaders who negotiated for the Christians' release. First, the tribes care deeply about their Christian neighbors and don't want them killed, Edward said. It also makes the Sunni tribal leaders look good and gets a rapport started between them and ISIS. ISIS has a very narrow definition of who is a real Muslim and who is an apostate. Foremost, a Muslim must practice Sunni Islam in its eyes. The group is quick to practice ""takfir,"" which amounts to the excommunication of a Muslim, for things as seemingly petty as shaving off one's beard or voting in an election. ISIS is quick to kill anyone it condemns, because it wants to create a fanatically pure caliphate with only the strictest devotees, Wood wrote. ISIS has executed 125 of its own members for doing things that broke with its strict take on Islam, the Syrian Observatory said. Yes. Even in the strictest interpretation of Islam, there is a provision for sparing Christians, Wood wrote. Social media posts indicate that ISIS carries out mass killings regularly, but ""exempted from automatic execution, it appears, are Christians who do not resist their new government."" They are required to pay a special tax and acknowledge the new ruling power. That's exactly what the judge ruled, Edward said. The released Assyrian Christians agreed to acknowledge ISIS as their new masters and to pay the tax. ISIS is still holding two of Tal Goran's Christian villagers, Edward said. They should be released as soon as the taxes are paid. He is hoping for the same deal for the other Christian villagers, including for his family. CNN's Samira Said and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","ISIS released 19 Assyrian Christians on Sunday and plans to release 10 more .

"(CNN)New figures indicate that about 11 million people have signed up for health insurance during this latest sign-up period of Obamacare, of which about half will be from the uninsured population, based on previous estimates. Once again, the supporters of the law celebrate with  proclamations that ""it's working."" One could say that assessment is true, if the definition of ""working"" means enrolling people into anything called health insurance. To be sure, the law's implementation is progressing, but there is no cause for celebration. It is indeed true that millions of Americans are now newly enrolled into health insurance, but it is disingenuous to tout this as a great success. An estimated 71% of the new insurance arises through Medicaid, using 2014 calculations based on analysis by Haislmaier and Gonshorowski of data from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. The harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients. Such ""insurance"" from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance  ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade. It is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable. Health care access for middle-class Americans is also significantly worsened by Obamacare's private insurance decrees. The law already forced termination of health insurance for millions of Americans estimated as 4.7 million by the Associated Press --  insurance they personally had chosen to buy. The Congressional Budget Office now projects that a stunning 10 million Americans will be forced off their chosen employer-based health insurance by 2021 -- a tenfold increase in the number that was initially projected back in 2011, at the onset of the law. Along with that forced change of coverage, many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors. Despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices, the Obamacare exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government's subsidies. McKinsey reported 68% of Obamacare insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks, double that of the previous year. For cancer care, the majority of America's best hospitals in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are not covered in most of their states' exchange plans. The ""narrow network"" strategy is about to hit even more Americans in 2015, as Obamacare exchanges from California to New Hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself, according to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times. And a study in late 2014 commissioned by the prestigious American Heart Association determined that the specialists essential to diagnose and treat stroke, one of the most disabling and lethal diseases in the United States, are in severe shortage under Obamacare insurance exchange plans. Indeed, unless one has the financial resources or power to skirt the new system, many of America's top doctors and hospitals are no longer available. Obamacare has forced Americans onto a far more government-dominated health care pathway than in the past. Coupled with population aging, the 107 million under the government's Medicaid or Medicare insurance in 2013 will rapidly increase to 135 million just five years later, a growth rate tripling that of private insurance. By the end of the decade, a full 140 million Americans will have their health care access directly controlled by government insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. More doctors than ever  already refuse Medicaid and Medicare due to inadequate payments for care, and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements. Less appreciated is that inadequate payments to doctors by government insurance substantially increase private insurance premiums. Back in 2008, a shortfall of over $88 billion of payment from Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries added more than $1,500 extra per year in premiums and $1,800 extra in total out-of-pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance. As the government increases its role as insurer, it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals, so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals. And with increasing enrollment into government insurance, private premiums will undoubtedly rise even more. It is therefore absolutely critical for the new Congress to reject Obamacare and instead help individual Americans and their families, particularly middle class and poor Americans -- the people most harmed by Obamacare. Any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals: 1) help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs; 2) liberate the poor from Medicaid so they have actual access to medical care, as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor; and 3) add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value-seeking by consumers. The plan should not replicate the false claims of Obamacare supporters that recent slowdowns in health spending from economic downturns were somehow caused by Obamacare. The Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (PatientCARE) Act put forth this month by leading Republicans in Congress tries to do just that. This bill, also known as Coburn-Burr-Hatch, represents a serious plan to expand access to health care and reduce the nation's health care expenses. The Coburn-Burr-Hatch proposal incentivizes people to buy insurance they value, and it generates affordable options, instead of forcing the purchase of expensive insurance that individuals don't want. Current harmful barriers to interstate cooperation and anti-competitive impediments are reduced. Health savings plans are liberalized to allow everyone, not just the affluent, control over their health care dollar. Medicaid reforms provide options for individuals to buy private coverage, and the government provides significant financial support for lower income Americans. And no one is forced to spend their hard-earned money on something they do not want. As the Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday about the legitimacy of subsidies under the ACA, Americans must recognize the bigger picture about U.S. health reform. Contrary to the mantra that the GOP has no plan other than to repeal Obamacare, the truth is that it is the supporters of Obamacare are the ones who are single-minded. They are focused on maintaining the ACA without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with US health care -- its cost. Responsible leadership must focus on empowering patients instead of the government, before private health insurance and with that access to the excellence of America's medical system are eliminated for all but the affluent. Empowering individuals -- regardless of socioeconomic status -- with choices and information in order to facilitate access to care from the best doctors and hospitals in the world should be the thrust of any change to American health care. That's an American solution, and it's up to our elected officials to make sure it finally happens.","Scott Atlas: Nearly three-quarters of those insured under Obamacare were added to Medicaid .

"(CNN)When food giant Nestle USA (to which I am, alas, not related) last month announced plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies, it understandably made headlines. According to the company, by the end of 2015, none of a group of 250 chocolate products including Butterfinger and Baby Ruth will contain artificial flavors or colors such as Red #40 or Yellow #5. With the expectation that these chemicals will also disappear from the company's other candies, it looks like the end of the use of artificial flavors and colors in anything but the cheapest food products. If that proves to be the case, it will be a welcome shift. Nestle USA intends to advertise the reformulated products with a ""No artificial flavors or colors"" claim on package labels. If sales of the ""no artificial"" candies grow as expected, the company will surely extend the removal to all of its other colored and flavored food products. After all, Nestle's international parent company -- and the company's competitors -- will have to take notice and find ways to remove these chemicals from all their product lines. Nestle USA has undeniable clout. It accounts for a quarter of the $100 billion in annual revenues of the more than century-old, privately held parent corporation, which itself is the largest food company in the world. This move surely will not only reverberate through the candy industry, but also affect every other major food company. In substituting natural for artificial flavors and colors, Nestle USA is responding to what its customers are saying. The company's own research indicates that Americans prefer their beloved candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors, while other surveys find majorities of respondents saying that artificial chemical additives negatively influence their buying decisions. 7 chemicals in your food . Nestle is also responding to decades of complaints from consumer advocates about the potential health risks of these chemicals, especially the dyes. Studies in experimental animals have linked high doses of food dyes to health problems, among them organ damage, cancer, birth defects, and allergic reactions. In humans, studies link food dyes to hyperactivity and other behavioral problems in young children. The credibility of these studies and their implications for human health remain hotly debated. In the 1970s, for example, Ben Feingold, a physician in California, suggested that food additives caused children to become hyperactive. Much of the evidence for the ""Feingold hypothesis"" rested on anecdotal reports by parents, whereas double-blind, controlled clinical trials produced contradictory results. On the basis of current evidence, some artificial food dyes have been banned, while others remain in use despite suggestions that they too might be harmful.  But the makers and users of food dyes argue that the chemicals are safe at current levels of usage. As a result of all this, and in the absence of convincing evidence of their safety, the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest has campaigned since the 1970s to remove food dyes and other chemicals from foods, and has continued to petition the Food and Drug Administration to ban them. Kraft removing artificial dyes from some mac and cheese . The opposing views complicate the regulatory status of food dyes. But after one clinical trial reported that dyes induce hyperactivity in half the children studied, the British government asked companies to stop using most food colors; the European Union requires a warning notice on many foods made with them. In the United States, the FDA does not permit artificial food dyes to be used unless the manufacturers can meet safety requirements. But the amounts of these substances in the country's food supply have greatly increased in recent years -- soft drinks, breakfast cereals, frozen desserts and even salad dressings all contain artificial coloring agents. True, the FDA considers a dye to be safe if there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from its intended use. But that standard is vague enough to cause concern. Given the unresolved scientific questions, it is reasonable to ask why artificial colors have to be in foods at all. From the standpoint of manufacturers, such additives are essential for covering up and hiding unattractive colors in processed foods. To the public, red candy seems to taste better than the drab variety. And while natural colors exist, they are less stable or more expensive to produce. But for Nestle to have taken the action that it has, the company must have found substitutes it can live with. And appealing to consumers' preference for ""natural"" makes good business sense. The truth is that whether artificial colors do or do not cause health problems in adults or children, they are there strictly for cosmetic purposes. For that reason alone, getting rid of them is a good idea.","Nestle USA plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies .

"(CNN)There is only one likely outcome for Baghdad's current military offensive to reclaim Tikrit: defeat for ISIS. The campaign to restore central government authority over the restive Salahudin province is seen as both symbolic and strategic for Baghdad which has invested too much already for it to afford losing this battle. ISIS are said to have booby-trapped much of the city in an attempt to slow down the government assault. However, the task at hand has been made easier for Baghdad given that most civilians in Tikrit have already fled -- both to Kurdistan in the north as well as south to Baghdad -- leaving behind mostly ISIS jihadists who defend the city, according to Iraqi constitutional specialist Zaid al-Ali, who is from the city. Initial reports of the multi-pronged attack on Tikrit have been encouraging. Iraqi forces have already cleared a number of areas on the outskirts and are expected to continue advancing towards the city center as both heavy artillery and helicopter gunships pound ISIS militants who have taken up defensive positions. Another crucial element for the success of this battle will be the varied make-up of the groups involved in the fight. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the mainly Shia Hashd al-Shabi paramilitary force, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades, and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Although the campaign is Iraqi-led, help from outside is also going to play an important role. Though the United States has not conducted any airstrikes in this campaign yet, this may well change as the battle develops. Iran, in stark contrast to the U.S., provided Iraq with immediate and much-needed military assistance when the security crisis escalated last June. The Iranians are heavily invested in this current campaign and are also not going to let the Iraqis lose. Unlike in Syria, the Americans and Iranians both share a common enemy and a common friend in Iraq, but due to wider political considerations neither Washington nor Tehran will admit that there is any form of tacit cooperation in Iraq. However, the campaign for Tikrit is just another front where such cooperation is likely to be already happening behind the scenes. Baghdad will make use of U.S. intelligence that will almost certainly be shared with the Iranian officers who are advising the Iraqi army. General Qasim Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, who has played a key role in the fight against ISIS, was reported to be near Tikrit just hours after the military campaign was officially launched. Iran provides military advice, support and weapons not just through the central government in Baghdad but also directly to a number of increasingly powerful Shia militia groups that now operate under the state-sponsored paramilitary committee, the Hashd Al-Shabi, known as the ""Popular Mobilization Units."" The two key Iraqi leaders of this paramilitary command, Hadi al-Ameri and Abu Mehdi al-Mohandis, were also pictured together with General Fadhil Barwari, the commander of Iraq's elite Special Operation Forces. Though there are few civilians left in Tikrit, all eyes will be on the Iraqi security forces -- and especially the Shia militias --- to see if abuses are carried out once the enemy is routed. Prime Minister Abadi already warned the anti-ISIS fighters to protect civilians and properties in the area and also gave the ""misled"" ISIS militants a last chance to lay down their arms before the troops made their advance. The battle is an especially emotional one for the Shia soldiers and fighters as Tikrit is the site of the Camp Speicher massacre last June, where 1,700 Shia soldiers were captured, separated from their Sunni comrades and then summarily executed in an atrocity that was documented by ISIS as a powerful propaganda film. However, it is encouraging that both Shia and Sunni fighters are supporting the army in its effort to defeat ISIS. The cooperation between Shia and Sunni fighters will be crucial not just in the ongoing offensive in Tikrit but will also set the stage for further cooperation in the strategic campaign to recapture Mosul. Politically, these groups may not see eye-to-eye and of course there remain deep ethno-sectarian tensions in Iraq and beyond, but regardless of these differences they all view ISIS as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated. To be sure, the Sunni tribesmen involved in this campaign are more anti-ISIS than they are pro-government, but that they can work with the pro-government Shia militias is both good news and good progress for a country believed to be ripping itself apart along ethno-sectarian lines.","Likely outcome for Baghdad's current offensive to reclaim Tikrit is defeat for ISIS, writes Hayder al-Khoei .

"(CNN)The Ferguson Police Department has demonstrated a pattern of racial discrimination, the Justice Department said Wednesday. But while some experts say the numbers alone tell only part of the story, the 102-page report merely reaffirmed many residents' beliefs. In Ferguson, just over 67% of residents are black. But among the findings, the report shows that 85% of traffic stops, 90% of citations, 93% of arrests and 88% of use-of-force incidents involved African-Americans, the Justice Department said. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said the police department's behavior amounted to ""taxation by citation."" He told CNN the arrests affected not just Ferguson residents but also residents of nearby communities who pass through Ferguson en route to other locales in the area. Justice Department: No Darren Wilson charges . The statistics sound damning, but former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks, who dealt with the Justice Department during his five-year tenure as chief, said, ""The numbers can be deceiving because the population is overwhelmingly black."" The numbers alone don't paint the full picture, he said, explaining that he'd need more than mere statistics about each stop to draw solid conclusions. Read the report . Parks served as chief in LA from 1997 to 2002, and after the Justice Department determined in 2000 that the LAPD had engaged ""in a pattern or practice of excessive force, false arrests and unreasonable searches and seizures,"" he had to overhaul the department, combating corruption and even jailing former police officers. Based on that experience, Parks said the report released Wednesday shouldn't be taken at face value, but rather should be used to help determine ""what is really going on in Ferguson and what to do to correct it."" Politics may even be at play, Los Angeles-based community activist Joe Hicks suggested. Attorney General Eric Holder wanted to bring civil rights cases against Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Michael Brown in August, and Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who killed Trayvon Martin in 2012 -- but neither case panned out. The report may be Holder's way to ""extract a pound of flesh, if you will, from the Ferguson Police Department."" (Also Wednesday, the Justice Department closed its investigation into Wilson, declining to bring criminal charges against him.) Still, the report likely didn't surprise some residents who spoke to CNN in August, during the height of the protests. Patricia Pendelton, 41, a nurse who lives a few blocks from where Brown took his last steps, said older and female African-American residents aren't affected as much, but her sons -- ages 17, 19 and 21 -- have had different experiences. They and other young black men have been stopped for reasons as spurious as looking suspicious, she said. ""How does a person look suspicious? What do you have to be wearing to look suspicious?"" she asked before mimicking an offending police officer's questions: ""'Where you going? What you doing? How you doing it?' It's none of your business."" Outside his bustling barbershop, Mike Knox recalled how one of his sons, an A student, was arrested with several other kids in the parking lot of an auto parts store. They'd met there because it was a central location to rendezvous before a game of basketball. When Knox, 33, picked his son up, police told him he hadn't been charged, just taken away by police, he said. The father of four said he himself had been pulled over for DWB, or ""driving while black,"" a common complaint among African-Americans in Ferguson. Maurice Phipps, 22, a Ferguson resident of eight years, relayed a similar story: A Ferguson officer once pulled him over and said he was looking for a suspect with dreadlocks. ""And I got a box cut,"" he said, pointing to his dyed-blond 'do. Being a lifelong resident of the St. Louis area, Knox knows Ferguson well. When he was a kid, St. Louis police walked the streets and handed kids Cardinals baseball cards, so he's seen real community-oriented policing. But there's a rift between the community and police in Ferguson -- as well as in surrounding areas such as Hazelwood and Florissant, he said. ""They all do it. People are just tired of that happening. Why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car?"" he said, adding that he struggles with what to tell his kids. ""You don't want to tell them the police are bad. I tell them, 'Keep it moving,'"" he said. ""If you let your attitude take over, that can be you laying on that ground."" Even white residents have complained of run-ins with police. Tom Steigerwald, 31, who has lived in Ferguson since 1994, said Ferguson has always been a diverse town, and race isn't much of a factor among residents. ""It's always diverse, but they always got along,"" he said. But the police? ""They all got a power trip problem, a lot of them,"" he said. Following Wednesday's announcement, Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., released a statement saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face federal charges in their son's death. But the report on the police department could provide a silver lining. ""We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,"" the statement said. ""It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.""","Michael Brown's parents say son's death not in vain if report prompts change .
