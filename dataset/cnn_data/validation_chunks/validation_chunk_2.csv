"(CNN)After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, ""Fashion Police"" is going on an extended break. The fashion commentary show on E! channel announced Tuesday that it will be on hiatus until September. ""We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season,"" it said in a statement. The announcement caps a rocky few months. Last week, co-host Kathy Griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes, saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts. She made a dig at the show on her way out. ""There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people's bodies into it,"" she said in a statement. ""I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference."" Shortly before her departure, co-host Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana. Rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen's defense. But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later. Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski  will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers.","Fashion commentary show will be on hiatus until September .

"Washington (CNN)A Florida ""dream ticket,"" two nuggets about leadership questions in Congress and coming tests for Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich filled our final March trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. 1.  Another ""Draft Warren"" movement? If you follow politics, you have heard this one: Liberals say Elizabeth Warren has to run for president because Hillary Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street. And now that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top Senate Democratic job -- you are about to hear this: Warren has to run for leader because Chuck Schumer is too cozy with Wall Street. The senator from Massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run, but Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left. ""What this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with Chuck Schumer, because he's so close to Wall Street, and it's an issue they've really been hammering on,"" Kucinich said. ""So watch for more of that, because I have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard, through Warren or not."" 2.  A good week for Boehner. Yes, you read that right. It has been a rocky year for House Speaker John Boehner, but his allies think they may have just turned a corner. The House of Representatives passed the Republican budget last week as well as a big Medicare change known as the ""doc fix"" because it clarifies reimbursement rates to Medicare providers. NPR's Juana Summers shared reporting on how Team Boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore. ""Part of (his success) is because of the speaker's willingness to use unconventional tactics, to work with Democrat Nancy Pelosi for that Medicare reform,"" Summers said. ""Congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return. So whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating."" 3. Bush-Rubio? Rubio-Bush? Watch the real estate listings! Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio both call Florida home. And both want to be the Republican nominee for president. They also happen to be on friendly terms. So among Florida Republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a ""dream ticket."" Of course, it won't happen. Can't happen. Rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state. (Dick Cheney changed his residency from Texas to Wyoming right before joining the George W. Bush ticket.) But Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post said the obstacles aren't preventing Florida Republicans from doing a little dreaming. ""They say, look, Bush has all this executive experience, he's bilingual, he has a Mexican-American wife,"" O'Keefe said. ""Rubio is young.  He has an interest in foreign policy. Why not?"" 4. Ted Cruz wants to ""rock"" the youth vote. Much was made of the fact that Liberty University students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which Ted Cruz announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. But it gave Cruz a big crowd -- and Robert Costa of The Washington Post reports that Team Cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement. ""He's playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months,"" Costa said. ""And he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives, who aren't really familiar with Bush and are looking for someone new."" 5. Is Kasich waiting for a ""summer wave""? John Kasich had a well-regarded visit to New Hampshire last week. And he got a decent buzz out of a New York fund-raising stop, too. So is he ready to launch and join the crowded GOP 2016 presidential field? Not so fast. Two New Hampshire Republicans keeping close tabs on GOP visitors say he wouldn't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run. A national GOP source plugged into to the Kasich operation says the governor hasn't made a firm decision, and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call. That, too, is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run. This national source said Kasich is one of two GOP governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a ""summer wave"" of new entries. The other, according to this source, is GOP Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.","Can liberals ""Draft Warren"" to run for Democrats' top Senate spot?

"Washington (CNN)There should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in Washington this spring. Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. Here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited D.C. blossoms: . The city's first cherry trees were destroyed . In 1910, 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, thanks to a gift from the city of Tokyo and the advocacy of Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, one of the first female board members of the National Geographic Society. These trees, however, were riddled with disease and were destroyed. Two years later, first lady Helen Herron Taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from Japan. Winter's almost over: See the proof . The festival was launched more than 20 years later . It wasn't until 1935 that civic groups and the D.C. government came together to hold the first ""Cherry Blossom Festival."" That first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of Washington school children. It's not all about cherry trees . That's right, there's a Blossom Kite Festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on March 28th. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there's even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Two types of trees dominate . In the 1912 gift of trees to Washington, there were 12 different varieties. Today, two varieties are dominant -- Yoshino and Kwanzan. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms. The Yoshino, which produce white blossoms, are closer to the northern part of the Tidal Basin near the Washington Monument. Descendants of the original trees live in Japan . In 2011, about 120 trees propagated from D.C.'s surviving 1912 trees were sent back to Japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees. Over the years, cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to Japan for horticultural projects.","The National Cherry Blossom Festival starts March 20 in Washington .
Peak bloom is expected in mid-April ."
"(CNN)Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been ordered to stand trial over her role in a controversial rice subsidy scheme that cost the country billions. The first court hearing will take place on May 19, a statement from Thailand's supreme court said. ""This case falls under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court Criminal Division for Persons Holding Political Positions ... and the charges brought [against Yingluck] are accepted,"" the statement said. If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison. On her Facebook page, Yingluck said she behaved with integrity and honesty during her time as prime minister. ""I pledge that I have followed correct proceedings of the constitution, laws of the country in every way."" The rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop. But critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it couldn't sell without losing money. Anger over the scheme played a role in the protests that led to the downfall of Yingluck's government and a military coup in May last year. In January, Thailand's military-appointed National Legislative Assembly (NLA) voted in favor of impeaching Yingluck for her role in the rice program. Though the vote was largely symbolic, as she had already lost her post, it carries a five-year ban from politics. CNN's Kocha Olarn and journalist Kiki Dhitavat in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been ordered to stand trial .

"(CNN)Gov. Mike Pence unleashed a firestorm on Indiana last week when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the LGBT community of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion. The ramifications for the Hoosier State are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts, petitions and travel bans. As the controversy mushrooms, here's what got us to where we are. And where things are headed. Last week, Pence put his signature on the RFRA -- a law that allows Indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense. The law states that the government can't ""substantially burden a person's exercise of religion"" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be ""substantially burdened"" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Pence says the RFRA ""ensures that Indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people's religious liberty."" Pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law. Civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief. ""Silence is consent!"" tweets Laurel Davilia, a commentator on Brass Knuckles Progressives Radio. From sports teams to musicians to other cities and states, they fell like dominoes. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and set to host its men's basketball Final Four in the city this week, said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years. The NBA, WNBA and NFL issued critical statements too. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome. ""The Colts have always embraced inclusiveness, tolerance, and a diverse fan base,"" Irsay tweets.  ""We welcome ALL fans to Colts Nation.   ONE FAMILY!"" A petition posted on change.org hopes to get the Big Ten Conference to move its football championship out of Indianapolis. ""I think that Indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex, age, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation,"" Sean Burke of Madison, Wisconsin, says in the petition.  ""As a football fan, I think we can send a message by calling on the NCAA and Big Ten Conference to take a stand."" Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is scheduled to host the league's championship game through the 2021 season. At last check, the petition had more than 11,000 supporters. The mayors of San Francisco and Seattle have barred spending on travel to Indiana.  The governors of Connecticut and Washington state did the same thing. And you can add Wilco to the boycott bandwagon. The group is canceling its May 7 show in Indianapolis, it says on Facebook. ""The 'Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us,"" Wilco says.  ""Hope to get back to the Hoosier State someday soon, when this odious measure is repealed."" Cher is among the artists speaking out.  Her son Chaz Bono is a transgender man. ""#GOVPENCE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF RIGHT WING RACISM, ASAULT ON WOMANS RIGHTS & HATRED OF LGBT AMERICANS,"" she tweets. Indiana's top two state lawmakers pledged Monday to amend the state's controversial ""religious freedom"" law to clarify that it cannot be used to discriminate against gay people. ""This law does not discriminate, and it will not be allowed to do so,"" David Long, the Indiana Senate president pro tem, said during a news conference with state House Speaker Brian Bosma. Pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law. Critics still weren't on board with the anti-discrimination claims.  Opponents of RFRA marched around the state capitol. Someone even created a satire ad:  ""Indiana. It's a great place to be a bigot."". The rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in Tuesday's edition of the Indianapolis Star blares the headline:  ""Fix.  This.  Now."" The editorial suggests the RFRA and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist. The state is at a crossroads it says. ""(N)o matter its original intent (the law) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future,"" according to the editorial.  ""Only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage."" The editorial closes with: . ""Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand. ""You must act with courage and wisdom. You must lead us forward now. You must ensure that all Hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination. ""The laws can co-exist. And so can we."" Some of the GOP's top figures are backing Pence despite the controversy.  Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have voiced their support.  Both are considered likely Republican candidates for the White House. Sen. Ted Cruz, who announced his candidacy last week, is also on board. ""I'm proud to stand with Gov. @mike_pence for religious liberty, and I urge Americans to do the same,"" Cruz tweets. Indiana is the 20th state to adopt a ""religious freedom restoration"" law, most of which are modeled after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993. But that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and wasn't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years. Adam Talbot, a spokesman with the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, stresses that those 20 laws are ""dramatically different in their scope and effect."" ""Calling them similar in this way risks being misleading. Indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country,"" Talbot says. Arkansas' legislature passed an Indiana-style law on Friday, which now heads to the state's governor for approval. Despite the controversy, the Indiana governor says concerns that his state's new ""religious freedom"" law will allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers is the result of a ""tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding."" Still, he was hard pressed to explain why that wasn't the case. Given a chance on Sunday to add some clarity, Pence refused to answer at least six yes-or-no questions from ABC's George Stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians. Jeremy Diamond and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.","Indiana is under fire for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .

"(CNN)""The Stomp"" remains one of the most controversial plays in NCAA history -- when Duke's Christian Laettner lifted his foot and stepped on Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, the 1992 NCAA East Regional Final. Mention The Stomp in a diner or bar in Kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue-haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how Laettner is the vilest human on Earth. Then, the woulda, coulda, shouldas begin: Laettner should've been kicked out; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot; Kentucky should've advanced to the Final Four. The Stomp returned to headlines this week after ESPN aired a ""30 for 30"" documentary called ""I Hate Christian Laettner,"" detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day. When it comes to The Stomp, Laettner says he decided to give a ""little payback"" while Timberlake lay helpless on the ground. If Kentucky fans needed more reason to hate Laettner, those words might've been it. But on Twitter, Laettner issued a video apology to Timberlake, the first time he'd ever done so: . Timberlake could've lashed back, but he's too classy for that. He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He remains active in basketball, coaching an eighth-grade girls travel-team in Atlanta. (In full transparency, I coached with him last year.) He responded to Laettner, saying he appreciates and accepts the apology. But he makes it clear where his loyalty lies. At the end of his 23-second message, Timberlake's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with: ""Go Big Blue."" Timberlake doesn't dwell on The Stomp. The thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by Coach Rick Pitino after the game. Pitino held up an old Sports Illustrated cover that said the Kentucky program was in shambles. Pitino told his players that although they lost on the court, his players had done something much bigger: They'd put Kentucky basketball back on the map. ""It put a lot of things in perspective, especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy NCAA sanctions,"" Timberlake says. ""All I remember is working with our heads down, attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability. And that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work, even in a loss."" That is a message, he says, that still resonates in his life: ""Sometimes you don't see the full picture and don't reap the immediate rewards of your work, but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen."" Timberlake has had fun with The Stomp over the years, even donning a ""I Still Hate Laettner"" T-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when Kentucky and Duke played a couple years ago. He jokes that he's not sure if he was ""a true hater"" of Laettner like so many others. But that game will never quite sit well with Kentucky players and fans. However, Timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on Laettner that he thought he'd never have. ""I can really respect his accomplishments, his basketball career and his passion for the game,"" Timberlake says. Don't get him wrong. Timberlake still bleeds Kentucky blue. He'd love to see Kentucky play Duke for the title this year, this time with the Wildcats walking away as the winners.

"(CNN)The end of ""Jinx,"" the six-part HBO documentary about real estate heir Robert Durst, has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements Durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution. Durst, as you probably heard, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and he has been suspected, but never charged, in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. Whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the Constitution, as well as our fast-evolving ideas about privacy. While Durst's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial, the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in. Let's go over three main reasons why: . 1. Is this inadmissible hearsay? Probably not. Hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth. It really just means a witness can't testify at trial about someone else's version of the facts. If a sentence starts with ""He told me"" or ""She said that,"" it's probably hearsay.  As general proposition, hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible, but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception-riddled rule itself. Perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions. These can be admitted against a defendant. Why?  Well, the idea is that these statements are reliable. The thinking is that people don't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it. 2. Is this a violation of Durst's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination? Again, probably not. The rules of the U.S. Constitution are a different matter. The Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause states that ""[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ..."" By definition then, compulsory self-incrimination requires, well, ""compulsion.""  And not just any compulsion. The kind of compulsion targeted by the Fifth Amendment is governmental coercion. Durst may still contend that his ""confession"" wasn't voluntary.  It's true that confessions deemed ""involuntary"" are often excluded at trial under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  However, a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity. Voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person, such as a journalist. What of Durst's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police?  Sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action, constitutionally speaking. This is not an easy case for a defendant to make, though.  Durst would have to establish that the HBO interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police. The police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians.  But the police frequently benefit from the work of good Samaritans or citizens volunteering information, photos or iPhone videos.  The television show ""America's Most Wanted"" has been premised on this idea for decades.  Given the defendant's burden here, it's unlikely that he can convince a judge that, in light of all the circumstances, filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police. The bottom line is this: A voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will, not physical intimidation or psychological pressure. How was Durst ""pressured"" when alone in the bathroom?  However, his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will. 3. Can Durst argue for some ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom? Not in our modern world, and not in this case. Perhaps in decades past, a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom, but things have changed. Subjects of documentaries and reality TV stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day.  Moreover, everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their ""hot"" mic.  In this brave new media world, the rule appears to be: You wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk. This is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews.  No matter how good an interviewee a client may be, audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites.  Admitting to killing ""them all"" would fall into this category. When it comes to giving interviews, it's probably better for defendants such as Durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, especially doubt of the reasonable kind.","Robert Durst made some potentially incriminating statements at the end of HBO's ""Jinx""

"(CNN)John Isner could not keep the United States in the Davis Cup on Sunday, so it was likely small consolation that his incredible tennis milestone remained unbeaten. While the American lost to Andy Murray in Scotland, putting Great Britain into the quarterfinals of the prestigious teams event, halfway across the world an absorbing battle was playing out between two of South America's most bitter rivals. In the end it didn't come close to matching Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010, but the fourth rubber in the clash between Argentina and Brazil made its own piece of history. For six hour and 43 minutes, Leonardo Mayer and Joao Souza contested the second-longest singles match in tennis history -- and third longest of any format after a seven-hour doubles clash between Switzerland and the Czech Republic in 2013. Mayer eventually triumphed, after his 11th match point, winning 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 5-7 15-13 in front of a delirious home crowd in Buenos Aires to send the tie to a deciding rubber. It set the scene for Federico Delbonis to take on Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci in the decider -- with the winner to earn a clash with Novak Djokovic's Serbia, a 5-0 victor over Balkan rival Croatia. Delbonis had won the first set 6-3 when play was halted for the day due to bad light. The match will resume on Monday. Meanwhile, back in Glasgow, the British team celebrated after earning a home quarterfinal clash with France on July 17-19, the weekend after the completion of Wimbledon. ""It was an incredible experience,"" said world No. 5 Murray, who beat Isner 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in two and a half hours to give his team a 3-1 lead and ensure a repeat of the result of last year's first-round clash between the two nations. ""Playing in front of a home crowd is a bit more pressured, especially today, but I managed to fight my way through the first set and played really well after that."" It was the second defeat of the tie for the big-serving Isner, who lost a five-hour five-setter against James Ward on Friday. The Swiss, without leading players Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka, crashed out at the first hurdle with a 3-2 defeat in Belgium. Canada makes their way into the quarterfinals for the second time in three years after beating Japan 3-2. Vasek Pospisil led the tie-break victory by defeating Go Soeda in straight sets on Sunday. Canada will face Belgium in July, after Wimbledon concludes. France, beaten by Switzerland in last year's final, went through after beating Germany 3-2 -- losing both of Sunday's meaningless singles rubbers having already secured victory in the doubles 24 hours earlier. Australia conquered three-time champion Czech Republic, a semifinalist last year, with Bernard Tomic clinching victory in the fourth rubber against Lukas Rosol. Seeking a 29th title, but first since 2003, the Australians will next host Kazakhstan -- which defeated Italy 3-2 as Aleksandr Nedovyesov overcame Fabio Fognini in a five-set decider after trailing 2-1.","Leonardo Mayer beats Joao Souza in longest Davis Cup singles match .

"(CNN)Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an Australian teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of ISIS in Iraq. ""I can confirm that the Australian government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18-year-old Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the Middle East,"" she told reporters. ""If these reports are confirmed, this is another tragic example of a young Australian being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in Iraq and Syria but beyond."" On Wednesday, ISIS claimed that ""Abu Abdullah al-Australi,"" along with four other foreign fighters, had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of Ramadi in Iraq. The claim, issued on a Twitter account associated with the Anbar provincial division of ISIS, was accompanied by a series of 20 images, including a photo of a young man who looked like Bilardi. The image appeared to show Bilardi at the wheel of a car with the caption, ""Abu Abdullah al-Australi (may Allah accept him), the attacker on the 8th Brigade."" The other attackers hailed from Belgium, Syria, Uzbekistan and the Caucasus, the Twitter account claimed. Victoria police said Bilardi first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year. A search of his family's home in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn following his disappearance uncovered chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device, police said, although no actual bombs were found. Bishop said Bilardi's passport had been canceled in October on the advice of Australian security agencies. Australian media have reported that Bilardi kept a since-deleted blog, written under his alias Abu Abdullah al-Australi. Entitled ""From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey,"" it reportedly detailed his transition from an ""atheist school student in affluent Melbourne to a soldier of the Khilafah preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam."" The blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in Melbourne, after an initial attempt to move to Iraq or Syria failed. ""This plan involved launching a string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar,"" he wrote, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Member of Bilardi's family have linked the teen's radicalization to the loss of his mother from cancer. ""He's just a young boy that went looking for something after he lost someone very very dear to him, his mother,"" his aunt, Connie Bilardi, told CNN affiliate Seven on Monday. A former classmate of Bilardi's from Melbourne's Craigieburn Secondary College described the teen on Facebook as a ""shy kid who didn't like to be disturbed"". ""One day, he randomly got angry at me and tried to punch me,"" he posted. ""Always keep an eye out on the quiet ones."" A former penpal of Bilardi told CNN he cut off communication with the teenager about two years ago, when Bilardi started posting Islamic extremist messages on his Facebook page. The friend, who requested not to be named, said he first met Bilardi on the website interpals.net about seven years ago. They shared a love for soccer -- Bilardi was a supporter of Chelsea Football Club -- and became penpals. Bilardi told him about his mother's death, and confided that he was fighting with his family, because they would not allow him to go overseas to study. The penpal said he started noticing a change in Bilardi's behavior when the teen started posting ""things that supported Osama bin Laden"" on Facebook. ""I got scared,"" the friend said. ""My friends here told me that maybe I should stop talking to him."" He blocked Bilardi on the social networking site about two years ago. After a while, he said, he got curious about how his old penpal was doing. ""I thought he was my friend. I wanted to make sure he was okay... I sent him an email saying 'Are you well?' but he never wrote back."" Bishop said that 90 Australian citizens are in Iraq and Syria fighting on the side of ISIS, and that at least 20 Australians have been killed in the conflict. The passports of some 100 Australians had been canceled on national security grounds, she said. Bishop appealed to young Australians ""not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization, to not be lured into believing that they're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor."" ""This is a brutal organization dedicated to creating misery and hardship,"" she said. ""Its activities of beheadings and executions and crucifixions all take us back to the dark ages."" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressed Bilardi's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press Thursday. This is a horrific situation -- an absolutely horrific situation -- and it shows the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters,"" he said. ""It's very, very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking alien and extreme ideology."" Last week, two Australian teen brothers were arrested at Sydney Airport on suspicion of trying to leave the country to join ISIS. CNN's Jennifer Z. Deaton, Naomi Ng and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Australia is seeking to confirm reports a Melbourne teen killed himself in an ISIS suicide attack .

We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: ""What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?"" And ""Where is Paraguay, anyway?"" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen.

Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for ""The Missing Bourdain"" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film ""The Limey"" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's ""Parts Unknown"" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.",Bourdain goes looking for the story of his long-lost great-great-grandfather in Paraguay .
"(CNN)The story of the Jews in the United States is a testament to ""American exceptionalism"" and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in Europe and Muslim lands. In fact, the economic prosperity and social standing of America's Jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities. This positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the Newport, Rhode Island, Hebrew Congregation in 1790 by President George Washington: ""It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States ... gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.""  Since then, American Jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors, senators, mayors, Cabinet officers and in the military, and today, most American adults are unaware of and don't seem to care who's Jewish. Thus it comes as a shock when at the University of California Los Angeles, a Jewish woman student applicant for the Student Council's Judicial Board is initially rejected after being asked: ""Given that you are a Jewish student and very active in the Jewish community, how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view?"" According to The New York Times, the discussion that followed had ""seemed to echo the kind of questions, prejudices and tropes -- particularly about divided loyalties -- that have plagued Jews across the globe for centuries."" The minutes and video of the event suggest some student leaders seemed to be auditioning for the Salem witch trials and others for jobs as political commissars in Communist North Korea.  And in February, at another University of California campus in Davis, Jewish students opposed to a Student Council resolution advocating a boycott of Israel were heckled by cries of ""Allahu Akbar"" and a Jewish fraternity house was daubed with a swastika. Chancellor Gene Block of UCLA called the dust up on his campus a ""teachable moment.""  Yes, agreed. It seems UCLA's diverse body of students requires remedial classes in civics. Would UCLA students consider it appropriate to ask U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan similarly hostile and demeaning questions? Apparently it's necessary for the university to teach its student leadership that the U.S. Constitution bans religious tests for public office.  While they are at it, they also can inform them that the Bill of Rights assures freedom of religion, speech and assembly to all citizens.  California's university administrators might need to be reminded that Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to all Americans, and they have an obligation to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students. This includes, among other things, promptly and effectively addressing certain hostile environments. As for the UC Davis students, they need to learn that support for Israel is a legitimate American tradition. A century ago, Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis asserted: ""Zionism is the Pilgrim inspiration and impulse all over again ... to be good Americans, we must be better Jews, and to be better Jews, we must become Zionists."" Students are of course free to disagree with Brandeis but not to harass or intimidate Jews who support his argument. The events in California might be regarded as isolated incidents and youthful excesses of the type that has always marked campus life. Except of course that is not true. This type of hatred, stereotyping and bias is a worrying new development that suggests a generational problem. In our recent study, my Trinity College colleague, Ariela Keysar, and I found that 54% of Jewish students reported experiencing or witnessing ant-Semitism on campus during the six months of September 2013-March 2014. Our survey covered 1,157 Jewish students on 55 campuses. The patterns and high rates of anti-Semitism that were reported were surprising. Another finding was that female students were more likely than males (58% versus 51%) to report anti-Semitism. Jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today. America's universities need to foster American exceptionalism and values.  They should take special care to avoid following current ""European fashion trends.""  The situation in France today demonstrates the price of failing to nip youthful extremism in the bud. Twenty years ago, complaints by Jewish students in Paris that they were subject to anti-Semitism from a strange coalition of Marxist, fascist and Islamist groups were ignored by complacent university and government officials. The dangerous streets of Paris are witness to what results when a country ignores problems and panders to extremist opinions.  The army is currently deployed across France to protect synagogues and Jewish community buildings. But history has taught us what begins with the Jews doesn't end with the Jews. The French army also has to defend the nation's shopping malls, government buildings and of course, its cartoonists.","Barry Kosmin: U.S. tradition of tolerance is challenged by incidents of anti-Semitism on campus .

"(CNN)Indiana is declaring a public health emergency in one county due to an epidemic of HIV. Gov. Mike Pence issued the order Thursday for Scott County, which has 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. The county averages about five new cases a year. ""Scott County is facing an epidemic of HIV, but this is not a Scott County problem; this is an Indiana problem,""  Pence said in a news release. All the cases in the current outbreak are linked to injection drug use, primarily of the prescription opioid opana. The declaration requires law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials to develop a response plan that also includes hospitals and health care providers. A team from the CDC Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention arrived Monday and is working with local and state health officials to stop the outbreak. Their recommendations include a  short-term needle exchange program and public awareness campaign focusing on safe sex, needle disposal, addiction services, and HIV testing and treatment. HIV can take up to three months to appear in a person's system after they are infected. Health officials recommend people who have participated in risky behavior, such as needle sharing and unprotected sex, to be tested for HIV now and again in three months. ""I am confident that together we will stop this HIV outbreak in its tracks,"" Pence said.","Seventy nine cases of HIV have been confirmed in Scott County, Indiana .
All cases are linked to intravenous drug use ."
"Omoa, Honduras (CNN)Alexis González walks slowly and with some hesitation, using the outside wall of his house for balance. ""I'm getting used to the prosthesis,"" the 16-year-old says. He tries to smile, but an expression of sadness quickly returns to his face. When he was 15, González made a decision that would forever change his life -- to leave Omoa, an impoverished village in Honduras  -- with dreams of getting to the United States. At the end of the trek -- about 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) across Mexico and Guatemala -- he saw hope, school, a job and the chance to send money home. ""Sometimes we don't even have food to eat and I also wanted to get a higher education,"" González says. His mother was singlehandedly raising nine children, working odd jobs in restaurants and the nearby fields. They lived in a single room, an adobe house with dirt floors built on a steep and muddy hill. Chickens being raised for food roamed around the structure.  González says his father left the family when he was little boy. When Gonzalez left in January 2014, he didn't ask his mother for permission. He only left a letter telling her about his plans. ""I wouldn't have let him go,"" his mother Mercedes Meléndez says. ""When he left I went looking for him everywhere."" She even went to Corinto on the Honduras-Guatemala border to ask authorities if they had seen him, she says. González says he traveled by land through Honduras and Guatemala with a teenage cousin.  They took the bus and also walked and hitch-hiked in some places. Once in Mexico, they got on the cargo train migrants call ""The Beast."" Migrants get a risky, but free ride clinging to the outside of the train. Violent gangs sometimes board the train to rape, rob and kill migrants. Those without money to pay off the gangsters are thrown off, sometimes to their deaths in deep ravines or sharp rocks. González says he never faced any gangs. Things seem to be going well for him and his cousin for a while.  They had been traveling for a few days on the train and were excited at nearing the U.S.-Mexico border and crossing into the land of their dreams. But they were also tired. They ate what they could, but were unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time.  They were hanging onto the grate above the train car's couplers.  ""We used our own sweaters to tie ourselves to the train so we wouldn't fall off,"" González says. But tragedy was just around the corner. Somehow, he doesn't know how, he fell off the train while sleeping. He woke up bleeding profusely. ""The train had severed my right leg and part of my left heel,"" he says. He was eventually rescued by the Mexican Red Cross and taken to a hospital where he recovered for a month. He stayed at a shelter for wounded migrants for another two months. There he was fitted with a prosthesis free of charge. It's not difficult to find stories of minors in Central America who have lost limbs, been kidnapped or died while trying to travel through Mexico with the dream of migrating to the United States. Juan Armando Enamorado, a 22-year-old who lives in the coastal town of Tela, Honduras, says he almost lost his life at 17 when he jumped off the train, fleeing from gangs. ""They got on the train to steal money from people. When I heard they were coming, I jumped off the train traveling at more than 30 mph,"" he says. Enamorado says he was barely able to make it to the nearest town after walking for four days without food and very little water. Children are fleeing endemic poverty and drug violence in Central America. Last year, U.S. immigration authorities in the United States detained nearly 18,000 minors from Honduras as they were trying to cross the border without documents.  Altogether, more than 67,000 minors, mainly from Central America, were detained, according to U.S. government figures. To understand why children are fleeing in droves, CNN traveled to San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  The second largest city in the country. It has the highest reported murder rate in the world.  Violence is fueled by turf wars between two powerful gangs that control entire neighborhoods. The Honduran government is trying to change this harsh reality by deploying security forces to hotspots. Vilma Maldonado says her son was forced to leave because of death threats from gangs when he was only 15 years old.  He left La Lima, just outside San Pedro Sula, four years ago at the age of 19. The last time she heard from him he was in Monterrey, Mexico, hoping to cross into the United States. ""Sometimes I think he's dead,"" Maldonado says crying. ""But then I seek refuge in God and try to think the opposite and ask God to take these ideas out of my mind because if I'm trusting God you have to have faith that my son is still alive."" For Monsignor Rómulo Emiliani, Auxiliary Bishop of San Pedro Sula, the migration of Central American children to the United States is a regional disgrace. ""It's something terrible, sad and shameful for us Hondurans that nearly 18,000 of our children have desperately left because of hunger and violence. It's a slap on our faces and there are people that don't care about these 18,000 children. ""Can you imagine the trip for a child who's 4, 6, 10, 12 years old all the way to the United States?  Many girls have been fondled and raped by the smugglers,"" Monsignor Emiliani says. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández says his country has fallen victim to powerful criminal organizations fueled by drug dollars and weapons coming from the north and drugs from the south, but insists his government is working hard to stem the tide. ""We have our own responsibility.  We accept that and we're doing our work. We are pushing this forward with all that we have. Other countries are responsible for this war that we're living,"" President Hernández says. Back in Omoa, Mercedes Meléndez, the mother of Alexis González, says she's deeply worried about her son. ""He has told me that he's depressed. He has recently been better, but he used to say he wanted to die.  I was getting very worried because he said that he wanted to kill himself,"" Meléndez says. The teenager says he now draws and writes to forget. He shows us a drawing of a family of four holding hands. He uses pastel colors and soft features in the drawing and inscribed words like ""happy,"" ""love,"" and ""I love you"" throughout. He may never be able to go to college or help his family the way he wanted. But asked if he regrets his decision to leave, he says he doesn't: the rewards were so high, it was worth the incredible risk. And for countless others like him -- from across Central America -- the same is true. And they will keep trying.","Honduran teen tells how he lost his leg trying to get to the U.S.

"(CNN)An Indiana jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison. In 2013, Purvi Patel showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding.  According to court documents, at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which, she said, she placed in a bag in a dumpster. Patel was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent, though these charges are decidedly contradictory.  ""Feticide"" would require Patel to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb.  On the other hand, ""felony neglect of a dependent"" requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it. As Amanda Marcotte of Slate pointed out in February, Patel ""was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus.""  The only thing more preposterous than this is that Patel was charged in the first place. The evidence against her has been shaky from the start.  Initially, police questioned Patel when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present.  Prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that Patel had purchased miscarriage-inducing drugs, but there was no evidence Patel took the drugs.  In fact, they didn't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried. Nonetheless, after five hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Patel of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial  evidence.  And on March 30, 2015, she was given a 30-year-sentence on the felony neglect charge, 10 of which were suspended. She'll serve a concurrent six-year sentence for feticide. Patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under Indiana's anti-choice ""feticide"" law.  In 2011, Bei Bei Shuai was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant.  In 2013, lawyers announced Shuai had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin. Still, both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government.  But Indiana's harsh anti-abortion laws, and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies, make women far less likely to reach out for this help. Conservatives like to say that women are the ""victims of abortion"" and that laws such as the Indiana ""feticide"" measure are intended to ""protect"" them.  Years ago, the president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists.  The website of the Ohio Right to Life association similarly argues that ""no one is interested in sending women to jail."" And in fact, the Indiana ""feticide"" law was plainly intended to criminalize ""knowing or intentional termination of another's pregnancy.""  But there's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals.  So much for not sending women to jail. Those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned.  After all, Patel was convicted based on text messages about miscarriage-inducing drugs, not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs. In Shuai's case, it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide.  So what else might be considered a ""deliberate attempt"" to terminate one's own pregnancy?  If a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway?  Merely googling abortion-inducing drugs?  Telling a friend you've thought about having an abortion? The message from Purvi Patel's conviction is clear. After all, there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies.  Laws like Indiana's and cases like Patel's don't change that.  What they do is make women hide, avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk. In Texas, which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics, abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures.  Researchers suggest that's partly because rates of self-abortion, which then go unreported in the statistics, are increasing.  And anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case. Before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. New anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions won't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies.  It simply restricts their options to do so. Ask yourself: In the case of Purvi Patel, even if she did intend to self-abort and used black market drugs to do so, and if she indeed delivered a live fetus, wouldn't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life-saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster? Purvi Patel is reportedly appealing her conviction.  We should all appeal to logic and sanity and compassion and repeal these horrid anti-choice, anti-pregnancy laws.","Sally Kohn: Indiana jury sentenced woman to 20 years, charging her with feticide and neglect of a dependent after she miscarried .

"(CNN)On October 24, 1944, U.S. warplanes swarmed at the Leviathan of battleships, Japan's Musashi, splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it. It took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in World War II to the bottom of the Philippines' Sibuyan Sea. This month, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight-year search for the Musashi. Japanese maritime expert Kazushige Todaka is 90% sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in March. And that's a breakthrough. ""I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true,"" Todaka said. Unfortunately, Japanese war ships did not bear their names on their sides, so a full identification takes a while. But the wreckage matched the ship's description, and it had a mount for the Imperial Japanese Navy seal, a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship's 70 years in the sea. On Thursday, Paul Allen's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves. An unmanned vehicle's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness, revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water. The live tour began with one of the Musashi's many death blows -- a warped bow. ""What we see here is torpedo damage,"" said Robert Kraft, the expedition's leader. Torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship, belling the metal outward. The remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage, as Kraft and his team described it.  A big dent pushing inward, he explained, was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship, exploding outside the hull, pushing it in. ""It's the concussive force next to the ship,"" he said. The submersible showed multiple hits right under the Musashi's main gun, perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time. It weighed 270 tons, and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed. While in the Musashi's death throes, the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship's deck, Allen's researchers said. It was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns. The Musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time, the researchers said. But the giant had an Achilles heel. It was very vulnerable to torpedoes. The ship caught fire; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail. U.S. warplanes went in for the kill. ""No defenses would have saved her,"" an expedition member commented, as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next. As the Musashi sank, parts of it, where air was trapped imploded. The wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members. About 1,300 more were rescued by other Japanese ships, including the executive officer. The camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains, but among unfired shells and bent iron, small objects peered at the lens. Could the small chain have been a necklace? Pocket watch chain? Those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on Allen's website. Launched in 1940, the Musashi was, at the time, in the largest class of warship ever constructed, displacing more than 69,000 tons. It had a twin, the Yamato. The U.S. Navy sank the Musashi during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines. Microsoft billionaire Allen has said his long fascination with World War II history was inspired by his father's service in the U.S. Army. To finally arrive at the wreck, Kraft's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices, such as the Bluefins that have searched for missing airliner Malaysia Airlines flight 370. Nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites. ""That moment of discovery was exhilarating,"" Kraft said. CNN's Euan McKirdy, Jethro Mullen, Yoko Wakatsuki and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Japan's giant battleship Musashi was sunk off the Philippines in World War II .

"(CNN)Lewis Hamilton has conquered the world of Formula One but becoming a global superstar is a far bumpier ride. Sporting ability has been transformed into lasting celebrity by footballers like Pele and David Beckham and NBA star Michael Jordan. At the age of 30 -- and with the fastest car in the world at his fingertips -- Hamilton is at the peak of his powers. During Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, millions of hardcore Hamilton fans will bite their fingernails and hold their breath when their hero returns to the track in his Mercedes racing car. But will the Briton's quest for a third world title in 2015 even register with the average Joe? Half a billion TV viewers watch F1 across the year, a figure which pales in comparison with the 4.7 billion football fans who watch the English Premier League over the course of a season. Jon Stainer, managing director of leading sport and entertainment market research company Repucom, argues that Hamilton, however, is already gaining wider recognition. ""On a global scale Lewis already sits in the top half of all celebrities across sport, arts and music,"" he told CNN. Repucom monitors celebrity trends by a monthly survey of the general public where 5,000 famous faces are rated according to certain parameters. Those who rank in their study of the world's top-20 faces includes actors Angelina Jolie and Leonardo DiCaprio, singers Madonna and Jennifer Lopez, footballer Beckham and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates. ""We look at celebrity awareness and other metrics like likeability, whether they are seen as trendsetters, the level of trust people place in them and whether people aspire to have a life like that celebrity. ""We are starting to see Lewis go beyond the traditional Formula One audience into the mainstream audience. ""Some of that is spurred on by his on-off relationship with [former girlfriend] Nicole Scherzinger. Those stories put him in the headlines beyond the back pages."" Hamilton split from popstar and TV personality Scherzinger for the fourth time in February after a seesawing seven-year relationship. He may no longer be one half of motorsport's ""Posh And Becks"" but he's not been shy of socializing with stars from other spheres. Just 10 days before the Australian GP, Hamilton was partying at Paris Fashion Week with musician and producer Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian. Mixing with celebrity friends has raised Hamilton's profile, and for some of his fans that is part of his appeal, but there is also a danger of alienating his petrolhead devotees. The famous friends, bright red private jet -- complete with traveling pampered pooches Roscoe and Coco -- and forays into song writing might be at odds with the perceived image of a feisty F1 world champion. Marketing expert Steve Martin, who worked with Hamilton in his role as CEO of M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment, warned the driver's lifestyle could be ""a bit showy."" ""I'm not sure if in any walk of life people like showy people,"" he told CNN. ""And so why should that be different on the international stage in a sporting context?"" Christopher Thomas, a Hamilton super-fan from New York, says: ""Hanging out with top celebrities isn't a problem as long as it doesn't interfere with his ability to race. ""As long as he shows up to the race and does what he's supposed to, everything is fine."" Hamilton has often split opinion with his emotional approach to racing. Unlike his seemingly unflappable Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, the Briton races with his heart on his sleeve. For some, that passionate impulse is exactly what draws them to him. ""Lewis is cautious and aggressive all at the same time,"" says Brazilian fan Melissa, who shows her support for the Mercedes driver by referring to herself as Mel ""Hamilton."" ""Sometimes I think I will have a heart attack watching him! ""He does not live by certain standards. He is not hiding. He is authentic."" Thomas agrees: ""He's so popular because you see him show his emotions. He stays true to himself."" Hamilton's fiery responses have helped make him a fearless, instinctive driver who gives no ground on track. Consider the mental resolve required to win both his world titles at the final race of the season -- or, in the case of his 2008 triumph with McLaren in Brazil, at the very last corner. But then there have been the meltdowns, which reached their nadir in a tumultuous 2011 season when Hamilton had an ongoing spat with Ferrari driver Felipe Massa -- at one point calling his driving skills ""frickin' ridiculous"" -- and controversially criticized the race stewards in Monaco. ""A lot of commentators diss Lewis for being open about his emotional life,"" says Tom Roope, whose company The Rumpus Room creates Hamilton's digital media. ""There is that Marmite-ness -- you either love him or hate him. ""But I think people like the fact that he's not running around trying to be perfect."" His hot-blooded impulses do allow a fleeting glimpse into the real Hamilton. Following Hamilton at grands prix over the last six years, he's not a very visible driver compared to others who can be seen chatting with team members and guests inside the motorhomes. He is courteous and friendly in media briefings, where he will often chew on a handful of sweets, but it is hard to get beyond the façade of the PR-trained F1 driver and understand what he is really like. Marketing and PR expert Martin believes Hamilton could improve his global popularity by opening up a little more. ""If I were to do one or two things, I'd like to make him more natural, to make him relax and be more comfortable in his own skin,"" advised Martin, whose clients include footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, another athlete who has successfully transcended his sport. ""When he talks to use a language that isn't so robotic. Humility and having a common touch is a very big skill that people forget. ""Beckham is the best example, he can show humility, he's down to earth, he's a smiler and he takes the highs and lows in his career very well. ""He has that continuous appeal that is so enduring, and you can take a lot of lessons from that."" If Hamilton is to extend his celebrity beyond the sporting sphere, he could do well to follow Beckham's example in another area too -- philanthropy. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star retired two years ago but he has been an ambassador for children's charity Unicef for the last decade. He and his popstar-turned-fashion-designer wife Victoria have their own charitable trust. When Beckham signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2013 he also donated his multi-million dollar wages to charity. Hamilton has also contributed to Unicef's campaigns and during a break last season he traveled to Haiti to see first hand the charity's work there with malnourished children. ""Being involved in charity and community work is a way Lewis can develop his appeal beyond F1 and the sport audience,"" suggests Stainer. ""That's how Beckham managed to mold and transform his character and marketability towards the end of his playing career. ""Lewis can also touch the lives of more people but that is a difficult thing to do when you're at the peak of your career."" Martin agrees that having a strategy for his career beyond sport is absolutely essential to maintaining a high profile. ""We've worked with Lewis for a number of years and he's been brilliant but it's not about living in the moment, it's about having a plan that evolves,"" he added. ""How does he make sure his appeal is so enduring that it lasts beyond his Formula One career?"" Hamilton still has plenty of racing left in the tank. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen is the oldest driver on the 2015 grid and the Finn will turn 36 in October. For now, at least, there is one relatively easy way for Hamilton, allied with Mercedes' powerful car, to crank up his kudos. ""Win more championships,"" says Thomas. ""And win more races in the U.S. and Canada. ""F1 is still growing in the U.S. and when it comes to celebrity status the U.S. has a big deal to do with what happens globally. ""If you're a celebrity in the U.S. then it transcends outwards into other countries."" Could winning a third world title with Mercedes push Hamilton into the ranks of F1's greatest drivers and deeper into the public consciousness? ""He's the favorite in 2015 because the Mercedes gap to the others is so big that even if it's reduced, it's probably still going to be there,"" Hamilton's biographer Mark Hughes told CNN over the winter. ""Lewis is in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants."" Hamilton has already raced his way to riches from rags, becoming F1's first black star, a winner of 33 grands prix and two world titles, against a backdrop of racing rivalry and a rocky celebrity romance. On Sunday, another chapter will be written in the double world champion's rollercoaster story when the 2015 season fires up around Melbourne's Albert Park.  So, what next? ""Lewis is a bit like a soap opera,"" says Roope. ""It's amazing how much drama there is around him."" ""You need to create a story around somebody to have ongoing appeal,"" says Martin. ""What makes great sports people, the ones that fans like over time, are those who come back from tremendous highs and lows -- that's a great story.""","Lewis Hamilton is starting to reach beyond the traditional Formula One audience .

"(CNN)They're some of the toughest athletes on the planet, saying goodbye to loved ones for almost a year, as they traverse the globe's oceans. Hardened Volvo Ocean Race sailors must sleep in four-hour shifts, and survive on little more than freeze dried food and chocolate bars, if they hope to win the event. The prestigious competition kicked off from Alicante, Spain, in October last year, and will finish nine months later in Gothenberg, Sweden. Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing skipper Ian Walker, spoke about the journey so far. This is the 45-year-old Briton's third Volvo Ocean Race. ""As the leading offshore race -- and the one that is most vulnerable to nature and synonymous with danger -- it could be described as the 'Everest of sailing.'"" ""We trained for six months, covering 16,000 sea miles. As a team, we usually do three weeks on the boat, one week off. When not offshore, we train six-days-a-week in the gym."" ""Everybody has four hours on deck, followed by four hours off when you eat and sleep. On the off-watch, you still have to get on deck and help for any sail changes, so it is quite disturbed."" ""Mainly freeze dried food with some savory and sweet treats like beef jerky, dried fruits, one chocolate bar per day, and nuts."" ""I'm the skipper, so overall in charge of safety and performance. I'm involved with all strategic decisions with my navigator, Simon Fisher, and I run one of the watches when on deck. Onshore, I'm also busy with media duties and management of our 15 shore team members."" ""It can be an emotional roller coaster and it can be tough not to take things personally if they don't go well. At sea, emotions can range from frustration, boredom, elation, being scared, loneliness... it is important to try to keep a level head at all times -- especially if you are the skipper!"" ""I have great respect for the ocean. It will always win in the end so you must respect it. I am also saddened by all the man-made debris we see in the ocean as we sail round the world."" ""A professional sailor with a fierce determination to win. Someone who is prepared to put the needs of the team above his own, and who is prepared to commit over 12 months of his life to being away from normal life.""

"(CNN)He's a Rolls Royce footballer who honed his game in his parents' garage. And even at the age of 40, former Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero is still purring along, showing no signs of running out of gas. The record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an Indian summer to his football career, completing stints at Sydney FC in Australia and more recently at the Delhi Dynamos in the inaugural Indian Super League. Inevitably, the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that doesn't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he's still enjoying himself so much. ""About football, I love every single moment -- the life with teammates, the atmosphere before a game, the free kicks, the goals. I love every moment like the first one,"" Del Piero told CNN's Human to Hero series. The man dubbed ""Il Pinturicchio"" (""the little artist"") has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in Italy. During 19 seasons at Juventus he won 15 trophies including six Serie A crowns and a European Champions League title, as well as setting club records for appearances and goals. In all, Del Piero made 705 appearances for the Bianconeri -- including a record 478 in Serie A -- and scored 289 goals along the way. ""I'm very proud about the records because I do everything for the club. I've had some great moments with the club, with the fans (and) with my teammates,"" he says. Raised in the town of Conegliano in northern Italy, Del Piero's love for football was fostered by his late father, Gino. ""My childhood was fantastic. I trained and played every moment and in every space of my home,"" he recalls. ""You know northern Italy is very cold -- you cannot play outside, so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space. I would play alone, with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer."" Del Piero turned professional at the age of 17, joining Serie B side Padova in 1991 before being snapped up by Juventus for €2.6 million two years later. His longstanding relationship with the ""Old Lady,"" as Juventus is affectionately known, got off on the right foot almost from the start. Del Piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year, becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker Roberto Baggio. The two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level, with both netting 27 times for their country, but their defining moments for the Azzurri could not have been more contrasting. While Baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed Brazil victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup final, Del Piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football's biggest stage. After being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002, Del Piero and Italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in Germany, beating France on penalties in a final remembered primarily for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi. Victory in the final was a ""beautiful"" moment but Del Piero's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier. ""The most special moment in my head, and probably the heads of my teammates, was the semifinal,"" he says. ""Definitely the final, when you take the cup and lift it to the sky, it's beautiful. But the semifinal was the most exciting. We played the home team for 120 minutes. There is a big connection between our two countries. It was incredible."" An epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes, with extra time going the same way, before Fabio Grosso netted in the 119th minute followed by a Del Piero effort moments later. ""I can't hide that my greatest victory is the World Cup. Since you're a kid you think you want to win that. It was massive,"" he says. Italy's third World Cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in Italy's domestic league as Juventus and other Serie A teams were implicated in the ""Calciopoli"" match-fixing scandal. The repercussions would see former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi banned for life by the Italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two Serie A titles won in 2005 and 2006, relegated to Serie B and docked nine points. The demotion to Italy's second tier saw some top players leave the club, including Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, France defender Lilian Thuram and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But the ever-faithful Del Piero stayed put, helping Juventus secure the Serie B title and an immediate return to the top flight. ""I think that staying with Juventus in Serie B, even before I knew how large the points penalty was going to be, was the best decision I could've made,"" Del Piero said last year. ""I had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards, including the (Serie A) trophy I lifted on the last game at the Juventus Stadium."" Del Piero also scored in that final league match against Atalanta in May 2012 and was afforded a hero's send-off with a 20-minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half. ""There were many people crying that day. I was very emotional. I tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some scarfs and cleaning my eyes. It was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever,"" he recalls. A open letter to Juventus' fans confirmed his exit the following July before signing a two-year deal to play for Sydney FC in Australia's A-League in a deal worth AUS$4 million ($3 million). He was soon helping repay that fee, netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time Down Under. Del Piero has since gone on to help promote the new Indian Super League, appearing in the inaugural competition late last year. So what plans does the veteran have for 2015? ""My future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day,"" he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet. ""I have two or three situations to analyze. I want to take some time to make a good decision like I did in the past,"" he adds. ""I would love to play again, I want to play with good people around me. I'm still training now -- I want to keep myself ready for a big decision.""

"(CNN)Israel's ruling Likud Party pulled off a victory in Tuesday's election -- and it was a stunning one. During the campaign, incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum, for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the White House, to his fixation on the Iran nuclear issue, to allegations over Netanyahu's household expenses. Yet despite this unpromising backdrop, Likud is on course to win 30 seats in the Knesset, six seats more than the main opposition Zionist Union -- headed by Isaac Herzog and Tsipi Livni, and an obvious favorite of the Israeli media establishment and Europe, Washington, and the West Bank. The blow to the Zionist Union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading Likud as the campaign drew to a close. (Likud wasn't the only winner of the night --the new center-right party Kulanu (All of Us), which focuses on the economy, also had a good showing, securing 10 seats). Still, Likud's resounding hasn't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks, the work of negotiating a coalition will begin. With this in mind, there is a good chance that President Reuven Rivlin will ask Netanyahu to form a national unity government, either with the Zionist Union, or as the head of a right-wing coalition (although the bitter rivalry between Herzog/Livni and Netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely). Overall, the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate, with even voters who self-identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the Palestinian issue and broader questions of national security. Meanwhile, the numbers for the left in Tuesday's election -- a four seats for Meretz, 24 for the Zionist Union and 14 for the Arab List suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition. As a result, the international community and the Palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the Palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right. So, what can we expect from the new Netanyahu government? Issues that dominated the campaign, namely security and the economy, will likely dominate. For a start, Netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform.  The issue of housing  requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the Israel Land Authority and planning and zoning processes. But to address these Issues properly, Netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors, meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term. In addition, Netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with Washington, something that may not be easy given that ties with the Obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over Iran is reached, and what shape such a deal takes. That raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security, and on this, the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo. This is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that Israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term, comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power. Making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than merely kicking the can down the road. Restarting communication with the West Bank leadership and properly engaging with the Arab Peace Initiative would be steps in the right direction. All that said, this will be Netanyahu's fourth term in office, and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory. And that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long-tern national security strategy. Those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won re-election in Tuesday's poll .

"Moscow (CNN)Kim Jong Un is expected to attend World War II anniversary celebrations in Moscow at Russia's invitation, a Russian official speaking on condition of anonymity said Thursday. North Korea accepted Russia's invitation, but Russia is waiting on Pyongyang to make the official announcement about the May trip, the official said. This would mark Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership in late 2011. ""The invitation was sent to Kim Jong Un. North Korea accepted the invitation. The leadership of North Korea is expected to take part in Victory Day celebrations in Moscow,"" the Russian official said. The official later clarified: ""By leadership, we're talking about Kim."" So far, North Korean state media has not issued any statement about the invitation. This year's Victory Day marks the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Chatter over whether Kim  would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late December after Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation to Pyongyang. On December 22, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told Itar-Tass: ""First signals are given from Pyongyang that the North Korean leader plans to come to Moscow and attend celebrations."" Recently, Russia and North Korea have been fostering warmer relations. If Kim appears in Russia along with other world leaders, he may look like a minor figure, said Dr. Leonid Petrov, an Asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of North Korea. ""In a setting with a large crowd of state officials, in group pictures, he would look like a minor figure instead of what he's portrayed in North Korean media as supreme leader, invincible marshal, jack of all trades. ""So I think if Kim Jong Un decides to go to Moscow, he's going to look like a very lonely, lonely figure."" The Kremlin has invited 68 world leaders to its Victory Day celebrations on May 9, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as quoted on Russian network RT. He was quoted in Russian media as saying that Chinese President Xi Jinping will also attend. In the last year, Russia and North Korea, two historical allies, have increasingly established stronger ties as Russian President Vladimir Putin faces international backlash over the war in Ukraine. The two countries declared 2015 their ""Friendship Year."" Both countries have been slapped with sanctions by the United States and are facing international isolation. ""North Korea is a convenient friend for Moscow -- it's anti-American and it's in a key place of Asia,"" Petrov said. ""Russia lost many of its traditional allies -- it needs friends, both economically, politically, strategically."" Ties between North Korea and Russia date back to World War II, when Kim Jong Un's grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il Sung, trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the Soviet Union. Throughout Kim's subsequent reign, the Soviet Union backed the nation. After the Soviet Union crumbled in the early 1990s, North Korea became increasingly reliant on China. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, visited Moscow several times, with his last visit in 2011. The late Kim rode into Russia in an armored train (he disliked flying) and met with both Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. ""Moscow undertook a diplomatic offensive"" with North Korea, said Petrov, of Australian National University. ""It absolved $10 billion of Soviet-era debts from the account books and started rebooting relationships between North Korea and Russia."" Last year, Russia forgave 90% of North Korea's $11 billion debt. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported in Moscow, and Madison Park wrote and reported in Hong Kong. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report.","This would be Kim Jong Un's first official foreign trip as North Korea's leader .

"(CNN)Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May. May's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of ""Death in Venice."" It wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were. Intrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly. ""I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture,"" he said. ""I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents."" By chance he landed in Montana's Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, home to 7,000 members of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) and the Assiniboine (Nakoda) tribes on 675,147 acres of land near the Canadian border. His American girlfriend had distant relatives living there who supported his idea and invited him to stay in their home. His first stop upon arriving in October was to present his idea to the Fort Belknap tribal leadership. With their approval, he spent his first week walking around without his camera, introducing himself to tribal members and building relationships. ""The most important thing was I sat down, listened and learned,"" he said. ""I opened my ears and let them talk so they could teach me."" Over time, they opened their homes to him and his camera. His choice of a Pentax 67 medium-format roll film camera forced him to carefully consider each shot, to ""create images"" in his head before taking them. It left him with a focused body of work. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. He captured sacred tribal rituals and ceremonies along with the more mundane, familiar aspects of life: the tribal basketball team, a horse grazing in a field, a girl sitting on a bunk bed with a stuffed pony, the inside of a casino. Through conversations with tribal members, he also learned of the harsh realities of life on the reservation, from the difficulties youths face in pursuing educational opportunities to the drug and alcohol addiction killing some members. He put the camera away for some of his most memorable experiences -- a sit in the sweat lodge, dinner with his host family -- the ones that formed lasting relationships and earned him the nickname ""the man who crossed the ocean."" By revealing just a slice, he hopes to arouse curiosity in viewers and inspire them to learn more ""to connect the dots."" It's something he plans to continue doing by returning this summer to learn and experience more. ""The story's not finished,"" he said.

"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso returned to work at McLaren on Wednesday following his freak accident in winter testing. The Spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in Australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash. Alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the Malaysian Grand Prix in nine days' time and used the McLaren simulator to hone his mental preparations. The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. McLaren had explained that Alonso's ""accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time."" After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, ""focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures."" The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid. Alonso left Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season to rejoin McLaren, which is experiencing teething as it renews technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. In his response on Twitter, Alonso chose to focus on congratulating Spanish rookie Carlos Sainz, who finished ninth on his Toro Rosso debut and who was inspired by Alonso as he plotted his own racing career. ""Congratulations to @carlosainz for the great weekend in Australia!! And of course to Hamilton and Mercedes for the win!! See you in Malaysia,"" Alonso's message read. Meanwhile, Boullier is focused on finding improvements in the car's pace and performance for the next race on Sepang's sizzling circuit, which is also very physically demanding on the drivers. ""We know we have a mountain to climb as far as performance is concerned,"" the Frenchman said in a McLaren statement. ""In two weeks' time we'll be racing in Sepang [Malaysia], where the weather is bound to be extremely hot and humid. ""I'm not going to be rash enough to predict a form upswing in so short a time frame, but we'll be working flat out between now and then to make performance and reliability gains in any and every way we can, of that you may be 100 per cent certain.""","Fernando Alonso steps up comeback preparations in McLaren simulator .

"(CNN)A gloved hand reaches for a scantily-clad backside. It could be an image from the hit television series ""Mad Men,"" which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s America. Except this is 2015 and ""Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"" is the poster strapline for the elite E3 Harelbeke competition in Belgium, accompanied by that gloved cyclist's hand poised to pinch a woman's bottom. Unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt, the controversial advertisement wasn't dreamed up out of thin air. It's inspired by previous winner Slovak Peter Sagan, who pinched a podium girl's behind at the 2013 Tour de Flanders -- something he later apologized for, saying ""I promise to act more respectfully in the future."" A week earlier, he was also pictured on the E3 Harelbeke podium, making an ass-grabbing motion towards another flower girl. E3 Harelbeke's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign, sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard. ""Old Boy's Club"" ""A guy grabbing a woman's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault,"" said Kathryn Bertine, former professional cyclist and director of ""Half the Road,"" a documentary about female racers. ""This poster makes cycling look very outdated. They're relying on a 'good old boys club' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing."" Judging by E3 Harelebeke's provocative standards, the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years. In 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field, while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside. More baffling was last year's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike. ""Such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products, but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago,"" said Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University. ""I think E3 Harelbeke are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today."" ""A playful nod"" Cycling's world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) has since requested the poster be removed, to which the E3 Harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves. ""Personally, no I don't think it's sexist,"" Marc Claerhout, E3 Harelebeke manager, told CNN. Could he see why others might find it offensive? ""I don't know. You have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear,"" he said. ""And we didn't mean it as sexist."" The organization has since withdrawn the poster, releasing an official apology to ""anyone who might find it intimidating, discriminatory or sexist."" ""The organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl,"" it added. Removing the poster is one thing -- but the UCI missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years, said Olympic road race champion, Nicole Cooke. ""Telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent,"" added the retired cyclist whose autobiography ""The Breakaway"" highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career. ""A whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling. Instead, the race has received huge publicity."" Celebrating sexual assault? The poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace, said Laura Bates, founder of the ""Everyday Sexism Project."" ""It contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault, which shouldn't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about,"" she added. Similarly, Belgium's Institute for the Equality between Men and Women, said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and ""incited sexual intimidation."" It's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament. ""Not only is the poster sexist -- this race doesn't even have a women's field,"" said Bertine, who has long campaigned for a women's edition of the Tour de France equal to the men's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling. ""Here we are, fighting these battles to make equality happen. And posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling,"" she said. She sees the problem not with the majority of ""supportive"" male cyclists, but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters. Money talks . Indeed, sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the Women's Tour de France off the ground, said Alex Russell, one of two females on the board of British Cycling. ""A lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it's not necessarily down to gender,"" she said. ""We've introduced a women's tour in Britain and we have got financial support for that. But you can't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally."" Former World Road Race champion Cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport. ""The inspiration for the poster is the 2013 Tour de Flanders, for which male winner Fabian Cancellara received €20,000 ($22,000) for his efforts. In comparison, when I won this event, I was happy for the team to split the modest €1,000 I received amongst the other riders,"" she said. ""The biggest change I would recommend to provide protection, security and credibility for female road riders, would be the introduction of a minimum wage, as there is in place for male riders,"" added Cooke. ""Cycling cannot be allowed to exist outside the laws of society, like some sort of medieval anarchy."" It seems that rather than a podium girl's bottom, the one being put under the spotlight at this year's event, will be the organizers themselves.","Belgium cycling tournament scraps poster of podium girl's bum .

"(CNN)During a conversation with a professor at an Ivy League college, a mother nudges her daughter to share how she's president of her school's ""survivors-of-bulimia"" group. Hoping to impress the Yale admissions committee, a student writes an essay about the time she was so engrossed in a discussion with a French teacher she admired that she urinated on herself instead of interrupting the teacher or leaving the room. Looking to give their child an edge, parents hire a college admissions consultant when their child is in the eighth grade and know the total tab will be roughly $50,000. How I wish I could report that those three nuggets were pure fiction, morsels from my imagination for a great storyline for a novel or television series. But sadly, they are all-too-real examples included in a provocative new book ""Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania"" by award-winning New York Times op-ed columnist and bestselling author Frank Bruni. Those examples, Bruni said, should really be ""wake-up calls"" for any parents or students currently engaged in, or one day likely  to be consumed by, the ""What school will I get into?"" annual game. ""This says that we are attaching a level of importance to this that is just completely bonkers,"" Bruni said during a recent interview. Student goes 8 for 8 in Ivy League college admissions . For many families in the United States, the challenge isn't getting into the right college. It is being able to afford the school of their choice, or any school for that matter. But for many middle- and upper-income families, the college admissions process is as frenzied as ever with the belief that one school can make or break a child's future. I had to ask Bruni, whom I met during my time covering presidential politics, how exactly college admissions became so insanely intense and ridiculously competitive. We both laughed that the process was definitely not nearly as manic or as charged when we both went to college in the '80s. Bruni points to a number of factors all mixed together, creating ""this kind of perfect storm of just absolute fixation, panic, etc."" about where kids are going to go to school, whether it's exclusive enough and whether they've ""breached the inner sanctum."" There's the economic pessimism over the past decade, combined with a widening chasm between the haves and have-nots, he said. ""I think all of that has made parents feel anxious on behalf of their kids and has made them feel like their kids have to have anything that might be a leg up, and if an elite school is a leg up, well, then dammit, let's get them that."" Adding to the dangerous brew, says Bruni, is the ""whole test prep and college coaching industry."" Yes, it has become an industry, with parents and students willing to pay thousands of dollars to consultants for an extra edge. That ""industry"" didn't exist just three decades ago when Frank and I were applying. 5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education . The final piece of the puzzle are the colleges, which have essentially become businesses, marketing themselves and using their acceptance rate as a bragging right. ""So when you have colleges drumming up extra applications so that they can then claim an acceptance rate below 15%, that becomes part of the discussion that adds to the anxiety because you look at these numbers and you think, 'Oh my God, if I don't begin doing SAT prep as a freshman in high school, if I don't hire the private tutor,' "" I won't get in -- or so the thinking goes, said Bruni. But how much does where you go really determine how successful you will ultimately be? Consider the Fortune 500 and the alma maters of the heads of the 10 companies with the highest gross revenues back in the summer of 2014. There was only one Ivy League school on the list (Dartmouth), Bruni says in his book. When you look at the Fortune 500 executives in the top 30, you see Cornell, Princeton and Brown, but also the University of Central Oklahoma, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Minnesota, he writes. The point is there isn't one exact path to the corner office, and an Ivy League degree or a degree from another prestigious private university is neither a requirement nor a guarantee. National politics is another case in point. Sure, there are presidents who hail from the Ivies (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton) but there are many who don't: Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College, a small school in Illinois, and Richard Nixon got his undergraduate degree from Whittier College in Southern California. Looking at other national politicians who either ran for or could run for president someday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Vice President Joe Biden graduated from the University of Delaware, Paul Ryan from Miami University of Ohio and John Edwards from North Carolina State University. Bruni said a big reason for writing the book was that when he surveyed the accomplished people he has known and interviewed, there didn't seem to be any ""exaggerated concentration"" of people coming from the most selective colleges. ""So the amount of importance that parents and kids seem to be attaching to the selectiveness of where they went to school did not seem to me to jibe at all with the ingredients of success as manifest in the people I've met who were successful and even more to the point content,"" he said. ""And so I felt like that contradiction really needed to be pointed out in a bold way."" Part of what fuels the perception that the most successful among us always attend the most selective schools is what we see and read about people who've made it. For instance, take the ""30 Under 30"" list, which Forbes magazine puts out every year. Bruni writes about how back in 2013, a website called the 60second Recap noted how every time honorees attended a school like Harvard, Stanford or Princeton, it was mentioned in the profile. But if they hadn't graduated from such a school, Forbes didn't mention their alma mater. ""So why do we get the impression that so many of the world's most glittering people went to these schools? Because when they've gone to those schools, we make it part of their biography because we think it explains something. And when they haven't gone to those schools, we skip right over it because we think it's actually contradictory evidence when it may be anything but."" One of the most poignant stories that Bruni shares in his book is the letter Matt Levin's parents wrote to him the night before he received his first college response. Levin, like many of his classmates at Cold Spring Harbor High School on Long Island, had Ivy on his mind. He hoped for admission to Yale, Princeton or Brown, and he did everything to be a standout candidate: studying with a tutor for the SATs, playing on the varsity baseball team, earning one of the highest grade point averages as a junior and volunteering for more than 100 hours of community service. The letters came, and Levin got rejected by all three. His mom and dad, in their letter, wrote, ""Your worth as a person, a student and our son is not diminished or influenced in the least by what these colleges have decided. If it does not go your way, you'll take a different route to get where you want."" A letter to my son as he leaves for college . ""What I love about Matt Levin's parents and that story is ... they were saying, we know you've been filled with these aspirations. We may have been agents of filling you with them,"" said Bruni. ""What they were saying is this is one metric in a life with many of them. Do not turn this metric into a bludgeon that you are beating yourself up with, and that's what I think parents need to do."" Is it possible to restore any sanity to the entire college admissions process? Bruni said what we can do is try to change the conversation and begin to also talk about the negative consequences of this push to get into the most selective school. ""If we give kids too much of an impression that the name on their diploma is going to be everything, we run the risk of also telling them that their diploma is going to do the work for them."" Kids who feel that way often end up in therapy or completely incapable of carving out a life, he said. ""If we talk about all the things that happen, all the negative things that attend an over-concentration on getting into an elite school, then maybe we will begin to not concentrate as much on getting into elite schools."" Bruni hopes parents and students read his book, but he especially hopes graduating seniors read it before they head off to school. Because while we spend so much time worrying about where our kids are going to get in, we spend less time on what they are going to do and explore when they get there. ""So my dream audience are kids going off to college, and kids who are going off to college ... being made to think about more than the name on their sweatshirt and being made to ponder what they're going to do with this extraordinary privilege.""

"(CNN)Early Intervention changes lives. Respite care keeps families together. Both save states money over time. Alas, both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of Bruce Rauner, the new Republican governor of Illinois. This is happening for two reasons. First, Rauner has a problem. He promised to lower taxes despite a $6.2 billion structural budget deficit. Unwilling to think about new revenue, all he can do is cut programs. Second, Rauner's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability. Too many right-wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups, pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net. Meanwhile, they reassure their base, which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state, that only they really deserve benefits. Like Rauner, other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity. Kansas, under Sam Brownback, has pushed disabled people off Medicaid, making services less effective and efficient.  Scott Walker, in Wisconsin, has proposed cutting long-term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers, empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled Americans. Florida has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the Department of Health. And that's all just at the state level. Nationally, the new Congress began the year with a sustained attack on Social Security Disability Insurance, which some analysts see as a way to threaten the whole foundation of Social Security. Last December, House Republicans insisted that the ABLE act, a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money, only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26, a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work, disease, accident or age. Now Bruce Rauner is adding to this troubling pattern. The Rauner budget slashes state spending by over $4 billion, much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the Department of Human Services (DHS). Each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state's help most. Moreover, many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time. Take, for example, Early Intervention, which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents (there are means-tested co-pays).  At their best, these therapies not only help children with disabilities learn new skills, but also teach parents to better understand their children. Right now, a child who is at least 30% delayed in any category -- for example being at least 30% less able to use speech than a typical child of their age -- is eligible for services. Now, as explained to me by a spokesperson for DHS, the program has to save $23 million (they did not explain how this number was picked). The plan is to take every child who is 30-49% delayed (about 10,000 children), re-test them, and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached. Over the long term, this is not only bad for children, but is bad for Illinois' budget. The program is extremely economically efficient. For each dollar spent on programs like Early Intervention, according to studies by people such as the Nobel Laureate James Heckman and the Rand Corporation, the state saves at least $7 in future services. Those savings are, in fact, most likely to be realized most dramatically with precisely the children that DHS is trying to exclude. Children with only mild delays can, with Early Intervention, avoid requiring the more expensive special education services in school when they are older. Everyone wins. Despite this Gregory Bassi, acting secretary of DHS, is undeterred. At a recent state Senate budget hearing, which I attended, Bassi kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long-term costs of short-term savings. He even, in a revealing moment, said that his own nephew ought to get booted from the program because the nephew's parents make too much money (a spokesperson clarified that Bassi actually has two nephews in the program, both of whom have benefited from the therapy). Respite programs, which the Rauner budget eliminates entirely, provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities.  Sometimes, such a program just enables the caregiver to do errands or have some private time, essential to maintaining one's ability to function in a challenging home environment. The programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue. Like Early Intervention, the program is cost efficient.  Without respite, families are more likely to disintegrate. In such cases, the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state-run facility. This is both vastly more expensive and, most importantly, generally bad for the institutionalized individual. In fact, the Rauner budget is packed with what Illinois Senate Appropriations Committee chair Heather Steans, a Democrat, called, ""penny wise, pound foolish"" proposals.  Throughout, the governor and his administration have found ways to re-write definitions of disability in order to save money. They will likely end up paying more as a result of increased use of emergency rooms, rates of incarceration and homelessness. Violent encounters between police and people with disabilities will only become more common.  People who now receive aid that allows them to live more independently will end up institutionalized or in nursing homes. Not only that, but many of these programs bring in matching funds from the federal government or other sources, and the state is surrendering those dollars as well. So why make these cuts, given their likely long-term costs? It may be that the Rauner administration just doesn't care about long-term fiscal health so long as next year's budget looks good. But I see the Rauner attacks on disability-related services as just the latest example of lawmakers trying to re-define disability in a way that saves them money. Questions about the fundamental necessity of disability benefits infuse right-wing speech on the issue. Thom Tillis, the new senator from North Carolina, was filmed in 2011 calling Republicans to ""divide and conquer"" by separating the sympathetic disabled -- people with conditions like Down syndrome and cerebral palsy --  from the unsympathetic (people he implies are just lazy). That's a rhetoric I see at play regularly, though most lawmakers are too smart to say it out loud. Recently, for example, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky falsely claimed that 50% of all individuals on disability were ""gaming the system."" Fraud is, in fact, somewhere around 1%.  While defending Paul's claim, a Fox News host told a woman that her bipolar  disorder was ""something made up."" I don't hear that type of explicit hateful language from the Rauner administration. Everyone I've talked to is saying that they want to help the most vulnerable. They just have a big budget deficit, so they have no choice but to make these draconian cuts. But there are always choices. Rauner is just following the right-wing playbook. Rule out making up the shortfall by increasing taxes and thus raising revenue. Play different groups of needy against each other. Tell the public that only some people really deserve help. Divide and conquer.","David Perry: Governors are making the wrong choice by aiming to cut disability programs and benefits .

"(CNN)For the second time in his career, Madison, Wisconsin, police Officer Matt Kenny is being investigated for using lethal force. But the cases and their circumstances are different, very different. Friday's death of Tony Robinson, an unarmed biracial 19-year-old, has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers. Eight years ago, it was a different story. Kenny shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him. He was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation.  The dead man was white. It started as a 911 call.  The caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch. What the dispatcher didn't know was the man that Ronald Brandon was talking about was himself. Three officers rushed to the scene, including Kenny.  They knew they were facing a potentially life-threatening situation. They were unaware that Brandon's ex-wife, Susan, was also calling 911. ""My ex-husband is sitting outside and I think he just called 911,"" she said.  ""He's got a pellet gun ... He's drunk."" As she talked to the dispatcher, the squad cars arrived outside. ""I think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness,"" Brandon said.  ""I hear the sirens coming.  Jesus criminy.  It's not a real gun.  I think he wants to be taken away."" The officers never learned that the weapon Ronald Brandon pointed at them was a pellet gun.  The call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived. Kenny shot him dead. Investigators ruled the shooting a ""suicide by cop."" For his handling of the incident, Kenny was awarded the medal of valor, the department's highest honor. Last week's shooting hasn't earned commendations.  It's polarized a community. Because Robinson did not have a weapon, his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: ""Black lives matter."" The incident started Friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. When Kenny went to the apartment where the report came from, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. ""It's a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation,"" said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. ""The real fear for any officer when he's being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away,"" Palmer said, ""and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly."" Concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues. Concern for his officer.  Concern for the community. Kenny, 45, is a 12-year veteran of the Madison Police Department. Koval calls him ""a very conscientious dedicated public servant,"" but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight-year's time is, well, concerning. ""Any loss of life is very tragic,"" the chief said.  ""Twice is concerning for anyone. We are concerned for him and the community."" And the community is looking for its concerns to be addressed. CNN's Gary Tuchman, Brian Todd, Catherine E. Shoichet and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Officer Matt Kenny has involved in two fatal shootings during his career .

"(CNN)You think March Madness is all about basketball? Think again. Sure, millions will be watching the 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament to see whether Kentucky's bid for an unbeaten season can be quashed or whether a 14 seed can make it to the Final Four. But the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications, vasectomies and HDTV upgrades. What are the odds? (Probably a heck of a lot better than picking a perfect bracket.) Here are some of the more unusual aspects of the Big Dance: . Glass slipper, golden payoff . Cinderella teams don't just provide a couple weeks' entertainment; according to some studies, their success has long-term effects. Thanks to exposure from the NCAAs, such teams as Florida Gulf Coast and George Mason see rises in applications and endowments. Academics call it the ""Flutie Effect"" after the charge Boston College received from a last-second 1984 win against Miami, thanks to a Hail Mary pass from quarterback Doug Flutie. (Go ahead and watch it again, we'll wait.) Experts debate how much of an influence athletic wins have on admissions, but there's no question a Cinderella turn gives schools greater exposure, which certainly can't hurt. George Mason, which went to the Final Four in 2006, and Gonzaga, which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late '90s, saw applications go up after their turn on stage. Money in the basket . March Madness pulls in more national TV revenue (as of 2013) than any other postseason sports franchise: $1.15 billion. A lot of that money comes from fast-food franchises, which know you like to eat while watching the games. And those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins. According to WalletHub, there's a 19% increase in pizza orders and a 9% rise in dessert orders by fans after their teams lose. Investors certainly know it: Buffalo Wild Wings stock has traditionally gone up in March. Making the cut . Doctors report up to a 50% rise in the number of vasectomies during the NCAA tournament. Well, if you have to spend a few days resting on the couch ... Everybody into the pool . According to a survey by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 50 million Americans participate in March Madness pools. Productivity, shmoductivity, part 1 . All that bracket-filling costs employers an estimated $1.2 billion in unproductive workers (assuming each worker spends an hour filling out a bracket). That may be low. WalletHub puts the figure at $1.9 billion. For all that, employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale. Productivity, shmoductivity, part 2 . Twenty-seven percent of respondents to one 2014 survey say they watch games at work. (That could explain the morale situation.) Would you like an upgrade with that? According to the same 2014 survey, 12% would upgrade to HDTV if their favorite team made it to the Sweet Sixteen. (As of 2014, 59% of U.S. households have HDTV.) Bet on the humans . Of the 76 champions, almost one-third -- 25 -- have had mascots based on a human figure, such as Hoosiers and Tar Heels. Fourteen have been bear-related (largely thanks to UCLA's Bruins, who have won 11 championships) and 10 have been feline (Kentucky's Wildcats, mainly). Perhaps you should play the lottery .

"(CNN)ISIS' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an Israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda. As ISIS encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of Syria and Iraq where it imposes its brutal rule, the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing. The deeply disturbing cases shine a light into the range of ways the militants are using children to further their aims. In August, an Australian man who had taken his young family to join ISIS in Syria posted a photo on Twitter of his 7-year-old son using both hands to hold up a man's severed head. ""That's my boy,"" the father wrote alongside the photo, which was reportedly taken in ISIS' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. In a video the jihadist group released in January, a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol in the air. Last month, when ISIS publicized its immolation of the captive Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, one of its videos showed a young boy watching a public screening of the killing in Raqqa and saying that he would ""burn the pilot"" himself if he had the chance. Those examples reflect a broader effort to induct children into ISIS' campaign of violence. ISIS has also promoted videos of young boys training as fighters, some of them wearing the militants' black masks, holding bullets and waving the group's flags. The jihadist movement has called the boys the ""cubs of the caliphate,"" a reference to the way ISIS fighters refer to one another as ""lions."" It has taken over schools with the purpose of indoctrinating children. Human Rights Watch has said that ISIS and other extremist groups ""have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions."" The United Nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training. One 15-year-old boy told CNN in November how he was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol, an AK-47 and a radio to stand guard at an ISIS base in Syria. Another boy told CNN last year that ISIS forced his father to send him to one of its children's camps in northern Syria when he was just 13. ""For 30 days we woke up and jogged, had breakfast, then learned the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet. Then we took courses on weapons, Kalashnikovs and other light military stuff,"" said the boy, who later fled to Turkey with his family. Some of the militants at the camp were kind, joking and laughing with the younger recruits, he recalled. Others made the boys watch hideous things. ""They used to bring young [kids] to the camp to lash them,"" said the boy, whose real name was withheld because of fears for his safety. ""When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings."" ""We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she committed adultery,"" he said. Syrian activists say that some of the boys indoctrinated and trained at such camps are now being killed on the front lines of battle. CNN is unable to independently verify those claims. The militant group, also known as ISIL and the Islamic State, is aggressively using social media to try to lure more young people to join its ranks. The decision of three British teenage girls to travel to Syria last month was a stark example of ISIS' ability to attract young Westerners. Another young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS in 2013 now appears to write a blog about her life under the extremists' rule, describing perks and offering reassurances to those who might follow in her footsteps. Western officials, though, say that ISIS is pushing a false narrative of what things are really like in its territory. But officials also admit they're struggling to counter the relentless wave of propaganda churned out on social media by ISIS members and supporters. ""There's no question what we're combating with ISIL's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told CNN last month.","Children are regularly featured in grisly ISIS propaganda .
Boys have told CNN of their military training by the jihadist group ."
"(CNN)Things have been messy between singer Chris Brown and his now ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran, and it looks to be about to get messier. Oprah Winfrey's network, OWN, posted a teaser Tuesday for Tran's interview with Iyanla Vanzant. The inspirational speaker and host of ""Iyanla: Fix My Life"" fires off at Tran: ""He betrayed you. He lied to you. He did it all publicly,"" before asking, ""How did you find out that he had a baby by another woman?"" Brown has been the subject of rumors that he fathered a daughter with another woman while in a relationship with Tran. He has neither confirmed nor denied the stories, but the story heated up when Tran tweeted on March 4, ""Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me."" The tweet was later deleted. Brown and Tran have had an on-again, off-again relationship for years. In 2012, Brown posted a video on Twitter questioning whether it was possible to be in love with two people. At the time, the singer had broken up with Tran after once again growing close to singer Rihanna, whom he assaulted while they were dating in 2009. ""I love Karrueche very much but I don't want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna,"" Brown said in the video. ""I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives."" Brown and Rihanna eventually reunited but then broke up again, and he and Tran, who bills herself as a model and entrepreneur, resumed seeing each other.

"Washington (CNN)Ted Cruz is back in his favorite place: the spotlight. As the first candidate to quit the charade of ""exploring"" a presidential run and actually jumping in, the Texas Republican senator presented an image Monday of decisiveness and vision -- all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals. Now comes the hard part. Cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the GOP if he hopes to break through as a top-tier candidate. He doesn't have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard-line tactics on issues like Obamacare. And he's facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Even evangelicals, Cruz's target audience during his launch speech at Liberty University, aren't firmly in his column. The firebrand's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded GOP field where multiple Republicans will vie for the same social and evangelical support base. ""Ted is clearly a player,"" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian public policy ministry. ""But the competition this cycle is very steep."" By choosing Liberty University in Virginia, which was founded by fundamentalist preacher Jerry Falwell, to roll out his long shot campaign, Cruz made clear he won't cede the Christian right to another candidate. ""From the dawn of this country, at every stage, America has enjoyed God's providential blessing,"" said Cruz, roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a Sunday morning. ""Over and over again, when we faced impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge. You know, compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS ain't all that tough."" Liberty offered Cruz a ready-made crowd: young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands, because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation. This is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful Christian idealists Cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire. But Cruz won't have this political territory all to himself. Several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red T-shirts emblazoned with ""Rand,"" referring to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives. Meanwhile, Walker, with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions, seems to have eclipsed Cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the White House. ""When the grass roots look at a guy like Scott Walker -- he can not only bridge the divide, we believe, in the Republican Party, but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in Wisconsin,"" said Jennifer Stefano, a Pennsylvania tea party activist. ""That's what I think is dominating Ted Cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013, as when he tried to stop and defund Obamacare."" Cruz must also face off against Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task. ""It's a crowded field to begin with and it's almost as if, within the Republican contest, there are some early sub-primaries: Who is going to be the establishment candidate? Who is going to be the social conservative candidate?"" said David Yepsen, who was for years the dean of Iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the Des Moines Register. Meanwhile, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week put Cruz as the choice of 4% of likely Republican voters. So if he seems unlikely to win, why would Cruz get in -- and so early? Paradoxically, the size of the task facing Cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign --  may not apply. Perkins said he had been assured by Cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the White House with the almost unanimous disapproval of the Republican establishment. Announcing now could give Cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals. He used his speech Monday to also slam Common Core education standards and immigration reform, areas where establishment GOP favorite Jeb Bush is perceived to be vulnerable. He also joined the hawkish Republican barrage on foreign policy, slamming President Barack Obama over his row with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his record on Iran and combating ""radical Islamic terrorism."" But should he fall short in his 2016 bid, a successful campaign that positions Cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run. And at only age 44, there's plenty of time for that. His Texas Senate seat, meanwhile, seems to be his as long as he wants it. He doesn't have to run for re-election until 2018, so a presidential bid wouldn't get in the way of the day job. So in a sense, Cruz may not have that much to lose. Another reason to get in early is Iowa. The state is going to be crucial for Cruz's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path. A win in the first-in-the-nation caucus could crown Cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party. But he is going to be facing proven Iowa campaigners. Huckabee won the state in 2008 and Santorum won a recount over the eventual GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, in 2012. Both have substantial networks of support and, crucially, know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything. ""I think Cruz has generated some excitement in Iowa, and he is a new face,"" said Yepsen. ""But it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists."" An added bonus for Cruz getting in now: The early bird gets the best coverage. In a matter of weeks, Republican presidential announcements from the massive GOP field will draw little more than a shrug, so getting out ahead of expected announcements from Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio could be a good idea. When Democrat Hillary Clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race, any Republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks. Monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day Obamacare was signed into law.

"Los Angeles (CNN)Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to ""manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure."" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,"" said Brown. ""But we have a lot of good policies coming."" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. ""The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,"" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. ""This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort."" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately. He has recently created a Drought Task Force to expedite the legislation.","Gov. Jerry Brown: ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up""

"(CNN)Its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake. Traditionally at this time of year, a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in England's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation, and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances. Do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire, or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes? On Monday, Sunderland's American owner Ellis Short elected to twist and fired the club's Uruguayan manager Gus Poyet, confirmed by a statement on its official website. Less than a year ago Poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at Chelsea and Manchester United in order to stave off the threat of demotion. Now that task is for someone else as Short and Sunderland try to protect the cool $106m it pocketed last season, with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that's worth over $7.8 billion to the Premier League's 20 clubs. ""It's inevitable Sunderland will have been thinking about money,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University, told CNN. ""Particularly television money, because it now accounts for over 50% of most, if not all, Premier League clubs' turnover. ""It'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality, very often it is short term thinking. ""Whilst I'm sure Sunderland are mindful of what's going to happen in 2016, they'll be even more mindful of what's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down."" The tipping point came Saturday when fellow strugglers Aston Villa fired in four unanswered first-half goals against Sunderland, having scored four away goals in its previous 14 Premier League matches. Some fans streamed out of the Stadium of Light before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront Poyet. It left Sunderland just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire Short to swing the axe, the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind. Even though Cardiff City, which finished bottom of the Premier League last season, still banked $92.1m for its efforts, the disparity between tiers one and two in England is vast. ""Most obviously, the TV revenues from the Premier League deal,"" Chadwick answered when asked what Sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor. ""Also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined. ""I wouldn't want to put a figure on it but you're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions."" Ironically, Aston Villa were marshaled to victory on Saturday by its new manager Tim Sherwood, installed in the wake of Paul Lambert's sacking in February. Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who is in the process of trying to sell the club, decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 EPL matches. After Saturday's win, the Birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and Short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man. According to Chadwick, research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus, but he argues there are few ""impact managers"" available at present. And he suggests the approach of Short and Lerner proves American owners still don't fully understand the dynamic of English football as well as they perhaps should. ""It's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and I'm not sure American owners are in tune with that,"" he said. ""We've seen it with Aston Villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but I don't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of English football still. ""So they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of English football clubs."" Chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered Premier League in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end. ""In one sense, it's always been like this,"" he said. ""You go back to the 1980s when Liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they weren't going to be champions. ""I think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams. ""Whilst the Premier League would argue it's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in Spain don't have, even so, such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and the rest dominating. ""For the likes of the north east clubs Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough it is great if they can get there, even better if they can stay there.""","English Premier League club Sunderland sack Uruguayan manager Gus Poyet .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN)Gunmen on a motorcycle have shot and killed Uganda's lead prosecutor in the 2010 bombings that killed 76 people who were watching the World Cup finals. Joan Kagezi stopped at a roadside produce stand in a Kampala suburb Monday evening to buy some fruit when her assailants approached, according to police. ""Criminals riding on a motorcycle ... stopped next to the parked car she was driving and shot her twice in the neck and shoulder through the window on the driver's side,"" Kale Kayihura, the inspector general of police, said Tuesday.  Kagezi was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Kagezi was the lead prosecutor in the case of 13 terror suspects now before the High Court in Kampala. The blasts erupted in an Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby center while crowds watched the World Cup finals on TV. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2010 championship hosted by South Africa. Kagezi also was in charge of the nation's International Crime Division. Kayihura called her death a big loss for the country and promised to hunt for her killers.

"(CNN)Italian fashion designer Stefano Gabbana and Elton John are in a war of words on social media, calling for boycotts of each other's work. The argument stems from comments about in-vitro fertilization in Panorama magazine, in which Gabbana and longtime collaborator Domenico Dolce spoke about ""synthetic"" children born from ""rented"" wombs. ""No chemical children: life has a natural course, there are things that shouldn't be modified,"" the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers. The magazine also promises insights from the designers on ""the importance of relationships within conventional families with very, very traditional values"" in an interview that hit Italian newsstands last week. John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, issued a strong repudiation of the statements on Sunday and pledged to boycott the Dolce & Gabbana fashion line. In response, Gabbana defended his ""freedom to speak"" and called on fans to boycott John. Sir Elton appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana, which by Monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on Twitter since John invoked it on Sunday. By comparison, Gabbana's #boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on Twitter, according to social media search tool Topsy. ""How dare you refer to my beautiful children as 'synthetic'. And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfill their dream of having children,"" John said Sunday on Instagram. ""Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again."" The sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as Ricky Martin, Al Roker and Courtney Love. Tennis star Martina Navratilova tweeted her support for John's post, saying ""My D&G shirts are going in the bin — don't want ANYONE to wear them."" Parents and IVF advocates also joined the boycott. ""My son is NOT synthetic. His life was made possible through #IVF & I couldn't be more grateful,"" writer and infertility advocate Jenn Palumbo said in a tweet. The comments from Dolce and Gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 (they continued working together after the breakup). Still, Gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his ""traditional"" views toward family structure. He told an Italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was ""opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents."" Gabbana was quick to react to this controversy, calling John a ""fascist"" in an Instagram comment that was later deleted, according to CNN affiliate TGCom24. He also sought to discredit reports that they told Panorama in this instance they objected to same-sex adoption, even though Gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview. By Sunday evening, Gabbana's Instagram feed was full of screengrabs and reposts from people who supported his right to voice his opinion. ""It's a shame that you are not allowed to say what you like,"" one person said in a comment on Gabbana's Instagram. ""You have every right to say what you want, especially as you weren't disrespectful nor immature like Elton was. His comments are unnecessary, cheap and childish."" Gabbana issued a statement saying he and Dolce had not intended to judge others. ""We firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it. We talked about our way of seeing reality, but it was never our intention to judge other people's choices,"" the statement read. Dolce also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people. ""I'm Sicilian and I grew up in a traditional family, made up of a mother, a father and children. I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one I've known. But in my personal experience, family had a different configuration....I was talking about my personal view, without judging other people's choices and decisions,"" the statement read.

"(CNN)Football is the most widely played sport among French youths. Yet, it struggles to attract and retain girls. How can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men? Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, who has a coached a number of Ligue 1 clubs, notes that for a long time, women's football ""was a sport totally marginalized."" Stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough, too masculine for girls to play. They were much more likely to compete in basketball, ride horseback, or dance, such as Maïmouna Coulibaly, whose dance company, Les Ambianceuses, is internationally recognized (though overshadowed by her brother, Amedy Coulibaly, the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre). But change is afoot. Since the late 1980s, the French Football Federation (FFF) has promoted the sport to women and girls. ""Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable development of the women's game,"" said Gourcuff. Former player and ex-Paris Saint-Germain official Jean-Michel Moutier concurred. Over the past decade ""girls have significantly increased the level of play,"" he said. ""I am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches."" The sport's increased television presence helps significantly, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup. ""That has changed a bit the image of women's football,"" Gourcuff said, ""notably among young girls."" Farid El Alagui, who now plays for Scottish club Hibernian, noticed a dramatic difference in how women's football is perceived back home. ""If you look at the French national team,"" he said, ""they've been really good."" Les Bleues are presently third in FIFA's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women's World Cup in Canada between June 6 and July 5. The professional women's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play. ""There are big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain,"" El Alagui said, ""who are very good and the level of play is quite high."" Such examples foster confidence to try to the sport. ""I think a lot of girls want to play football,"" he said. ""They're just scared."" However, enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait. At ASVCM only seven out of 345 players in the club's football school are girls, and two more play with the club's youth teams in competitions. Such statistics are mirrored nationally. During the 2013-14 season, there were 50,516 licensed girls in the Under-6 to Under-20 demographic, as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age. While few in number, the young girls at ASVCM -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of Paris -- are welcomed and respected, observed Catherine Ledemé, who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade. ""They are often the 'mascots' of the team,"" she said. Moreover, they excel on the field. The football section's president Marc Girard proudly boasted that two of ASVCM's young players are in formation with PSG's women's team. For Ledemé, who week-in and week-out ensures the club's conviviality, ""football has strong social values."" She supports girls playing football, regardless of the game's stereotypes or image, a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes. More is needed, but the continued success of the women's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport.","French women's football has long been marginalized, stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play .

"(CNN)Golden beaches and grand hotels can all be found in Mauritius, but there is much more to this island paradise. The country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar, has been attracting global investors for decades. But there is also a healthy local appetite for business development -- one of the many reasons the country has been hailed as an African success story. One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat. ""My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,"" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. ""The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius."" Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success. As a kid, Surat would get up early to help his father on the small farm before going to school. ""Whatever he was growing, people were coming to buy in our garden, wholesale...So my father decided to go retail,"" Surat remembers. Shift to retail . The family's first stall was in Curepipe market in the country's highest town. It was here, not far from the famous extinct volcanic crater ""Trou aux Cerfs"", that the family business started to really grow. Lychees, pineapple and mangoes all bloom in Mauritius' tropical climate, but the weather stops oranges, apples, and plums from sprouting. When Sooklall Surat started importing foreign fruit, others followed suit. Import/Export . Sooklall's brother Shyam focused on selling fresh produce from abroad, attracting customers with foreign tastes. He built a busy operation, but the fast flow of goods didn't stop the family monitoring the fruits and vegetables. ""We say you need to be able to talk to the fresh produce -- this is the success of the business,"" says Suren Surat. 'Work is work' Estimates say the Mauritian economy grew by 3.5% in 2014 and will top 4% in 2015 -- impressive statistics in a country which the World Bank says does a better job of supporting business than Japan, France and Spain. In such a competitive market, guts, good relations and hard work are essential.  Suren says that the business keeps the family together, with different members taking control of areas like import and distribution. ""We've seen many local companies, Mauritius companies, who are family business who split,"" says Suren Surat. ""But luckily I have to say our grandparents, our mother, father have taught us how to manage."" The company's next leaders will have to do more than manage the fresh produce. Recently, the family started the islands' first dairy, and is soon to open its sixth supermarket franchise. It's all part of the strategy to keep things fresh on the island that is home to over 1.3 million people. ""The future is very very important,"" says Shyam Surat. ""I would advise any people, mainly in Africa or this part of the islands, to grow more fruit and veggies. And this is the future because people have to eat."" More from Marketplace Africa .

"(CNN)A Black Hawk helicopter that went down in waters off the Florida Panhandle three days ago -- killing 11 service members -- had aborted a training mission due to bad weather before it crashed, a military official said Friday. On the same day that officials released the names of the seven Marines who were aboard, new details emerged Friday on the fatal mission at the Santa Rosa Sound near Eglin Air Force Base. As officials continue to investigate why the aircraft went down in thick fog Tuesday, Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman -- commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) -- told reporters that the Black Hawk was one of two that had to abort exercises involving water ""insertion and extraction techniques"" before the crash. ""My understanding is ... that they were flying as we normally do -- two aircraft together,"" Osterman said. ""As they went in, they encountered bad weather and made the decision to wave off and to abort the training mission. At that point, the one helicopter obviously made it back and determined that the second helicopter was not back with them in that return."" The crash occurred at night -- hours after the two helicopters had successfully completed the same training exercise in daylight. The Black Hawk helicopters were training near Eglin as heavy fog shrouded the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern Florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, the military said. ""The fog was moving in and out,"" Osterman said. ""I think they had done the pre-assessment before going in, said that everything appeared to be OK, but then -- even in route -- made the decision (that) the risk was too high."" The second helicopter lost communication with the missing aircraft and returned to begin the search operation, Osterman said. That operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery, with the military focused on recovering the helicopter, military officials said. Searchers found the helicopter at the bottom of the sound, and the bodies of the seven Marines and four Army National Guard members who were aboard. The bodies of at least two National Guard members were recovered Thursday, and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface, the Guard said. The crew members were with 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Hammond, Louisiana, according to a statement from the Louisiana National Guard. Osterman said the remains will be taken to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for identification and forensic examinations before being turned over to the soldiers' families for burial. On Friday, MARSOC, based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, identified the seven Marines who perished in the crash as Capt. Stanford H. Shaw, III, 31, of Basking Ridge, New Jersey; Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, of Williamsburg, Virginia;  Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol, 26, of Warren, Michigan; Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, of Lake Orion, Michigan; Staff Sgt. Liam A. Flynn, 33, of Queens, New York; Staff Sgt. Kerry M. Kemp, 27, of Port Washington, Wisconsin; and Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif, 26, of Holland, Michigan. They gave all: Profiles of those killed in helicopter crash . The names of the four Louisiana National Guard members were not released. ""To have such a tremendous group of Marines -- obviously the experience that they had, the cohesion and teamwork and everything else that they exhibited -- it definitely hit us all hard by having that many at one time,"" Osterman said of the deaths. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Mark Giuliano, chief of the Eglin Air Force Base's fire department, said a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise but that ""nobody saw anything because of the dense fog."" ""People said they heard a loud bang, and that was it,"" Giuliano said Thursday. The second Black Hawk -- which, like the first, was assigned to the 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond, Louisiana -- safely returned to the base, some 40 miles east of Pensacola. ""Whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft, it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise,"" Eglin spokesman Andy Bourland said earlier this week. Giuliano said the fire department, which has a unit on Santa Rosa Island near the crash site, was called to help at about 10 p.m. Tuesday, roughly 90 minutes after the crash. The military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage, he said. Military officials have said it's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash. The 11 service members, all men, were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations, said Capt. Barry Morris, a spokesman for the U.S. Marines Corps Special Operations Command. It involved small boats, and inserting and extracting Marines from the water via helicopter. Morris would not say which phase of the training the Marines were in Tuesday night. The initial search was hampered by dense fog, to the point that searchers on boats ""could not see,"" Giuliano said. On Wednesday morning, after searchers got a sonar hit, a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound, Giuliano said. Divers then went into the water ""to start retrieving the aircrew,"" Giuliano said, without specifying how many bodies were recovered. The helicopter had broken into several pieces in a ""high-impact crash,"" he said. The Coast Guard has hired a salvage company from Mobile, Alabama, to take the wreckage from the water, Giuliano said. On Wednesday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the crash was ""a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk, both in training and in combat."" ""We will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for."" Osterman said the 2,500 MARSOC troops have been deployed to Afghanistan and other conflict zones during the last eight years -- earning seven Navy Crosses, 19 Silver Stars, 207 Bronze Stars and 189 Purple Hearts. ""It is a very tight organization, and many of these Marines and sailors associated with MARSOC are more senior Marines,"" Osterman said. ""Their families are all very close. In this particular case, they were all from the same team so they were very, very close. And everyone immediately rallied together."" CNN's Ed Payne, Greg Botelho, Jason Hanna, John Newsome, Brian Carberry, Victor Blackwell, Jamie Crawford and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","All on the Black Hawk helicopter were killed in the crash .

"Washington (CNN)Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It's a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren't going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party's hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. ""The great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,"" said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Now we're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances."" Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. ""Unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn't a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,"" said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about ""legitimate rape."" Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. ""Democrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight,"" said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""The infighting is so bad that it's not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington."" The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, ""no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers."" That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was ""willing to consider"" entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities, there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder Democratic hopes in Maryland, which hasn't seen a GOP senator since Charles Mathias in 1987. And Mathias, a civil rights advocate and skeptic of Ronald Reagan, was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party. Republicans are also hoping for Democratic carnage in Ohio, where Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election. National Democrats have endorsed former Gov. Ted Strickland for the nomination, but the news did not force P.G. Sittenfeld, an up-and-coming 30-year-old Cincinnati city councilman, out of the race. Democrats are skeptical that Sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against Strickland and Portman, but if he does, his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old Strickland. In an interview, Sittenfeld spoke critically of Portman, calling him ""a 25-year creature of Washington"" who is ""out of touch"" with Ohio. But the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about Strickland's age. ""I fit the mold for new leadership,"" Sittenfeld told CNN in an interview, careful to note his admiration for Strickland and stressing that he is running against Portman. ""If you put together 100 people into the Senate, wouldn't you want at least one person from the largest generation in American history, the most technologically savvy generation in American history?"" Sittenfeld asked. ""How can we invest  in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles?"" As in Maryland, there appear to be no major early-stage differences between Strickland and Sittenfeld on the issues, which again suggests that the Democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else. With a presidential election on the ballot, increased voter turnout is expected to give Democrats a lift in the general election. ""There is an ideological reason for running, but let's not separate that from a path to victory,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Gonzales & Rothenberg Report. ""Primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity. Democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle, specifically in Maryland. The Democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because Maryland is a Democratic state. Lots of candidates see paths to victory and think, 'Why not me? Why not now?' "" And while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines, the contests are not necessarily damaging, Gonzales said. ""Crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that a party can't win."" Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who worked on several top tier Senate races in 2014, said the primaries might boost Democrats. ""Some of those primaries will animate elements of their base, including some donors, more than the general elections,"" he said. But Todd said the rush of primary activity for Democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years. ""I don't see that happening with Democrats as much as it does with Republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as a centrist Democrat anymore, so there won't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries.""","Recently, it's been Republicans who have been in attention-getting, bruising primaries .

"(CNN)If ignorance is bliss, then America must be a pleasure junkie, because we sure are chasing that dragon. The most recent example:  A school in New York sought to celebrate ""National Foreign Language Week"" by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day.  You get one guess as to what happened when it was Arabic day. Complaints came in from both Jewish parents and people who had lost family in Afghanistan, according to the school superintendent. What language do they speak in Afghanistan?   Not Arabic.  The main languages are Dari and Pashto.  Perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education, not less. Unfortunately, this wasn't an isolated incident.    Earlier this year in Florida, parents were up in arms because a school taught about Islam in a history class.  And, there are perennial stories about ""Americans"" offended by a Spanish recitation of the pledge. Because of the outcry, Pine Bush students will now not hear the pledge in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, or French, as planned. That they were deprived of such a pedagogical exercise is bad enough.  What is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize.  The district's statement was a surrender to ignorance. ""The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country. We sincerely apologize to any students, staff or community members who found this activity disrespectful."" Instead of the Pine Bush students learning about other languages and cultures, they learned that the ""heckler's veto"" and phony tales of ""offense"" trump open mindedness and the quest for knowledge.  At least they do in modern-day American education.  Perhaps this is a lesson best learned now, because once they get to college, it will be even worse. Our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish, and we went to question what we knew.  Today, they are places where disfavored ideas are all but banned.  According to students, Dixie State (Utah) bans posters that ""mock"" anyone, including former president Bush. Last year, Smith College's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had ""hurt feelings"" when alumna Wendy Kaminer argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism ""the n-word"" in historical discussions. She believed that using the actual word, in context, was proper (and it is). Yes, censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top-down or parent-driven phenomenon.  Now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs.  Instead of debating an anti-abortion protester, Oregon University students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side. George Will was slated to speak at Scripps College in a program specifically designed to challenge students' prevailing views.  But, since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus, Scripps pulled his invitation. When I went to college, I enjoyed challenging my beliefs.  I still do.  I hope that my children constantly do the same.  That is how we grow.  If we cannot tolerate foreign languages, or distasteful ideas, even in an educational setting, what hope do we have? When we have orthodoxy of thought, the very notion of liberty begins to shrivel up and die.  When the cry of ""I'm offended"" can shut down debate over philosophies, or learning about other cultures, or learning other languages, then what have our educational institutions become?  How much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning? And the very inspiration for this column, a debate over the pledge of allegiance, makes the problem even more glaring.  A rote and thought-free-chant of mindless allegiance can't even be expressed in a different language?  Is America really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims ""fidelità agli Stati Uniti"" that it means anything less because it is in Italian? Perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can.  Perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place.  Perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself. Perhaps if we pledged to uphold the Constitution, instead of a piece of cloth, we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the Spirit of the Enlightenment. No views are so sacred that they need not be challenged.  Whether we are talking about learning to say the Pledge in Japanese, or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs, that is what education is about, not enforced ignorance.","NY school district canceled its experiment with the Pledge for ""National Foreign Language Week""

"(CNN)Britain's Prince Harry is preparing for a new chapter in his life. After nearly a decade with the British military, he has announced in a statement that he is leaving the armed forces. ""Moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision,"" he said in a statement released Tuesday. ""I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process. ...[T]he experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life."" ""Captain Harry Wales,"" as he is known, from his official title and name of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.  The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana seemed to thrive in a military setting.  He managed to curb his wild ways (for the most part), served two tours in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain in 2011.  He has also qualified as an Apache Aircraft commander. Prince Harry does have a few more responsibilities before he returns to civilian life. He'll spend the last two months of his operational service attached to Australian Defence Force units in Darwin, Perth and Sydney. ""We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,"" said Air Chief Marshal Mark Binski of the Australian Defence Force. ""While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF."" Work with wounded soldiers will prepare the prince for the position he will take up in August. He will work in a volunteer capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme and the London District Personnel Recovery Unit.  Both groups assist wounded or sick soldiers either return to duty or transition to civilian life. ""Wounded warriors"" are a special interest for Prince Harry.  He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. Prince Harry will still have royal duties to attend to while he is finishing his military service.  He will accompany Prince Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April, for commemorations marking the battle of Gallipoli. And he will undertake an official Royal tour of New Zealand in May, after his service with the Australian Defence Force is complete. ""This is a big, bold step for Prince Harry,"" said CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster.  ""The military provided him with an escape from public life. He thrived being 'just one of the guys.'  But, as I understand it, he feels he's reached a natural crossroads in his career. The next steps would be staff college and desk jobs and that's not for him. He's passionate about the military, though, and I don't think will ever lose that connection.""","Statement: Prince Harry to leave military service in June .

"(CNN)""Hey dude -- can you turn your music down?"" If anyone says this to you while you're wearing your earbuds, take note: You are probably endangering your hearing. More than one billion teens and young adults are at risk of losing their hearing, according to WHO (that's the World Health Organization, not the rock band). It's not just old folks who suffer hearing loss. Just by listening to music at what you probably think is a normal level, or hanging out in loud bars, nightclubs and music and sporting events, you can permanently damage your hearing. By analyzing listening habits of 12- to 35-year-olds in wealthier countries around the world, WHO found nearly 50% of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices and about 40% are exposed to damaging levels of music and noise at entertainment venues. It doesn't take much time to damage your hearing at a sports bar or nightclub. According to the WHO, ""exposure to noise levels of 100 dB, which is typical in such venues, is safe for no more than 15 minutes."" Once you lose your hearing, it won't come back. Rapper Plan B and Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin know that all too well.  They both suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss that causes a permanent and irritating ringing in the ears, because they didn't protect their hearing.  Now they've joined forces with a British hearing loss association to warn others. ""I suffer from tinnitus,"" says Plan B on actionhearingloss.org.  ""When I first developed it, I thought it was trains rushing by my house as I live near a railway line. It was really loud and an extremely high pitched ringing in my ears.  I now have to wear special earplugs when I go to bed to help stop my ears from ringing."" ""Looking after your ears is unfortunately something you don't think about until there's a problem,"" says Martin.  ""I've had tinnitus for about 10 years, and since I started protecting my ears, it hasn't got any worse (touch wood). But I wish I'd thought about it earlier."" When it comes to personal listening devices, the level of damage you can cause to your ears is directly correlated to how long you listen and how loud the sound.   ""Unsafe levels of sounds can be, for example, exposure to in excess of 85dB for eight hours or 100dB for 15 minutes,"" says WHO. Eighty-five decibels isn't all that loud.  According to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, it's about the level of city traffic that you'd heard from inside your car. Some 360 million of us have already suffered moderate to severe hearing loss, according to the UN Health Agency Worldwide.  While that number does include factors out of our control, such as aging, genetics, birth defects, infections and disease, about half of all cases were avoidable. That's why WHO has launched the Make Listening Safe initiative.  Part of the campaign is to encourage manufacturers to create audio safety features on devices and then educate consumers on how to use them. WHO is also calling on governments to create and enforce recreational noise legislation. ""Parents, teachers and physicians can educate young people about safe listening, while managers of entertainment venues can respect the safe noise levels set by their respective venues, use sound limiters and offer earplugs and 'chill out' rooms to patrons,"" says WHO. In the end, it's up to each of us to protect our own hearing. The good news is that it's easy to do. When it comes to your personal audio devices, such as your smartphone: . -- Turn the volume down. Don't go above 60%. -- Wear noise canceling earbuds, or better yet, headphones. -- Take ""listening breaks"" or only listen for just an hour a day . -- Get an app for that. Download a smartphone app to help monitor safe listening levels. And the next time you go to a bar, nightclub, sports event or concert, use ear protection. Martin does. ""Now we always use moulded filter plugs, or in-ear monitors, to try and protect our ears,"" says Martin.  And his kids never go to a concert without big, noise-canceling headphones.","50% of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices .

"(CNN)Schools in New York City have decided to observe two Muslim holidays and close schools for them. After all, for decades, kids have gotten Christian and Jewish holidays off. Why not add Muslim holidays to the list? Conservative Family Research Council president Tony Perkins went predictably apoplectic, saying that it was evidence of ""discrimination"" against Christians.  To Perkins, ""family"" apparently does not include ""non-Christian families.""  Perkins' position is that kids get Easter and Christmas off, but we call those holidays ""winter break"" and ""spring break."" I hate to ally myself with such people, but I sort of agree that Mayor Bill de Blasio's decision is a bad one. However, not for the reasons expressed by Perkins. I simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state.  I cannot support the government endorsing religion of any kind. There was once a time when most people considered the United States to be a ""Christian"" country.  However, that notion was never the intent of our founders and is not consistent with a pluralistic and enlightened nation.  Unfortunately, even recent events have shown us that there are a lot of ignorant Americans who still think Islam is ""un-American."" Because of that, I support measures that tell Muslims that they are our brothers and sisters, too.  Nobody should feel less welcome or ""American"" on the basis of the religion they practice, or whether they believe in any religion at all. But this is the wrong way. First of all, virtually every recognized religion is practiced in New York City.  Unfortunately, now only three of them have some kind of ""officially acknowledged"" status.  Christians, Jews and Muslims have their holidays off, but what about New York's other religions?  What about my religion?  March 6 has long been ""The Day of the Dude,"" and as a Dudeist minister, should I not demand respect for my beliefs, by insisting that the school district ""take 'er easy"" on that date every year? Pastafarianism is a recognized religion. Pastafarians believe that every Friday is a holiday. Perhaps it is time for us all to be touched by the noodly appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster on a weekly basis. By selecting only three ""approved"" religions for respect, we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others. Such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some Abrahamic religions' holidays. Because therein lies a theory behind the establishment clause.  We don't rank belief systems here.  In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the U.S. Supreme Court gave us a three-part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the Establishment Clause: (1) the governmental action must have a secular purpose, (2) it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion. De Blasio's action violates, I think, all three prongs. De Blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction, and state that there would be no official religious holidays — that selecting just the Abrahamic vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper.  This would send the right message -- that the government is not going to get involved in matters of religion, at all. This is not to say that I disapprove of any ""cultural"" days off, or even simply pragmatic decisions.  For example, in some school districts in New York, 60% of the students were absent on Chinese New Year.  The New York State legislature authorized local districts to call off school that day, as a practical approach to empty chairs.  Further, it did not improperly send a message that certain religions were valued over others. I see no problem with kids taking religious days off, if their family's beliefs require them to.  Schools can accommodate that kind of thing as easily as they can accommodate kids who get stuck home with the flu.  I don't have a problem with even teaching about different religions; in fact, I support doing so. But what de Blasio did here was wrong.  Montgomery County, Maryland, officials handled it the right way; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015-16 school calendar, including Rosh Hashana and Christmas. Those days are simply ""days off"" as far as the government is concerned. Myself, I intend to continue to observe The Day of the Dude every year by takin' er easy for all you sinners.  I don't expect you to -- and as much as I would like the government to mandate that we all do so every March 6, that would simply rot the Lemon, so to speak.","Marc Randazza: NY Mayor de Blasio says schools will observe two Muslim holidays.

"(The Hollywood Reporter)It's official: AMC is moving forward with its ""Walking Dead"" companion series in a major way. The top-secret drama, which went through the pilot process with the title of Cobalt, will join the flagship series on the network as the cabler continues to focus on scripted fare. In addition to ordering the pilot to series, AMC has preemptively renewed the drama for a second season. The first season will consist of six hourlong episodes — just like the flagship series did. The drama will premiere on AMC in the ""late summer,"" with season two set for 2016. Robert Kirkman, who created The Walking Dead comic series, co-wrote the pilot with Dave Erickson (""Sons of Anarchy""). Kirkman and Erickson exec produce alongside ""Walking Dead's"" Gale Anne Hurd and Dave Alpert. Erickson serves as showrunner, while Adam Davidson directed the pilot. ""Walking Dead"" VFX guru Greg Nicotero will also exec produce the series. While AMC has been tight-lipped on its premise, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the series is a prequel that takes place in Los Angeles at the onset of the zombie outbreak. AMC on Monday confirmed that the companion series is set in Los Angeles but revealed nothing more beyond that it will focus on new characters and storylines. The drama is still untitled.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)During his upcoming speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran, hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the March 24 deadline for a political agreement. A senior Israeli official traveling in Netanyahu's delegation, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Israeli government had ""a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from."" ""We know what we know. And believe me, we know a lot of information about this agreement,"" the official told reporters aboard the flight to Washington. ""The Prime Minister is going to Congress to explain what they don't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement."" Will speech backfire? The official said Congress has ""no understanding"" of the deal shaping up. He described the Prime Minister's speech as a ""last chance"" to speak directly to Congress before a March 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal. The official would not disclose how the Israeli government reportedly had more information on the deal than the U.S. Congress, but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks. However, in congressional testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee last week, Secretary of State John Kerry said, ""Anybody running around right now jumping in to say, 'Well, we don't like the deal' or this or that, doesn't know what the deal is. There is no deal yet. And I caution people to wait and see what these negotiations produce."" The official suggested Netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his Tuesday address to pressure the Obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves Iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line. ""There is no sacred date,"" the official said of the March 24 deadline. ""It can be put off. It is not fixed. They can change it"" The official said that as the March 24 deadline approaches, Netanyahu will warn ""be careful of giving up compromises. They are compromises and they are not good."" Obama hinted last week that he did not see the need for any additional extensions, saying the talks have, ""sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified that we're at the point where they need to make a decision.""

"(CNN)During the three years that I was serving as a member of Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, I would frequently walk to work through the gate of the Bardo Museum so  I could get a glimpse of the mosaics, and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden. The museum, in downtown Tunis, serves not only as a physical reminder of Tunisia's Roman, Jewish, Christian and Islamic heritage, but is also connected to the Tunisian parliament. I used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work. Sadly, they will likely never feel quite the same again. On Wednesday, that kind of mood was shattered as the museum came under siege. More than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs opened fire, sending men, women and children scrambling through the Lion Gate to escape. The members of parliament who were evacuated were, ironically, discussing an anti-terror bill in a committee. Two of the attackers -- who were killed during the assault -- have been identified, and the security minister on Friday indicated  the pair had been activated from a sleeper cell, although at the time of writing authorities had yet to announce a link to a specific jihadist group. However, the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria threatening Tunisia. Meanwhile, individuals associated with the banned Tunisian organization Ansar Al-Sharia declared allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. All this has left some wondering if the museum attack marks a shift in strategy for ISIS. Have Salafist terrorists moved beyond their usual guerrilla-style operations to suicidal attacks outside Iraq and Syria? If they have, then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism, and have been collaborating with Turkey to prevent Tunisians entering Syria -- will need to redouble their efforts. The threat posed by terrorism to Tunisian citizens and our guests can't be downplayed, much less ignored. However, the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting, a point made in a recent report published by the Tunisian Institute for Strategic Studies, Tunisia's foremost think tank on political, economic and environmental matters. Indeed, the institute, which has tracked the upsurge in Salafi jihadi recruitment in Tunisia based on fieldwork and interviews with Tunisian jihadists, has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media's view. So, how should we respond? Some MPs have demanded the immediate passage of a new anti-terror law, and have been dismissive of the need to focus on human rights at a time of crisis. However, Wednesday's attack doesn't change the fact that we already have an anti-terror law that applies; simply passing a new version of a law will not stop a repeat. Instead, Tunisians should build on the stable institutions we have in place to implement some of the key ideas contained in the institute's report. For example, rather than rely exclusively on the Tunisian security apparatus for short-term gain, we need to better engage the Tunisian public in our common struggle against Salafi terrorists. Part of this means beating the terrorists at the recruitment game. Tunisians yearn for a sense that the state recognizes their humanity, dignity and value as individuals, not just as potential voters and taxpayers. With this in mind, it is clear that the Tunisian state has done a poor job of ""recruiting"" its citizens into the fold, which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young Tunisians who feel alienated and who have lost hope. Of course, a robust police response is required to contain Salafi jihadism. But this must be matched by an equivalent civil response to uproot the problem. That is why as law enforcement fans out across the country to investigate and protect, I hope also to see educators and trained social workers traveling to rural and impoverished areas of Tunisia to demonstrate that the state has recovered the kind of humanity that was lost during decades of police-state, authoritarian stagnation. Wednesday's attack was tragic. But to move forward, we must not be tempted to fall back on our past.","At least 23 people were killed in an attack on Bardo Museum in Tunis .

"(CNN)In an unusual turn of events last week, a terror plot suspect's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a Cincinnati television station in federal court. At issue was a taped audio interview with Christopher Cornell and whether the station could broadcast that interview. Cornell is accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol. The 20-year-old  -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with ISIS -- was arrested on January 14, months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the FBI's radar, according to court documents obtained by CNN at the time of his arrest. Two days after his arrest, a court order was issued barring public contact with Cornell, who is being held at the Boone County Jail across the river in Kentucky. Last week, Cornell made a collect call to CNN affiliate WXIX, said news director Kevin Roach. That phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview, Roach said. Cornell's attorney, Richard Smith-Monahan, argued that WXIX was in contempt of court for violating a January order ""directing the detention facility holding the Defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the Defendant without [defense counsel's] express approval."" Cornell spoke with reporter Tricia Macke. In that interview, he refuses to tell Macke how or when he first came in contact with ISIS, but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill President Barack Obama, members of Congress, as well as an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""I would have took my gun,"" he said.  ""I would have put it to Obama's head.  I would have pulled the trigger.  Then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members.  And I would have attacked the Israeli Embassy and various other buildings full of Kafir who want to wage war against us Muslims."" When Macke asked him why he would plot such an attack, he said ""Obama is an enemy of Allah, therefore an enemy of us, of Islamic State.""  He said his plan for an attack on the U.S. Capitol was retaliation for ""the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State."" Cornell told Macke he was planning what would have been a ""major attack"" to take place in Washington on September 20, repeatedly referring to himself as a member of ISIS.  ""I'm with the Islamic State,"" he said at one point.  ""I have connections with many brothers over there.  We've been corresponding for quite some time now, actually.  The FBI finally caught on this past year."" Cornell told Macke that he used ""encrypted messaging"" to communicate with ISIS members.  He said they discussed ""how we should wage jihad in America.  We should form our own groups and alliances with the Islamic State,"" he continued. Cornell said he was serious about his plans.  ""I'm very dedicated,"" he told Macke.  ""Like I said, I'm a Muslim.  I'm so dedicated that I risked my life.  That should say a whole lot."" He also warned that there were others like himself.  ""We are indeed here in America,"" he said.  ""We're in each and every state.  We're here in Ohio.  We're more organized than you think."" The interview was taped in three 20-minute segments and was recorded by the jail and WXIX. Roach said the jail's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time, so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended, Cornell called the station back to tell his side of the story. CNN listened to the audio recording. During the 6:30 p.m. newscast on Thursday, the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording, previewing a longer story that was to air later that night, in the 10 p.m. newscast. According to Mike Allen, legal analyst and attorney for WXIX, a producer from the station called him about 7:30 Thursday evening; Cornell's attorney had filed a ""show of cause"" order in Cincinnati's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. During that hearing, the judge continued the case for Friday morning and WXIX agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until Friday, pending a decision. In addition to the contempt of court argument, Smith-Monahan was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station, an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with Cornell, according to court documents. During the hearing, which lasted five hours, a lieutenant at the Boone County facility testified that one of Cornell's attorneys had given him a phone. In that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving Cornell a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to, which seemed at odds with the spirit of the January court order. At the end of Friday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Sandra Beckwith ruled that the order prohibiting Cornell from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order. Additionally, the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview, according to Allen. The judge also stated in court that while Cornell has the right to remain silent, he also has the right to freedom of speech. ""At the end of the day, the judge made the right decision,"" Allen said. CNN on Saturday reached out to Smith-Monahan, Cornell's defense attorney, but so far has received no response. WXIX aired a portion of the interview on Friday night, and plans to broadcast more this week.

"(CNN)Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and . . . a criminal? A sanitation worker in an Atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented Monday-- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning. Kevin McGill, a garbage collector in Sandy Springs, Georgia, had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city's noise ordinance that states that ""trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m."" He was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. McGill said that when he appeared in court, he was ""stunned"" when he learned he'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early. ""The solicitor said, 'It's automatic jail time,'"" McGill told CNN affiliate WSB. McGill said it was the first time he'd violated the ordinance, but the solicitor ""didn't want to hear nothing I had to say."" ""I was shocked,"" McGill told WSB. City spokeswoman Sharon Kraun said McGill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal, which included a 30-day jail sentence. The court said the sentence could be served on weekends, and Kraun confirmed Monday that McGill already spent two weekends behind bars. After news of McGill's punishment went viral, the solicitor's office announced Monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence, saying in a statement, ""The actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill's sentence for violating the city's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense."" ""As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation (is) suspended,"" the statement said. Chief prosecutor Bill Riley told WSB that the jail sentence was his idea because, he said, ""fines don't seem to work."" ""The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail,"" McGill said. Still, McGill said being locked up with ""real criminals"" was hard, and so was being away from his family. ""I just want this to be over with,"" he told WSB before getting word of the ""time served"" adjustment. ""I'm away from my family, my wife, and she's got to take care of the two little boys and I have four dogs.""","Kevin McGill was initially ordered to serve 30 days in jail for picking up trash too early in the morning .

"(CNN)A manager at an Indiana Veterans Hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a ""completely and totally unacceptable"" email apparently mocking mental illness. The email, sent by Robin Paul, ""in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients,"" Roudebush VA Medical Center Director Tom Mattice said in a statement posted on the hospital's Facebook page. Paul, a licensed clinical social worker, had been managing the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic, which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their VA benefits, services and programs, to include mental health, according to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Her email, first published by the Indy Star this week, was sent December 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios.  Two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities. In one photograph, the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate, with a post-it note that says, ""Out of XANAX - Please help!"" The caption reads, ""Self-medicating for mental health issues when a CNS would not give him his requested script."" In another, the elf is hanging from a string of Christmas lights. ""Caught in the act of suicidal behavior (trying to hang himself from an electrical cord),"" the caption says. John Thomas is a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and serves as a leader at an Indianapolis American Legion post. He said the email makes him sick and angry. ""I can't understand anybody who would do anything like this to us,"" Thomas told CNN affiliate WISH. Hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago, according to the Indy Star, and had ""administratively addressed"" the incident with Paul. But since the story went viral, the Roudebush VA Facebook page has been inundated with commenters calling for Paul to be fired. Matthew Conrad on Facebook said, ""Robin Paul's continued employment is an insult to every Veteran who has served this country."" Mattice announced Paul's leave, and a pending investigation, Tuesday evening.  But many say it's not enough. ""FIRING her would be the first step in showing you are truly committed to the veterans' health and well-being. Action speaks louder than words,"" Elizabeth Sanchez wrote on Facebook. Two of the country's largest veterans organizations have also criticized Paul's actions. ""It is absolutely inexcusable that a VA supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face,""  VFW National Commander John W. Stroud said in a statement. ""The VFW demands she be replaced as program manager."" The American Legion also expressed their discontent, saying they take ""health care for veterans very seriously."" ""Veterans suffering from TBI and PTSD should not be held up to ridicule,"" their statement read. John Crimmins was one of a few who came to the hospital's defense. ""As a veteran who receives care at the Rodebush VA Medical Center, I find this apology to be acceptable. We're all prone to doing stupid things. I'm sure Ms. Paul has received a reprimand for her actions. She doesn't need to lose her job. Now, let's move on,"" he wrote on the VA's Facebook page. Mattice, who was not available for comment Wednesday, did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident, or why it took so long to move forward with placing Paul on leave, but instead asked for forgiveness. ""I ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure, and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well-being,"" he said. This incident is the latest in what has been a tumultuous year for the Veterans Affairs Department.  CNN's months-long investigation into deaths due to long wait times for veterans at VA hospitals led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. CNN's attempts to reach Paul were unanswered as of Wednesday afternoon.","Robin Paul on paid leave after email mocking mental illness surfaces .

"(CNN)Eastern Europe, here comes the cavalry. The U.S. Army says it will soon be sending armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in the Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. The move was first reported Thursday in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. U.S. Army Europe posted the Stripes story on its website on Friday. The convoy is ""a highly visible demonstration of U.S, commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO's ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation,"" U.S. Army Europe spokesman Lt. Col. Craig Childs, said in a statement, according to the Stripes report. The troops and vehicles involved will be moving from training exercises conducted as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, the report said. They'll move through Latvia and the Czech Republic as they make their way to Vilseck, Germany, about a 40 miles drive from the Czech border. The troops involved are from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which are based at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, and they will be accompanied by the Army's 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, which will provide aerial reconnaissance, the Stripes report said. The move is unusual because long-distance movement of heavy military vehicles such as the 18-ton Strykers is usually done by rail. The trek is being called a ""Dragoon Ride,"" after the unit's nickname, the Dragoons. Troops will camp out along the route. ""For those participating in it, Dragoon Ride is a unique opportunity,"" Stripes quoted Childs as saying. ""Soldiers and their leaders will have numerous opportunities to engage with local communities along the route, deepen their appreciation for the cultural diversity within the alliance and enhance the relationships that are essential to building and maintaining mutual admiration, respect and trust among allied militaries."" The convoy will be the latest in a series of displays the U.S. and its NATO allies have taken under Operation Atlantic Resolve, during which the U.S. ""is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine,"" according to the Defense Department's website. The displays have come as close to 300 yards from the Russian border as U.S. Army Strykers participated in an independence day celebration in Nava, Estonia, last month. Other recent actions include the Air Force's movement of 12 A-10 Thunderbolt ""tankbuster"" attack jets to an air base in Germany and this month the placing of hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll soon be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Tension with Russia extends to the air too. Adm. William Gortney, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that ""this past year has marked a notable increase in Russian military assertiveness."" Russian heavy bomber aircraft flew more patrols outside Russian airspace ""than in any year since the Cold War,"" though he did not offer a specific number. There have also been increased Russian air patrols across the coastlines of Europe.","Armored U.S. Army Strykers to make trek to display solidarity with U.S. allies .

"Port Gibson, Mississippi (CNN)An African-American man is found hanging from a tree in the Mississippi woods with bedsheets around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground. There's no chair in sight. His feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground. His hands are not bound. Is this a suicide? Or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the South's history of racial violence re-emerging? Those were the big questions Friday, one day after authorities found a man's body with bedsheets around his neck in Port Gibson, a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural Claiborne County, about 60 miles southwest of Jackson, the state capital. Evidence collected so far doesn't suggest foul play in the death, law enforcement officials said. For that reason, suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death, the officials said. Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas on Friday identified the man as Otis Byrd. Even though authorities have confirmed his name, they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how Byrd died and who is responsible. ""It could take a week, it could take two weeks, it could take months,"" Lucas said. Authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused Byrd's death, Donald Alway, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson, said Friday afternoon at a press conference. He said 30 agents from the FBI, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim ""that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of Mr. Byrd."" Agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a ""storage location"" Byrd owned that might yield information, Alway said. Alway said the FBI is communicating with the family and won't comment on rumors circulating about the death. ""The community deserves answers,"" he said. ""The family deserves answers."" The body was found at 10:21 a.m. Thursday, deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house Byrd was renting, according to Lucas. A skullcap had been pulled over his head, the sheriff said. That house was the last place where Byrd had been seen on March 2, according to the sheriff. He was reported missing a week later, spurring a search. The body was found by staffers from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks who were taking part in the search, Lucas said. Thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found, according to the sheriff. A family member who did not want to be identified said Byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing. He went to church, he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino, according to the family member, who described Byrd as a ""good, hardworking man."" Byrd had been in prison. He was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman, but was paroled in 2006, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. No one has given any indication publicly whether Byrd had enemies. What distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching? Thomas Martin, a veteran crime scene investigator and president of Crime Scene Forensics LLC, said he knew nothing about the Mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation. Injuries to the dead person indicate lynching, he said, because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged. When people are strangled by somebody else, investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck, he said. The direction of the ligature is another indicator, Martin said. When people hang themselves, the rope often rides up directly behind the ears, he said. When a person is hanged by other people, the ligature moves differently on the neck, he said. Martin said these are general observations and that ""the facts are what make or break the case."" Mississippi NAACP chapter President Derrick Johnson issued a statement calling on ""federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of Mr. Otis Byrd."" The FBI already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi are also investigating, according to a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation also is investigating. FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jason Pack told WAPT that ""it's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner"" of death. ""We don't know what happened out there,"" Pack said. ""We don't know if it was a suicide, if it was a homicide. That's why we investigate these types of cases."" Lucas, who is himself African-American, said Friday that he's worried people will jump to the conclusion that Byrd was murdered and that race was a factor. ""I don't want the community to go excited saying it was a white-on-black thing. That's the worst thing that can happen, is people making it into a race issue,"" Lucas said. ""And that's my biggest fear.  And I don't want that to happen. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris reported from Mississippi, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Evan Perez, Alexandra Jaffe and Wesley Bruer contributed to this report.","Law enforcement officials say evidence collected so far doesn't suggest foul play .

"(CNN)More than two decades as a judge, prosecutor and defense lawyer could not prepare Susan Criss for the Texas murder trial of millionaire Robert Durst. The aftermath of the sensational 2003 trial of the scion of a New York real estate empire in many ways upended the life of the 54-year-old Galveston County-born lawyer who presided over the case. Durst admitted at trial that he killed neighbor Morris Black in Galveston and chopped up the body. There was the awkward encounter with Durst in an upscale Houston mall in 2005. Durst had already been acquitted after his attorneys argued that he killed Black in self-defense. Or the time, month's later, when the severed head of a cat was left near the doorstep of Criss' home. Criss said she believes Durst was behind it but admits police found no evidence. Fearing for her life, Criss said she stashed handguns throughout her house in case of a home intrusion. She put away the butcher knives in her kitchen. There was the strange instant message that she said brought FBI agents and surveillance cameras to her home. ""I've been living with this,"" the former judge said in an interview Friday. ""It's affected me in many, many ways."" The emotions came rushing back when Durst -- the focus of HBO's true crime documentary series ""The Jinx"" -- was charged with first-degree murder this week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante, Susan Berman. Durst's lawyer has denied his client was involved in Berman's death. ""Everything he does is totally unexpected,"" she said. Durst, 71, appeared to be preparing for life on the run when FBI agents arrested him in a New Orleans hotel on Saturday. In his room, agents found more than $40,000 in cash, a handgun, marijuana and a neck-to-head latex mask to alter his appearance. He's being held on drug and weapons charges in Louisiana as he awaits extradition to Los Angeles. The last time Durst was accused of murder was in Galveston. Though he was acquitted in the death of his neighbor, Durst later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case. Days before Christmas 2005, Criss ran into the man whose real estate developer family is among New York's wealthiest at Houston's The Galleria mall. Durst, who was on parole at the time, was on his cellphone. He had his head down. ""I was glad because I could get my composure,"" Criss recalled. It was the first time Criss had seen Durst outside court, ""in the free world,"" as she put it. ""I needed to not show any fear,"" she remembered thinking. ""I got my poker face on."" ""Hey, I know you,"" she said Durst told her. He appeared startled and dropped his phone. Fumbling to pick up the pieces of his phone, Durst said, ""You're Judge Criss. I did not recognize you without the robe,"" she recalled. ""How are you doing, Bob."" Durst told her that he couldn't believe she stopped to talk to him. ""I have a job to do but it's not personal."" There was small talk about cases Durst's lawyers were working. ""I thought, 'Oh my God, how do I get out of this? How do I exit,'"" said Criss, who then wished Durst a happy holiday. Durst said he was impressed that she had stopped to chat. ""He seemed genuinely touched,"" Criss said. She turned around and walked away. She wanted to look back at him but didn't want to seem concerned. ""I started calling my mom and staff and my friends -- You're not going to believe who I saw?  They said I should call security. For what? To tell them he's shopping."" The Galleria mall was not listed on the places Durst could go during his parole, said Criss, who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing. The former judge said police officers told her that Durst had also been spotted outside the home where Morris Black was killed. A secretary in the district attorney's office saw Durst driving behind the Galveston courthouse, Criss said. A condition of Durst's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him, Criss said. His parole was not revoked. When court officials called Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin to inquire about his presence near the courthouse, the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area. DeGuerin could not be reached Friday for comment about what Criss said about his client. ""There could be no good reason to come back to these places,"" Criss said. She started to become concerned. In ""The Jinx,"" Durst described the time he spent living in Vermont with his first wife, Kathleen, running a health food store in the 1970s. In 1982, Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing. Durst said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in Katonah, New York, and she headed to their Manhattan apartment. Her family said they believe she's dead and that Durst is to blame. The case has never been solved. Durst has denied any involvement in her disappearance. ""It's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice isn't going to be done,"" Criss said of the Durst case and its many tentacles. One day in June 2006, Criss said, that nightmare arrived on a walkway just feet from the doorstep of her home. She blames Durst. ""It was part of severed cat and it had been cut right behind the shoulders,"" Criss said. ""So it had the head and it had the two front legs. It was a small, pretty little gray cat. It was placed very carefully. It wasn't just tossed. It was very neatly laid there. It was perfectly cleaned. This had obviously had been killed somewhere else and brought here."" The animal's head was perfectly severed. ""What was the key piece of evidence in our case that wasn't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self-defense -- the severed head,"" Criss said, referring to Morris Black, whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head. Criss thought of the two dachshunds she had at home. She checked and the dogs were fine. ""I was in a panic,"" she recalled. ""I was just distraught."" The police were contacted. Even the Galveston police chief arrived at the scene, Criss said. A veterinarian determined that the cat had been killed by a person. Forensic tests found no DNA under the claws. There was no evidence linking Durst to the incident. ""They thought I was paranoid and crazy, that I was overreacting,"" Criss said. Galveston Det. Rick McCullor said he was part of the investigation but declined to comment further. In an email to the Bonnie Quiroga, head of the Galveston Office of Justice Administration, Criss talked about getting blinds for her windows and cameras for the courthouse. She recommended getting the door locks fixed. CNN obtained a copy of the email. ""His message is he knows where I live (and) this is what he is capable of,"" she wrote. Criss said she thought about evidence at the murder trial. The medical examiner testified that the person who dismembered Black knew exactly what tools cut through muscle and bone. Then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown senders. One said, ""Did you like your package?"" Criss contacted the FBI, which, she said, for nine months had cameras set up around her home. Criss said agents determined the message was sent from London. They found no link to Durst. The agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment. Criss started carrying a gun. Her parents always reminded her to keep her doors locked. ""There was a period of time after that where I not only did carry a gun, I had guns and weapons hidden throughout my home,"" she said. ""What if he breaks in and the gun is at the other end of the house? People did think I was crazy."" She hid the butcher knives in her breadbox. ""If something happen, I'd know where they were,"" she said. ""I lived like that. I believe that somebody really bad came to my home to send a message to me."" Criss' obsession with the Durst case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title ""Descent into Madness."" The final chapter keeps changing. ""Every time you think you've reached the highest level of weirdness, we go again,"" Criss said. She knows more than she needs to know about Durst and his peculiarities: How he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks. How whenever he's arrested, officers find guns, drugs and stacks of Metamucil. She learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of Durst's recorded jailhouse phone calls. ""This man, his day, every day of his life, is defined as a success or not a success by how going and doing No. 2 went,"" she said. ""That was a part of the conversations with him... It had to happen at a certain time of day or his whole day was shot.  The court staff used to joke that rearranging the court schedule was going to upset Bob's schedule."" A few years back, while Criss was campaigning for re-election and working the polls, a man approached her. Criss said it was a juror from the Durst trial, a man who had befriended the defendant, visited him in jail and dined with him at times. He must have seen a media report about the severed cat head. ""It seemed like he's inappropriately happy to be asking me this question -- 'Hey, did anything ever happen about that cat head at your house?'"" Criss recalled. ""I'm thinking to myself: You son of a bitch. I lied. I know the police weren't doing anything about it. I said, 'Oh yes, the police think they know who did. His demeanor changed and he couldn't get away fast enough.""","Former Texas judge says Durst case ""affected me in many, many ways""

"(CNN)The recent controversy over a video showing University of Oklahoma students, who also were members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting. The university said Levi Pettit and Parker Rice encouraged their brothers to sing the lyrics, which included multiple references to the ""n-word"" and mention of lynching. The two young men were expelled. And the fraternity was shut down. What caught my attention was the reaction of the families — the Pettits and the Rices. They couldn't have been more different. That convinced me that this story wasn't just about racist and juvenile behavior, but also about parenting. Who raised these kids? And shouldn't they have been taught better? At some point, didn't it occur to these young men that they were not only shaming themselves, but also their families? In Dallas, protesters gathered outside the Rice home, holding signs with messages such as: ""Racism is taught."" Parker Rice issued a statement, which was delivered to the Dallas Morning News by his father, Bob Rice. In it, Parker apologized for actions that he called ""wrong and reckless."" However, Bob Rice had no response to the controversy. He told reporters: ""At the moment, we are not doing interviews."" That is not good enough. Parenthood isn't like politics. It doesn't come with a ""no comment"" button we can press when the job gets uncomfortable. We haven't heard from Levi Pettit. His parents, Brody and Susan, addressed their son's misbehavior in a statement, which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family's website. It read in part: . ""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply. He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting. While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist. ... ""Of course, we are sad for our son -- but more importantly, we apologize to the community he has hurt. We would also like to apologize to the entire African-American community, University of Oklahoma student body and administration. Our family has the responsibility to apologize, and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation."" That's an impressive statement. I applaud the Pettits for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son, as many parents might have done. They did what parents are supposed to do: They took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised. Who knew that would be so controversial? Ever since the apologies were offered, there's been discussions in this country about whether it's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children. Last week, while hosting a radio show in San Diego, I brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the Rices and the Pettits have to parenting -- all the way from ""we are not doing interviews"" to ""our family has the responsibility to apologize."" The Pettits had the right idea, I insisted. A caller disagreed, saying he didn't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong.  ""He's his own person,"" he said. Based on what I've heard in the last few days, I would imagine that there are many people who agree with the caller. They seem to believe that, when their son or daughter turns 18, their job is finished. They can't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility, and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions. That sounds good. But I don't think it's either/or. Of course, individuals should take responsibility for their actions. Yet, as the Pettits demonstrated with their statement, when something goes terribly wrong, there is usually enough responsibility to go around.  When appropriate, parents can take a slice. Besides, I bet a lot of parents believe -- as I do -- that we should never stop loving our children. But at some point, it's perfectly fine for us to just stop claiming them as our own? It just looks like some parents can't wait to find the exit. Here's an idea. We tell people to drink responsibly. We tell them to drive responsibly. We need to start telling them to parent responsibly. After all, parenting a child is the most important job that many of us will have in this world. And there is no date of retirement.","The controversy over University of Oklahoma students reciting a racist chant raises a number of issues .

"(CNN)A documentary on the life of late singer Amy Winehouse will be released in Britain on July 3, just weeks before the fourth anniversary of her death, the film's production company says. ""Amy"" seeks to ""truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know,"" the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013. It will feature ""extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks,"" Deadline reported Wednesday. No U.S. release date has been set, Deadline reported. Despite releasing just two albums before her death of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011, the British singer's smoky voice and songwriting won widespread acclaim and six Grammy Awards. ""Amy"" follows a poorly received biopic, ""Fallen Star,"" released in 2013. The film was not authorized by the family and, unlike ""Amy,"" featured none of the star's music.

"Moscow (CNN)Russia's president shares ""political responsibility"" for the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, the late politician's daughter said Friday in her first TV interview since his death in central Moscow last week. Zhanna Nemtsova, who said she has no faith in the Russian investigation into the killing, said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices, rather than embolden them. ""I cannot blame him (Putin) directly, (but) I would say that our authorities, including the president of Russia, have political responsibility as the head of state,"" Nemtsova told CNN's Matthew Chance. Nemtsova says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder, but that ""it's evident that it's politically motivated."" Nemtsov, 55, was shot dead last Friday night as he walked near the Kremlin with his girlfriend. A former deputy prime minister, he was one of Putin's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the government. No one has been arrested, though Russia's Federal Security Service chief has said there are suspects. The Kremlin has suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord, but many Nemtsov supporters suspect Putin's administration of involvement. How Boris Nemtsov's murder serves notice to Vladimir Putin's enemies . Putin this week called the killing a ""disgrace"" and a tragedy, and he promised to bring those responsible to justice. But Nemtsova, 30, said she does not believe that will happen. She said investigators have not contacted her and she knows nothing of the case except what is in the media. ""I don't know where his cellphone and his personal belongings are, so I know only those things which are released or published in the press and nothing else, nothing else,"" she told CNN from Germany, where she is staying for a few days. ""As I have already said, I don't have any faith in this investigation."" Nemtsova said she loved her father ""more than anyone else in my life"" and that the two were very close. ""I think that he died a hero,"" she said. ""He was a very brave man, and he was clever, he was a great thinker and he was a brilliant physicist,"" having published dozens of articles on the subject, she said. He was also an economist and pacifist, she said, who most recently had been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. ""I know that some Russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous, but ... in an authoritarian regime, any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous,"" Nemtsova said. ""That's why, I think, if you look at other regimes, like in Russia, you will see that all opponents to the official line are in danger, under threat."" Nemtsov was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia-Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin. Early in his career, he was governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, a major economic hub. ""I think that now, Russia has crossed the line after this murder, and people will be frightened to express their ideas which contradict ... the official standpoint,"" Nemtsova said. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow. CNN's Melissa Gray reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Zhanna Nemtsova says she has no faith in the Russian investigation .

"(CNN)When I received an advance copy of a book called ""Moody Bitches"" last month, I was immediately intrigued. I have been called moody, and the ""b"" word, but never have both terms been used -- at once -- to describe me. (At least not that I know of!) Had I been labeled a moody ""b"" in the past, I certainly would have taken it as a major insult. But today, if someone called me that, I think I would say, ""Thank you for describing who I am and who we, women, are. There is nothing wrong with being moody, emotional or irritable."" That provocative title, ""Moody Bitches: The Truth About the Drugs You're Taking, the Sleep You're Missing, the Sex You're Not Having and What's Really Making You Crazy,"" got me thinking about whether our emotionality, our monthly ups and downs during our menstrual cycle, should be viewed as such a negative after all. Opinion: Are drugs stifling women? ""Women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we're supposed to tamp down that moodiness,"" said Julie Holland, author of ""Moody Bitches"" and a psychiatrist who has practiced in New York for 20 years. ""It's like a problem to be fixed and really, I think it's our greatest asset. It's certainly our greatest psychological asset."" After all, our empathetic nature helps us understand nonverbal babies -- and not-always-the-most-communicative husbands and partners. Our intuition helps us sense people's motivations. Our emotions help us realize when something is wrong in our lives. So, why on earth have all of those qualities come to be viewed as a source of weakness, not strength? And why is at least one in four American women taking some form of psychiatric medication, including antidepressants, versus one in seven men, according to Holland? Some of these women definitely should be taking antidepressants and other medications, but the question is why are so many other women taking them when they don't need to be? This is you on stress? Those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently: Holland, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, Cosmopolitan executive editor Leslie Yazel and me. Yazel, a mom of a 4-year-old, wondered if people are afraid of being unhappy. ""I do think that people are afraid to be sad and they're afraid to be scared,"" Holland said. ""I think we spend a lot of time and energy pushing down emotions that are uncomfortable for us. I don't want to cry right now. I don't want to be angry. I don't want to be scared so we push it down, but the problem with pushing it down is it takes a lot of energy and it ends up creating a lot of tension."" Social media, with the endless barrage of gorgeous-looking pictures from family and friends who appear to be having the most perfect lives, certainly doesn't help. In fact, a recent study showed that heavy Facebook users experience envy, which could lead to extreme sadness and depression. ""Everyone's Instagraming their best, most fabulous, freakin' pictures, and they're looking so skinny and beautiful and so happy, and they're going on vacation ... and then you compare it to your life,"" said Hostin, a mom of two. It's not a real or genuine life, Holland said. ""It's plastic."" But when more and more women medicate away their emotions when they don't need to be taking antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs, they create a ""new normal,"" she said. Postpartum depression: One mom's mission becomes a movement . ""It's like doping and biking, or steroids and baseball. If everybody is doing it, then the ones who don't are at a disadvantage,"" said Holland, who is also the author of the best-selling memoir ""Weekends at Bellevue."" ""If everyone is getting boob jobs, then people who don't end up feeling flat-chested."" And when it seems more normal than not to be on mental health meds, the bar is lowered for when women will go on antidepressants, she said. Women who are medicating away their emotions when they don't need to be might not realize there are major effects to their decision. Notably, they find it more difficult to cry -- and tougher to orgasm. ""I certainly talk to my patients about sexual side effects. It comes up all the time. In our first meeting, I ask ... 'Is it hard for you to climax because this may end up being an issue? It's going to be even harder' ... but it's not like it's in the advertising,"" Holland said. ""It may be in the small print on the back of the ad, or they may say it at lightning speed during the TV commercial."" Women today are subjected to a barrage of advertising -- from daytime talk shows to women's magazines -- about the medications they could take to make them feel better. Women's desire for sex is complicated, not strictly hormonal, study says . ""Twenty years ago, when I started my practice, I had somebody come to me and they would have symptoms, but they didn't quite know what was wrong and what they needed. And now people come to me and it's like, 'Well can you explain the difference between Effexor and Wellbutrin, and can you tell me which one I should take?' "" The conversation ""advanced from 'Is there something wrong with me? Do I need medicine?' to 'Which medicine is right for me?' "" said Holland, who points to how nine out of 10 of the big pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development. What we're also seeing, Holland said, is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office. She tells the story of a woman who called her up in tears and said she needed new antidepressants because clearly her current meds weren't preventing her from crying at work. When Holland asked her what caused her to cry, she said her boss was being difficult. Holland said what was needed was a plan to confront her boss, not a prescription for a new medication. ""I hate to see us medicating away our sensitivity and emotionality for the comfort of other people in the workplace. I think it's a big mistake."" Thinking about trying to control our emotionality for the comfort of others reminded me of a college relationship, which I shared with Hostin, Yazel and Holland. My boyfriend at the time told me one of my problems (he clearly thought I had many!) was that my highs were too high and my lows were too low. He said I needed to live in the middle. ""You should be more like me, like a man,"" joked Holland. Clearly, that relationship didn't last very long! As we wrapped up, I asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about Holland's thoughtful new book. ""Don't give up your awesome orgasms,"" said Yazel. (Amen to that!) ""So it's OK to be a moody 'b'?' "" Hostin asked. ""It's OK to be a moody 'b,' "" Holland replied. ""Our sensitivity and our emotionality is an asset. It's not a liability. It's not a symptom that needs to be medicated away."" How concerned are you that so many women who don't necessarily need antidepressants are taking them?

"Montabaur, Germany (CNN)Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's voice isn't heard in a recording of the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525. But investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit, deliberately locking out the plane's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the French Alps. Andreas Lubitz had medical note for day of crash, hid illness, officials say . The only sound the recorder picked up from Lubitz as the Airbus A320 went down, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said, was the co-pilot's steady breathing. Authorities didn't mince words Thursday as they blamed Lubitz for the crash, but questions are still swirling over the 27-year-old's past. Officials say Lubitz passed a psychological test when he was hired, had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight. It seems, Robin said, that Lubitz ""wanted to destroy the aircraft."" But why? Lufthansa CEO 'speechless' It's a question police were trying to answer as they searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf. Police spokesman Markus Niesczery said a team of five investigators went ""through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down."" About 85 miles (136 km) away in the town of Montabaur, the house where Lubitz's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police. A group of men, perhaps investigators, were the only ones granted access. This town in western Germany is where Lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age. At a club on the outskirts of Montabaur, pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said. They said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane. Between the ages of 14 and 20, Lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club. ""(He was) a very normal young person, full of energy,"" Klaus Radke said. ""What can I say? He had a bright future. He made his hobby into his job. What more can you hope to achieve?"" The authorities' explanation doesn't ring true for Peter Ruecker, another pilot who knew him from the flight club. ""Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me,"" Ruecker told the Reuters news agency. ""He was a lot of fun, even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet,"" Ruecker said. ""He was just another boy, like so many others here."" A neighbor told Reuters that Lubitz ""was very interested in things which are going on around him."" ""It's a very good family,"" the neighbor said. ""They have a good connection within the family and they are engaged in the community."" An 8-minute descent to death . Lubitz had been with Germanwings, a budget airline owned by Lufthansa, since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the airline's media office said. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters that Lubitz ""interrupted"" his training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr said he couldn't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training. If it was for medical reasons, he said, then that information would have been private before the crash, he said, but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation. Most of Lubitz's training took place at the Lufthansa flight training center in Bremen. He also trained in the United States, spending six months at facility in Arizona as part of a required program to get his license, a Lufthansa spokesperson said. Spohr said Lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying. However, the airline does consider an applicant's psychological state, along with other factors, when hiring pilots, he said. Lubitz and the captain passed a psychological test when they were hired, he said. ""We don't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities,"" Spohr said. ""He was 100% set to fly without restrictions,"" he added. ""His flight performance was perfect. There was nothing to worry about.""

"(CNN)Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star, claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family, vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-Semitic remarks. In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with ""what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?"" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of ""offensive"" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to ""f---ing kill"" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to ""constant harassment"" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.","Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber file lawsuit against the pop star .

"(CNN)Whoever wins the general election on May 7 will face international challenges reaching to the heart of a question that has bedevilled every London government since 1945: what is, or should be, Britain's role in the world? As one of World War II's victor countries, Britain helped shape the post-war international architecture. Notably, it gained a permanent seat, plus veto power, in the U.N. Security Council, which it retains to this day. But these battlefield laurels disguised fundamental weakness. The two world wars severely depleted Britain's human and material resources. The heyday of the world's largest-ever empire and of London and Liverpool's control of a vast maritime trading network had passed. As the Cold War took global grip, the United States purposefully pushed Britain aside. The U.S. took over its military bases, its spheres of influence, and its markets. Conscious of its decline, London clung, slightly pathetically, to what it termed its ""special relationship"" with Washington. Maintaining this key U.S. relationship is the most important foreign policy challenge facing Britain's prime minister after May 7. Whether that person is the Conservative party's David Cameron or the opposition Labour party's Ed Miliband makes no difference. Barack Obama's arrival in the White House now looks like a watershed for bilateral relations. Unlike many of his post-war predecessors, Obama was no Anglophile. Indeed, his grandfather's unhappy experience in colonial-era Kenya gave him reason to dislike the English. Obama the dispassionate analyst also found scant objective reason to prioritize the British alliance or Europe generally. Looking at the EU, he saw one dominant, friendly power -- and its capital was Berlin, not London. Looking the other way, to Asia, Obama saw opportunities and threats of far greater moment, centered on rising powers such as China and India -- hence his subsequent ""tilt"" to Asia. Britain's principal value to the U.S. lies with its defense capabilities. It proved a loyal if not especially effective ally in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although capacity has steadily declined in the past 30 years, Britain was seventh in the world in 2013 in terms of military spending and remains a dependable U.S. deputy within NATO. But the pre-election consensus is that the next British government will be obliged to slash defense spending again, probably below the 2% of GDP threshold to which NATO members are pledged to maintain. Big cuts in army and air force numbers are in prospect. Maintaining even one modern aircraft carrier has become a real struggle. It is likely, on these trends, that Britain would be unable to contribute separately to any new international campaign, but would be obliged to place its troops under U.S. command, as General Raymond Odierno, U.S. army chief of staff, recently suggested. America's top politicians, soldiers and diplomats, such as U.N. ambassador Samantha Power, are applying increasing pressure on Britain over defense expenditure, but with little joy so far. In time, this impasse could lead to a permanent rift. Worse still, in the U.S. view, is the possibility that a Labour-led government, potentially beholden to the unilateral nuclear disarmers of the Scottish National party, could slacken its commitment to Trident, the UK's nuclear missile submarine fleet. The SNP says the country can no longer afford a nuclear deterrent, morally or financially. Washington's worries about Britain's role have been exacerbated by the lack of fight, as some see it, displayed by London when faced with the prospect of Scottish independence and the inevitable break-up of the United Kingdom. Similar concerns apply to Britain's EU membership, which Cameron has placed in doubt by promising a national referendum by 2017. The U.S. greatly values Britain as an informal, surrogate voice within the EU. But Washington's interests aside, the EU is Britain's biggest trading partner and a natural ally in terms of democratic values, and legal, social and cultural norms. An exit from the EU would satisfy minority hardline nationalists in the UK Independence party. But it would seriously undermine Britain's standing in the world, in relation to Europe and to the emerging Brics powers. All this matters more than ever because, amid the developing disorder of the post-Cold War world, old certainties are being uprooted and new or revived threats are multiplying. The aggressive behavior of Vladimir Putin's Russia is one obvious example. Another is the rise of international terrorism, most recently in the form of ISIS, also known as the Islamic State. Another is China's hegemonic ambitions in the East China and South China seas, at the expense of neighbors such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. On these issues, it seems that Britain, by design or not, has little concrete to contribute. London allowed Germany and France to take the lead on Ukraine diplomacy. Embarrassed by public criticism, Cameron belatedly sent a few army advisers to help train Kiev's forces. Similarly, London's military contribution to the fight against ISIS has been minimal, and confined to Iraq. Members of Parliament recently expressed strong dismay that Britain was doing so little. And as for Japan, ostensibly an important British ally, recent defense cooperation agreements do not disguise the likely infeasibility of sharp-end assistance. Indeed, as some see it, there is far too much British kow-towing to China. Disturbed by this evidence of decline, Britain's political class comforts itself by arguing the country still leads by example. It still maintains a generous overseas aid budget, it mounts successful humanitarian missions such as in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak, it remains a top five world economic power, and sometimes (though not always) it uses its U.N. and other platforms to stand up for democratic values and human rights. All this is true. But it is small consolation for a country that, 100 years ago, was a superpower with truly global reach. In the election campaign, foreign policy and the key 21st century international issues, such as climate change, have barely got a mention so far. This is not an accident. Britain's horizons are narrowing. Its strength and global ambitions are fading. Its post-imperial destiny is that of a second-tier power. The trick is not to appear second rate.","Whoever wins May 7 election must answer this question, says Simon Tisdall: What is, or should be, Britain's role in the world?

"(CNN)The world is watching for what could turn out to be either a historic achievement for international diplomacy -- or, just as easily, a disappointing failure -- as negotiators sit down this week in the tranquil lakeside city of Lausanne, Switzerland, to hammer out a framework nuclear deal with Iran before March 31. Here are some of the key things you need to know as the next major deadline approaches in the Iran nuclear talks: . 1. The road to Lausanne has been a long one. This latest round of talks are part of a process that has been going on for two years, through both public and private diplomatic channels. In 2013, tensions between the world powers and Iran began to thaw a bit after the election of reformist Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who pledged to end the crippling weight of international sanctions on Iran's economy. In November of that year, officials from the five permanent member nations of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China -- along with Germany, began nuclear negotiations with Iranian officials in Switzerland and signed what came to be known as the Geneva Agreement or Joint Plan of Action, offering limited sanctions relief for Iran in return for that country rolling back aspects of its nuclear program. The deal was heralded as an interim step toward a larger, more comprehensive agreement, which would further lessen the economic pressure on Iran and give the six world powers -- referred to collectively as the P5+1 -- certain assurances that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful in nature, as it claims. Several rounds of talks have taken place since the Joint Plan of Action was reached in an effort to bring about that comprehensive agreement. But this interim agreement has been extended twice over a failure of the parties to meet previous deadlines for a final deal. 2. There's no guarantee they'll reach a deal. While both sides stand to gain from a potential agreement, they also have certain ""red lines"" they aren't willing to cross -- key issues that could sink the prospects of a deal even if everything else is agreed to. For Iran, a major sticking point is the pace of sanctions relief. They want the international community to lift all U.N. sanctions at the beginning of the agreement, whereas the P5+1 powers would rather see those sanctions phased out as Iran demonstrates its commitment to the deal. Iran also wants a high cap on the number of centrifuges and other nuclear hardware it can continue to operate, and for the restrictions imposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time. This platform is diametrically opposed to the P5+1 position: that Iran should maintain a relatively small nuclear infrastructure and that the moratorium on Iran's nuclear activities should last at least a decade. And of critical importance, particularly to the United States, is the insistence that Iran be held to a minimum one-year ""breakout time"" -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement. So even as negotiators express some optimism about the progression of talks, it's clear that there are major gaps to bridge, which may be why some U.S. officials have put the odds of reaching a deal at 50% or less. 3. Even if there's a deal, it's not the deal. While the focus this week is on the March 31 deadline, it's important to note it isn't the final deadline. The parties are seeking to reach what's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal. But if they're able to come together on the big issues, they still have until the end of June when the Joint Plan of Action expires to iron out the details. So that means the talks won't be finished this month. Officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders. The United States would prefer a written accord, but Iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached. 4. There are a lot of stakeholders. There are seven countries at the negotiating table, but far more following along from the outside. Israel, for instance, as one of Iran's primary geopolitical foes in the Middle East, is watching the talks keenly. Israeli officials are regularly consulting with their P5+1 allies on a regular basis and are trying to influence the outcome of the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been one of the most vocal critics of the negotiation process, publicly butting heads with the Obama administration in an effort to derail the talks. Saudi Arabia's government is equally concerned about the prospects of a deal, fearing it could give Iran greater leverage in the region. And there are those who fear that a nuclear agreement will spur other countries in the region to develop nuclear programs -- a means of deterring Iran if it decides to restart the military dimensions of its newly legitimized nuclear program. But there are also stakeholders in the international community that would welcome the opportunity to trade freely with Iran once sanctions are eased, giving them access to vast Iranian markets. 5. Domestic politics matter. Aside from Netanyahu, many of Iran's most ardent detractors are in the U.S. Congress and in Iran, and they will continue to make their views known. The chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, is introducing legislation that would compel the administration to put any deal it reaches to a vote in Congress, something that the administration adamantly opposes. Administration officials say Congress has already been consulted throughout the negotiating process, and that, at the end of any final agreement (potentially a decade from now), will play a role in repealing U.S. unilateral sanctions. But Congress is not satisfied to take a back seat in these talks -- a fact that was demonstrated this month when 47 Republican senators signed a letter to the Supreme Leader of Iran, suggesting a future president can easily retract any agreement the Obama administration signs. In Iran, Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has the final say on any nuclear agreement Iran would reach with world powers. And he is mindful of hard-line clerics in Iran who are opposed to a deal with the West that imposes restrictions on what they see as Iran's right to a nuclear program. Khamenei has sent mixed messages about the negotiations. He has voiced support for the efforts of Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the lead negotiator. But he has continually voiced distrust for the United States and has dismissed the idea that a nuclear deal would lead to cooperation in other areas. The internal struggle between power centers in both the United States and Iran is a key variable that could derail the already complicated negotiation process.","Interim deal from 2013 between six world powers and Iran has been extended twice .

"(CNN)It's been more than 13 years since 2,753 people were reported missing in lower Manhattan after the attacks on the World Trade Center. Although death certificates have been issued for all 2,753, the work to identify each victim continues. In fact, it's far from over: Some 40% of the victims have not yet been identified, according to the city's Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The most recent identified victim is Matthew Yarnell, a 26-year-old New Jersey native who worked for Fiduciary Trust on the 97th floor of the South Tower. Yarnell's mother said Friday that the news ""was a bit of a shock,""  but that it means that she can ""finally put everything to rest."" ""It kind of opened up all of the old wounds and old pains initially,"" Michele Yarnell told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""I guess it kind of put to rest any -- I wouldn't say doubt -- (because) we weren't doubtful about the outcome, but it kind of gave us closure."" According to the medical examiner, Yarnell's DNA samples were recovered during the original recovery effort from 2001 to 2002.  Until this week, they resided with other remains that have not been identified. A recent retesting, however, yielded a new result. ""Every time there's a new development in a DNA processing or technique, they go back and they recheck every single remain that they have in the repository at the museum,"" she told Baldwin. ""And this time (Matthew's) matched."" The identification of Yarnell puts the total number of identifications from the World Trade Center at 1,640, meaning there are still 1,113 more to go. Daunting, but not insurmountable. ""The ME's office is not going to give up,"" Michelle Yarnell said. ""I hope for everyone that lost a loved one there, that they'll have that closure someday, and, hopefully, sooner rather than later.""","DNA identifies remains of 9/11 victim more than 13 years later .

"(CNN)FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Iran to end its ""intolerable"" ban on women attending football matches. Writing in the FIFA Weekly magazine published by world football's governing body, Blatter described the situation as one that ""cannot continue."" Iran's ban was put in the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their team without restriction. At the match against Iraq, activists unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against Brazil in 2014, and called for the ban to end. The measure was imposed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-Islamic. Iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the Asian tournament, for which the United Arab Emirates is also bidding. But the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event. Blatter wrote: ""I raised the topic at my meeting with the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term. ""However, nothing has happened. A collective stadium ban still applies to women in Iran, despite the existence of a thriving women's football organization. ""This cannot continue. Hence my appeal to the Iranian authorities -- open the nation's football stadiums to women."" During last year's football World Cup, CNN reported how fans in Iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings. At one coffee shop in the capital, Tehran, the tense game against Argentina -- a game Iran lost only to an injury-time Lionel Messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd. ""100 percent it's better this way,"" said Negar Valayi. ""It doesn't happen often. It would be great if we have more of this."" ""It's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited,"" said Roya Marzbahan. Hoardings advertising the World Cup throughout Tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women. And state TV broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored. Blatter also hit out at football's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body's executive committee. The committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the FIFA congress following a change to the statutes in 2011. ""This was hard work because the members of FIFA's executive committee are elected by the national associations... and there was never, never a proposal for a woman to be finally in FIFA,"" the 78-year-old said at an event in Switzerland. ""We had to take the decision, and I did it in 2011 at the end of the congress, [that] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee."" He described football as a ""macho"" sport and warned: ""We should change in the future.""","FIFA president writes about issue in FIFA Weekly magazine .

"(CNN)There is a controversy brewing about Starbucks and its new ""Race Together"" campaign.  The ubiquitous coffee shop company was mocked for its decision to have its employees write the words ""race together"" on its coffee cups and start a discussion on race. But what's so bad about that?  Shouldn't we commend Starbucks for trying to be good corporate citizen, to walk the talk, as it were? Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced the company's new campaign this week, which he described as ""an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society.""  In other words, grab a cup of coffee and let's talk about race. ""We have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality,"" Schultz said in a video to corporate employees. ""We believe we're better than this, and we believe the country is better than this. There is a need for compassion, empathy and love towards others."" And he has indicated that the new move is not mandatory for its employees. This is what Schultz calls ""conscious capitalism.""  It is an example of businesses who want to serve the community, get ahead of the curve rather than pander to what they think customers want, and show that they care about something other than getting paid. theGrio.com: Creflo Dollar is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of 'false profits' Of course, we would be foolish to think that Starbucks or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive.  After all, the company, like any other money making enterprise, wants to make more money.  And capitalism is all about making money.  And yet, there are different pathways to getting there, and maybe Starbucks is showing us a new way. Perhaps you think that their approach is corny, and yes, the company has faced a lot of attacks online for their stance.  But the attacks are distracting us from a very important problem, one which many people would rather not discuss, with or without their coffee. Clearly some people do want to talk about race, and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on.  What we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride and Eric Garner, John Crawford and Tamir Rice, and many more, whether by police or by armed vigilantes. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72 percent as well as whites . People of all colors and persuasions have participated in #BlackLivesMatter, #ICantBreathe and #HandsUpDontShoot protests and die-ins across the nation.  Race is part of the town hall, the public square.  It always has been, but what is different now is that the issue is once again being placed on the front burner. It only makes sense that actors and players in society, including corporations such as Starbucks, would want to become part of that new dynamic. At a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable, exploitative, even deadly business practices, Starbucks is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution. Corporate America makes a great deal of money, and just as some corporations have benefited historically from slave labor and exploitation, some corporations today attempt to get ahead by cutting corners, underpaying their workers with poverty wages, cheating their customers with bad mortgages or polluting the environment.  Meanwhile, other companies take a completely different approach and realize that by giving back to the community, supporting worthwhile causes, and initiating important discussions not only helps their bottom line, but improves society's bottom line. Of course, we cannot pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve America's problems, just as President Obama's ""beer summit"" over the racial profiling of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those ""teachable moments."" theGrio.com: Let's stop the 'struggle equation' Race in the United States is not merely about who likes or who doesn't like you, or who calls you the N-word or does not want to live next to you.  Racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change.  But these institutions are made of people, and people do have to talk.  And drink coffee.  And who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race? Maybe they will even think about things in a different way. So, let's not attack Starbucks for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race.  The only thing worthy of criticism is that other companies haven't done it, and that's something that needs to change.

In his petition, Neil Lonsdale describes the rapper as an ""egotistical, maniacal, disgrace."" He calls on organizers to replace the  ""Yeezus"" singer  at the Glastonbury Festival this summer. West is booked to headline the festival, which runs between June 24-28. His performance is Saturday.

""We spend hundreds of pounds to attend glasto, and by doing so, expect a certain level of entertainment."" The petition urges West to  ""pass his headline slot on to someone deserving."" Lonsdale is not the only music fan upset by his scheduled performance.  By early Friday, the petition had nearly 80,000 signatures. West  and the festival's organizers have not responded to the petition. The festival  is held in Somerset, England, and features various types of music.  Past performers have included the Gorillaz and Stevie Wonder.","One music fan in the UK wants him out of the Glastonbury Festival .

"(CNN)He doesn't wear a uniform or hold an official rank, but Hadi Al-Amari is a powerful military leader in Iraq. He leads the Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit from ISIS extremists. Ousting ISIS from Tikrit is important for dozens of countries in the United States-led coalition trying to thwart the Islamist extremist group's quest to grow its caliphate. Iran isn't a part of this coalition, but it is also working to defeat ISIS -- something that's provoked both relief and alarm in Washington. Al-Amari is confident his men, with help from the Iraqi army and some Sunnis, can crush ISIS in Iraq without this coalition's help. He's sure because the Iranians are advising them. ""We don't need it, and we won't need it,"" he said. ""Anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate Iraq is putting their faith on a mirage."" Iran knows what it's doing, in his view. ""Yes, we declare to the world, we have Iranian advisers, and we're proud of them, and we thank them deeply for participating with us because Iran has more experience than anyone else on Earth in fighting terrorism."" Does it matter that Iran is advising militias fighting ISIS? Does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against ISIS -- including that one of them, Iran, is a longstanding U.S. foe? When asked questions along those lines Wednesday in Washington, it seemed that even top U.S. military officials didn't have easy answers. The view is that defeating ISIS is good, while relying on and possibly strengthening Iran is not. In other words, Iran's involvement in Iraq is a mixed blessing. To make sense of this all, one needs to understand not only the international landscape and Iraqi politics, but Islam itself. The religion's two major sects are Sunni and Shia. In Iraq, Sunni Arabs comprise 15% to 20% of Iraq's population, with about half of them in urban areas like Baghdad, Mosul and Tikrit, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. About 18% of Iraq's population is Sunni Kurds. That means the vast majority of Iraqis are Shiite Muslims. And it matters. During his decades-long rule, Saddam Hussein -- a Sunni whose hometown is Tikrit -- gave positions of power to Sunnis, and marginalized Shiites, experts say. Many Shiite families fled to Iran and the country gave them housing and jobs and schooled their children. That imbued Iraqi Shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to Iran. Shias have led Iraq since Hussein's ouster, often alienating Sunnis in the process. This has fueled major sectarian rifts that peaked when Nuri al-Maliki was prime minister, leading to not only millions of disaffected citizens but a weaker central government and military that ISIS frequently overran in 2013 and 2014. Haider al-Abadi took over as Prime Minister last year in part to address these deep divisions. Still, some Sunnis haven't seen the change they want: For instance,  Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud in February called for direct U.S. arming of Sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make Iraq's government help them more in the fight for Anbar province. And Shiite militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has documented what it calls escalating ""abuses by militias allied with Iraqi security forces in Sunni areas,"" pointing to instances in which residents have been forced from their homes, kidnapped and executed. Such treatment has happened in remote areas as well as the Iraqi capital, according to the group. ""Sunnis are a minority in Baghdad, but they're the majority in our morgue,"" an Iraqi Health Ministry doctor told Human Rights Watch last July. Just a few days ago, Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said people ""must always act with self-control,"" according to the New York Times. Still, there's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered, especially amid the chaos of war. The fear is that mostly Shia militias, like the one led by al-Amari, will inflame the tinderbox of sectarian strife -- with Human Rights Watch warning of revenge attacks on Sunnis in Tikrit. Add to this equation the fact that ISIS is made up Sunni Muslims who consider Shias heretics and apostates, slaughtering them in large numbers. Civilians and troops alike have faced their wrath: The most glaring incident may have been last June, when the militant group overran an Iraqi military base once known as Camp Speicher -- which, notably, is near Tikrit -- and claimed to kill some 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority of them Shias. Given these harsh realities, it's not necessarily cut and dried what a Sunni citizen in Tikrit will think if either Shia militias or the Shia-led Iraqi military battle the Sunni group ISIS. ""Do I choose the Iraqi military (which is working with the U.S.-led coalition) or ISIS?  Do I choose leukemia or the plague? ... Which groups do they dislike more?"" said Stephen Biddle, a strategy expert and the award-winning author of ""Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle."" ""It's not like the Sunnis love ISIS; most don't. But some think the Shiite government is a bigger threat than ISIS."" So what should the United States do? Jessica Stern, a lecturer on terrorism at Harvard University who this month published, ""ISIS: The State of Terror,"" says it's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in Iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government. She notes that ""the anti-Sunni, Shia-promoting government of Maliki"" was a big reason ISIS was able ""to take root"" in Iraq. ""Many Sunnis feel under siege. ISIS is saying, 'We're going to protect you. ISIS is presenting itself as a savior of Sunnis,"" she said. But, as Biddle points out, reform in a bureaucracy comes slow. There's been talk for years about healing Iraq's sectarian divide. What's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon? Biddle thinks the U.S. should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the Iraqis as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together.  The biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against ISIS. ""Right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do,"" he said. ""We're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they're going to suffer much either if they don't do what we want."" Enter Iran. It's part of this quandary because it shares a border with Iraq, has its own interest in fending off ISIS, and is predominantly Shia. It's also a staunch foe of the United States, which its leaders have cast as the ""Great Satan."" That lack of love is mutual, with Washington leading a years-long standoff with Tehran over its nuclear program. (There are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse, but critically no deal yet.) Yet ISIS is likewise America's enemy, with President Barack Obama saying that the goal is to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" that group. It's not in Iran's interest to have Iraq devolve into a sectarian war, says retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst. ""The Iranians are smart enough to know that's a possibility, so they would be telling the Shia-led militias not to make this a Sunni v. Shia fight,"" Francona said. But what should the United States think about Iran's efforts to defeat ISIS by backing Shia-led militias? Speaking at a congressional hearing Wednesday about the White House's request for use of force to fight ISIS, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff opined that Iran's involvement in helping Iraqi forces is a good thing. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" Gen. Martin Dempsey said. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced. The U.S. is worried about Iran's role, he said. ""It is something that is concerning to us,"" he said of Iran's role, ""in particular because the sectarian danger in Iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against ISIS."" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Shia militia leader in Iraq says Iran knows what it's doing; coalition help not needed .

"(CNN)One of 10 people killed in the collision of two helicopters in Argentina, France's Florence Arthaud has been described as a ""national treasure"" by fellow sailor Shirley Robertson. ""Florence held the hearts of her nation when she won the Route de Rhum in 1990 -- a crazy sprint across the Atlantic, alone in very fast boats, an event watched live across the country with millions coming to see their heroes set off,"" Mainsail presenter Robertson told CNN. Along with Camille Muffat and Alexis Vastine, the 57-year-old Arthaud was one of three sports stars killed in the collision as two helicopters transported the athletes to a gorge in northwestern Argentina to film the reality TV show ""Dropped"" for French broadcaster TF1. According to Robertson, Arthaud had inspired a generation of French sailors. ""Brave and brilliant, nothing was impossible,"" added Robertson of Arthaud. ""A true role model to the yachtswomen who would follow, she led the way. ""Her sense of adventure continued and she was well known for her TV documentaries bringing the power and passion of the sea into the living rooms of her adoring public. The nation will mourn this heroine's loss."" Known as the ""little girl of the Atlantic,"" Arthaud was the daughter of Jacques Arthaud, the director of the Arthaud publishing house. ""A true character, she made her mark in the sport through her determination and showed to the whole world that sailing was not merely a sport for men; that women could now also take part in the adventure and succeed,"" said the French Sailing Federation in a statement on its website. Despite being left in a coma after a car accident at the age of 17, Arthaud crossed the Atlantic for the first time when she was 19, going on to win a number of races including the 1997 Transpacific race that traverses the Pacific Ocean. The boat that she had sailed to win the Route du Rhum -- Pierre 1er -- also helped her establish a women's singlehanded west to east transatlantic record, as Arthaud notched a time of nine days 22 hours and five minutes. ""Her death has moved the French sailing world,"" added the French Sailing Federation. ""All our thoughts are with her family and her loved ones.""

"(CNN)Vladimir Putin lies. Blatantly. Publicly. And, apparently, without chagrin. But a year since the annexation of Crimea, what does that mean for the West's ability to deal with him regarding Ukraine? In February 2014, ""little green men"" -- the Ukrainian term for professional soldiers wearing Russian combat fatigues but no identifying insignia -- seized key installations and checkpoints around Crimea. The Russian President's website reported the following exchange at a March 4, 2014, news conference: . Question:  ""The people who were blocking the Ukrainian army units in Crimea were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the Russian army uniform. Were those Russian soldiers, Russian military?"" Vladimir Putin:  ""Why don't you take a look at the post-Soviet states?  There are many uniforms there that are similar. You can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform."" Question:  ""But were they Russian soldiers or not?"" Vladimir Putin:  ""Those were local self-defense units."" Within weeks, Putin admitted they were Russian troops. At the same news conference, Putin said he saw no possibility of Crimea joining Russia and said Moscow would do nothing to ""provoke"" that. Two weeks later, he presided as the Russian parliament passed legislation annexing Crimea. In a documentary shown on Russian television last Sunday, Putin said he gave the order to take Crimea on February 23, 2014. So, it is clear that Putin can and does lie. But with that in mind, how should Western leaders who must deal with him actually do so? First of all, they should bear in mind Ronald Reagan's ""trust but verify"" dictum. Second, while Putin may play fast and loose with the truth, he appears to be a rational actor who calculates costs and benefits. The challenge for the West is to structure agreements so that it remains in his interest to observe them. Take the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits U.S. and Russian strategic forces to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads on 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement requires data exchanges, notifications and on-site inspections. The Russians might be able to cheat a little, but not in a way that would give them a militarily significant edge without the United States having time to react. And the Kremlin has incentives to observe the treaty. If Russia violated it, the United States could relatively quickly add 1,000 strategic nuclear warheads to its deployed ballistic missile force. The U.S. government concluded last summer that Russia violated a 1987 treaty by testing a banned intermediate-range ground-launched cruise missile. As far as is publicly known, Moscow has not taken the more serious step of deploying the missile. Washington now seeks to persuade Russia to come back into full compliance and has threatened a variety of costs, including possible military countermeasures -- on top of the opprobrium of Russia's European and Asian neighbors, who would be targeted by such a missile. (It could reach little, if any, of the United States.) The costs of noncompliance for Moscow could be significant. The question now topping the agenda is whether the West can trust any Russian promises regarding a settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Sadly, the track record offers little encouragement. Russia effectively did nothing to implement the first Minsk ceasefire, which was agreed to last September. It did not withdraw its military equipment or secure the Ukraine-Russia border. The Minsk II ceasefire reached in February fared little better at the outset. A Kremlin spokesman dismissed the idea that Russia was a party to the agreement -- even though Russia's ambassador signed it. Russian forces backed those of the separatists attacking the Ukrainian town of Debaltseve in the first days after the ceasefire supposedly had begun. (Putin's continual denials that Russian troops are in eastern Ukraine have zero credibility after the Crimea case.) Since then, the ceasefire seems to have taken better hold, though it remains fragile at best. At the same time, concern has grown that the port city of Mariupol could be the next separatist/Russian target. What can the West do to stabilize the ceasefire?  An assault on Mariupol (or elsewhere in eastern Ukraine) would probably trigger severe costs in the form of a new round of Western economic sanctions on Russia and the provision to Ukraine of greater military assistance, including defensive arms. As Hans Binnendijk and John Herbst recently suggested in The New York Times, the United States and European Union should tell the Russians now what costs would be imposed if there is an assault on Mariupol, in order to help deter such an attack. The West may not be able to trust Putin on the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. But it can do more to raise the potential costs and affect his calculation, and hopefully dissuade him from further military action that would probably bring down the entire Minsk II agreement.","Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 .

"(CNN)Muhammadu Buhari has ruled Nigeria before, as one of a line of military strongmen who dominated the country between 1966 and 1999. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983 -- closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari -- and another military coup ousted him from power in August 1985. Buhari's 20-month rule was known for what he described as a ""war on indiscipline,"" a tough regime which some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has been viewed as a plus by some and a minus by others in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. This year alone, the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians, Human Rights Watch says. The ongoing violence in the Northeast has put security -- along with corruption and the economy -- at the top of the election agenda. Prior to this year's polls in March, Ayo Johnson, a documentary filmmaker and analyst on African affairs, told CNN that voters would opt for whoever could make Nigeria feel safe. ""Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader, during a dictatorship,"" Johnson said. ""Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism."" Buhari has campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime, while stressing that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. ""It's a question of security. Whether I was a former military officer or a politician through and through, when there is insecurity of this scale in the country, that takes the priority,"" he said from his campaign plane. In another interview with Amanpour in February, Buhari blamed President Goodluck Jonathan's government for repeated setbacks in the fight against extremists. ""The misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the Nigerian military is unable to beat Boko Haram,"" he said. Asked by Amanpour about abuses allegedly committed during his own previous leadership, Buhari said there was ""a degree of accuracy"" in the claims. But he said he had ruled Nigeria as part of a military administration. ""When that military administration came under my leadership, we suspended -- as a military then -- part of that constitution that we felt would be difficult for us to operate and as also a consensus,"" he said. ""I think I'm being judged harshly as an individual that what happened during a military administration can be extended under a multiparty democratic system."" Buhari's campaign was fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. The 2015 presidential race was Buhari's fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985. In 2003, Buhari -- then with the All Nigeria People's Party --  lost to Olusegun Obasanjo in an election during which EU observers reported widespread irregularities. He lost again to Umaru Yar'Adua in the 2007 election, which was widely condemned for rampant vote-rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. After Yar'Adua's death in 2010, Jonathan rose from vice president to president and Buhari challenged him in the 2011 elections as a candidate from the Congress for Progressive Change. Buhari had helped found the party a year earlier, saying it was ""a solution to the debilitating, ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party, the ANPP."" Buhari is a Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan hails from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. After Jonathan's victory in 2011, amid accusations of vote-rigging, violent riots broke out in the North. Armed protesters took to the streets chanting Buhari's name, and more than 800 people were killed in the post-election violence. Buhari's office issued a statement calling reports of burning of places of worship places a ""sad, unfortunate and totally unwarranted development."" ""I must say that this is a dastardly act (that) is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore cannot be supported by our party,"" said Buhari's spokesman Yinka Odumakin. ""I must emphasize that this is purely a political matter, and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic, religious or regional one."" Read more: Nigeria election -- what you need to know . Ahead of this year's election, Jonathan and Buhari signed a nonviolence pact, the Abuja Accord, in January. On March 26  they renewed their pledge and reiterated their commitment to ""free, fair and credible elections."" But violent protests broke out a day before the final results were announced. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest the elections, amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. Both candidates called for calm, with Buhari, who contested this year's vote as part of the All Progressives Congress, tweeting: ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced."" After the protests in Rivers, his party demanded the elections there be canceled. But Nigeria's electoral commission decided the results would stand, saying it ""did not believe the allegations were substantial enough to require the cancellation/rescheduling"" of the Rivers poll. According to his campaign website, Buhari is from Daura in Nigeria's northern Katsina state and is married with eight children. His military training began in 1963 and included stints in the United Kingdom, India and the United States. Buhari was the first chairman of the Nigerian Petroleum Corporation, the site says. Elements of Buhari's biography were questioned in the run-up to the March 28 election. After weeks of speculation and an ongoing legal battle over allegations that Buhari failed to complete his secondary school education, a Nigerian court on March 25 cleared the way for him to run in the presidential race after adjourning the case until April 22. As a Sunni Muslim from the North, Buhari appears to have moved to address any concerns his appointment could be detrimental to non-Muslim Nigerians -- approximately half the country's population, according to the CIA Factbook. A blog post on his campaign website headed ""Buhari will never Islamise Nigeria"" describes a campaign ceremony in January in Imo state. Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha, it says, ""dismissed suggestions of plans by Muhammadu Buhari to 'Islamize' Nigeria,"" telling the audience Buhari's long-time cook and driver were Christians and his youngest daughter had married a Christian. Buhari has also not been immune to the violence plaguing northern Nigeria. Last year, he was targeted in a suicide bombing that killed at least 15 people in the city of Kaduna. An earlier blast in the city the same day  had been aimed at a Muslim cleric. A day after winning the country's presidency, Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that fighting corruption and curbing violence were at the top of his agenda. The economy is another major issue the new leader has to contend with, as the country overtook South Africa last year as the continent's largest economy.  But as many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day.","Muhammadu Buhari is a 72-year-old retired major general from Daura, northern Nigeria .

"Washington (CNN)Updates on Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, an economic twist on the old adage ""All politics is local,"" and an overseas vote where President Obama would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. The official White House line will be something like this: The Israeli people are making their choice, the United States admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next Israeli government no matter who wins. But it's no secret President Obama is no fan of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israeli prime minister's recent address to a joint meeting of the Congress exposed the rawness of the relationship. So as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead, the White House has both a personal and professional interest. NPR's Steve Inskeep took a firsthand look at the Israeli campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty. ""Now, Israel's political system is so complicated that even if (Netanyahu's) party ends up not being the leading party, there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition,"" said Inskeep. ""But it's interesting to note that Isaac Herzog, the Labor Party leader, who's his biggest challenger, wants to change Israel's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end Israel's isolation in the world, which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this White House or frustrated this White House over the last several years."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tend to be at the top of GOP presidential polls these days, and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry. But Maggie Haberman of The New York Times took us inside some recent big-money conversations during which Walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival. Walker was in New York City last week for fund-raising meet and greets, and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him. New York Observer owner Jared Kushner was also on hand. ""He was asked how he would beat Jeb Bush, and he surprised a bunch of people by saying Jeb Bush is the front-runner,"" said Haberman. ""Now, that's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week."" ""But that is his sell to people who could give him money, which is: 'No, no, (Bush) is the front-runner but I'm the slow and steady guy who's going to come up behind, just like when I ran track when I was younger.'"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at times appears to be the odd man out in the early GOP presidential rankings. Jeb Bush's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for Rubio to tap Florida's deep fund-raising well. Then came the Scott Walker boomlet, and talk among some conservatives that the Wisconsin governor -- not Rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation GOP standard-bearer. But Rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. ""He's spoken with Romney twice since Romney decided not to get in the race,"" said Costa.  ""And he has had meetings this week with people like Lanhee Chen, Romney's former policy director, and texts often with Spencer Zwick, Romney's former finance director."" ""I think Rubio, if he nurtures those relationships, we'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters."" Ohio Gov. John Kasich is about to make his first New Hampshire foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Kasich, who is exploring running but hasn't been as aggressive as many other GOPers in terms of travel and staff recruitment, will be in New Hampshire on March 24 for the Politics and Eggs breakfast, a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. Word from people familiar with the trip is that Kasich is being encouraged to be more active in New Hampshire by former Gov. John H. Sununu and his son, former GOP Sen. John Sununu. Two New Hampshire GOP activists also report that former GOP Sen. Judd Gregg also believes Kasich -- like Gregg, a budget hawk during his time in Congress -- would be a strong addition to the GOP field. There is a crowded field of Republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are grateful. They don't have as much reason to be grateful to the Democrats, who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate. The lack of a big field will likely spare Hillary Clinton a damaging mess, as California Gov. Jerry Brown suggested last week. But, party loyalties aside, perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar. Julie Pace of The Associated Press reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states. ""When you have robust primaries in both parties, you have tons of money flooding into Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina, on television ads, on hotels, transportation, campaign headquarters,"" said Pace. ""And there is some concern that on the Democratic side, we're just simply not going to see that this time around."" ""And it's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super PACs.""","Scott Walker plays diplomat in big money conversations about Jeb Bush .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton held a closed door meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House on Monday.  Although the former secretary of state, senator and first lady has not declared, it is treated as a foregone conclusion that Clinton is running for president. Likely to launch her campaign in April, Clinton is regarded as the front-runner — if not the only Democratic candidate — and the inevitable Democratic nominee. There is an assumption that since Clinton supported Obama, the black community will now embrace her.  But there are more than a few who didn't get that memo.  At this stage of the game, many African-Americans may not be excited about a candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. And after two terms of the nation's first black president, she should proceed with caution. Clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest, when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects.  Early on, Clinton was the favorite of black folks, lest you forgot, and it did not hurt that President Clinton had been regarded as the ""first black president"" with high approval among African-Americans. Then, support for a senator named Barack Obama blew up after the Iowa caucuses. And Clinton found herself apologizing for her husband's comments about Obama's win in the South Carolina primary. President Clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared Obama's win in the Palmetto state to that of Jesse Jackson in 2004 and 2008, suggesting that Obama, like Jackson, would not win.  The misstep was an affront to many African-Americans, as were Hillary Clinton's suggestions on the campaign trail that Obama was only good for making speeches, but not for taking action. And let's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for ""hard-working Americans, white Americans."" We can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign-trail junk-talking, and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election.  President Obama made Clinton his secretary of state, and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the Obama Cabinet.  But that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter, racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago. Black voters are among the most loyal of the Democratic Party base, and their record high turnout for Obama  was an important part of his victory.  However, with a charismatic Obama no longer on the ballot, maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72% as well as whites . Moreover, as for Clinton, who (understandably?) has her own ideas and may not agree with the President on certain issues, any criticism of Obama could cost her some black voters.  Remember that Clinton voted in favor of the unpopular, costly and deadly Iraq war.  That support cost Clinton in 2008.  And while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton's strongly pro-Israel stance on Mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the Democratic base, including blacks, Latinos and young voters. However, it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to Hillary Clinton as economics.  Because she is tied to the Wall Street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees, people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class, and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy. The nation is hurting, despite the economic turnaround, and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks, who still have high unemployment rates, a rising wealth gap compared to whites, and, for many, no recovery in sight. And while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community, Clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject. She will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement. This, rather than her email account, is what concerns the black electorate. theGrio.com: Let's stop the 'struggle equation' Perhaps a populist, more down-to-earth challenger such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could appeal to black and working-class voters, and unlike Clinton, would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble, or lacking core beliefs other than being in power. It is safe to assume that if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election, but that may not be enough. Let's remember President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11% of the black vote. Had Mitt Romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes, he would be president now. Obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012, particularly in swing states like Ohio. Clinton can't assume she'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm.  Support for Barack Obama does not necessarily translate into support for another Democrat.  This means Clinton must fight for votes like anyone else: knock on doors, kiss babies, clap off beat at the AME church, and do whatever it takes.","David Love: The former secretary of state would need to woo African-American voters to turn out in big numbers for 2016 .

"(CNN)Food & Wine magazine has released its annual list of the best new chefs across America. Making the cut in 2015 are a chef with a doctorate in neuroscience, a one-time ""Top Chef"" contestant and a culinary artist who plays blues guitar in his free time. The 11 chefs and their restaurants, which will be profiled in the July issue of Food & Wine, span the country as well as the culinary spectrum, specializing in Spanish tapas, rustic Italian, modern American, farm-to-table and even the breakfast and lunch rush. What they all have in common is a willingness to take risks while satisfying the palates of many, says Food & Wine Editor in Chief Dana Cowin. ""I was surprised, and delighted, by how personal these restaurants are,"" said Cowin. ""The chefs seem to be cooking to please themselves, and in the process have dazzled diners."" Cowin noted a trend: The chefs are nodding toward the past while innovating. ""Chefs are also looking to their families as touchstones,"" she said. ""We've seen a lot of paeans to grandmothers. In fact, Olamaie is named for one of the two chefs' grandmothers. Tim Maslow of Ribelle took over his father's restaurant, Strip T's, and reinvented the food, while leaving the décor the same. Carlos Salgado of Taco Maria was born into a family that had a Mexican-American restaurant and now he's elevated that traditional cooking."" Though many of the chefs are looking to a simpler time in their lives for inspiration, picking the top cooks in the country is no simple task. First, Food & Wine editors reach out to a ""trusted group of nominators"" around the country, which includes writers for the magazine, past honorees and industry insiders, for their picks. They're looking for chefs who have been creating dishes and running a professional kitchen for five years or less. Editors also comb local magazines and newspapers to find out who is generating buzz regionally. Once the group of candidates is whittled down, Food & Wine visits the restaurants to taste the local fare anonymously. This year's selections include a former scientist, chef Katie Button of Curate in Asheville, North Carolina; ""Top Chef"" season 4 contestant Zoi Antonitsas of Westward in Seattle; and blues-lover Bryce Shuman of Betony in New York City. ""Top Chef"" host Tom Colicchio, famed restaurateur Thomas Keller and international megachefs Daniel Boulud and Nobu Matsuhisa are past honorees. The July issue of Food & Wine hits newsstands in mid-June, and the honored chefs will be in attendance at the annual Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Colorado, that month. A complete list of this year's Food & Wine top chefs is below. See the gallery above for more on the chefs and their cuisine. Bryce Shuman; Betony; New York City .

"(CNN)Two extremists who attacked a landmark museum in Tunisia, killing 23 people, got weapons training at camps in Libya, an official said Friday. The suspects were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia, Security Minister Rafik Chelly said. He did not say which group activated them, or with whom they trained. ""They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there,"" he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV. Like Tunisia, Libya saw its longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring. But unlike its neighbor to the west, Libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by Islamist militants, like those behind the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Such violence has been rare in Tunisia, at least on the scale of what happened Wednesday at the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Still, it is not a total shock, given that up to 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight as jihadists in Iraq and Syria, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London, not to mention others who have joined radical groups closer to home. Already, authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack, including four directly linked to it, according to a statement from Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi. And in an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted ""crusaders and apostates"" with  ""automatic weapons and hand grenades."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. That bloodshed is ""just the start,"" the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow, but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators. The nation's security forces are working to break up other cells like those behind the recent Bardo Museum attack. But that's not necessarily going to be fast or easy. ""We know they can launch operations, but we must piece together clues in order to conduct an arrest,"" Chelly said. As investigators continued their work, Tunisians turned out Friday to mark the North African nation's independence from France. Those commemorations were more somber this year, but they were also in many ways more significant. ""I'm here to celebrate 59 years of our independence,"" said Adib Adela, 38, a school inspector in Tunis. ""The most important thing now is to properly investigate and to find those responsible."" Tunisia has been shaken by the terrorist attack, though it was foreigners -- 19 of them tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis -- who made up the vast majority of victims. Fifteen victims' bodies are at a morgue in the capital, a forensic official said. Some of them haven't been identified two days after the attack, according to the official, and all are foreigners. The fear is that many other tourists won't come back. Already, the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims, Costa Cruises and MSC Cruises, have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in Tunis for 2015 and substituted them with other ports. That means some foreigners won't be coming to Tunisia as once expected. But it doesn't mean all tourists will stay away -- as illustrated by a movement online of people vowing, ""I will come to Tunisia."" Beyond tourism, Tunisians also hope to get support from other countries as they fight terrorism. ""I hope other countries will support Tunisia, like they supported France after Charlie Hebdo,""  said Amir Foudieli, 33, who works for an export company, referring to the January massacre at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. ""We are Tunisian, this is our country. Not theirs, they (the terrorists) are bastards of children. We have centuries of history."" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Victor Blackwell and journalist Yasmine Ryan contributed to this report.","Two cruise ship companies cancel 2015 stops in Tunisia after the Bardo Museum attack .

"(CNN)Team Cookie or Team Boo Boo Kitty? If you're a fan of the hit TV show ""Empire,"" you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series. If you aren't a fan, you may soon be in the minority. The show has become something of an industry phenomenon, with ratings growing every week. According to Variety, two weeks before the season finale, which is set to air on March 18, ratings were up 53% from its January 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45%, from 9.9 million to 14.3 million. Eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard-of these days in broadcast TV, which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services. But Fox's ""Empire"" is doing the damn thing. The show revolves around the character of record label owner Lucious Lyon (played by Terence Howard) and his family, which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what's hers. ""You're so beautiful,"" Empire, and here are some of the reasons why: . Taraji P. Henson . Henson has been in the industry for a minute, and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), her career hadn't really taken off. Not so now. Henson has sunk her teeth into the role of Lyon family matriarch Cookie. The character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely, even as she is also motivated by making money. The show's co-creator, Danny Strong, told Entertainment Weekly that fans can thank Henson for the now infamous ""Boo Boo Kitty"" nickname that viewers have come to love. When Cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband Lucious' new lady love, Anika Calhoun (played by Grace Gealey), ""Boo Boo Kitty,"" you want to yell at the screen, ""Get her, Cookie!"" ""So, basically Taraji is a genius,"" Strong said. ""She's a comic genius, but she's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress, and we're utilizing all that in Cookie."" Watch for Henson to snag nominations next award season. It's old school soapy . Think ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas"" for the 21st century. It has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious: sex, scores to settle, family tensions, violence and did we mention sex? Set in the world of the music industry, there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy, dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode. That's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that ""and then what?"" itch. It's new-school hip . ""Empire"" has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern. One of the primary story lines has been about homophobia, as Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal (Jussie Smollett) battle over Jamal revealing he's gay. It comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights. Series co-creator Lee Daniels, himself an openly gay man, has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community. ""Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community, and men are on the DL (down low, meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women). They don't come out, because your priest says, your pastor says, mama says, your next-door neighbor says, your homie says, your brother says, your boss says (that homosexuality is wrong),"" The Wrap reported Daniels saying during the Television Critics Association press tour in January. ""And they are killing African-American women. They are killing our women. So I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community."" The music is off the hook . The show has managed to improve on what ""Glee"" did and succeed at what the now-canceled NBC drama ""Smash"" tried to do: fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry. Smollett has been the breakout star in this area. His mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack's more popular tunes, including the anthem to individuality, ""Good Enough,"" which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service Spotify. Superproducer Timbaland (best known for work with artists including Jay Z and Justin Timberlake) and his protegee Jim Beanz are responsible for the show's sound. Beanz told Rolling Stone the music has to be authentic and original. ""One of the things that Tim told me is, 'If it sounds like something you've heard before, don't do it,' "" he said. Of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on iTunes. Fingers crossed for a possible ""Empire"" tour featuring Smollett and other co-stars including Bryshere Y. Gray, who portrays youngest Lyon son Hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker Yazz the Greatest. The awesome guest appearances . You could have knocked us over with a feather when Courtney Love popped up on the show. Love had a bit role on this first season, as has supermodel Naomi Campbell and '80s actor Judd Nelson. The series has been hyping appearances from music stars like Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige and Patti LaBelle. Given the popularity of the show, there's no telling who will pop up on season 2. Henson and Howard . The love/hate relationship between Cookie and Lucious Lyon is everything. They have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite. Chalk it up to the longtime friendship between Henson and Howard, who also co-starred in the film ""Hustle and Flow."" Howard told BlackTree TV that he and Henson had to do a ""chemistry read"" to show that they clicked. The end result has been magical. ""We have so much fun,"" Howard said.","""Empire"" has seen its ratings grow every week .
Taraji P. Henson's character is a favorite .

"(CNN)Christopher Nowak says none of his friends were surprised when he and his wife decided to use a down payment for a home on a monorail car instead. After all, this was no ordinary monorail car, and Nowak is not your average collector. This was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout Walt Disney World in the 1970s and 1980s. The original Mark IV monorail trains were retired in 1989 to make room for a new generation of models, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Nowak and his wife are Disney fanatics who honeymooned at Disney World and once visited all the Disney parks in the world (minus Paris) in a month. He's also a self-described artist, inventor and collector of ""weird old vehicles,"" including an articulated bus he claims to have transformed into a mobile nightclub. The couple from Chico, California, purchased the cab in 2014, dreaming of the day they might use it to drive their kids to school or bring it to the annual Burning Man festival (Nowak declined to say what he paid for the rail car.) But plans change. Nowak listed the item last week on eBay for $260,000 with a starting bid of $169,000. More than 1,500 people were watching the auction as of Saturday night, though no one had bid. The listing itself was pulled from eBay on Sunday. Nowak, who owns a sound and lighting custom stage design company, had told CNN he and his wife needed the money to fund their next big project, but he declined to provide details. ""My wife and I had plans for it, but we're kind of strapped for cash, so we figured, let's put it out and see what happens."" The listing provided some insight into what Nowak might have had in mind for the cab. ""Some people have train cars in their back yard, imagine your own monorail guest room, or man cave. Mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around!! Turn it into your kids' ultimate clubhouse,"" the description on the eBay page read. ""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a very serious piece of Disney history."" The listing said the vehicle is available for viewing in Tampa, where Nowak left it with a friend after buying it from a seller in Georgia via eBay last year. CNN could not independently confirm its authenticity. Nowak says he did not receive a title or certificate of authenticity when he purchased the cab but he is confident that it's the real deal. ""I guess there's chance it could be a reproduction, but I'm not too worried,"" he said. The listing promised free shipping, but Nowak is not sure that he's ready to part with the item. ""I'm sure I'd have salty taste in my mouth if it gets sold, but we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""If this thing gets sold, I know that in 20 years, I'll look back and think that of all the things I got rid of, this is the coolest.""","The listing has been removed from eBay .

"(CNN)Madonna, saying something controversial? Perish the thought. The object of her scorn fighting back? Of course. The mayor of Rochester, Michigan, has written an open letter to the venerable pop star, taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school. ""I can't be around basic, provincial-thinking people,"" she told Howard Stern last week on his SiriusXM satellite radio program. You could almost hear the steam coming out of Mayor Bryan Barnett's ears. ""It's like someone calling one of your kids ugly,"" the Detroit Free Press quoted Barnett as saying. ""You're not going to let that go by without a response."" In his letter, published Monday in the Free Press, Barnett said the city's recent achievements are anything but provincial. ""Our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two Blue Ribbon Schools, the most in Michigan. Our Universities are among the fastest growing in the Midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity,"" he wrote. Buying Madonna's house: A tale of fame and misfortune . ""We design and build more robots than any other city in North America, and Rochester Hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents, nearly one a day, over the last three years. Not a typical achievement you would associate with 'simple or basic' people,"" he wrote. He also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by Money magazine. ""We are many things, Madonna, but basic and provincial minded we are not!"" Barnett wrote. ""I invite you back to Rochester Hills to see who we are and what we believe in. While we certainly don't need your stamp of approval, I am quite confident we would earn it."" Not surprisingly, some Rochester Hills citizens weren't thrilled with Madonna's comments. ""Makes me proud to live in Rochester Hills after reading this letter to Madonna by @MayorBarnett,"" Twitter user LoganBrown97 wrote. And although Madonna hasn't responded to the fracas, she of course found some defenders on social media. ""Why is everyone mad Madonna said Rochester was basic?"" Twitter user itsleah wrote. ""It IS basic. I thought that was the appeal? Small towns AREN'T for everyone, dummies."" Of course, Madonna is no stranger to controversy, and she's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than Rochester City Hall. Remember the 1980s, when her ""Like a Prayer"" video angered the Catholic church? Or the 1990s, when it seemed a camera couldn't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation? Then there was last year, when she had to backtrack after posting an Instagram photo of her son boxing, captioned with a take on the N-word. And in January, some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album. Heck, this isn't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up. In a 1987 interview with Jane Pauley, she called Bay City, Michigan, where she was born, a ""little smelly town in northern Michigan."" A few moments later, Madonna followed up by saying she had ""great affection"" for the place. So far, no such love for Rochester Hills. Nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor's invite to return to her hometown for a visit.","Madonna angers the Rochester Hills, Michigan, mayor by criticizing the town .

"Leicester, England (CNN)""God save King Richard!"" A cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of Richard III is carried away from the tower block-filled campus of the University of Leicester for the final time. The medieval monarch's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in August 2012. But on Sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became, once more, the mortal remains of a king. Some 35,000 people lined the streets of Leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of Richard's final battle, Bosworth, where he died in 1485, before returning to the city for a commemoration at Leicester Cathedral. The day began on the freshly-mown lawns in front of the university's Fielding Johnson Building, where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell, dignitaries dressed in their Sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a March shower. Leicester University student Anna Boyer, from North Carolina, said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony ""so I can say I was here,"" adding: ""It's an important historical event -- we don't have things like this in the States."" Leicester alumni Sara and Leeroy Paskell brought their daughters Saoirse, 6, and Orlaith, 9, to watch the cortege pass by. ""We thought it would be nice for the children to see it,"" said Sara Paskell. ""It is amazing to be part of history, it makes me really proud of the university and of Leicester."" That pride is something which those who helped in the search for Richard III share. Leicester University's president and vice-chancellor Paul Boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a ""defining moment"" which ""reshaped history,"" and pointed out that the university had been custodian of Richard III's remains for longer than he ruled England. Genetics expert Turi King, who proved the identity of the bones by matching their DNA to a living relative of the monarch, Michael Ibsen, said: ""It has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved."" King, who read Robert Frost's poem ""The Road Not Taken"" at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of Richard's heritage as a member of the House of York -- on the coffin, said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story, but not the end of the story itself; she is still working to sequence his entire genome. Michael Ibsen and another living relative of Richard III, Wendy Duldig, were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey-brown bricks of the Fielding Johnson Building; accompanied by archaeologist Richard Buckley, who led the dig which uncovered the King's bones, they walked silently behind as the cortege's journey began. Thousands of people lined the route of the procession, out through the Leicestershire villages visited by Richard III on his way to the Battle of Bosworth. Perched on fold-up picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges, along pavements decorated with bunting, flags and paper chains of white Yorkist roses, and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by. At Fenn Lane Farm, thought to be the closest location to the spot where Richard III died, earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol, a boar. The casket, and the procession, then made their way to Bosworth, where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor. Here, Richard's role as a ""warrior king"" was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him. A beacon, which will burn until he is laid to rest on Thursday, was lit on the battlefield. Back in Leicester, thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby Jubilee Square. Waiting to go in to the service, Judy Ellis, from the nearby town of Hinckley, said there was a ""real buzz"" around the city. ""It's quite exciting, coming over on the train I met people who'd come from all over the world to be in Leicester today."" Ellis, who named her son Richard, said she had used the parking lot where the king's remains were found. ""Four days before the dig started I parked my car over that grave!"" she said. Adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for Richard's return. In 1485, the defeated king's body was treated with little sense of occasion. It is said to have been slung naked over a horse and taken to Leicester, where it was put on display for three days before being hurriedly crammed into a too-small plot in the Grey Friars Church. More than five centuries on, those who sparked the search for Richard III's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell. Philippa Langley, who led the ""Looking for Richard"" project, said its aim was ""to give Richard what he didn't get in 1485 ... to recognize what went on in the past, but not repeat it, to make peace with the past."" To that end, the king's skeleton is to be given two things it did not have before: a coffin and proper burial rites. The coffin is a simple affair: English oak and yew, made by Richard's relative Michael Ibsen who, as chance would have it, is a cabinet maker by trade; it is carved with the king's name and a white rose. The burial rites are somewhat more complicated: they have entailed the rebuilding of parts of Leicester's cathedral, a guest list numbering into the thousands and delicate questions of location and religion. But with those puzzles overcome, the first of several high profile pre-reinterment services was held Sunday evening: The coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage, accompanied by two ""knights"" in full suits of armor, riding on horseback, to the cathedral. Those who had gathered to pay tribute to Richard III threw roses into the procession's path as it passed the new visitor center which has been built over his original resting place. As the city's church bells tolled and dusk began to fall, the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral, accompanied by four official ""mourners"" -- descendants of some of those who fought with Richard at Bosworth. Once inside, it was covered with a heavily-embroidered cloth, and a Bible and specially-commissioned crown were laid atop the casket, the latter by a local Brownie, 9-year-old Emma Chamberlain, whose height meant a step had to be placed next to the coffin to allow her to reach it. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols alluded to Richard III's controversial reputation and ""tumultuous life,"" which had seen moments of ""astonishing brutality."" Nichols said the king's short reign was ""marked by unrest and the fatal seepage of loyalty and support"" but insisted that he was also ""a man of prayer, a man of anxious devotion"" and one who had done good for his people. As those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening, one final illuminated tribute was paid: the initials RIII and a crown were projected onto the cathedral's tower, while nearby, white roses surrounded a statue of the king. As she left the service, Victoria McKeown, who won a ticket to the event, said the experience had been ""brilliant"" and the memorial ""absolutely lovely."" ""It's a lovely way to spend a Sunday evening -- not like being at home doing the ironing,"" she told CNN. ""It's part of history: I can say 'I've been to a king's funeral.'""","Richard III will finally be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral this week .

"Washington (CNN) A huge Obama foreign policy decision, a big immigration question and interesting steps related to Hillary Clinton, John Boehner and Marco Rubio filled an informative Sunday loop around the 'Inside Politics' table. There's nothing like a signature hire to quiet those who think you might blink and skip the fight. At issue is Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who remains a single-digit blip in Republican polls. So weak have his early poll showings been that many GOPers to this day say they would not be shocked if he decided not to move from exploratory candidate to official candidate. But a new hire sends a signal. Veteran South Carolina GOP strategist J. Warren Tompkins is signing on to run a pro-Rubio super PAC. That same PAC is in line for seed money from Florida billionaire Norman Braman. Tompkins is a protege of the late GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell and legendary South Carolina strategist Lee Atwater. His hiring is seen as a signal in GOP circles that Rubio is close to launching. For those of us who lived through the Clinton White House years, and especially the Monica Lewinsky scandal, it was interesting to say the least listening to Hillary Clinton a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with Newt Gingrich. And the former House speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast. But don't break into ""Kumbaya"" or order the marshmallows. ""He said, if she becomes president, she'll be a hard worker; she'll be pretty practical,"" said Kucinich. ""However, he doesn't think she's going to get there because of what's happening with the Clinton Global Foundation and because of the foreign money.  He's testifying to the Homeland Security Committee next week and he says he's going to bring up the problem of foreign money in American politics. "" It's been a rough start for the Republican Congress and House Speaker John Boehner. But Boehner sees a chance to get two big-ticket items on their way to passage, and through those debates to get the House back on a more productive track. Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared his reporting on the speaker's calculations -- including one health care bill where he struck up an alliance with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""There's two pieces of legislation to really keep an eye on that he wants to muscle through,"" said Costa. ""One is the Republican budget: He wants to just get it through the House, get a compromise with the Senate.  And the next is the Doc Fix bill, which is how Medicare reimbursements are done for doctors. Boehner wants to solve that long-term and it looks like he is going to have the votes to get it done."" President Obama meets with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani this week, and is open to slowing the withdrawal of U.S. forces.  A big change, but with a bigger goal in mind. Julie Pace of The Associated Press shared inside reporting on the administration's willingness to leave up to 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan for the time being. ""There's one big reason why the President is going to have some flexibility in the drawdown, and that's because he's very focused on one specific aspect of this plan, and that is pulling out all U.S. troops by the end of 2016,"" said Pace. ""That would allow him to make the case at the end of his presidency that he had fulfilled his promise to end the war in Afghanistan."" The always intense political debate over immigration policy heated up last spring during a dramatic surge in the number of young children illegally crossing into the United States. The surge undermined what was already a long shot chance of congressional consensus on immigration reform. NPR's Steve Inskeep reports that both policymakers and political strategists are watching to see if there is a similar seasonal surge this year. ""Now we're getting back into the spring season, when it's a little bit easier to travel, and we'll see if the numbers go up again,"" said Inskeep.  ""If they do, of course, we're going to have another series of news stories about a really sensitive issue that's been very difficult for either party to solve.""","A signal that Marco Rubio is close to jumping in .

""I'll be honest with you,"" Ferguson told James on Monday night. ""I think you know that we should probably get rid of the n-word, but in reality, I think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they don't stop using the word."" The two were part of a panel discussion about who can say the n-word. The panel also included CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill. ""I'm making money off of doing music and being creative, sir,"" James responded. ""I'm not making money just because I use the n-word. Nobody goes to buy an album because it's full of the n-word."" To which Ferguson responded: ""Trinidad, you wouldn't be on this show tonight if it wasn't for using the n-word in your rap music. Let's be honest."" Trinidad James is the rapper whose hit song, ""All Gold Everything,"" is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- was caught on a Vine video repeating the n-word seven times on camera.

In a previous interview with CNN, James said he was willing to give the house mom a pass -- though he said he didn't condone her use of the word. But when Ferguson said Monday the rapper was only on the show for his use of the word, the third panelist -- Hill -- quickly jumped in.

"(CNN)As the seventh full week of testimony in the first-degree murder trial against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez came to a close this week, witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing. Hernandez is on trial in Fall River, Massachusetts, in connection with the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. The former tight end had signed a five-year contract extension worth $40 million but, less than a year later, Hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancée. Hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team. Two of Hernandez's closest associates are co-defendants in the case. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. He is accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, allegedly over a spilled drink. Two witnesses who saw Hernandez at the Boston nightclub Rumor just 48 hours before Lloyd's killing said he looked angry and aggressive. Lloyd was with Hernandez at the club that Friday night. On Thursday, prosecutors called witness No. 100: Kasey Arma, a nightclub promoter. She told jurors she danced with Aaron Hernandez at the club in the early morning of June 15, 2013. Hernandez approached her. ""He walked by me and he tapped my hip."" Arma testified that she danced with Hernandez for about 10 minutes. ""He was pleasant and kind of charming,"" she said. Then he left abruptly. When he returned about 10 minutes later, Arma said, Hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club. His demeanor changed. He was ""very aggressive,"" she testified. Then, she said, he asked her ""to show what I could do with that thing,"" referring to her backside. ""He was irritated and very aggressive,"" she told the jury. During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee showed surveillance video of Arma dancing with Hernandez. There was bumping and grinding, mostly with her backside to him. It was uncomfortable to watch in court. Jurors watched the video with laser focus. Fee asked Arma, ""What kind of dance is that called?"" Arma said she didn't know. Some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly. Earlier in the week, witness Kwami Nicholas testified that he also saw Hernandez at Rumor and the ex-player ""seemed like he was angry about something."" Hernandez's mouth looked like a ""grunt,"" he said. Nicholas, a college student, was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with Lloyd. When Lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends, Hernandez looked angry, according to Nicholas. Hernandez was standing near the DJ at the time, about 15 feet away from Lloyd and his friend. Nicholas said Hernandez glared at them for a few minutes. During tough questioning from Fee, Nicholas stood his ground. The defense showed jurors Nicholas' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of Hernandez. Nicholas also remembered Hernandez ""storming out of the club."" ""He looked angry,"" Nicholas told the jury. As Hernandez walked down the street, ""he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me."" Prosecutors played surveillance video backing up Nicholas' description. During that video, Lloyd is also seen following Hernandez at a distance. Though prosecutors are trying to establish that Hernandez was angry, jurors still don't know why. Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his baby daughter, was not in court to see the dirty-dancing video. She hasn't been seen in court since March 6. But Jenkins' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from Hernandez's house in November 2014. Jurors were not present for that debate. The prosecution showed before-and-after photos of a closet in Hernandez's home in North Attleboro. One photo from June 2013 showed the sneakers Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was killed. It also showed the shoes Hernandez associate Carlos Ortiz wore the same night. The two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes. In the second photo, taken in November 2014, the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones Hernandez and Ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting. They were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house. Prosecutors wanted to link Jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes. McCauley referred to the defendant's jailhouse comments that ""she does what I want,"" referring to Jenkins. McCauley also told the judge that Hernandez ""was directing her (Jenkins) to give money to Tanya Singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk."" He added, ""We know she didn't talk and then was held in contempt."" Tanya Singleton is Hernandez's cousin. Court observers wonder when Jenkins will be back. The last time Jenkins was in court, a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring. However, Jenkins is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial. Will testimony about Hernandez's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about Jenkins -- affect her testimony? Does her absence mean she'll turn on her fiance? The answers may be a few weeks away. There are indications the Commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-April, . Much testimony focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot. A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows in a size 13. About 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made, significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression, according to Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police. The consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes-- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . Yet Bennett, who works in crime scene services, testified that the footwear impression left near Lloyd's body was ""in agreement"" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13. Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night, he an identical pair to make his determination.  Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression. What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan. Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions, and he introduced a March 2014 report from Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison. Sultan hammered Bennett on that report. Bennett admitted that his reexamination helped the prosecution. McCauley was able to undo some of the damage, allowing Bennett to explain that it was only after gaining access to Air Jordan Retro 11s  in December 2014 that he was able to make a comparison. He testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole. It's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in November 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by Hernandez, Ortiz and Ernest Wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of Lloyd's death, despite having a photo of them from June 2013. Seventeen months into the investigation, they searched Hernandez's house again. None of the shoes were found. The prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along John Dietsch Boulevard where Lloyd's body was found. With these witnesses and collected surveillance videos, prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say Hernandez drove to the Corliss Landing crime scene. While the car's make and model aren't distinguishable in the video, jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz and Lloyd would have been in the car. Tanya Singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and Wallace to Georgia in the days after Lloyd's death. Testifying for the prosecution, Euna Ritchon said Singleton asked her on June 21, 2013, to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in Georgia. She brought Wallace with her. At the time, Singleton was married to Ritchon's nephew, TL Singleton. He died in a car crash a little more than a week later. Ritchon also testified that Wallace suggested using back roads to drive out of Connecticut and through New York to avoid tolls. She said Wallace carried his clothes in a black trash bag. Prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag Shayanna Jenkins removed from her house just a few days earlier. Prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill Lloyd. After spending the night at the home of Ritchon's daughter, Wallace boarded a bus to Florida. That's where he surrendered to police. Wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in Lloyd's death.","Aaron Hernandez on trial for the 2013 death of Odin Lloyd .

"Coral Gables, Florida (CNN)Former President Bill Clinton on Saturday defended his family foundation's practice of taking money from foreign countries, arguing that while he doesn't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed, he feels the foundation has ""done a lot more good than harm."" The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. Bill Clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects. ""The UAE [United Arab Emirates] gave us money. Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they are helping us fight ISIS and they built a great university with NYU open to people around the world,"" Clinton said at a foundation event in Florida. ""Do I agree with all the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia? No."" Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton continued: ""You've got to decide when you do this work, whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country. ... I believe we have done a lot more good than harm."" The story became a controversy for the Clintons, one where even some Democrats questioned the practice. Hillary Clinton is the party's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month. Republicans jumped on board the story, too, using it to question the Clintons' ethics and whether, as president, she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation. Democrats that did publicly defend the Clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website. On Saturday, Clinton did the same. ""My theory about all this is disclose everything. And then let people make their judgments,"" Clinton said. ""I'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions."" Clinton concluded his defense of the foundation, stating that he thinks organizations should ""bring people together across great divides, around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better."" The Clinton Foundation was founded by Bill Clinton after he left the presidency in 2001. To date, the foundation has raised over $2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects, including health and wellness, economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls. Many of their projects focus on international issues, such as rebuilding Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and providing access to low-cost HIV and AIDS treatment. Those were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries. The former president's comments were the only moment any Clinton mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy. Neither Hillary or Chelsea Clinton mentioned the issue. At no point Saturday did any of the Clintons address the fact that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as America's top diplomat, a practice that skirted legal standards in place. The former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage Saturday and didn't mention question about her email, instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation. That didn't bother the over 1,000 overachieving millennials at the Clinton Global Initiative University meeting who couldn't have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the Clintons the last few weeks. Saturday's event is the university-focused branch of the Clinton Foundation. It brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding. This year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things, from increasing women's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog. In total, the foundation will hand out $900,000 to the different students. The general sense among the event attendees was: ""What controversies?"" ""I am here for me. I am here for learning, exploring, meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change,"" said Armel Arnaud Nibasumba, a Middlebury College student born and raised in Burundi. ""I don't really care if they address those political issues that are going on."" A few students, including Victoria Arild from Menlo College, said they hadn't heard of the controversies. ""I am here because my college, I had the privilege of them funding me,"" she said, before shrugging off questions about the email issues.","Clinton Foundation has taken money from foreign governments .

"(CNN)It was a ding, just a ""minor concussion,"" that got Chris Borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an NFL player. Borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in August when he got his ""bell rung,"" he told ESPN's ""Outside The Lines."" What did he do? He kept playing that day, and through an excellent rookie season. But the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him. He talked to his teammates and family, read about concussions and their effects, each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week. At age 24, not even yet in his prime as an NFL player, Borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. ""I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,"" he told ESPN. ""From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk. ... I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late."" It was after that self-described ""minor concussion"" in the preseason that Borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players. In the end he didn't want to leave his teammates in a bind, but, ""I know this is right for me."" He said teammates' reactions to his retirement were mixed. One of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money. Borland, a third-round pick from Wisconsin, had signed a nearly $3 million contract for four seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and banked a $600,000 bonus. The guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler, ""That's a lot of money. Why don't you get your money and get out,"" Borland recounted to ESPN. The thought made him uncomfortable because he doesn't want to do anything just for a big paycheck. He didn't want to be wrong when it comes to this: ""Who knows how many hits are too many?"" Borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him. He's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete. Reports show an increasing number of retired NFL players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. ""For me, it's wanting to be proactive,"" Borland said. ""I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late. There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that 'X' will happen. ""I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise."" Passionate reactions to his decision came quickly, with many supporting him. Others say that while the move might be smart for Borland, and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health, there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him. Borland told ESPN that he wasn't saying no one should play football. He said youth players and their parents should do things: 1) Get informed about concussions and 2) Never let anyone play . Last August, thousands of former NFL players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the NFL to cover the cost of concussion-related compensation, medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families. The suit alleged that the NFL deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions.  In July 2014, a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement. Chris Dronett was one of the plaintiffs. Her husband, former Denver Bronco Shane Dronett, committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38. After his death, scientists found evidence of CTE in his brain. Borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the NFL. ""I've thought about what I could accomplish in football, but for me personally, when you read about Mike Webster and Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling, you read all these stories. And to be the type of player I want to be in football, I think I'd have to take on some risks that as a person I don't want to take on,"" he said. Webster had a career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. He was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After he retired, he was diagnosed with amnesia, dementia, depression, and bone and muscle pain. He was 50 when he died. Duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. He had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to Boston University School of Medicine, which was researching CTE. BU neurologists confirmed the NFL veteran had the disease. Easterling, who played eight seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, committed suicide in 2012. He apparently suffered dementia. An autopsy revealed he had CTE. Some on social media said Borland's decision made them think about former NFL linebacker Junior Seau. He was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. Friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide, but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage. Portions of Seau's brain were sent to the National Institutes of Health, which found ""abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form"" of CTE. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer. The NFL has reported that in 2013, 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games. At least 261 were diagnosed the previous year, the league said. In its statement about Borland's retirement, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety, said: ""We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision. By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players."" Miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety. Complaints keep coming. In July of last year, ex-NFL players Christian Ballard and Gregory Westbrooks filed suit against the NFL Players Association, alleging the union withheld information about head injuries.

"(CNN)A  Los Angeles police officer charged with murder in the shooting death of a local truck driver had his father's help in fleeing California and traveling to Texas, court documents filed Thursday said. Henry Solis, a Los Angeles Police Department rookie, is accused of killing 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. early in the morning of March 13 in Pomona. Solis disappeared shortly after the shooting. Items left by Solis at the crime scene allowed Pomona police detectives to identify him ""as the individual responsible for killing Rodriguez,"" according to an affidavit signed Thursday by FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola. The document goes on to say that Solis made ""incriminating statements about his role in the murder"" to friends, family members and others, and said he would never be seen again. The affidavit says his father, Victor Solis, quickly left his home in Lancaster after receiving a call from him. The elder Solis was seen a day later in El Paso, Texas, at the home of family members. He told FBI agents he drove his son to El Paso, dropped him off at a bus station and doesn't know where he is. Federal authorities haven't said if Victor Solis would face charges for helping his son leave California.

"(CNN)""Wait up 2015 CNN Fit Nation Team and Dr. Sanjay Gupta-- you want me to climb up Stone Mountain -- that is over 1,500 feet straight up. Are you nuts?"" I screamed. Yes. This is actually what I signed up for when I uploaded my video to the CNN Fit  Nation website in December. ""But climbing mountains on Sunday morning -- you got to be kidding me,"" I exclaimed. But it was all part of the process I realized I was going to take on as I learn how to be a triathlete. After our first initial week with a trainer and nutritionist, the six of us were introduced to a whole new way of how to approach fitness and how to incorporate it into our lives. I knew it was going to be a difficult task, especially for someone like me heavily involved in civic affairs and community service. At Lifetime Fitness, our nutritionist walked us through a number of exercises on how we should look at food, nutrition and our calorie intake. After being on several diets over my lifetime, what he said was simple. To look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training. Tackling nutrition and calorie intake can also be exactly how I viewed the climb up Stone Mountain. I put these nutritional issues on the backburner for years. It was pretty much like looking at the mountain that I was about to climb that morning -- where do I start, where do I begin? -- and telling myself that it was going to be an arduous task. My training schedule has also been an uphill battle. In January and the first weeks of February, I started strong with my gym, running and swim workouts. However, as life pressures got in the way, I saw myself withering off. But luckily I have been inspired by my 2015 CNN Fit Nation teammates to keep me on track. Their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles I face in my training activities. As I get older, I realize that fitness and nutrition are key to long-term health; however, the support of friends and family is also important to help tackle your health. My team members of the CNN Fit Nation have been there for me. I recently weighed myself when I visited the doctor's office. It has been six weeks since I hit the scale. I actually lost 20 pounds. What! Really! Uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them. But you keep moving. Just like that Sunday afternoon in January, I could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from Stone Mountain with the members of 2015 CNN Fit Nation. And guess what? After all this huffing and puffing over the last six weeks, I can't wait to see the view in September at the Malibu triathlon. It's just another uphill mountain to climb.","George ""Chip"" Greenidge Jr. says training schedule has been an uphill battle .

"(CNN)I was in Florida last year when I got a call asking me to pose for a calendar. What? A calendar? As in Sports Illustrated swimsuit? Victoria's Secret angels? Cover girls. Pinups. Movie stars. Glam. I agreed, and now I am Ms. December. But it isn't quite what you think. The caller on the other end that day was Patti Tripathi. She was an anchor at CNN Headline News at a time when there were few Indian-American women in high-profile media jobs. Tripathi has her own media company now, but more recently she launched a nonprofit called Saris to Suits. She was asking me to help. She began by telling me her story. She was 12 when her family immigrated to the United States. Indian parents often have to save  a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter. Tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left. We spoke about similar experiences as Indian teenagers in America. She was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts, except to play tennis. She had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college. Tripathi felt like a burden. She did everything she could to stand on her own. And she did. My father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become ""Americanized."" I, too, longed to be independent, far more so than was expected of a Bengali girl in the 1970s. At an all-girls convent school in Kolkata, I used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom. On every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders, most of them Indian. Hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede-like dash up the stairwell. It was impossible to stop but I always looked up when I arrived at Indira Gandhi. There she was, in her trademark white sari and what I thought was a Cruella de Vil slice in her hair. In a nation that valued boys more than girls, I was in awe that we had a female prime minister. Gandhi's political career turned out to be less than stellar, but it was 1971 and I was not yet 9 years old. I wanted to grow up to be just like her. Regal. Smart. And most of all, in control of my destiny. I know so many other Indian girls felt the same. We had dreams. Big dreams. We wanted to be someone, do something rewarding with our lives. Yet for so many girls in India, dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios. They are denied education and married off within months of their first period. I have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men. Those problems are not limited to India or the rest of South Asia. They exist in the immigrant communities in the United States, in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists. Women are often ashamed to talk about these things. As an Indian-American journalist, I have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many South Asian women. I have mentored girls in my hometown of Kolkata. And always wondered: What else can I do? Some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life. As a newborn, I was left on the steps of an orphanage in north Kolkata. It happened to be run by an American missionary, Helen Benedict, who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the Indo-American Society. My mother was honing her English speaking skills there. That was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage. It's not hard to guess the rest of the story. Instead of growing up in harsh surroundings, I was raised in a professor's house. And, instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness, I faced one that was bright. I had loving parents, attended good schools and traveled around the world. There is not a day that goes by when I don't think about the life I might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an American missionary and a Bengali woman pining to become a mother. I shared my story with Tripathi and told her I would help. Tripathi put together Saris to Suits as an empowerment tool. She wanted to raise money to help South Asian women. She also wanted to inspire them, she said. They needed strong role models. They needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them. She was putting together the 2015 Saris to Suits calendar and wanted to feature South Asian women who had found success in America. They were doctors, lawyers, corporate leaders. One was a weightlifter from Pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her Muslim attire. Another was Miss America 2014. I felt honored to be in such fine company. I would be the only journalist in the calendar. It would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend I was a glamour girl. Some of the women opted to wear saris, the traditional dress of India. Some wore salwar kameez, a long tunic and pants. And some of us were in suits or our work attire. The 2014 calendar, the first one Tripathi published, raised money for various organizations that help South Asian women. One of them was Raksha (which means protection). Based in Atlanta, Raksha provides support for the South Asian community in a number of ways. Most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages, divorce and issues with their children. Raksha's executive director, Aparna Bhattacharyya, told me why the calendar was important. ""I think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves,"" she said. ""I think it is powerful for young South Asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams."" Her words took me back to my school in Kolkata where I gazed upward at Indira Gandhi's face. In it, I found strength. I am of course, a far cry from the likes of Gandhi, but perhaps I can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future. Maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life. Besides, it's kind of cool to be in a calendar.","CNN's Moni Basu shares her story of struggle and success as a South Asian woman .

"(CNN)Debra Milke spent 22 years on death row, convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout. On Monday, a judge ruled that the Arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her. This makes Milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the United States. More importantly, the judge's decision finally clears Milke after years of legal back-and-forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence. Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, Armando Saldate, who said Milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording. Prosecutors withheld from the jury Saldate's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases, including lying under oath. The two men with whom Milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall on December 1, 1989, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. Milke's roomate, James Styers, took the boy; then called Milke saying Christopher had disappeared. Instead, Styers and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head, prosecutors said. Styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from Styer's friend, Roger Scott. The detective, Saldate, said Scott told him that Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son. And during her trial, prosecutors floated a likely motive: A $5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child. But neither Scott nor Styers testified to a plot in court. No other witnesses or direct evidence linked Milke to the crime other than Saldate's testimony. Saldate further said that Milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a ""bad judgment call."" There was no recording of the interrogation, no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror, and Saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report. Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role. The trial became a he-said/she-said contest between the two. Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted Milke of murder. What prosecutors didn't tell the court was the detective's long history of lying under oath and misconduct. Saldate had been suspended five days for taking ""liberties"" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors. Four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because Saldate had lied under oath. Judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because Saldate had violated a person's constitutional rights. In 2013, after more than 20 years in jail, an appeals court overturned Milke's conviction. ""The Constitution requires a fair trial,"" Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. ""This never happened in Milke's case."" ""The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents,"" Kozinski said. ""... There can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation."" Milke was released on bail, and the court said she couldn't be tried again. The state appealed the decision to the Arizona Supreme Court. Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. And on Monday, all charges against Milke were finally dropped. The ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed. And Milke left the court room, sobbing in relief. The case is now closed. Debra Milke is finally a free woman.","Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death, given the death penalty .

"(CNN)Organized labor is up in arms about President Barack Obama's effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific that involves 11 nations. The agreement, union leaders argue, threatens to take even more jobs away from Americans. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka sent a clear message to members of Congress, warning, ""There is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact, and then we will not forget this vote for a long time."" The AFL-CIO announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up. The tension between organized labor and Obama is not new. The struggles have been going on since 2009 when the President allowed the Employee Free Choice Act to wither in Congress. The act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions. The President avoided making any strong appeals for the bill, though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid. ""There is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials,"" one labor leader said, ""broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda."" Even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions. Organized labor has not been that surprised. The truth is that unions have been on the defense against Democratic presidents for decades. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. ""It will cost jobs,"" warned Michigan Democrat David Bonior said of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton endorsed. ""It will drive down our standard of living. If we don't stand up for the working people in this country, who is going to?"" In the past few decades, many Democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party, as they had been during the creation of the New Deal and Great Society. As organized labor became a smaller part of the American workforce, Democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote. A larger number of Democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence. These voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues, such as environmental regulation, than they are with middle class jobs. Many Democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets. New voices that came into the Democratic Party after the 1960s wanted to challenge Republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy. The opportunities for Democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives. The Koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren't in unions. Unions are under assault, and the movement is looking for help. Democrats, and some Republicans, often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality. Much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. Without strong unions, the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started. As George Gresham, the president of United Health Care Workers East wrote in The New York Times, ""By defunding unions and weakening union members via 'right to work' laws, corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers' primary means of raising wages, securing pensions and improving workers conditions. Workers' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized."" Democrats need to listen to what the AFL-CIO is saying. They need to push back against President Obama, even if this creates political opportunities for Republicans, so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda. As Democrats continually watch Republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit, they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the White House and Congress in the coming years.","President Obama wants to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific .

"(CNN)Opening statements in the murder trial of movie theater massacre suspect James Holmes are scheduled for April 27, more than a month ahead of schedule, a Colorado court spokesman said. Holmes, 27, is charged as the sole gunman who stormed a crowded movie theater at a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in July 2012. When the trial began in January, some 9,000 potential jurors were summoned, and jury selection was expected then to continue until May or June, when the trial would finally start. The jury selection process, however, appears to be moving faster than expected, according to court spokesman Rob McCallum. In January, Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. told the first pool of potential jurors that if chosen for the jury, they cannot read, watch or hear anything about the case. ""This will require great effort on your part,"" the judge said three times. Holmes, a one-time neuroscience doctoral student, faces 166 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. Prosecutors have charged in court that Holmes ""intended to kill them all,"" referring to patrons in the crowded cinema watching the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Holmes colored his hair a comic-book red and told police he was ""The Joker"" upon arrest after the mass killing. Holmes was heavily armed and ""dressed head-to-toe in protective gear,"" authorities said. He wore black contact lenses to conceal his eyes. His AR-15 jammed during the shooting, police said, and they arrested him in the parking lot. The trial itself could last four months. If there's a conviction, the death penalty phase could last another month, which means court proceedings could last until fall.

The two people fell about 70 feet (21 meters) Saturday when part of the Arch Rock overlook at Point Reyes National Seashore gave way. The day before the collapse, the Point Reyes National Seashore had posted a photo on Facebook of a fissure in the rock structure -- with a warning to use caution. ""Visitors using Bear Valley Trail to Arch Rock -- watch out! At the very end of the trail, the cliff is breaking away -- seen here in a photo taken Wednesday,"" the government organization said. The NPS said hazardous conditions had been reported to it on March 19.

""We didn't know what could happen and what unfortunately did happen is on Saturday afternoon a large portion of that overlook actually collapsed down onto the beach and partly onto the ocean,"" he said. ""The tragedy is that there were two people that were standing out there who fell with all of that rubble."" On Monday, the Marin County Sheriff's Office named the deceased as 58-year-old Nancy Blum, from California.

"(CNN)Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore, died early Monday morning, according to a statement released by the office of Singapore's current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. He was 91. Lee passed away peacefully at Singapore General Hospital at 3:18 a.m., the statement said. He had been in the hospital with pneumonia since February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. ""The first of our founding fathers is no more,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee's son,  told the nation in a televised speech Monday. ""He fought for our independence, built a nation where there was none and made us proud to be Singaporeans,"" Lee said. Building up Singapore was his passion, the Prime Minister said, reading out a quote from his father:  ""At the end of the day what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life."" Lee's body will lie in state at Parliament House from Wednesday through Saturday.  A state funeral will be held Sunday. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a condolence statement and said Lee ""helped Singapore to transition from a developing country to one of the most developed in the world, transforming it into a thriving international business hub."" President Obama called Lee a visionary who helped him formulate U.S. policy of ""rebalancing to the Asia Pacific,"" when the two met in Singapore in 2009. ""He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs,"" the President said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also praised the advice he got from Lee, calling it ""the most valuable and insightful I have received."" ""He was, of course, a uniquely astute analyst and observer of Asia, and it is largely through his life's work that Singapore became one of the United States' strongest strategic partners in the region,"" Kerry said. Former President George H. W. Bush said he respected Lee's effective leadership of a ""wonderful, resilient and innovative country in ways that lifted living standards without indulging a culture of corruption."" He added, "" Because of the example set by Lee Kuan Yew's singular leadership, I am confident that the future will be bright for Singapore."" China's foreign ministry called Lee ""a uniquely influential Asian statesman,"" and Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said ""our region owes much to Lee Kuan Yew."" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesia's foreign ministry also praised Lee's leadership in their condolence notices.

"(CNN)Budi, an adorable baby orangutan, is on the road to recovery after an animal shelter in Indonesia rescued him. The 15-month-old was on the brink of death after he was kept in a chicken cage and fed nothing but condensed milk for the first year of his life. He had been kept as a pet in Ketapang, Indonesia, his caretakers said. Now Budi is well enough to eat on his own, walk and climb. ""After weeks of physiotherapy, medical treatment and a nutritious diet, Budi's muscles are developing well,"" said United Kingdom-based International Animal Rescue. But Budi's development remains slow due to the extreme malnutrition, his caretakers said. Budi was in quarantine for awhile, they said, but has been introduced to another infant orangutan, Jemmi, rescued by another shelter. Neither orangutan had met another animal of its kind since being taken from their mothers just after birth, and they eyed each other with curiosity. When Budi arrived at International Animal Rescue's Orangutan Rescue Center in Ketapang, his condition was extremely critical. His body was swollen with fluid due to a severe lack of protein. His limbs were misshapen because he was never fed properly.

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN)Friends called him Tony. Family knew him by his middle name, Terrell. Now, Tony Terrell Robinson Jr.'s name is written on signs carried by demonstrators who say they're demanding justice after a police shooting ended the unarmed teen's life. As Wisconsin state investigators begin their inquiry into the controversial case, details are emerging about the 19-year-old biracial man. Turin Carter described his nephew as a person who had struggled to fit in. ""A lot of his identity was formed because of his racial ambiguity. ... Terrell felt (like) a misfit most of his life,"" Carter said . At one point, Carter said, his nephew's desire to fit in led him astray. ""Terrell just wanted to be loved, honestly ... and as a result, made some poor decisions, and I think that's something we can all relate to,"" he said. Last year, Robinson found himself in jail after stealing an Xbox and TV during a home invasion. An adviser with the Robinson family attorney told CNN the teen fell on hard times after his dad lost his job and then his apartment, forcing Robinson to live with friends. He pleaded guilty in December to armed robbery and was sentenced to probation. That same month, he wrote a post on Facebook slamming police: ""The only thing cops are trained for is to shoot first and ask questions later."" Court documents from the case include letters the family wrote, asking the court to show mercy and vowing that the teen would never repeat his mistake. ""Tony has made a grave decision, one which may cost him his freedom, but before a decision is made I want you to know him as his family does. A loving son, a responsible older brother and a kindhearted, incredibly intelligent young man with hopes and dreams to become successful and to move forward in life,"" wrote Lorien Carter, his aunt. ""Growing up impoverished, and without his father, Tony managed to excel in school and sports. Graduating high school a semester early, he was on a great track."" His grandmother, Sharon Irwin, described him as ""a great kid in between being a teen and a man."" ""What he did was wrong. Following behind a boy he just met. He didn't want to go yet did it anyway,"" she wrote. ""That is one of his issues. Impulsive. The other is being a follower."" Carter said his nephew's run-in with the law last year had nothing to do with last week's shooting. Robinson paid his debt to society and was trying to find his way and better his life, according to his uncle. ""They try to associate his past with this act, to paint a picture about the type of kid he was,"" he said. ""He was a good, kindhearted kid who was very happy and just wanted to be accepted and wanted to be loved."" A GoFundMe page collecting donations for Robinson's family says he was hoping to go to college and study business. Recent social media posts from the teen point to a troubling time in his life. In one post, he wrote, ""I hate my mind."" Another said, ""I don't need help im not crazy."" A post from January says, ""My soul is dying."" According to the Wisconsin State Journal, citing court documents, Robinson dealt with anxiety issues, depression and ADHD. Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, stressed that her son was never violent. ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she told CNN affiliate WKOW. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" During a confrontation before Friday night's shooting, Officer Matt Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate the shooting. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial. ""That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" ""We know that he was not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned ... the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy."" Ryan Young reported from Madison. Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.

Some very cute images of pit bulls wearing flower crowns started popping up on Facebook this weekend after the Sean Casey Animal Rescue in New York posted them. They are the brainchild of New York-based photographer Sophie Gamand, who is partnering with shelters in New York to create pit bull portraits that make you say ""awwww.""

"(CNN)Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion was a gilded cage for former Hef companion Holly Madison. In her new memoir, ""Down the Rabbit Hole,"" Madison -- one of the stars of the Playboy-centered E! reality series ""The Girls Next Door"" -- says that living in the mansion wasn't all sex and good times. ""Life inside the notorious mansion wasn't a dream at all -- and quickly became her nightmare,"" the promotional material states, according to Us Weekly. ""After losing her identity, her sense of self-worth, and her hope for the future, Holly found herself sitting alone in a bathtub contemplating suicide."" Madison also details stories of backstabbing Bunnies and very strict house rules. Some of Madison's revelations won't be news to anyone who's ever read about the recent life of Hefner, the Playboy founder, whose most recent marriage was to Crystal Harris in 2012. Former spouse Kimberley Conrad described Hefner as ""very controlling,"" and he's a man of routine. The 88-year-old has a passion for old movies and old friends, and he keeps more than 2,000 scrapbooks about his life. The mansion -- except for Hefner's bedroom -- is kept immaculate. And the sex? A ""couple times a week,"" Hefner told The New York Times in 2010. Madison is now married to promoter Pasquale Rotella and has a young daughter. Her memoir is due out in June. ""I'm excited to finally share my story and what I've learned from my personal experiences both inside and outside of the Playboy Mansion,"" she told Us.

"(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them. Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said. He described Williams as a frequent protester in the city -- which some took issue with. Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, said he spoke to Williams on Sunday. ""I asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community,"" Robinson said. ""It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested."" For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted. At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property. The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, ""which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered"" at the scene of the shooting. Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they ""buy"" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. ""It's possible he was firing at someone else,"" he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw ""muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,"" Belmar said. ""We could have buried two police officers,"" Belmar told reporters last week. ""I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was."" Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward. Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd. ""In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said. ""These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,"" he said. The department has been criticized since the shooting death of Brown and, more recently, since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. ""We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts,"" the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday. While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both men have been treated and released. CNN's Carma Hassan, Sara Sidner, Jason Carroll, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez and Alina Machado contributed to this report.","Jeffrey Williams, 20, is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, prosecutor says .

"(CNN)Denmark has slammed as ""unacceptable"" comments by Russia's envoy to Denmark that joining NATO's missile defense shield would make Danish warships ""targets for Russian nuclear missiles."" In August last year, Denmark said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to NATO's missile defense shield. In an opinion article published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten on Saturday, Russian Ambassador Mikhail Vanin said he did not think the Danes fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield. ""If this happens, Danish warships become targets for Russian nuclear missiles,"" he wrote. Denmark's Minister for Foreign Affairs Martin Lidegaard said Vanin's remarks were unacceptable. ""Russia knows full well that NATO's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them (Russia),"" Lidegaard said.""However, I would not over-dramatize this. Right now we disagree with Russia on many important issues, but we also cooperate, for example, in the Arctic and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate. We certainly are not contributing to that."" Tensions between Russia and NATO member countries have been mounting since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied its military is involved. In April 2014, NATO foreign ministers said they had ""decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia"" over the issue. The United States and NATO allies have been conducting military exercises as part of ""Operation Atlantic Resolve,"" which the United States describes as ""a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of NATO and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine specifically."" On March 2, NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow told the alliance's annual meeting on arms control: ""Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its continuing destabilization of Eastern Ukraine have put the European security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain."" Last Monday, state-run Russian media reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his Northern Fleet ""to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise"" in the Arctic. At least one Russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the ""international situation."" Conversely, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov told Tass news agency that Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about NATO drills near its border. NATO says the long-term goal of its missile shield  is ""to merge individual Allies' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system, providing full protection for NATO European populations, territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats."" NATO has previously asked Russia to participate in the system, but negotiations were deadlocked over Russia's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow's own systems.","Denmark slams Russia's envoy for warning against joining the NATO missile shield .

"(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. ""What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,"" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said ""there will be no military intervention by the U.S."" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, ""If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us."" He added, ""We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner."" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. ""This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,"" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called ""the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,"" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. ""We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue (that includes) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis,"" the Iraqi ministry said. The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen. In addition to airstrikes, the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen. Just a day in, the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis. Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight, said journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital. The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said. While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis' combat and control operations there, the Saudi adviser said -- it wasn't the only place struck. Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. The military operation, dubbed al-Hazm Storm, was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday. It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty, al-Arabi said. Specifically, the strikes aim to support Hadi, who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered, but still claims to be Yemen's rightful leader. ""We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,"" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, in announcing the beginning of the military campaign. ""Having Yemen fail cannot be an option for us or for our coalition partners."" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Jubeir told CNN's ""The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer"" that Saudi Arabia was concerned that the Houthis had control over Yemen's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force, and the fact that Iran backs the Houthis was troubling. ""This is really a war to defend the legitimate government of Yemen and protect the Yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with Iran and Hezbollah,"" he said. American military commanders said they didn't know about Saudi Arabia's action until the last minute. ""We have been discussing this matter with the United States in principle for many months,"" Jubeir said. ""We have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action didn't really happen until the last minute, because of circumstances in Yemen."" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday proposed a joint Arab military ""to deal with these challenges."" But at least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People's Congress, which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out. The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties. The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table, the group said. ""The (party) expresses its rejection of the attack on the Republic of Yemen and the capital, Sanaa, considering what (is) happening is an internal affair,"" the GPC said. ""... The General People's Congress (calls on all parties) to return to and accelerate the completion of a national, historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy."" Meanwhile, the last person to be elected president of Yemen -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to Egypt to petition Arab officials, according to Yemeni officials. The location of Hadi had been a mystery for days, with conflicting reports about whether he'd left Yemen and where he'd gone. Saudi Arabia's state news agency, SPA, reported that Hadi arrived Thursday in Riyadh, where he met with the Saudi defense minister and intelligence chief. But two Yemeni officials close to Hadi said that the deposed president is in Oman. They said that his next stop, on Friday, will be an Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Meanwhile, some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the Saudi-led coalition are expected to reach Aden, the Yemeni city that was Hadi's last known location, in the next three days, according to the officials. Their aim is to make that port city safe enough for Hadi to return after the Arab League summit. Whether the rest of Yemen will be secure at that point is another matter. Unfortunately, there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner. Opinion: Why Yemen has come undone .

"(CNN)Jeremy Clarkson won't have his contract renewed as host of ""Top Gear"" after he apparently busted his producer's lip and verbally abused him, the BBC announced Wednesday. Clarkson, who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world, was suspended on March 10 after what the British broadcaster previously described as a ""fracas"" with producer Oisin Tymon on March 4. Wednesday, the BBC released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident. Ken MacQuarrie, who conducted the investigation, said Tymon had been ""subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson"" at a hotel in North Yorkshire after a day of filming. ""During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip,"" he said. The physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness, MacQuarrie said, but Clarkson continued to use ""derogatory and abusive language"" for a sustained period of time. MacQuarrie said Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to BBC management. BBC Director General Tony Hall issued a statement announcing Clarkson was being dropped. ""A member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature. For me a line has been crossed,"" he said. ""I know how popular the program is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion."" ""Top Gear,"" fronted by Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it. Clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about, both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns. In his statement, Hall referenced the BBC's diversity, saying it was ""a broad church."" ""We need distinctive and different voices but they cannot come at any price. Common to all at the BBC have to be standards of decency and respect,"" he said. North Yorkshire police issued a statement Wednesday saying they had asked for the BBC's report on the incident. ""The information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by North Yorkshire Police where necessary,"" they said. On March 10, the BBC announced that ""Top Gear's"" March 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live ""Top Gear"" shows scheduled for next week in Stavanger, Norway. However, it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would ""run as scheduled."" Hall said the BBC would ""look to renew 'Top Gear' for 2016"" and that he had asked BBC controller Kim Shillinglaw to ""look at how we put out the last programs in the current series."" After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to ""I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear."" On Wednesday, the wording became past tense: ""I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear."" Co-host Richard Hammond tweeted: ""Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together."" Fans had earlier expressed outrage at the BBC decision to suspend Clarkson. Even media baron Rupert Murdoch commented on speculation that Clarkson would be sacked, posting a tweet Tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a ""funny man with great expertise."" An online petition to have Clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people. Fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired. Last week, a fan dressed as the ""Stig"" -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the BBC's London headquarters in an armored tank to present the ""Bring Back Clarkson"" petition. Clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times. According to the BBC website, Clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism. It also adds: ""Terrifyingly, he might just be the most influential man in motoring."" Clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998, and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with Hammond and May. The trio's long-distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status. In 2013, Guinness World Records named ""Top Gear"" the world's most widely watched factual program, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show is sold to 214 territories worldwide. Local versions have been made in the United States, China, Russia, Australia and South Korea. While Clarkson's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers, his on- and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense. Last year, he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that wasn't aired. ""I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,"" Clarkson said in video statement posted online. He's been accused on other occasions of racism, including characterizing Mexicans as ""lazy and feckless"" and using the word ""slope"" over footage of an Asian man crossing a bridge during a ""Top Gear"" special in Myanmar. Producer Andy Wilman later apologized, calling it a ""light-hearted word play joke,"" and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to Asians. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. A CNN reporter who was at the event said Clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC had ""f**ked themselves"" and had ruined a great show. Clarkson later brushed off the incident, saying the rant was meant ""in jest"" and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the ""Top Gear"" race track. CNN's Rosie Tomkins and journalist Monica Sarkar contributed to this report.","North Yorkshire police ask for BBC report to assess it .

"(CNN)A sixth suspect in the shooting death of a top Russian opposition figure blew himself up after a standoff with police in the capital of the Chechen Republic, state-run television reported Sunday. Beslan Shavanov, 30, was holed up in a building in Grozny when police arrived to arrest him Saturday afternoon, Russia 24 reported.  Police surrounded the building and Shavano tried to escape, throwing a grenade at police officers before blowing himself up, the station said. The news came as Russian authorities reported making five other arrests in connection with Boris Nemtsov's killing. One of those arrested claims to have an alibi, according to Russia's Sputnik News. ""At the time of the murder, I was at work as I usually am every day. There are many people, my colleagues, who will confirm this,"" the news agency quoted Tamerlan Eskerkhanov as saying in Moscow's Basmanny District Court. Two of the suspects have been formally charged and three ""remain under the status of suspects,"" court spokeswoman Anna Fadeyeva told Sputnik. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in late February. Surveillance video showed someone darting from the sidewalk and into a nearby car right after Nemtsov collapsed. Putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with Nemtsov's death, Russian media said, citing Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov. Two of the other suspects are Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev, Bortnikov said in a televised statement. The others are Ramzan Bakhayev and Shagit Gubashev, Anzor's younger brother, according to a Sputnik report that also said Dadayev was the only one of the five to plead guilty -- though to what crimes was not clear. Bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the North Caucasus, which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against Moscow. Dadayev had previously served as an officer in a Chechen police battalion, Albert Barakhayev, secretary of the Security Council of the Caucasian republic of Ingushetia, told the official news agency TASS. Dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the Chechen Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs groups, Sputnik reported, adding that Gubashev worked at a security firm in Moscow. Gubashev was arrested between the town of Malgobek and the village of Voznesenovskaya, while Dadayev was arrested in the city of Magas, Barakhayev told TASS. The slain opposition leader's daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, told CNN she is ""not surprised both of them (are) of Caucasus origin. It was predictable."" Nemtsova said the only things she knew about the arrests came from media reports, as authorities did not contact her immediately. Later Saturday, a southern Russian law enforcement official told state news agency RIA Novosti that two more men were arrested. The two suspects in the second arrest were not named, but one of them was driving with Dadayev, and the other man is Gubashev's younger brother, Barakhayev said. Like Gubashev and Dadayev, those two suspects are also ethnic Chechens, according to Barakhayev. After Nemtsov's shooting Putin blamed extremists and protesters who he said were trying to stir internal strife in Russia. Many opposition sympathizers and people close to Nemtsov have pointed the finger at Putin and the Russian government he leads. They note that Nemtsov -- the deputy prime minister under former President Boris Yeltsin -- is the latest in a list of Putin's opponents who have been killed or imprisoned. Nemtsov had also been arrested several times for speaking against the government. In her first TV interview since her father's death, Nemtsova told CNN that Putin shares ""political responsibility"" for her father's assassination. She spoke from Germany. ""I don't believe in the official investigation,"" she said Saturday. Other opposition figures previously jailed or killed include Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist critical of Russia's war in Chechnya. She was gunned down at the entrance to her Moscow apartment in 2006. There was also business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who backed an opposition party and accused Putin of corruption. Khodorkovsky landed in jail after a conviction on tax fraud, which he said was a ploy to take away his oil company. The government rejected the claim. Putin pardoned him in 2013. Former Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium, his tea spiked in a London hotel during a meeting with two former Russian security service men in 2006. He had blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. The Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it or its agents are targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. CNN's Catherine Shoichet, Ben Brumfield, Elena Sandyrev, Brian Walker, Greg Botelho, Joshua Berlinger and Alla Eshchenko  contributed to this report.","With police surrounding hiding place, sixth suspect kills himself, Russian media say .

"(CNN)The gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous. My job is to ask tough questions, but when it comes to faith, God, and religion, the more questions I ask in my quest for truth and understanding, the more complex the answers become. I was a bit of a rebellious child. My mom might tell you differently, but I never saw that as a bad trait. I felt that if I questioned authority, fought for the underdog, battled for the things that people told me were impossible, I would be different. Change the world maybe. That same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me, like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that I would rather not put in print. That's when I ""found God."" I became a ""born-again"" Christian when I attended a Young Life camp in high school. My home life wasn't exactly going swimmingly, and this group really embraced me. I loved the Christian notion of community, giving back, praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk, smoking pot and having sex. I opened my arms to Jesus and fully embraced Christian morals and principles. I decided that I was going to be ""that good girl"" and go on to do great things. I started off at Westmont, a beautiful Christian college nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara, California. What a safe place that was. It was also extremely nurturing. The professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development, and regularly prayed with us.  My peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for, not what sorority you were rushing. We lifted each other up, had intimate sunrise Bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends, talking about how to lead a godly life. As glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared, two years into college, the world became much larger to me. More complex, diverse, intellectually and spiritually challenging. It became the world of church, religion and faith versus the world of ideas, cultures, and philosophies. I found myself more drawn to Carl Jung than the book of Corinthians. A good friend gave me a book, The Myth of Certainty. It posed these questions: . ""Do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life? Do you find yourself compartmentalizing different aspects so that tensions between them are minimized?"" The answer to all of these for me was: yes. I started to read a lot. I wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers, and religious scholars. I needed to make a change. I left Westmont after my sophomore year and transferred to USC's School of Journalism. I discovered I had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry, but I felt good about this transition. To me, it made perfect sense, because like ministers, true journalists love people, listen well and want to make a difference within this universe. Meet the friendly atheists next door . The key difference is, in journalism, if we gather the ""facts,"" we can usually find the answers to what we're looking for.  When it comes to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, those answers rest in faith. As a journalist, I seek intellectual certainty. When it came to my faith, I felt intellectually embarrassed. There was so much I just couldn't explain. When I started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism, I found myself in a profound place of reflection.  In the days when I thought I was going to pursue a life of ministry, I experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable.  What was that?  God?  A higher power?  Energy?  Or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life?  There is no way to know. My stepfather, who grew up in -- but later left -- the Mormon church has a perspective on religion that I find intriguing.  He doesn't believe in a God with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives.  That concept is too abstract. But while he may not embrace ""God-liness,"" he does believe in ""Good-liness.""  God, he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions, is the ""good"" in humankind. He and I definitely agree that the concept of God should not be dismissed as having no meaning. To the contrary, it has a very important meaning, for it refers in symbolic language to the highest dimension of human existence, our spirituality. After years of spiritual reflection and inquiry, I am at a place where I don't want to feel guilty, hypocritical, judgmental, closed-minded or arrogant.  So, where do I stand now -- 30 years after ""finding God,"" questioning my faith, committing sins, seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability? I am a ""seeker."" A constant seeker within this world, among people and, of course, for spiritual enlightenment of all kind. Because if I did possess the truth -- the ""final answer"" --  I am convinced I would spend the rest of my years missing out on the enrichment and surprise of seeking it. I guess I just love my exhilarating and torturous life.","Kyra Phillips became a born-again Christian as a teen .

"(CNN)A lawsuit that's stirring concern among drinkers of some California wine starts with a history lesson. The deaths of Napoleon Bonaparte, Simon Bolivar, King George III, King Faisal I and other prominent figures have been attributed to arsenic poisoning, the first paragraph of the 30-page complaint says. And, now, drinkers of some California wine have become ""unwitting 'guinea pigs' of arsenic exposure,"" thanks to the negligent and misleading actions of dozens of California wineries, according to the class action complaint filed March 19 on behalf of two California couples. The lawsuit does not include any allegations of physical injury or death due to arsenic consumption associated with drinking the wines named in the complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order requiring the defendants disclose on the bottles the risks of consuming inorganic arsenic in wines and engage in ""corrective advertising"" regarding their conduct. News of the lawsuit, which broke last week, struck fear in the hearts of frugal wine consumers nationwide, prompting many to share lists on social media of labels named in the lawsuit, all but declaring the outcome a foregone conclusion. The complaint names 28 companies that represent 83 low-cost labels familiar to supermarket wine aisle shoppers: Cupcake, Franzia, Flipflop, Rex Goliath and Korbel, among others. Even the maker of Trader Joe's Charles Shaw Zinfandel varietal (affectionately known among fans as ""two-buck Chuck""), was called out for allegedly failing to warn consumers that it contained ""dangerously"" high levels of inorganic arsenic. But should consumers start looking to other winemakers or other wine-producing states for gallon-sized bottles of zinfandel? Or is the lawsuit a fearmongering tactic being used to drum up business for the beverage-testing company used for the lawsuit, as some defendants and industry insiders have insinuated? Most of the defendants said their wine was safe to drink when contacted by CNN. Some declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. Others referred CNN to the Wine Institute, a California trade group that called the claims ""false and misleading."" ""We are concerned that the irresponsible publicity campaign by the litigating party could scare the public into thinking that wine is not safe to consume, which is patently untrue,"" said the group, which represents 1,000 California wineries, including 10 of the defendants. The lawsuit alleges that three separate labs ""skilled in arsenic testing"" independently confirmed that the defendants produce wines containing ""dangerously"" high levels of inorganic arsenic, in some cases up to 500% more than what is considered acceptable. ""Put differently,"" the complaint states in bold letters, ""just a glass or two of these arsenic-contaminated wines a day over time could result in dangerous arsenic toxicity to the consumer."" A spokesman from the public relations firm representing the plaintiffs and BeverageGrades, which performed the analysis, said the company is confident that its data is ""based on sound scientific research."" Because the company expects testing methodology to be at issue in litigation, it declined to reveal specific data or testing methods. ""We understand the public interest in this story and look forward to resolving the litigation to make these products safer for consumers. And we hope the winemakers will take these findings just as seriously and work to make sure their wines are safe,"" spokesman Rob Feldman said. Without seeing the lab results, experts suggest reserving judgment based on the following issues to arise from the lawsuit: . Arsenic is found in air, soil and water throughout the world. Therefore, it can also found in grains, fruits, vegetables and seafood due to absorption through soil and water. ""Plants take up trace amounts of arsenic from the soil, and we have been ingesting these trace amounts for all of human history. Generally, these amounts are at levels well below that associated with either acute or chronic toxicity,"" said Cornell University's Gavin Lavi Sacks, director of undergraduate studies for the viticulture and enology program in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Arsenic occurs in inorganic and organic forms. The FDA describes organic or naturally occurring arsenic as ""essentially harmless."" Inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. The first time the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink was in 2013, when it proposed to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic in apple juice to 10 parts per billion. Long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic, mainly through smoking, drinking contaminated water, eating food prepared with contaminated water or eating food irrigated with arsenic-rich water, can lead to health risks such as cancer and skin lesions. According to the lawsuit, inorganic arsenic makes up the ""overwhelming majority"" of arsenic in wines at issue, despite the winemakers' ability to limit inorganic arsenic through ""responsible winemaking procedures"" and ""sophisticated testing equipment."" Without providing specific data, the plaintiffs said their analysis found inorganic arsenic ""far in excess"" of what's allowed in drinking water based on the EPA's standard for arsenic in drinking water: 10 parts per billion. But the EPA limit for water is based on total arsenic, including both organic and inorganic forms, leading some to question whether it's the best basis for comparison. This standard is set to protect consumers served by public water systems from the effects of long-term, chronic exposure to arsenic, EPA spokeswoman Tara Johnson said in an email. It's based on how much water people typically drink daily, which ranges from one to two liters, she said. However, the EPA standard for arsenic in drinking water ""is of limited use when considering any potential health risks related to arsenic in wine,"" FDA spokeswoman Lauren Sucher said in an email to CNN. ""People drink far more water than they do wine over their lifetimes, and they start drinking water earlier in life. Thus, both the amount and period of exposure are different and would require separate analyses,"" she said. Seeing as the USDA recommends drinking about 10 cups of water a day and no more than two alcoholic drinks (about 1 cup of wine) a day, ""a sensible concentration limit for arsenic in wine should be at least 10-fold higher than for drinking water, and possibly higher, since we also use water for cooking and cleaning,"" Sacks of Cornell University said. This is roughly the case in countries that have established limits for arsenic in wine, which leads to the next point: . The U.S. Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production of alcoholic beverages, and part of this process is testing wine for arsenic, said Erika Holmes, spokeswoman for Washington State University's Viticulture and Enology school. Even though the FDA has not established a standard for acceptable levels of arsenic in wine, California wine exports are tested and found to be below the established limits for export, Holmes said in an email. Countries that import California wine also test for arsenic using their own standards: 100 parts per billion in Canada and 200 parts per billion in Europe -- 10 to 20 times higher than the drinking water limit in the United States. ""It's certainly appropriate to look to other countries' regulations for guidance,"" Sacks said. ""Their regulators are presumably looking at the same body of research that U.S. regulators would look to if they were to establish a mandatory limit for wine."" The day CBS News aired a segment on the lawsuit, the company that performed the analysis sent out a news release offering its services to provide ""reassurance from arsenic in wine"" through ""a tool for screening their offerings to ensure the quality of their supply chain."" Neither BeverageGrades nor its CEO, Kevin Hicks, is a party to the lawsuit. But Hicks' appearance in the segment prompted detractors to cry conflict of interest. In a statement to CNN, Hicks said it was concerning that some winemakers would point to this as a conflict of interest ""instead of focusing on making sure their product contains the lowest amount of contaminants possible."" He also defended his company's right to offer its services to retailers, saying he will continue to do so. ""The arsenic data in my testing is based on years of scientific research and operating a commercial chemistry lab for over two years. As a commercial lab no one should be surprised that BeverageGrades has been offering lab testing services to the alcohol beverage industry since July 2013."" A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the brand Barefoot was a named defendant in the lawsuit. It is not. This story has been corrected. CNN sincerely regrets the error.","A class-action lawsuit alleges some California wines contain unsafe levels of arsenic .

"(CNN)Everywhere you look there are two-wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board. They're the backbone of public transport in Uganda and the fastest way to get around the capital city, Kampala. The boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society. Traditionally, the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by. But now, a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone. ""Bodas are the main thing getting people from A to B,"" says Alastair Sussock, co-founder of SafeBoda, ""and we're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city."" The motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in Uganda, with over 80,000 riding the streets of Kampala, according to Sussex who wants to seize upon the country's burgeoning young population. Uganda has more than 24% of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old, according to UNICEF -- and Sussock wants them to get on their bikes. ""Young people use smartphones in Kampala and it's one of the youngest countries in the world,"" he says. For now, the Uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of Kampala, where a click on the SafeBoda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a Safeboda bike, complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket, helmet and fully trained in road safety. He'll even have a helmet for you. Safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in Kampala. A study conducted at Mulago National Referral  Hospital in Kampala, by researchers at Makerere University, identified approximately 40% of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda-boda accidents. I request a SafeBoda to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of Kisementi, in Kampala's central district. As i stand waiting, at least 10 regular boda bodas pass by beeping to get my attention and business. A driver called Richard Lalunga then arrives who I spot clearly in the distance thanks to his bright orange jacket and orange helmets -- one on his head and one on his handlebars. Lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined SafeBoda four months ago to learn more about road safety. He explains how he now earns more than ever before due to a loyal customer base stemming from his safe driving. The ride was in fact calmer than those taken with other bodas, and unlike some, as we ride along the congested streets no kerbs were scaled or mounted to avoid the traffic. The name stands - safeboda. The dangers lie in the low use of helmets -- by both drivers and users -- alongside risky driving and poor road safety practices. This makes many fearful of catching a two-wheeled ride but the team at SafeBoda are trying to lure people back on board. They're reinventing the boda boda reputation to prove they can be safe, as well as fast and economical. ""It's a market-based approach to road safety,"" says Sussock, an economist, who believes that as word spreads about the skills of his drivers, the income -- and safety -- of his drivers will rise and reflect this. ""People in Uganda don't wear helmets,"" says Sussock. ""So how do we get them to wear helmets?"" The answer, is by providing one. Driver training is provided in partnership with the Ugandan Red Cross and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working. Since its inception in November 2014, the fleet of drivers at SafeBoda has reached 50, currently occupying four areas towards the north and center of the city. The main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown Kampala where the company plans to expand into next. ""If we train people and make them good and responsible drivers, we're going to save lives,"" says Ricky Rapa Thomson, who manages the drivers. ""But implementing has been a challenge,"" he says about the difficulties in changing the mindsets of a population. The team are dreaming big, with plans to expand to 100 by the end of March and 800 by the end of 2015. ""With over 1,000 drivers we can begin to change the entire boda industry,"" says Sussock.

"(CNN)China has executed three men convicted of plotting a knife attack that killed 31 people at a railway station in the southwestern city of Kunming last year. The Kunming City Intermediate People's Court said that Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were put to death Tuesday. It said they had committed intentional homicide, led a terrorist group and organized the mass knifing, which also wounded 141 people. The names of those executed suggested they were Uyghur, a mainly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang, northwest China. Authorities had blamed terrorists from the region for the attack. The train station attack shook the country and state media labeled it ""China's 9/11."" Dressed in black and wielding long knives and machetes, several assailants stormed the station on March 1, 2014 seemingly hacking at anyone in sight. Authorities said police shot four perpetrators dead on the scene and captured another. It was the deadliest of a recent spate of violent incidents that have been blamed on Uyghurs.

"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks.  Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has ""always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law."" He added: ""And I am not going anywhere."" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause. The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of ""smear campaign"" against him. The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. RELATED: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Senator's donor . Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back  Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an ""oversight."" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor.  Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities ""don't want to live by."" ""If those countries can get away with that, they will,"" the senator said. ""And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage."" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included  allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about ""legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts."" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. ""The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,"" the appeals court said. ""These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.""","An announcement from the Justice Department could come in weeks .

"(CNN)Barring a revelation from his parents or girlfriend, we may never know what was going through the mind of Andreas Lubitz in the moments leading up to the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. What we now know is that all indications point to Lubitz as the perpetrator of the crash, locking the pilot out of the cockpit and setting the aircraft on a fatal trajectory into a remote mountain range in the French Alps. Every day, more details come to light, as the world struggles to make sense of why a 27-year-old German man would apparently choose to deliberately crash a plane with 150 people on board, including himself -- and remain so calm while doing it. When investigators searched Lubitz's home in Dusseldorf, they found medical leave notes ""slashed,"" suggesting Lubitz was hiding an illness or illnesses from his employers. The dates for which Lubitz was excused from work included the day of the crash, though investigators have not yet revealed the reason he was excused, if any reason was written on the notes by his doctor. We do know, from a German aviation source, that Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification examination last summer. An official with Lufthansa, the parent company of the budget airline Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. ""He was 100% fit to fly without restrictions,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters at press conference last week. ""His flight performance was perfect. There was nothing to worry about."" Spohr added that Lubitz had ""interrupted"" his training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Lubitz suffered from ""generalized anxiety disorder,"" with severe depression symptoms dating back to 2009, according to French newspaper Le Parisien. While the main medical clinic in Dusseldorf denies it was treating Lubitz for depression, German investigators found antidepressant medications in Lubitz's apartment, according to published reports that CNN has not yet been able to independently confirm. Die Welt, a German newspaper, over the weekend cited an unidentified senior investigator, who said Lubitz suffered from ""severe subjective burnout syndrome"" and severe depression. ""Someone who has a significant depressive episode or depressive disorder will oftentimes get an antidepressant alone, and many times will have a good resolution of those symptoms,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told Poppy Harlow Sunday on ""CNN Newsroom."" ""People who relapse or develop more of what is called a psychotic depression in addition may have symptoms of psychosis. Maybe they could be having delusions or hallucinations, but the idea is having breaks with reality."" One of the medications Lubitz was prescribed is said to be Agomelatine (an antidepressant medication), according to Le Perisien. Antidepressants can sometimes make people suicidal, especially those suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Other times, they can make patients manic or psychotic. The drug's list of warnings and precautions include metabolic changes -- such as weight gain -- and the potential for cognitive and motor impairment. ""Has potential to impair judgment, thinking and motor skills; use caution when operating machinery."" In 2010, Lubitz received Olanzpine injections (an antipsychotic medication) ""to treat OCD,"" according to Le Perisien. Doctors advised Lubitz to be more active, practice a new sport and regain self-confidence. ""This is a powerful medication,"" said Gupta. ""If this is true, it sort of reads into the severity of just how bad the psychosis was, at least at one point in his life."" There are other things besides psychosis for which the drug may be administered, but that's the most common use. One of the side effects is blurred vision. Citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, The New York Times Saturday reported that Lubitz sought treatment for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. If he was prescribed this medication as an injectable five years ago, was now taking it as an oral antipsychotic and wasn't taking it because of it was causing these detrimental side effects, ""that could be very concerning, as well,"" said Gupta. Authorities have not ruled out that Lubitz's vision problem could have been psychosomatic. Many people have been asking how likely it is that depression could result in this sort of horrific action. In a word: ""Unlikely,"" says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. ""Most people would just kill themselves,"" he says. ""It's very, very rare for depression to cause people to kill other people. This leads me to believe there's something else going on, like a personality character flaw."" Forensic psychologist Jeff Gardere agrees. ""It has to be a very severe depression to the point that there's a psychosis that's a result of that depression,"" he says. ""That's different than the schizophrenia part of psychosis. With this kind of depression, it's so deep that you actually break with reality."" Remember, Lubitz was in his late 20s -- and the odds of mental illness presenting at this age are much higher for someone in their 20s or 30s. ""Sometimes people lose touch with reality slowly. Other times, they lose touch really quickly,"" says Raison. ""Bipolar psychotic states can develop in as little as a day or two. I'm most curious what was going on in this guy's life the week before this happened. Did anyone see any changes with his behavior? Did he stop sleeping? There's a pretty good chance something would come up in speaking with the people in his life."" ""If a story doesn't make sense, it means you don't have the real story,"" says Raison. ""Even people who are psychotic will tell you a crazy story. It's crazy, but it makes sense."" More details are needed on Lubitz's story. Perhaps the most chilling revelation so far is that Lubitz not only decided to do what he did, but that he ignored the pilot's pleas to think about the lives on board and change his mind. ""It tells you he's at peace with what he's doing,"" says Raison. ""If you were uncertain or anxious, you might still open the cabin door (when the pilot was banging on the door and yelling to be let in). Calm determination to do this tells you he really believed in what he was doing."" ""If you look at school shooters, they go into a dissociative state,"" says Gardere. ""They've been planning for quite some time. They go into this personality where they can calmly go into murder mode -- robotic and calm. Even when they're shooting or doing something rageful, they behave in a calm manner. (Lubitz) knew when he got onto that plane that he wasn't coming back."" On Monday, Britain's most senior psychiatrist told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that when a pilot is ""acutely depressed or suffering from... any mental illness"" that impairs his or her ability to fly, he or she cannot fly an aircraft. ""We don't let pilots fly with depression, not because we're worried that they're going to murder everybody on board. That's such an extraordinary possibility that -- that's not depression -- but because they're impaired in concentration, memory and attention, which isn't good for a pilot,"" said Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army. Wessely added that the Germanwings plane crash might open a discussion on ""relaxing the laws of (doctor-patient) confidentiality in different countries,"" though in the United Kingdom, as well as in many other countries, a doctor is obliged to go to the authorities if he or she believes that people are genuinely being put at risk by one of their patients.

"(CNN)As a November dawn breaks over an Irish bar in downtown New York, the early risers inside are hunkered down to watch Lewis Hamilton begin his chase for a second Formula One world title. It's mid-morning in Brazil and Melissa, her husband Alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the TV to watch their hero in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On the verdant Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, three thousand miles from the desert showdown, another Hamilton fan anxiously waits for the Mercedes man to race to his fate. These supporters, and others around the world from Estonia to South Africa, had voiced their hopes in video messages and their supplications on social media. When Hamilton flicked down his visor, revved the Mercedes' engine and hit the throttle, a global surge of support roared. ""We came out at 6am on Sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in Manhattan,"" New Yorker, and self confessed No.1 Hamilton fan, Christopher Thomas told CNN. ""We met up with fans from all over; we had a guy from the UK and one guy even took a bus from Boston just to watch the race. ""We also made videos and sent them to Lewis' website using the hashtag TeamLH."" In Brazil, self-styled Melissa ""Hamilton,"" who is married to Alex ""Senna,"" also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol. She told CNN: ""I support Lewis every day but during the races I am aware of everything, even practice and all the interviews. ""At all times he knows he can count on our support, in good times or bad. I am extremely proud to be a fan of his."" When Hamilton won in Abu Dhabi -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival Nico Rosberg -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference. ""I always say we win and lose together,"" he smiled. ""The love and energy that I get from my fans... It really made me believe that I can do anything."" Racing in a global championship has helped Hamilton gain fame across international borders. In 2015, the F1 series will visit an air-mile clocking 20 countries. But when the 30-year-old Briton lines up for Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he will do so as the most famous face on the grid. ""Lewis has over three million Facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the UK -- and he has 2.6 million Twitter followers,"" explained Jon Stainer, managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company Repucom. ""He has a very strong following. Compared to other F1 drivers, Lewis is also right up there in most of the sport's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness. ""In the big markets -- Brazil, China, India and the UK -- he scores in the top three. Fernando Alonso is the only other [ever-present] driver."" Tom Roope, whose company Rumpus Room runs Hamilton's digital media, decided to tap into the racing star's global appeal in the build-up to the sizzling Abu Dhabi finale. ""We saw that Lewis' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol #TeamLH,"" explains Roope. Rumpus Room then devised a real time app, which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support.  These twin projects enabled Roope and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of Hamilton's followers. ""His fanbase is enormously international,"" he said. ""Around 50% of them are from the UK but then there are a lot in Asia, Brazil and the U.S. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries. ""There was also a surprisingly high female following, which is probably connected to [his former girlfriend popstar] Nicole Scherzinger."" The video messages was then edited into four films, which were broadcast daily on Hamilton's social platforms over the race weekend. The final film on race day had a million views on Facebook in one day alone. Our story. Here it is. #TeamLHmovie. Thank you all so much #TeamLH @mercedesamgf1 . https://t.co/HbuiT4jRrw . Hamilton himself explained the concept, and the emotional response it generated within him, after the race. ""This weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people,"" he said. ""I really didn't know what to expect. When I got it there was something happening in my heart. I can't really explain it."" Thomas and his fiancée Julliana Sanchez, as well as Melissa and her family and the Reunion Island fan, were featured in the films. ""It was important to us personally,"" Thomas said. ""It's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans."" Thomas, who is originally from Guyana in South America, has also been galvanizing global support for Hamilton through social media for the last five years. He explained: ""The idea percolated at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2010. My brother-in-law Shaka had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five-year-old did -- but at the bottom it said '#LewisNation -- We Believe.' ""We started using it and Twitter was soon blown up with #LewisNation. The initial idea was to unite crew members in North America but when I go on Twitter and Facebook I see people from India, the Philippines, the UK and Germany. ""It's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger. Right now, we use #LewisNation to meet up at races but we've started work on a website."" Hamilton's mass appeal is not just because he's an F1 driver and now a double world champion. He has something the other 17 drivers simply don't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel, a blockbuster script. Born in Stevenage, a commuter town 30 miles north of London, he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as F1's first black driver. He revealed on his website when his career began he ""tried to ignore that fact"" but has now ""really started to appreciate the implications."" Hamilton's mixed heritage -- his mother is white British and his father's family have roots in the Caribbean -- and a rags-to-riches success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase. ""There's a crossover that appeals to many, many backgrounds,"" said Thomas. ""He's diverse, but not just [in] race but in his social likings too. ""He hangs out with top celebrities like Jay-Z and Kanye West. This hip-hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the U.S. make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to Americans."" Roope agreed: ""Lewis is a bit different. He invites a whole new set of people into F1, people who might be put off by the rich, white, middle-classness of it all."" Hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates --- and an on-off romance with Scherzinger. There have been some mesmerizing moments on track, and some famous meltdowns off it. Perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix. Hamilton had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media: ""It's an absolute frickin' joke. Maybe it's because I'm black. That's what Ali G says."" Many of Hamilton's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his derring-do on the racetrack, and draw inspiration from both. Melissa races go karts in Brazil and, although she credits her husband Alex for his practical support, she also takes heart from Hamilton. ""Lewis is a fighter, he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream; he teaches us that,"" Melissa explained. ""In addition to his talent as a wonderful driver, he has a big heart, a great willpower. ""Many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because I dispute championships with many men, and women on the track are in the minority. ""I win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice. I do not really care, I care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers."" Melissa has met Hamilton at many Brazilian Grands Prix. ""All my meetings with Lewis are fantastic and happy. He is a charismatic and kind person. He really loves his fans."" Thomas, like Melissa, has met Hamilton ""tonnes of times"" in and around grand prix weekends. ""He seems like a down to earth guy,"" Thomas revealed. ""He's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and shoves it back to you. He actually talks and spends time with you."" Thomas and his fiancée Sanchez are so impressed with the British racer that they graced him with a special honor. ""The first person we invited verbally to our wedding was Lewis,"" Thomas explained. ""We met him in the pit lane at the U.S. Grand Prix last year, he hung out with us, took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said 'hey you're the first invite.' ""We are trying to set a date around the summer break. We can't set the date on a race weekend!"" Being a global personality offers the ability to change people's lives even in a small way but for Hamilton, the relationship he has with his fans appears to be mutualistic. ""Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans,"" said Roope. ""He always sees his fans as the core of his powerbase."" When he drives out of the garage in Australia, the world champion may be racing to end the season as No.1 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions.

"Venice, California (CNN)Actor Harrison Ford was ""banged up"" and hospitalized Thursday afternoon after a 1940s aircraft he was piloting crashed during a forced landing on a golf course, his publicist said. ""Harrison was flying a WW2 vintage plane today which had engine trouble upon takeoff,"" Ina Treciokas said. ""He had no other choice but to make an emergency landing, which he did safely. He was banged up and is in the hospital receiving medical care. The injuries sustained are not life threatening, and he is expected to make a full recovery."" His son was with him at the hospital. ""Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man,"" Ben Ford tweeted. Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Patrick Butler, who wouldn't identify Ford as the patient, said the pilot suffered moderate trauma and was ""alert and conscious"" when he was taken to the hospital. He said the pilot, the only person on board, was in fair to moderate condition. The 72-year-old actor was in a two-seat, single-engine 1942 military trainer that went down on Penmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Airport. Patrick Jones, an investigator with National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters that the plane's engine failed. A man who lives near where the plane came down told CNN he heard the plane in trouble. ""I heard it having problems and then he turned around,"" Jens Lucking said. ""When he was right by the house, the engine cut out and then he turned around."" The plane clipped a tree top as it glided back toward the airport, officials said. It landed on its belly with the landing gear collapsed underneath and the left wing touching the ground. There is a mark in the ground behind the plane where the aircraft sliced into the grass. Ford had just taken off when the plane experienced some kind of problem. He was trying to return to the airport, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said. Tom Haines with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association said he had flown with Ford in the past. ""He's a very skilled pilot. He's very safety-conscious and goes to training routinely for all of his aircraft,"" Haines said. Santa Monica Airport is a small facility with one runway, originally built in 1919. But now it is basically in the back yard of a very dense beach community.  There have been many complaints about the air traffic and golfers and neighbors say aircraft fly too close to homes. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA said the plane was a Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR. According to FAA registry, the plane is owned by MG Aviation Inc. The plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder, Jones of the NTSB said. It is not the first aviation-related incident for the star of the ""Star Wars"" and the Indiana Jones film franchises. In 1999, Ford had to make an hard emergency landing in a California riverbed while flying in a helicopter with a flight instructor. MG Aviation also was the owner of that aircraft, according to a Los Angeles Times report. He missed time during the filming of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" last year in Buckinghamshire, England, when he broke one of his legs on the set. CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Santa Monica and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Rosalina Nieves and Sam Stringer contributed to this report.","Man who lives near crash site says he heard plane's engine cut off .

"(CNN)ISIS militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a Libyan hospital, then released them -- under the condition, if they want to live, that they stay put so they can treat members of the Islamist extremist group, a hospital official said. About 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State stormed Ibn Sina Hospital in Sirte on Monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to Tripoli, Libya's capital. The medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility, a hospital official said Tuesday. But they can't go far, with ISIS militants ordering them not to leave Sirte, according to the official. One of those kidnapped, a doctor from Uzbekistan, was told he is safe as long as he didn't leave, and he treated any militants who were wounded, the hospital official said. ""They told him that, for your life, you (stay) and work in the city,"" the official added. Like the doctor, the other medical workers aren't Libyan. Most are from the Philippines, with others from Ukraine, India and Serbia. The kidnappings came days after people of Filipino, Austrian, Czech, Ghanaian and Bangladeshi descent were taken from Libya's Al-Ghani oil field, an operation that Libya's internationally recognized government blamed on ""ISIS militias."" The abductions are more evidence of the turmoil Libya has experienced since 2011, the start of an uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Sirte was Gadhafi's hometown, where he was killed, and where his loyalists held out the longest. In the years since, Sirte has become a home to ISIS. The coastal city, halfway between Tripoli and Benghazi, is where terrorists kidnapped 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt in separate incidents in December and January. That mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that, in ISIS' distinctive, depraved style, was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda, showing jihadists standing behind their orange-clad, handcuffed victims and then beheading them. ""The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in,"" a masked English-speaking jihadi said on the video, ""we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood."" Like the Egyptians, the medical workers kidnapped Monday are foreigners, having come to Sirte to work. They also have skills that could help ISIS. The Ibn Sina Hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who'd been trying to flee Sirte's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat ISIS militants. The large-scale kidnapping illustrates how ISIS has become a disruptive force in Africa. The group's main foothold is in Iraq and Syria, where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a U.S.-led air campaign. ISIS branched out into Libya last year, with CNN reporting in November that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of Derna, a city of about 100,000 near the Egyptian border. Militants who've pledged allegiance to ISIS also have made their mark in points westward, forming chapters in cities including Sirte, Benghazi and Tripoli, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the Quilliam Foundation. Besides its actions in Derna and Sirte, ISIS' Libyan branch claimed responsibility for a January attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed 10 people, one of them American David Berry. But ISIS isn't just active in Libya. Earlier this month, Boko Haram -- another Islamist extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This bond gives ISIS a gateway to West Africa and specifically to Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and Boko Haram's home.","ISIS tells doctor to stay, treat militants, hospital official says .

"(CNN)When American writer Avijit Roy was hacked to death on a Dhaka, Bangladesh, street in full view of horrified onlookers, blogger Washiqur Rahman doubled down. Fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation, he wrote. But they couldn't silence it. His friends warned him to be careful, to watch what he posted online. But Rahman dismissed those concerns, saying his Facebook profile page didn't even bear his picture. They don't even know what I look like, he told them. On Monday, the 27-year-old Rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed Roy, hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency. He was so maimed -- with wounds to his head, face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying. His death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in Dhaka for online posts critical of Islam -- but they are hardly the only two who've paid a steep price. In the last two years, several  bloggers have died, either murdered or under mysterious circumstances. ""The despicable murder of Avijit Roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk. The killing of Washiqur Rahman today is another clear example of the Bangladeshi government's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk,"" said Abbas Faiz of  Amnesty International. ""How many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken?"" As shocking as Rahman's death was, the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing. On his Facebook page (for which he picked a custom URL that translates to ""unbeliever""), Rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag #IamAvijit. After his death, someone left a comment, ""Now you are."" Another wrote, ""I felt sorry when I first learned of your death. But then I saw what you wrote and I am not."" On his page, Rahman reposted a cartoon depicting Prophet Mohammed from the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo. He wished a happy birthday to author Taslima Nasreen, who was forced to flee Bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists. And he ""liked"" a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned, ""Pigs in burqas."" Posts threatening him were numerous. ""Get ready for the afterlife,"" one person commented on one of his posts. ""See you in hell,"" said another. He used to write under the pseudonym ""Stupid Man"" on a blog but switched to posting on Facebook after 2011. On Facebook, he is credited for a series, ""Jaw-crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists."" There, he posted questions that critics of Islam often raised and then answered them. But he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within Islam. For example, one question asked what proof was there that the Quran was the word of God. The answer, ""Mohammed said in his own words that the Quran is the word of God. Since Mohammed is the messenger of Allah, his claims are true."" He placed the question next to one that asked, ""What is the proof that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah?"" The answer, ""The Quran claims that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah. And since the Quran is God's word, its claims must be true."" Asif Mohiuddin, a blogger who himself was wounded by machete-wielding attackers in 2013 but survived, remembered Rahman as a great satirist. ""I named him the George Carlin of Bangladesh,"" he told the International Humanist and Ethical Union. ""He wanted with all his heart, a true secular country, where everyone can practice their freedom."" The irony is that the people who killed Rahman weren't even familiar with his writings; they were simply following orders, police said. Of the three involved in the Monday morning attack, two were quickly caught by bystanders. In confessions to police, the pair -- both students at Islamic schools -- said they didn't know what a blog was, nor had they seen Rahman's writing. They said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing Rahman was a religious duty, Police Commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarkar told reporters. The third person is still to be apprehended. That appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in Bangladesh. The only person arrested in the killing of Roy, the U.S. blogger, is Farabi Shafiur Rahman, who had called for his death in Facebook posts. There has been no conviction in the January 2013 attack on Mohiuddin. And no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, also in 2013. ""The Bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others,"" the Committee to Project Journalists said after Rahman's death. ""Otherwise the rest of the country's bloggers, commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well."" Bloggers, unlike political parties, aren't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals, said Imran Sarker, who heads the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh. ""They want peace, they talk of humanity. If you strike them with stones, they don't strike back. They try to reach you with flowers,"" he said. ""So, if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought, they are easy to pick on."" But the deaths -- of Rahman, of Roy, of Haider -- have emboldened the movement, rather than chill them into silence. ""No one is cowering in their homes because this is happening. Because this has been happening regularly for a long time,"" he said. ""We want to take the society forward. We know we have a lot left to accomplish."" CNN's Omar Khan, Kunal Sehgal and Ravi Agrawal contributed to this report.","The 27-year-old Rahman falls victim to the same brazen act that killed Avijit Roy .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military has pulled its remaining personnel out of Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation, the U.S. State Department said. The evacuation involved about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. The State Department called it a temporary relocation. Those evacuated, which include Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force, were the last American forces stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. ""We ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them,"" State Department Spokesman Jeff Rathke said late Saturday.  ""As we have in the past, we will take action to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the United States and our citizens."" The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. ""There is no military solution to Yemen's current crisis,"" Jeff Rathke said.  ""We urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions."" The United Nations is taking the situation seriously. The Security Council will meet at 3 p.m. ET Sunday to discuss Yemen, the French mission said Saturday via Twitter. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. ""Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,"" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of ""partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government"" as the best approach in a bad situation. ""The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,"" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the ""coup"" that led to his departure from Aden. ""The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,"" he said. After Hadi spoke, the Houthi-run SABA news agency responded, saying the Supreme Revolutionary Committee has decided to mobilize forces and ""directed security and military institutions to carry out their duties to confront (the) dirty war."" ""The Committee announces the decision to call proud sons of the Yemeni people in all regions to unite, collaborate and cooperate with members of the armed and security forces in the face of terrorist forces in all parts of the country,"" the report said. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. ""We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,"" Al Bukhaiti said. ""Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow."" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Ed Payne and Laura Koran contributed to this report.","U.S. military forces have been evacuated from Al Anad airbase .

"(CNN)The FBI has increased its reward for information on missing American Robert Levinson from $1 million to $5 million, it announced Monday. Levinson, a retired FBI agent, vanished after traveling to the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007 and is one of the longest-held U.S. citizens in history. The FBI announced the reward increase on the eighth anniversary of Levinson's disappearance -- and the day before his 67th birthday. ""Levinson traveled to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007, working on behalf of several large corporations, and his whereabouts, well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time,"" it said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement asking Iran to cooperate with the investigation into Levinson's whereabouts. ""He has spent more than 2,900 days separated from those who love him, and is one of the longest held U.S. citizens in history. Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,"" Kerry said. ""We remain committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners. We remain concerned about Mr. Levinson's health given his age and the length of his disappearance."" Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. The FBI says he was in Iran as a private investigator. But news reports in 2013 said he was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. That prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the U.S. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy. The FBI, White House and CIA have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the CIA and Levinson. It's unclear exactly who is holding him, but U.S. officials have said they believe he is somewhere in southwest Asia. Whoever his captors are, in 2010 they sent a ""proof of life"" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family. In the video, he asked the U.S. government for help: ""Please help me get home,"" a gaunt-looking Levinson said on the tape, citing his 33 years of service in the FBI as a reason for that help. The photographs showed him with a large beard.","The FBI says it is increasing the reward for missing American Robert Levinson to $5 million .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)More than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a series of suicide bombings in northern Nigeria on Saturday, witnesses and authorities told CNN. The blasts occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of the tumultuous Borno state, at the city's main market, a fish market and a bus station. Four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks, according to witnesses. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed. But the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram has been behind many similar attacks in northern Nigeria and beyond, killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of Sharia law to the region. Clement Adoda, a Borno state police spokesman, said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks. Suleiman Bulunkutu said he and others involved in the rescue operation had taken about 50 bodies to the Maiduguri General Hospital morgue. ""This toll doesn't include those taken to three other hospitals,"" Bulunkutu said. ""Therefore, the‎ final (death) toll may be higher."" In the first blast, a woman dressed in a hijab got off a motorized rickshaw and blew herself up outside the Baga Road fish market around 11:20 a.m. (5:20 a.m. ET), fish trader Mohammed Boni said. The next attack took place about an hour later outside Monday Market, the main one in the city, where people were lined up to go through security. Those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the city and region. Two women joined the female security line, one of whom ""blew herself up, causing minimal casualty,"" said witness Abdulkarim Musa. Then, as people gathered to help, the second woman detonated her explosives, said Musa, who was waiting outside the market in the male security line. The third attack occurred at a bus station. ""He came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand,"" a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from Maiduguri General Hospital. Such attacks, sadly, are nothing new for Borno State, one of those hit hardest by Boko Haram and the Nigerian military's campaign to stop them. The terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques, raided villages, and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok.","Police official: At least 54 are killed and 139 wounded .

"London (CNN)An investigation is underway after a canine competitor died the day after taking part in Crufts, one of the world's most prestigious dog shows. An autopsy indicates  he was poisoned. Three-year-old Irish setter Thendara Satisfaction -- known to his owners as Jagger -- took second prize in his class at the event in Birmingham, central England, on Thursday. But just a day later, after returning home to Belgium, he became ill. Owner-breeder Dee Milligan-Bott told CNN Jagger was ""finding it hard to breathe"" so a veterinarian was called, but the dog died before he could get there. ""The vet thought it was suspicious, so carried out an autopsy,"" she said. ""They found cubes of beef in his stomach that had at least two types of poison inside. Pieces of beef had been stitched together so that the poison didn't come out. ""He had enough in his system to kill a horse, according to the vet,"" said Milligan-Bott, who is at a loss to explain why Jagger was targeted: ""We can't fathom why anyone would do this."" ""I've been doing this for 30-odd years and I think I would have to give up on everything if I believed that someone who shows and breeds dogs would kill a dog. We all do this because we love dogs. If you hate me for being successful, then stick a brick through my window or something. But why would you involve a dog?"" Toxicology tests are being carried out. The vet has reported the dog's death to Belgian police, and Milligan-Bott said she would likely contact West Midlands Police in the UK too. A spokesperson for the Kennel Club, organizers of the Crufts dog show, said there had never been such an incident in the history of the competition, which dates back to 1891. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened to hear this terrible news and our heartfelt sympathies go out to Jagger's owners,"" said Caroline Kisko, secretary of the Kennel Club, in a statement. ""We understand that a toxicology report is due next week and that this matter has been reported to the police - we will work with them and help however we can."" Television personality and writer Clare Balding, who hosts TV coverage of Crufts in the UK, took to Twitter to express her shock at the news: ""Everyone at #Crufts2015 horrified at death of Irish Setter Jagger & post-mortem found poison. Awful for all concerned,"" she tweeted.","Three-year-old Irish setter Jagger died suddenly after competing at Crufts dog show .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)A mob, consisting of thousands of people, stormed a prison compound in India's far northeast, dragging out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets on Thursday, authorities say. Police say they tried to stave off the mob with tear gas and opened fire, killing one person. The crowd targeted a 35-year-old suspect, identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, who died of his injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, the director-general of police in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack took place. The mob that broke into the main jail in the state's Dimapur district was comprised of ""thousands"" of people, Doungal told CNN. ""Many of them were students in uniform,"" he said. The suspect was accused of raping a local woman on February 23. Tensions between the native Naga and undocumented Bangladeshi migrants in the district have been simmering for some time, police said. On Thursday evening, thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers, tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out. Police initially used tear gas and bamboo canes to rescue the inmate, but were not successful, Doungal said. ""There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,"" he said. The crowd planned to lynch the suspect, but he died from critical injuries suffered in the attack. ""We retrieved his body before it could be (hanged),"" Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under curfew, according to the officer, as the situation remains volatile.","Mob pulls rape suspect out of jail and kills him .

"(CNN)A migrant worker whose life ended in Washington after police shot at him 17 times. A father of four killed by an officer during a traffic stop in Texas. A man killed during a robbery investigation in California. After three Mexican citizens were killed by police in the United States in the past month, Mexico's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. Justice Department should step in. ""Given that these incidents cannot be looked at in isolation, the Mexican government has called for the U.S. Department of Justice through its civil rights division to monitor the investigation of these three cases to assure that they're conducted with transparency and where appropriate, the proper criminal or civil responsibility is determined,"" Mexico's Foreign Ministry said on Monday. The Mexican government's statement comes amid a debate that has surged across the United States about whether police are using excessive force, particularly when they deal with minority groups. ""Adding to our consternation over the third case of a Mexican killed by an excessive use of force in less than one month, is our deep concern for the effect of the break in trust between the Hispanic community and the police forces that could result from these actions,"" the foreign ministry said. Investigators said they're still piecing together information on all three cases. No charges have been filed. Here's a look at what we know so far: . Protesters at a city council meeting in Grapevine, Texas, this week chanted a familiar refrain: ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" For the demonstrators, the chant -- which started as a call to action after the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- has become a rallying cry for another case. Police shot 31-year-old Rubén García Villalpando in the Dallas suburb of Euless, Texas, on February 20. Investigators say the case started when a burglar alarm sounded at a business. Villalpando's car, which was in the area, was followed by police in what authorities described as a high-speed chase. Eventually, Villalpando pulled over. Villalpando was unarmed, but in early reports about the shooting, police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer's commands during a traffic stop. The traffic stop was caught on camera, but police haven't released the dash cam video to the public. ""There will be more information released as the investigation continues. This additional information may shed more light on Mr. Villalpando's actions that night,"" police and city officials said. ""We look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident, which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident."" Villalpando's family said they've seen the video, and even though it doesn't show the officer or the shooting,  they said one thing is clear: Villalpando was unarmed and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him. Fernando Romero said it was jarring to hear what his brother-in-law said in the video as he gets out of the vehicle. ""My brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up,"" Romero said, ""and the first thing he asks is, 'Are you going to kill me?'"" Marta Romero, Villalpando's wife, said her husband made a mistake when he didn't stop when the officer tried to pull him over. But she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in. ""He was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer, and in the video you don't see any of those things,"" she said. ""You see the opposite, a man who is scared, who is simply trying to calm the situation, who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands."" Police say Ernesto Javier Canepa Díaz, 28, was killed February 27 after a shooting broke out during a robbery investigation. ""At this time we need the process to continue in order to know what happened,"" Santa Ana, California, Police Chief Carlos Rojas told CNN en Español. He declined to comment on the investigation, but said Canepa had been arrested in the past for various crimes, including narcotics possession, possessing stolen property, domestic violence and resisting police. When police came across his car last week, he was wanted for a series of robberies, Rojas said. ""He did not cooperate with the police and we know that a police officer shot various times at him and he died at the scene,"" Rojas said. And police, he said, found a replica of a gun inside the car. ""We do not know if this is the reason why the police officer used force. That will be investigated,"" Rojas said. Canepa's family said they don't believe police were justified in opening fire. ""Whatever it was, he did not deserve to die this way,"" said Mayte Canepa, Ernesto's sister. ""He did not deserve for them to shoot at him like they did."" The Orange County Register reported that at a press conference on Tuesday, Canepa's brother, Andres, described police as ""a gang with a badge."" The officer who shot Canepa has been suspended with pay until the investigation is finished, police said. A proud laborer from Mexico, Antonio Zambrano-Montes picked fruit in the orchards of Washington state, but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year, he fell into deep despair. He couldn't work or send money to family in Mexico, two routines that shaped his life. It was this misfortune that distressed Zambrano-Montes in the days before he and police in Pasco, Washington, clashed in February, in a confrontation that ended with officers firing 17 bullets, hitting Zambrano-Montes several times and killing him. He was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks. Police have said that Zambrano-Montes, 35, was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by officers. He then allegedly stoned two officers, and police resorted to deadly force, authorities said. Officers had used a Taser on him, but it wasn't effective, police said. The shooting now haunts his family, due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on YouTube by bystanders. Zambrano-Montes' family said his limited English left him unable to understand the officers' commands, shouted in English. His mother, Agapita Montes, said she didn't see her son throwing rocks in the videos. ""The only thing I can see is that he's running, he raises his hands and they still shoot him. Why? I ask myself. Why?"" Montes said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events, she said. ""We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,"" the aunt said. ""I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard.""

"(CNN)A  Los Angeles police officer wanted on murder charges ""should be considered armed and dangerous,"" according to authorities. Police in Pomona, California -- about 30 miles east of L.A -- issued an arrest warrant Monday for Henry Solis, an LAPD rookie, in the shooting death of a local man over the weekend. According to witnesses, shots were fired in the predawn hours Saturday after a struggle between a shooter and a victim before a compact car was seen rushing off. The victim -- identified as 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. -- later died at a Los Angeles hospital. Investigators looking for clues discovered an abandoned car about three blocks away from the scene that belonged to Solis. Authorities soon began looking for the 27-year-old cop to question him, but so far, he has not turned up. ""The suspect knows he is wanted, and that police are actively searching for him.,"" Pomona police said in a statement. The LAPD is helping them look for him. Solis, who is still in his probationary phase, was off duty when the killing happened and has not reported back since. Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Residents have built a memorial to Rodriguez, a trucker, at the street corner where he collapsed. Sunday afternoon, they held a vigil and played his favorite songs. They said he put God and family first. ""He was just sweet,"" Sandra Soto told KTLA. ""He was my best friend.""

"Moscow  (CNN)The Ukrainian girlfriend of slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov faces constant psychological pressure from Moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death, her mother told CNN. Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, was walking with Nemtsov on Friday night when a gunman shot the politician about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin. ""She was crying and she was saying Boris had been killed and he's lying next to me,"" said her mother, Inna Duritskaya. ""She was in such shock she couldn't say anything else."" Duritskaya said her daughter was questioned until 2 a.m. Monday. She said she fears authorities will implicate her daughter in the death because they have threatened to take her attorney away from her. The model had been staying at the apartment of an aide to Nemtsov under constant police guard. Late Monday, Yevhen Perebyinis, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, tweeted that Duritskaya had left Moscow for Kiev. The assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories. Nemtsov was one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, and many suspect the Kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader. ""Of course when I heard she was dating him it was a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""Then when I met him in person I liked him a lot as a person. He was straightforward, he treated my daughter very well, she was happy. And I couldn't influence it anyway; my daughter did what she wanted to. Of course, I was worried and scared, but I couldn't change it anyway."" Thousands of Nemtsov supporters gathered Sunday in Moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old, who was deputy prime minister during President Boris Yeltsin's administration. The event took place the same day Nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in Moscow decrying Russia's policies on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Saturday that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported. ""A few weeks ago I had a conversation with him on how to build relations between Ukraine and Russia, as we would like them to be,"" Ukrinform quoted Poroshenko as saying. ""Boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of that. Boris was not afraid, the executioners were afraid. They killed him."" Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. Police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches, Russia's Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information leading to the arrest of the killer. It said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity. On Monday, the Russian television station Dozhd published an interview with Anna Duritskaya after her release. Duritskaya told the interviewer she did not see who killed Nemtsov, but that when she turned around she saw a light-colored car driving away. Duritskaya said that her wish was to go home to Ukraine to see her mother and that she did not believe she could attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday. Speculation has pointed blame at everyone from Putin, to a Putin associate, to someone just irked by Nemtsov's business activities. ""I doubt it was a direct order from Putin, but it was this toxic atmosphere of hatred,"" Russian pro-democracy activist Garry Kasparov said. ""It has been propagated by Russian television 24/7."" Nemtsov's friend and political colleague Ilya Yashin blamed Putin more directly: ""It's clearly a political murder,"" Yashin said. ""I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it."" Putin offered a different theory: that the killing was a contract hit, but one meant to fire up political strife, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. One man near the site of Nemtsov's memorial said he thinks the killer was a Putin opponent. ""I don't think Putin did this,"" he told CNN. ""I think this was some radical group that wants to make Putin look bad."" Nemtsov had said he was at risk for assassination. He told the Russian newspaper Sobesednik last month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid his mother's fears that Putin would have him killed would come true. But he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Opinion: The complicated life and tragic death of Boris Nemtsov . Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Late last year, Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial. Russia's official news agency reported Monday that a request by Navalny to attend Nemtsov's funeral had been denied. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council, suggested the killing was linked to the Kremlin's own insecurity. ""If you are popular your critics don't have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin,"" Kasparov tweeted. ""Putin is just food in a prison, eat it or starve."" CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Kiev, Ukraine; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow.

"Dusseldorf, Germany (CNN)Years before he was at the controls of a Germanwings plane that plunged into the French Alps, Andreas Lubitz told the airline he worked for that he'd had a bout with depression. Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane, told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a ""previous episode of severe depression,"" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a ""swift and seamless clarification"" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? It's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation, but it's only one piece of the puzzle, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said. ""We need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training, because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process,"" he said. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and ""held all the licenses required."" Check out the latest from our correspondents . The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf said Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career. Medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation into last week's crash told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was ""a big part of his life,"" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. Lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work, the official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. ""Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,"" he said. ""But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems."" Reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of Germanwings Flight 9525, but a police spokesman said the accounts were ""completely wrong."" French magazine Paris Match and German newspaper Bild reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed. ""One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,"" Paris Match reported. ""Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing."" The two publications described the video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications reported that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. ""It is a very disturbing scene,"" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were ""completely wrong"" and ""unwarranted."" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they ""hadn't been exploited yet."" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical ""no."" Reichelt told ""Erin Burnett: Outfront"" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are ""very confident"" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. ""That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,"" he said. While investigators search for clues to Lubitz's motivation, recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the March 24 crash. The remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using DNA analysis. Naffrechoux warned Monday that ""it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash."" But French President Francois Hollande, speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, was more positive, saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week. A simple stone memorial has been set up at Le Vernet, where grieving relatives of those killed have laid flowers and held prayers. Germanwings crash compensation: What we know . Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? The BEA, France's accident investigation agency, said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash, based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data. ""A deliberate act by a man with a disturbed psychological profile is a possible scenario,"" BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono told CNN. ""The first step of the investigation is to describe more precisely what happened."" This will be based mainly on analysis of the cockpit voice recorder, to be supplemented by data from the flight data recorder if it is found, she said. ""But we will also look at other events with possibly similar scenarios, try to understand if there are systemic weaknesses which may contribute or facilitate such scenarios. ""We will in particular look at the cockpit door locking as well as the criteria and procedures applied to detect specific psychological profiles.""

"(CNN)Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday. ""We have to be clear about this,"" Koval said. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used."" The officer who killed Robinson, 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny, had used deadly force before, shooting and killing a man in 2007, the chief said. Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was ""concluded to be a suicide by cop"" situation. Kenny was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence when Robinson attacked him, Koval said. Robinson had a criminal history, according to the state of Wisconsin public records.  These records were first reported by the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper. Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate that Robinson pleaded guilty in December of last year to an armed robbery that occurred April 25, 2014. The Madison Police Chief said that Robinson was unarmed, but his officer was assaulted and an investigation is underway.  Koval, on Saturday, refused to comment on Robinson's past police criminal history or past interactions. In a press conference, he stated, ""I could but I choose not to. I am not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago."" ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character particularly someone's as young as his,"" Koval said. But he also said that the public records were available to all. After the shooting, protesters in the university town took to the streets and converged on City Hall, chanting ""Black lives matter."" Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Police described Robinson as African-American. ""In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" the police chief told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house. They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother ""based on the dynamics"" of the situation. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" he said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she said. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children. ""He was our caretaker and so gentle,"" she said. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital. Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place. ""His relationship to the home is unclear to me, although there were certainly familiar acquaintances. This was not a random place. He had hung out."" In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he ""can only imagine the heartbreak"" of Robinson's parents and added he's ""concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well."" ""They are all in my thoughts and prayers,"" Schimel said. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Some were demanding answers sooner rather than later. On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday. ""Who do we trust?"" some called out, prompting the response, ""No one!"" And in another refrain, they chanted, ""Black lives matter."" The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened. ""Praying for Madison tonight,"" wrote one activist. ""Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."" Mayor Paul Soglin spoke to the raw feelings, calling what happened ""an enormous tragedy."" ""We've got a family that's really hurting,"" Soglin said, according to WKOW. ""And we've got a city and neighborhood that's feeling pretty well hurt itself."" Some of the protesters were members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. She said Young, Gifted and Black will be working with church groups on Sunday and will hold more rallies Tuesday and Wednesday.

"(CNN)One of the nine suspects was killed. Another was shot in the stomach. All eight responding officers were injured, including one 10-year veteran who required surgery. It's the aftermath of an all-out melee in a Walmart parking lot in Cottonwood, Arizona, a town of 11,000 people about an hour's drive south of Flagstaff. But details are murky outside of the injury and arrest reports. What's known, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety statement released by spokesman Raul Garcia, is that someone at the store called the Cottonwood Police Department a few minutes before midnight Saturday to report that a woman who worked at Walmart ""had been assaulted in the store by multiple suspects."" The suspects were in the parking lot when police responded, and they immediately attacked the officers, the DPS statement said. Two suspects were shot, one in the abdomen and one fatally, while one of the suspects shot a Cottonwood officer in the leg, according to DPS. ""I heard about eight to 10 shots,"" Louie Solano, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate KPHO.  ""It was a lot of noise. It looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot. I mean it was unbelievable,"" he said. Investigators believe the nine suspects were all from the same family. ""We believe they are from Idaho because of the license plate on their vehicle,""  DPS spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. The condition of the suspect who was shot in the stomach was not known. Seven other suspects were taken into custody, the statement said, and ""a total of eight officers and another (Walmart) employee were assaulted in the parking lot during the fight. Seven of those officers sustained minor injuries to include lacerations and bruising."" The Walmart employee, who was a loss prevention officer, had a broken arm,  Graves said. The 31-year-old officer who suffered the gunshot wound was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. The veteran officer is expected to make a full recovery, according to the statement. The Cottonwood Police Department and the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office directed media questions to DPS. Asked for additional information, Arizona DPS spokesman Bart Graves said, ""This is a very complex investigation, we are still sorting things out and there are a lot of witnesses to talk to, so we are in the early stages."" He added, ""We were asked by Cottonwood police to conduct a criminal investigation.""

"(CNN)The man suspected of killing a deputy U.S. marshal at a motel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has died, Brittany Stewart in the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office said Wednesday. The cause of death is pending autopsy, she said. Jamie Croom, 31, was wounded in a shootout with Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells. It can be one of the most dangerous tasks for a law enforcement officer: serving an arrest warrant to a fugitive murder suspect. When Wells tried to do that Tuesday, he lost his life. ""Wells was part of a team executing arrest warrants on a fugitive wanted for double homicide in Baton Rouge,"" the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. ""The team engaged in gunfire with the fugitive and Wells was shot. He was immediately transported to Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana, where he died."" Wells, 28, was trying to arrest Croom, who is suspected in the deaths of a brother and sister in New Roads, Louisiana, CNN affiliate WAFB said. ""Our deputies and law enforcement partners face untold dangers every day in the pursuit of justice in cities nationwide,"" said U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia A. Hylton said in a news release. ""The fugitive who killed Deputy Wells was extremely dangerous, wanted for double homicide and intentionally evaded justice. ... When a public servant dies in the line of duty, it is an immeasurable tragedy felt by all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Deputy Wells' family, friends and colleagues."" Officials would not elaborate on exactly what happened, but The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge said there was a shootout. Authorities said Croom shot and killed Wells at a Baton Rouge motel. Wells, 28, was based in Mississippi but was on temporary assignment in the Baton Rouge area, the Sun Herald newspaper said. He was married and came from a law enforcement family. Despite the risks, Wells loved his job. ""It was his passion,"" longtime friend Alex McGee told the paper. ""I tipped my hat to him because he knew the dangers and wanted to do the job anyway."" Croom, the suspect, was taken to a hospital after he was wounded, WAFB said. He was wanted in the shooting deaths of the two siblings in February and was also on probation for firearms charges. That double homicide stemmed from a feud over a loan made to one of the victim's relatives as well as an alleged break-in at the suspect's grandmother's house, Croom's older sister Latonia Croom Duncan told CNN. Duncan said the family reported threats and a shooting at her grandmother's house to police, but said there was never any follow-up. She said her brother called her the night of the homicides, which took place at a nightclub. ""He called me and said he loved me and that he'd be gone,"" Duncan said. ""He said he wasn't going back to jail. Before he'd go back to jail, he said, he'd rather be dead."" CNN's Devon M. Sayers, John Newsome, Sam Stringer and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","The fugitive who killed the marshal was ""extremely dangerous,"" U.S. Marshals Service director says .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Gunmen detonated bombs and sprayed people with bullets as they raided a hotel in Somalia's capital late Friday afternoon, killing a Somali diplomat and at least five other people in an attack claimed by Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab, officials said. Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack at the the Makka Al Mukarama hotel in Mogadishu, the Somali government said. The attack began around 5 p.m. when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was meters away from the hotel when the blast happened. Gunmen then went inside the hotel, shooting people, Hussein said. One of the attackers, wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said . A few hours after the assault began, state-run media reported that security forces stormed the building and killed the remaining assailants. The attackers killed at least six people, Abdi said. The hotel, which is along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists and business people. An Al-Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, told CNN that the group was behind the attack. He said Al-Shabaab fighters were conducting an operation at the hotel against what he said were spies and government officials. Al-Shabaab has been active in Somalia for years. Initially its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

"(CNN)Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson is about to be out of a job. Jackson and city officials in the St. Louis suburb have announced his resignation, effective March 19. It's the latest fallout after a Justice Department investigation slammed his department's tactics. Speculation has swirled for months that Jackson would step down, and critics have pointed to several key points as signs that the police chief was in hot water. Here's a look at some key moments leading up to his resignation: . A police officer shoots and kills Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen. The incident exposes feelings of distrust between Ferguson's black community and its Police Department, which is overwhelmingly white. Anger begins to simmer on that first day, when Brown's body isn't removed from the street for four hours. Protests erupt. Among demonstrators' demands: that the Police Department release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Jackson reveals the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. On that same day, the department releases surveillance video that he says shows Brown robbing a store. Jackson says he distributed the store videotape ""because the press asked for it,"" noting he couldn't withhold it indefinitely. The chief adds, ""we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting,"" though he doesn't elaborate on why . Critics accuse him of inflaming tensions rather than getting the situation under control. In a YouTube video, Jackson apologizes to Brown's parents. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said during his video statement. Investigators were doing ""important work"" trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours, Jackson said, but ""it was just too long, and I'm truly sorry for that."" ""Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,"" he says in the video. ""As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution."" That night, he meets with protesters, agreeing to march with them. But even that meeting turns ugly; a scuffle breaks out and arrests are made. Jackson tells CNN's Erin Burnett he plans to stay in his job as police chief. ""I intend to see this thing through. And I've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems,"" he says. ""So, yes, I think I can -- I think I can see this through and come out on the other side with the community, the region and even the country a whole lot better."" The Justice Department slams the Ferguson Police Department for tactics that federal investigators say targeted African-Americans. Investigators also find evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. Asked about his reaction to the report by CNN's Sara Sidner, Jackson keeps mum, saying that he needs to analyze it further before he comments. Asked what he'll do in response, he says he will ""take action as necessary."" The city says it has reached a deal for the police chief to resign, effective March 19. Jackson confirms his resignation in a letter, saying ""it is with profound sadness that I am announcing I am stepping down."" In a text message response to CNN, Jackson says, ""It's a really hard pill to swallow."" CNN's Sara Sidner, Eliott C.

"(CNN)A North Carolina man facing murder charges in the death of a ""Food Network Star"" contestant had human remains in his woodstove, authorities say. Robert Jason Owens is accused of killing former contestant Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, and her husband, Joseph Codd, 45. Cristie Codd was five months pregnant, according to CNN affiliate WHNS in Greenville, South Carolina. Owens was a contractor and had worked at the couple's home in Leicester, a community 15 miles west of Asheville, authorities said Friday. Relatives reported the Codds missing Sunday after they could not reach either of them. When authorities went to their home, some things looked out of place, which prompted an investigation,  according to Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan. He did not elaborate on what was unusual, but authorities had said earlier that the couple's cars and dogs were at home. A day after they were reported missing, authorities received a call about suspicious activity around Owens' home in Candler. ""They (caller) identified that someone had come out and very suspiciously had left things in a Dumpster,"" Duncan said. ""We responded and were able to locate items that we knew belonged to Cristie Schoen Codd."" When investigators did an initial interview with Owens, he confessed to taking items from the victims' home, authorities said. Duncan said they obtained a warrant to search Owens' home and found human remains. ""Parts of those were recovered from a woodstove at that residence,"" Duncan said. Those remains, he said, are undergoing a forensic analysis to determine whether they belong to the Codds. In addition to the remains, Owens' wife told investigators that her husband confessed to killing Joseph Codd, according to the sheriff. Duncan declined to provide details on the motive or whether the suspect confessed to killing Cristie Schoen Codd as well. ""From that point, there's not really a whole lot of detail we can get into,"" he said, citing an ongoing investigation. Owens faces various charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, murder of an unborn child and breaking and entering, according to WHNS. It said Owens allegedly broke into the couple's house and stole a laptop, gun and  jewelry, citing investigators. It's unclear who his attorney is. Cristie Codd was a finalist on season eight of ""Food Network Star,"" which airs on the Food Network.","Cristie and Joseph Codd were reported missing Sunday .

"Los Angeles (CNN)The search for a rookie Los Angeles Police Department officer suspected of homicide has expanded into an international manhunt, focused on the border cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The FBI said Friday it believes AWOL policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from Southern California to El Paso with his father in a pickup a week ago. The FBI is offering $25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of Solis in connection with the death of Salome Rodriguez, 23, who died after a fight between the men in a downtown Pomona, California, bar. ""The pattern suggests he crossed into Mexico, but he has family and friends living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,"" said Scott Garriola, special FBI agent who runs the fugitive task force from the Los Angeles Bureau. ""So he could be on either side of the border."" ""It's a quick bus ride from the interior of Mexico to other parts of the country and Central America."" The FBI, Pomona Police and Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to comment on whether Victor Solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to El Paso. Garriola said Solis is a veteran of the Marines and ""he has extensive training and weapons"" understanding. Authorities posted three photos of Solis, with and without facial hair, and said he may now have a full beard. Police said after the early morning bar fight Solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements ""not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again,"" Garriola said. Henry Solis worked in the Devonshire Division of the San Fernando Valley, where he rode with a training officer. Earlier this week, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck fired Solis and appealed for him to give up. ""You have dishonored this police department, your country and your service to your country,"" Beck said. Marine Corps records say Solis served in Iraq from April to November 2007, earning several medals, including for the Iraq campaign, global war on terrorism service and Marine Corps good conduct. The personnel file also shows Solis was an aircraft maintenance technician and a security guard. Garriola said he was confident Solis will be caught, and said he shared Beck's opinion of Solis. ""It's a brother law enforcement officer, he served our country, we echo that same indignation.""","FBI says it believes AWOL rookie policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)A siege that started with gunmen detonating a bomb and spraying bullets in a hotel in Somalia ended Saturday with at least 20 people dead, authorities said. Among the dead was a Somali-American woman, Fahia Bashir Nur, 45, of Alexandria, Virginia, according to her uncle, Yusuf Kheire. He said Nur and her mother were dining in the hotel when the attack began. The mother lost an arm in the attack and was hospitalized. The attack, which lasted hours, began when gunmen raided the hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening. Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack, the Somali government said. ""He will be remembered for his strong personal commitment to protecting and promoting human rights for all,"" Nicholas Kay, special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General to Somalia, said of Bari-Bari. Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. The attack started about 5 p.m. local time when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was nearby when the blast happened. Gunmen then stormed into the hotel and opened fire, Hussein said. They overpowered the hotel's security guards, said police Capt. Ahmed Abdi, adding that the gunbattle between Somali special forces and the attackers lasted at least 17 hours. One of the attackers, who was wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said. Some members of the terror group ""stormed into the first, second and third floors of the hotel where rooms are located and held several people hostage,"" according to a statement from the African Union Commission in Somalia, a peacekeeping mission. The Makka Al Mukarama hotel, located along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists, business people and Somalis returning home from abroad. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud condemned the attack as a ""heinous and inhuman act"" in an interview with state-run Radio Mogadishu during an official visit to Egypt. In a statement, Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said Al-Shabaab's ""talk of 'legitimate targets' and 'justification'"" exposes ""the sham logic behind their lust for terror."" ""These terrorists contradict Islam and betray Somalia,"" he said. The injured, along with the bodies of the dead, could not be removed from the hotel until after the hours-long gunfight. More than 10 people, most of them Kenyan nationals who worked at the hotel, were rescued, police said. Al-Shabaab said it targeted the hotel because its guests are spies and government officials. The terror group has been active in Somalia for years. Initially, its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. ""We reiterate again that there will be no safe haven for the crusaders and apostates in Somalia, and that our attacks on them will continue until the enemy of Allah (is) defeated and his law is implemented fully in Somalia,"" the group said in a statement.

"(CNN)The emissions sticker on David Kassick's car was expired. That's what first caught the attention of Lisa Mearkle, a police officer in Hummelstown Borough, Pennsylvania, who ordered Kassick, 59, to pull over on February 2. Instead, Kassick fled. Moments later, he lay dead on the ground in a yard near a relative's home. On Tuesday, Mearkle was arrested on a homicide charge following a state police investigation into the shooting. Mearkle's attorney, who described the use of deadly force in the case as justified, said he is girding his client for national scrutiny as the case finds itself on a growing list of officer-involved shootings. The final moments leading to Kassick's death were captured on video which Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico Jr. said was critical in bringing the homicide charges. It was around 4 p.m. on February 2 when the 15-year police veteran first attempted to pull Kassick over, according to the charging documents. Instead of pulling over, Kassick took off and Mearkle gave chase, flipping on her lights and sirens. Less than a mile away, Kassick pulled into the driveway of a relative he'd been staying with and ran off on foot into the backyard, with Mearkle following close behind. As they ran through the yards behind Grandview Drive, the charging documents said, Mearkle fired her stun gun, automatically engaging a built-in audio and visual recording device. Marsico described the video: . ""She's running, she's tasing him, he falls to the ground. He's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit,"" Marsico said. Standing several feet behind his prone body, Mearkle shouts for Kassick to show his hands. Despite the commands, Marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where Kassick is seen reaching beneath himself, his hands obscured to Mearkle. Holding the Taser in her left hand, court documents said, Mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and, while continuing to shout ""show me your hands,"" fired twice into Kassick's back. Kassick was pronounced dead at the scene. He was unarmed. Marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney. ""He was face down on the ground, no weapon had been displayed. He didn't approach her, he didn't come toward her, he didn't verbally threaten her in any way,"" Marsico said of Kassick. ""It's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary."" CNN has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the video, which it has not independently viewed. Mearkle later told investigators she thought Kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun, according to court documents. ""What was she supposed to do?"" Mearkle's attorney, Brian Perry said. ""She felt that this was the only option that she had."" ""Keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under,"" Perry said. Mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on Tuesday after posting $250,000 bail. ""This was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end, we are servants of Justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,"" the Borough of Hummelstown said in a statement. Hummelstown Borough announced on Wednesday that Mearkle had been suspended from the Police Department without pay.","Police Officer Lisa Mearkle faces homicide charge for shooting an unarmed man .

"(CNN)Two police officers shot and wounded while standing guard outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department early Thursday were deliberately targeted in what a police official called an ""ambush."" Such ambush-style attacks were the leading circumstance in the surging number of shooting deaths of law enforcement officers, according to the nonprofit, Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The shootings were a chilling low point in the protests in the St. Louis suburb since a Ferguson police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. The demonstrators were out again late Wednesday -- in response to the announcement hours earlier of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson's resignation -- when shots rang out from a hill about 125 yards from where the protesters had gathered, according to witnesses. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shootings were an ""ambush"" intended ""for whatever nefarious reason"" to inflict harm on the officers. The officers -- one shot in the face, the other in the shoulder -- have been released from the hospital. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decried the shootings as a ""heinous assault (that) was inexcusable and repugnant."" Calling the shooting a ""cowardly action,"" Holder said, ""I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities."" The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% in 2014, the law enforcement group said in a report released in December. Many of those shootings occurred during police interactions with suspects such as traffic stops, responses to disturbances or attempted arrests. Such was the case in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Tuesday, when Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells was killed in an exchange of gunfire after going to arrest a fugitive murder suspect at a motel. However, ambushes were the largest single category of circumstances in the shooting deaths of officers in 2014, according to the group's report. Fifty officers were killed by firearms -- 15 in ambush attacks -- in 2014, the Memorial Fund said. That's compared with five ambushes among 32 shooting deaths in 2013 and six ambush deaths during 2012, according to the FBI. But those ambush numbers have trended higher before in previous years: The FBI counted 15 officer deaths by ambush each year in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed from 2002 to 2011: 23.2%. Ambush killings are nothing new. The FBI defines two types: . One is by ""entrapment and premeditation,"" which is a scenario ""where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning. These attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding; however, they can occur without cover or hiding,"" the agency said. The second are ambushes of ""unprovoked attacks,"" which are ""generally accomplished without hiding; however, they can occur with or without cover,"" the FBI said. Harry Houck, a consultant and former New York Police Department detective, said officers could be second-guessing themselves as scrutiny of the police increases. ""If an officer is afraid to immediately react the way he's supposed to,"" he said, ""that could cost him his life."" According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 2014 report, 126 federal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers died in the line of duty in 2014, compared with 102 and 123 the previous two years. Most of the on-duty deaths considered ""non-felonious"" were from traffic accidents or health reasons. CNN has not analyzed each case and cannot authenticate the group's findings. After the findings were released in December, Holder said: ""These troubling statistics underscore the very real dangers that America's brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms. Each loss is both tragic and unacceptable -- a beloved father, mother, son or daughter who never came home to their loved ones."" He said that the Department of Justice is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 ""so we can mitigate risks in the future."" The report's release came amid simmering distrust and tension between police and some communities across the country. It was published less than two weeks after the December 20 ambush killing of two New York City police officers. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, approached Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as they sat in their marked patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20 and shot them to death. He killed himself shortly afterward. The police memorial fund invoked the memories of Liu and Ramos' deaths in a December statement. ""With the increasing number of ambush-style attacks against our officers, I am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in America is influencing weak-minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws and keep our nation safe,"" said Craig W. Floyd, chairman and CEO of the police fund. ""Enough is enough,"" he said. ""We need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness."" That angry rhetoric isn't confined to the case of Ferguson -- or of Staten Island, New York, where the death of Eric Garner in July after police attempted to subdue him spurred national protests and preceded the slayings of Liu and Ramos, said Steve Groeninger, a spokesman for the memorial fund. Groeninger said the uptick in ambush-style attacks was ""punctuated"" by the New York officers' slayings, but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the fund. They included: . • In Las Vegas in June, Jerad Miller and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch, shooting them to death. Witnesses said the Millers placed a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a swastika on one officer's body. The couple then died in a murder-suicide as police closed in. • In Jersey City, New Jersey, in July, police said a man assaulted a Walgreen's security guard and took his gun in order to carry out the ambush-style killing of an officer, according to the Jersey Journal. • Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were ambushed and shot outside police barracks in Blooming Grove in September. The hunt for the alleged killer, Eric Frein, lasted almost seven weeks. He was captured at an abandoned airport on October 30. Frein was hit with terrorism charges in November for allegedly admitting that he shot the officers to change the government and ""wake people up."" But the number of shootings by police officers also is on the rise. According to data collected by the FBI, there were 461 justifiable homicides in 2013 -- the highest level since 1994 and the most recent year available. The figures are incomplete, however, because the shootings are self-reported and not all police departments provide them. The total number of fatal shootings by police officers is much higher -- 1,010 in 2013 and 1,134 last year, according to the nonprofit Fatal Encounters. The group started collecting the data in 2013. Its source of information is different from the FBI's. The group's founder, Brian Burghart, said the figures create a toxic environment for police, as well as suspects. ""When it comes to an eye for an eye, that people are addressing the problems with violence, the numbers are always going to go up on both sides,"" he said. This week, Wisconsin residents took to the streets to protest the police killing of Tony Robinson, a 19-year-old who was unarmed. Robinson's shooting was the fourth involving an officer in Wisconsin in the last three weeks. The others hardly made headlines: One involved an armed robbery, another a domestic abuser who put a knife to his girlfriend's throat, and another involved an assailant with a fake gun. Last April, Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times. The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged criminally. Instead, he was fired for not following protocol. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke accused politicians of fueling what he called an ""assault"" on policing. ""War has been declared on the American police officer,"" Clarke told CNN on Friday. ""And I'm tired of politicians taking all of the maladies of the American ghetto and blaming them on the American police officer.  ... They jumped in, early on, instead of offering calm words, they threw gas on an already smoldering fire."" Experts say the numbers alone don't tell the whole story. ""We need to know the circumstances in each individual case,"" said Houck, the consultant and former New York Police Department detective. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Two police officers are shot and wounded in Ferguson, Missouri, in what a police official calls an ""ambush""

"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's own words may determine whether he lives or dies, even if he never speaks a word at his trial. The admitted Boston Marathon bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand. He slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail-packed pressure cooker bombs exploded, killing three people, claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others. He didn't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court. At issue: Was Tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the United States for policies he believed were harmful to Muslims? Or, was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older, more radical brother? The defense team tried to portray Tsarnaev as a confused college kid who, like countless others, watches Comedy Central and cracks crass jokes. ""I wanna study a broad or two,"" he posted on his Twitter account as @J_tsar. He jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the Trix rabbit, and about ""whale watching"" outside a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. Miriam Conrad, a member of his defense team, tried Tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would-be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise. His brother was dead and police knew who he was; they were scouring the Boston suburb of Watertown for Tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the Slip Away II, a fishing boat dry-docked in a Watertown backyard. He hid for hours before being discovered. Bleeding, he picked up a pencil and wrote what Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb called his ""manifesto."" Tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother, Tamerlan, had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police. The indictment against him says Tsarnaev helped in his brother's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police. About the bombings, Tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he didn't enjoy killing innocent civilians, but that circumstances excused it. ""The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that,"" he wrote. ""Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it."" Streaks of blood cover portions of his message. More than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words. So ended one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history. While in the boat, he wrote that he couldn't stand to see the U.S. government ""go unpunished"" for killing Muslims. ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" He ended with: ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said "" -- the word was lost to a bullet hole  -- ""it is allowed."" Tsarnaev's connections: Who's who . Judge George O'Toole viewed the boat Tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat ""in context"" to the jury. He turned down requests by the media to accompany him. The defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1,100. Many were benign, about girls, cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying, the defense argued. On Monday, FBI agent Steven Kimball testified about two Twitter accounts used by Tsarnaev. One account shows he tweeted on the day of the April 15, 2013, bombing: . ""Ain't no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people"" His last tweet was on April 17. He sent it while on the run: . ""I'm a stress free kind of guy"" His other account carried seven tweets, including this: . ""strive to be a better muslim, be greedy with your time, devote most of it to the Almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need #islam"" The jury also has now seen Tsarnaev in videos, trailing his brother onto Boylston Street. Both carried heavy backpacks. He paused for four minutes, standing next to a tree in front of the Forum restaurant. In front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race. He put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . When his brother's bomb went off a block away, heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise. And there was Tsarnaev walking through the crowd, looking back over his shoulder as his own bomb went off 12 seconds later. Martin Richard, an 8-year-old standing in the line of kids, took the full brunt of the blast, which tore him apart. The bombs went off at 2:49 and 2:50 p.m., about the same time as he exchanged phone calls with his brother. The next video showed Tsarnaev in the crowd running. Other videos show him carrying on as usual: buying milk and swiping his card at his college gym. But FBI agents were already in pursuit, collecting store security videos and looking for somebody suspicious in the marathon crowd. By Wednesday night, authorities had a good idea who they were looking for. By Thursday night, his photo had been released to the public. By the next morning, his brother was dead, and Tsarnaev was hiding in the boat, writing of martyrdom and paradise.","Jurors see Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on boat where he hid .

"(CNN)They died in separate shootings. Separated by more than 2,000 miles, they lived with the peril and uncertainty that hundreds of thousands of U.S. law enforcement officers face each day. One was a 14-year veteran; the other a rookie on his first day out on his own. Two law enforcement officers, one in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and another in San Jose, California, were shot and killed in encounters with suspects Tuesday. Such encounters are all too common. The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% last year, according to the Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. ""Officers were obviously crying, grieving,"" said Officer Alberto Morales, a San Jose police department spokesman.""They will do so for some time, as will many of us in the department."" They were grieving for San Jose police Officer Michael Johnson, a veteran killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. The suspect in the San Jose shooting was found dead on his balcony with a gunshot wound, authorities said. Thousands of miles away, officers grieved the shooting death of Wisconsin State Trooper Trevor Casper, 21, of Kiel, according to the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The suspect  -- a suspected bank robber -- was killed. Casper had successfully completely his field training recently. He was on his first solo assignment, Capt. Anthony Burrell told reporters Wednesday. It's unclear whether the suspects were fatally shot by law enforcement officers or died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Johnson, a veteran, was killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. Part of his job was to work with new officers. Police received a call Tuesday evening about a ""despondent, intoxicated man, who possibly had access to a weapon, including a rifle,"" said San Jose police Chief Larry Esquivel. When officers arrived at the scene, they were met with gunfire, said Esquivel, adding that investigators were still trying ""to understand what truly happened."" Johnson was the first San Jose officer killed in the line of duty in 14 years. The last officer killed in the line of duty, Jeffrey Fontana, was in the same academy graduating class, Esquivel said. ""It's unfortunate for any of our officers to lose their lives, whether it's that class or any class,"" he said. It's not known whether the suspect was wounded in the exchange of gunfire, the police chief said. ""SJPD grieves as we offer our condolences to the family of our brother,"" the police department tweeted. Morales said the death had shaken many officers. ""Our hearts, prayers go out with the family of Michael, our brother. This is a very, very difficult time right now."" He remembered Johnson's smile and bright eyes, how he was ""full of life and cared a lot about his job."" ""It's a tough thing to relay to your fellow officers who have to go out there to continue to do this job,"" Morales said. ""But rest assured, that we will keep him in our memories as we go out there and continue to do the job that we love to do, and I'm sure he loved to do."" In  Wisconsin, Casper was killed after chasing a bank robbery suspect in Fond du Lac, authorities said. He had been sworn in as a state trooper in December, according to media reports and a Facebook page dedicated to his memory. ""Trevor Casper was a lively young man,"" Burrell recalled. ""He was very excited about his opportunity to be a trooper... He always had a smile on his face. When we met several times, I always asked if he was having fun and his response was, 'I sure am,' with a smile on his face."" Gunfire rang out when the trooper was pursuing a car that matched the description of one used in a bank robbery, CNN affiliate WITI-TV in Milwaukee reported. The suspect, identified as Steven Timothy Snyder, also died, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice. No other details of the pursuit were available. Police believe the suspect may have shot and killed a man in his 60s after leaving the bank, the station reported. Authorities are not looking for any additional suspects. Lt. Col. Brian Rahn of the Wisconsin State Patrol said the rookie officer's handling of the fatal encounter was ""absolute textbook -- from the time he made contact with the vehicle until the event was over."" The Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation will conduct an investigation, a requirement for officer-involved shootings in the state. ""Our son Trevor was an amazing young man who from a young age would do anything to help anyone,"" the trooper's family said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""It did not surprise us when he selected a career in law enforcement. Even as a young child he was always helping others. Trevor had a soft and good heart. He truly believed his sole purpose in life was to serve and protect others."" When his family asked Casper whether he was ready for a career as a trooper, ""Trevor proudly told us that he was 'born ready to do this job.' Trevor was so very proud of his career as a Wisconsin State Trooper. As a family we are so deeply honored that our son served as a law enforcement officer with the Wisconsin State Patrol and we share in their grief and loss. We are so deeply saddened by this loss and wish to thank everyone who has assisted us during this time,"" the statement added. The shooting occurred on the four-year anniversary of the death of Fond du Lac police Officer Craig Birkholz, who was shot and killed during a standoff with a suspect, WITI reported. ""Our hearts go out to his fellow officers, his friends, and especially his family,"" said a statement on the Wisconsin Professional Police Association's Facebook page. ""May we never forget his sacrifice and that of his loved ones who shared and supported his devotion to our common security."" A total of 1,501 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty between 2004 and 2013 -- an average of one death every 58 hours, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. CNN's John Newsome, Shane Deitert and Sam Stringer contributed to this report.","Wisconsin trooper killed during first solo assignment, police say .

"Beijing (CNN)Native to a remote region of China, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species --  and neither do most people. Rarer -- and some would argue cuter-- than the panda, there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, says conservationist Li Weidong. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili. Last July, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. ""I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,"" he told CNN. ""If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty."" In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Li said. Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters. ""They have nowhere else to retreat,"" he added. It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Li said. Disease may also be a factor in its decline. In 1983, when Li first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Li  found another two and it was declared a new species. In the decade following, Li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites. However, in 1992, Li left Ili to work with Xinjiang Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Urumqi. No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either. In 2002 and 2003, Li,  with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed. However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Li, along with Arizona State University biologist Andrew Smith, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s. The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered. In 2007, Li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika. Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras. This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Li's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a ""magic rabbit."" They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Li. ""This tiny species could be extinct any time,"" he said. ""They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore."" Li funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature. He says he has spent more than $32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas. But what upsets Li most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight. The Ili pika isn't included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, under the Ministry of Forestry, said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details. Li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal. ""I'm almost 60, and soon I won't be able to climb the Tianshan Mountains,"" he said. ""So I really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the Ili Pika.""","There are less than 1000 Ili pikas in existence, says Li Weidong .

"(CNN)Lindsey Vonn lifted her crystal globe prize with pride after winning the World Cup downhill title for a seventh time, Wednesday. A crystal ball might be more useful for the American star, who has faced plenty of slippery slopes in her dramatic skiing career. The 30-year-old has twice fought back from a career-threatening right knee injury but this season she has been back to her brilliant best. At the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty French resort of Meribel, Vonn raced to more records on the women's World Cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall. The sparkly spheres are handed out to winners of the World Cup individual disciplines. ""This downhill title probably means more to me than the others because I've been through so much,"" Vonn told CNN's Alpine Edge. ""It means everything to me, this is what I've been working so hard for for the last two years. ""This season definitely got off to a better start than I expected and I've had some ups and downs for sure but to come away with a globe after a long season is something that I'm really proud of, so it couldn't be better for me right now, I'm so thrilled."" Vonn, who credits boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her recovery, fended off the challenge of Austria's Anna Fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points. Despite the softening snow, the American won the downhill race with a fastest time of one minute, 29.87 seconds while Fenninger finished off the pace in eighth. As she crossed the line, she punched the air and screamed at the crowd when she saw she was in first position. After receiving her crystal globe, she celebrated with her team by popping champagne and spraying it over her nearby supporters. Vonn and Fenninger will renew their rivalry Thursday for the super-G title, where Vonn holds an eight-point lead over her challenger. If Vonn wins tomorrow she will equal Swede Ingemar Stenmark, who owns an overall record of 19 crystal globes. ""I'm not thinking about that,"" Vonn insisted with a laugh. ""It's always hard to get titles - it's a long season, and it takes a lot to win the crystal globe but tomorrow I'm just going to be focusing on skiing my best, just as I did today.""","Lindsey Vonn wins record-breaking seventh downhill title .

"(CNN)Mikaela Shiffrin is on course to make skiing history after claiming her third consecutive slalom victory on the World Cup circuit on Saturday. The young American is hoping to become the first woman to win both the discipline's world title and overall crown in successive seasons. Shiffrin, who retained her slalom title at February's world championships in Colorado, now has a 90-point lead going into next week's World Cup finale in France. ""I think the first couple races of the season I was pretty arrogant and was like, 'I'm just going to win these, I guess.' And I didn't. I wasn't even close,"" said Shiffrin, who has won the slalom Crystal Globe two years running. ""When you're racing at a high level -- or doing any sport at a high level -- everybody's going for the win. I learned that I can't take my foot off the gas and expect to win. These last races, I was pushing everything. Any race that I won this season, I was giving my entire heart into it. I'm proud of that."" A day after her 20th birthday, Shiffrin won by a comfortable 1.41 seconds at Are in Sweden as she claimed the 14th World Cup win of her career, with Slovakia's Veronika Velez Zuzulova second and Czech Republic's Sarka Strachova third. Slalom title rival Frida Hansdotter finished sixth in front of her home fans. Tina Maze missed a chance to close the gap on overall World Cup leader Anna Fenninger, who did not race, as the Slovenian finished back in 16th. Defending champion Fenninger has a 30-point lead following the Austrian's victory in Friday's giant slalom in Are, where Shiffrin was fourth and Maze 20th. Fenninger has an 86-point lead in the giant slalom standings from fellow Austrian Eva-Maria Brem -- who was third on Friday -- while Shiffrin is another 35 points back. Meanwhile, Marcel Hirscher clinched the men's giant slalom title ahead of the finals in Meribel as the Austrian finished second in Saturday's penultimate race in Slovenia. The 26-year-old now has a 128-point advantage as he seeks to win his fourth successive overall title as closest rival Kjetil Jansrud finished 23rd in Kranjska Gora. France's Alexis Pinturault won on Saturday to be second in the giant slalom standings ahead of American Ted Ligety and third in the overall competition. Olympic champion Ligety has won the last two giant slalom Crystal Globes but has dropped off the pace after a disappointing second half of the season. On Saturday, he was fourth behind France's Thomas Fanara. ""This is the first time since the change in the ski rules (after the 2011-12 season) that I've caught the globe in GS,"" Hirscher said. ""For me, it was two years with a lot of thinking and disappointment against Ted. ""I was 2.7 seconds behind Ted in the first race with the longer skis. We realized that we are so far away from Ted and that was the beginning of a long way and a lot of work, a lot of test and some different setup things.

"Minneapolis (CNN)Unexpected car repairs can blow anyone's budget. But when you're struggling to make ends meet, the impact can extend well beyond your bank account. As a social worker in Minneapolis, Cathy Heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients' health, their jobs, even their homes. For years, she wished someone would do something about the problem. Then one day Heying realized, ""Oh dang, I think that somebody might be me."" In 2008, she quit her full-time job and enrolled in automotive school. Five years later, armed with a degree in auto technology, Heying founded The Lift. Her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low-income individuals. The approach is simple: Heying sells parts at cost, with no markup, and charges $15 an hour for labor; the going rate in Minneapolis is around $100 an hour. The result? Big savings for her customers. And for those who can't pay in full, she will work out payment plans. To date, Heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low-income individuals, saving them more than $170,000 and keeping them on the road to success. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . I talked with Heying about her career change and what she's learned from her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. Kathleen Toner: One day you're a social worker, the next you're in automotive school. What was that like? Cathy Heying: Imagine a scene of a 38-year-old woman and 18-year-old boys. I want to talk about feelings and people, and they want to talk about cars. That sums it up. It was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift. I had to use my brain very differently. I did not grow up working on cars. I did not have a father that wrenched on cars. It was not part of my life growing up. I taught myself a few things (like) changing oil. But for the most part, I had no skills around car maintenance. I cried all the way to school the first day 'cause I was like, ""What have I done?"" So it was terrifying and overwhelming. And at least three solid times in that first quarter, I was like, ""I'm quitting. I cannot do this."" See more CNN Heroes . I give credit, at least in that first quarter, to one of my instructors who's now on the board of The Lift, who kept saying, ""I know that you have a good vision here, and I'm going to help you get through this."" And when I really thought about it, going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage, who are living with a broken-down car in subzero weather. Basically, I needed to buck up. Toner: What's it like being a mechanic? Heying: It's physically hard. You find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions, digging under things. You're lifting tires. You're wrenching on things. But it is mentally challenging, and it can be really frustrating. Because you have all the pieces and for some reason, something is not working, and it's like, ""What is it?"" And to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together, it is, I think, way more difficult than I think the average person thinks it is. I think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor. People come in, they give you a list of symptoms. You try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis. And sometimes we get it wrong, but most of the time we get it right. But it is an art and a science mixed into one. It's a very satisfying job, when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running. At the end of the day, you can feel really good because you can look back and be like, ""This is what I did today."" Toner: You're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff. How so? Heying: Different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives. Some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system. Two of the three techs that we have I met when they were both experiencing homelessness. And they are all trained, formal, certified technicians. And so that is another piece of the work that we do at The Lift. We take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on. Toner: You save your clients a lot of money. How do they react? Heying: For the most part, people are ecstatic when they get the bill. And that just makes such a huge difference in people's lives. We had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car. And he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he didn't have heat in his car. And so it's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school, even though that's a really important piece of it. It's really about protecting people's lives. For many people, having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together. And it really allows them to remain independent, to remain self-sufficient, to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity. Want to get involved?

"(CNN)The birthplace of Coca-Cola, ""Gone with the Wind"" and Martin Luther King Jr. is still home to the busiest passenger airport in the world. More than 96 million passengers went through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2014, an increase of 1.9% over 2013, according to Airports Council International's preliminary passenger traffic data, released Thursday. With more than 86 million passengers last year, Beijing Capital International Airport remained in second place and continued to close the gap just a bit more with Atlanta, according to the worldwide association of airports. It saw an increase of 2.9% over 2013. ATL24: 24 hours in the world's busiest airport . London's Heathrow Airport continued to hold on to third place for another year, with more than 73 million passengers, an increase of 1.4%. Toyko's Haneda Airport was fourth with nearly 73 million passengers, a 5.7% increase over 2013. The airports in fifth, sixth and seventh places swapped spots. Los Angeles International Airport moved up from sixth to fifth, Dubai moved up from seventh to sixth, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport dropped from fifth to seventh. There were no changes to Paris Charles de Gaulle (eighth place), Dallas/Fort Worth (ninth) and Hong Kong (10th). Passenger traffic continued to grow around the globe, with the world's airports serving more than 6.6 billion passengers in 2014, an increase of 5.1% over the previous year, according to the report. Though the news was mostly good for Atlanta, the city did lose some bragging rights. Chicago/Atlanta airport rivalry heats up . Chicago O'Hare took the top spot from Atlanta in the number of takeoffs and landings, officially known as aircraft movements. A spokesman for the Atlanta airport says its carriers are adding more aircraft with higher passenger capacity, which means fewer planes. O'Hare took first place with 881,000 movements, followed by Atlanta with 868,359 and Los Angeles with 708,674. Rounding out that list were Dallas/Fort Worth, Beijing, Denver, Charlotte, Las Vegas, Houston and London. Airport movements in both Chicago and Atlanta actually decreased compared with 2013. Chicago's movements dropped by 0.2%, and Atlanta's dropped by 4.7%. Hong Kong's airport is still the busiest cargo airport in the world, transporting more than 4.4 million metric tons of cargo in 2014. Memphis, Tennessee, home to FedEx, came in second place with 4.2 million metric tons and Shanghai was third with nearly 3.2 million metric tons. (One metric ton equals 2,205 pounds.) Rounding out the top 10 were cargo airports in Incheon, South Korea; Anchorage, Alaska; Dubai; Louisville, Kentucky; Tokyo (Narita); Frankfurt, Germany; and Taipei, Taiwan. The Airports Council International preliminary traffic report was based on data from 1,095 airports worldwide. A final version will be released later in the year.","Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta is again the world's busiest passenger airport .

"(CNN)I've dressed up in the same type of costume on Halloween for years -- always a superhero. Not one character in particular. ""Just any excuse to put on a wig and a cape,"" I'd tell friends. Last year, I found a more specific persona. I would be Wonder Woman. See, this Halloween was different: I'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before, and donning this costume was a lighthearted way to feel empowered ahead of the biggest fight of my life. It was Saturday, October 25, 2014 -- earlier than usual for me to think about a costume for my favorite holiday. But this year, I wouldn't be able to party on the same day as everyone else. I was organizing one last massive celebration to honor my life and the people I love before my brain surgery two days later. It all started early one morning in September while I was wrapping up my work as a digital producer for CNN's ""New Day."" As I was typing at the computer, letters were dropping off the right side of the screen. I started to feel strange and went to the nurse's office in my building to ask for help. My speech began to slur, my hands were tingling, and my head was pounding. I also forgot my co-workers' and bosses' names. The nurse thought I could be having a stroke and called an ambulance. Within an hour, I went from thinking I might have a migraine because I needed new glasses to being rushed to the hospital. I was 28 years old. They stripped off my clothes in the emergency room to hook me up to the machines that would reveal I wasn't having a stroke. Great news! But then, what was going on? First Person: Shopping for a new coat unleashes old memories . After an MRI, we had the beginning of an answer. When I looked at the scan of my brain, sitting there, big as an orange, in the left hemisphere was a large black spot. My speech came back fully after a few hours, but a terrible headache lingered all day, and I was kept in the hospital overnight without discussing with the medical staff the full details of what was found on the scan. My family and I were scheduled to meet with a brain surgeon the next morning. About 6 a.m., I was asleep when a resident came into my room and woke me up. He wanted to talk about my case, he said. ""My parents are coming later, and we're meeting with the doctor,"" I told this stranger. ""Ms. Moskowitz, we suspect you have a meningioma."" He could have been speaking Russian. ""We see you have a brain tumor, and you'll have to have surgery to have it removed,"" he said in a calm, even tone. I don't remember what I asked him after that, but once he left, I felt hopeless and alone. Tears poured out of my eyes, and I sucked in air when I ran out of breath. It was the most afraid I've ever been in my life. When my parents arrived, we met with the surgeon, who offered more clarity. He suspected that the tumor was slowly growing deep in the left ventricle of my brain for years. And the incident at work?  Perhaps a miniseizure related to the tumor, but they couldn't be sure. I was told the mass wasn't life-threatening at that point and probably was not cancer, but the location was very deep and unique. The tumor was growing in an open tunnel in my brain and would eventually grow big enough to block the flow of spinal fluid.  Surgery was recommended sooner rather than later. First Person: Caught in grief's riptide . After my terrible experience earlier in the day with the resident who loved to share bad news and disappear, I knew I didn't want to have my surgery at this hospital. It was time to shop around for a brain surgeon. Two weeks after the incident at work, I saw a doctor at NYU who talked about the surgery in dire terms. There was a 10% chance I would need a shunt to help drain excess fluid from my brain for the rest of my life. Unsatisfied with that option, I kept browsing. Wonderful colleagues and friends within the CNN Medical Unit helped me find Dr. Jeffrey Bruce at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Dr. Bruce is a tall, commanding man with the confidence and swagger you'd hope for in a brain surgeon. Somehow, his description of the seven-hour procedure and what would come later didn't seem as scary as before. We booked the date for the surgery at the end of October. ""This is just like a pebble in my brain,"" I told friends. ""They'll get it out, and I can move on with my life."" Two days before the operation, my friends and family gathered at a bar in Brooklyn for that pre-Halloween, prebirthday, presurgery party. I wore a short blue wig with my Wonder Woman outfit and set up a photo area to document everyone's costumes. We all laughed and danced for hours, and at the end of the party, whoever was left did the Hora. We ran in and out of a circle, joyfully raising our hands in the air. Ghosts and pumpkins mingled with birthday decor. Although I was born at the end of November, I wanted to cover all my holidays since I had no idea what the future would hold. First Person: The only Cuba I've ever known . What if they took the tumor out and it was cancer after all? What if they couldn't get the whole thing during the operation and had to do radiation later? What about that shunt? What if ANYTHING went wrong and I would never be myself again? At the hospital, my family bickered about who got a chair in the waiting room as I sat silently, waiting to be whisked through the double doors and into the rest of my life. Once I was on the operating table with the IV in, the anesthesiologist started the magic medicine, and I barely started to count before I was knocked out. I woke up one brain tumor lighter and surrounded by the people I love. I spent five days in the hospital, mostly sleeping from the antiseizure medicine. Real Halloween came and passed. Friends and co-workers came to the hospital to tell me stories about their holiday adventures and share pictures of their nights. If I was ever lonely or uncertain about my place in the world before, having this experience was a relatively quick way to discover that I have tremendous love and support in my life. My recovery has taken a lot of hard work. I went straight from the hospital to inpatient rehab to weekly outpatient care, working on speech, occupational therapy and memory recall. I did so well there, I was named February's ""Patient of the Month."" When my doctor recently told me I've had the best recovery she's ever seen over her 20-year career, I burst into tears of joy. The experience has given me confidence in my resilience and more perspective than before on the importance of living in the present, because things could always be worse -- completely out of nowhere and totally unexpectedly. That fact was solidified when just a month after my surgery, my best friend's sister died from a brain aneurysm. Survivor's guilt overwhelmed me, but so did a sense of gratitude. I don't have an answer as to why I'm OK and my friend is gone, but I know it makes me push harder as I sweat through spin class and linger longer while I stare at sunsets and beautiful views. My zest for life itself -- the good and bad -- is so much stronger than before. I returned to work part-time, working one day a week starting in February. I'm at two days a week now and hope to be back producing digital content full-time for ""New Day"" by May. Though I'm now at the edge of 30 with a new identity as a survivor, I don't consider myself a superhero. At least not until next Halloween.","""New Day"" Digital Producer Jessica Moskowitz was diagnosed with a brain tumor in September .

"(CNN)Angelina Jolie's essay in the New York Times revealing that she had her ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed to lower her risk of cancer provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. Jolie, 39, wrote that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Many were inspired by her decision and her choice to open up about the surgery. Others saw an opportunity for helping educate women and advocate for their health, a cause near and dear to Jolie's own heart. Some worried for the star, who wrote in her op-ed that ""the fact is I remain prone to cancer."" The Internet being what it is, others took Jolie's announcement as a chance to mock.

"Maui, Hawaii (CNN)When she was just 4 years old, Chelsea Elliott went blind in her left eye. Then, two years later, she lost hearing in her right ear. Now 24, Elliott might have been spared years of struggle if her rare eye condition -- known as Coats disease -- had been caught earlier. Not wanting other children to feel the same frustration, anger and limitations, Elliott launched a nonprofit that offers free vision and hearing screenings to school-age children -- particularly from lower income communities. Here's a stunning statistic: 25% of U.S. children ages 5-17 suffer from vision problems, according to the National Commission on Vision and Health. Nonetheless, eight states still fail to require vision screenings at schools. Undetected and untreated, eye disorders can result in delayed reading and poorer academic outcomes. Elliott's organization, the Half-Helen Foundation, has screened nearly 9,000 children in Texas and Hawaii since its 2013 launch. As you might guess, the name honors Helen Keller -- who overcame blindness and hearing loss as an infant. Before her death in 1968, Keller learned to speak and then eventually earned degrees from Radcliffe College and Harvard University, inspiring countless people around the world. ""When I learned about Helen Keller for the first time in the fourth grade, I surmised that I am half blind and half deaf like half Helen,"" said Elliott. ""What better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf?"" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . I talked with Elliott about the motivation behind her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: You do vision screenings right in the schools. How does it work? Chelsea Elliott: We use our tool, the Spot camera. This device allows us to test for the six most common vision impairments in children in seconds. We are looking to see if they're near-sighted, if they're far-sighted, if they have astigmatism, or if they're at risk for conditions like lazy eye or strabismus or if there's a difference in pupil size. The Spot camera is a hand-held autorefractor that takes a picture of a child's eyes. It has multi-colored Infrared light -- a red, blue and green light that flashes. Children tell me it looks like a video game. Often I'm trying to get the child to look straight into the camera. So once I capture their attention, the camera will capture the image and the screening is done. It's that quick. We learn so much more about a child's vision health in a fraction of the time it takes to do a basic eye chart test. After the screening, we deliver referral reports to the school health aide to distribute to the families. The families communicate directly with us if they need assistance in seeking corrective wear or access to an eye care professional. If a child passes, all the better. But if a child fails, then we've found one who we can help, and that's one less child who has to know the struggle or the headaches or the frustration from not being able to see. See more CNN Heroes . CNN: Your efforts first started in Texas. Why did you choose to focus on Hawaii next? Elliott: The state of Hawaii currently does not require vision or hearing screenings in schools. So it has been left to the hands of service or civic organizations. Only certain schools on the island were receiving vision screenings, when it was convenient. It wasn't being done (systematically). So I reached out to some civic groups here that had been conducting screenings and asked if I could come out and present how we do our work. And they, in turn, invited me to come out for a year and pilot our Maui 528 program. It's the perfect pilot group size. With 21,000 students and the technology available, we calculated it would actually take us about 528 hours to screen all 21,000 students. CNN: How can a vision problem affect a child's education? Elliott: A child's learning can be set back several years by not being able to see the words on the page or if they're at a slant, if they're blurred, if they're nonexistent. They lose that self-confidence in their learning, that drive to push them forward, all because they were never screened for a potential condition that is easily correctable. It's so commonly assumed that you can see a problem. I was 4 years old, and I had no visual symptoms. A common misunderstanding with the need for these services is that if a child has a vision problem, they'll tell you. How can they tell you if that's the only reality they know? Because preventative care is the most important thing we can provide, and we have a way now to conduct it so efficiently and effectively, there's no reason not to provide this service. I would like to see every state require preventative screenings in order to ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to the best education possible. That's our way forward. CNN: Where does the name of your organization come from? Elliott: When I learned about Helen Keller for the first time in the fourth grade, I surmised that I am half blind and half deaf like half Helen. So that became the nickname from fourth grade on. And then when I graduated from college and I realized what my purpose was in this life, I realized what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf? Helen Keller did so many extraordinary things with her life, I can only hope to be half as wonderful as she is. Want to get involved?

"Boston (CNN)It was 9:35 on a slow Thursday night in April 2013 and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Chief John DiFava was about to call it quits. On his way out, he saw one of his rookie swing-shift officers, Sean Collier, sitting in his cruiser. He stopped to say goodnight. ""I chatted with him for a few minutes. I told him to be safe and I left,"" the chief told a crowded courtroom on Wednesday. He estimated the conversation lasted three, maybe four minutes. ""Did you ever see Sean Collier alive again after that?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb asked. ""I did not."" Less than an hour later, Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head.  His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. DiFava and other officers, assisted by surveillance videos, 911 callers and a lone bicyclist who happened to be passing by, recounted Collier's last moments in the death penalty trial of admitted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The bicyclist, MIT mathematics Ph.D. candidate Nathan Harman, pointed to Tsarnaev in court and identified him as the man with ""a big nose,"" who he saw leaning into Collier's squad car. He said Tsarnaev appeared to be alone. Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time, does not dispute that he was present when Collier was killed on the evening of April 18, nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier that killed three people and hurt more than 240 others. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. The FBI had released photos of the pair five hours earlier, and they were on the run. But Tamerlan, 26, would not survive the night. He was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an ""officer down"" at MIT. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. Collier's beat was the area of North Quad near Main and Vassar streets. He had been handling a routine call about a citizen who was upset his car had been towed. A young man called 911 about 10:20 p.m. and reported hearing loud noises outside his window. ""They don't sound exactly like gunshots,"" the caller told dispatcher David Sacco. He wasn't sure what they were. Maybe somebody banging on trash cans. Sacco tried to summon Collier on his police radio. No response. He sent an emergency alert. Nothing. He tried texting him. Still no response. ""It became an amount of time that wasn't comfortable,"" he said. Sgt. Clarence Henniger had returned to the station at the end of his shift, and had just passed Collier on the way in. He saw nothing out of the ordinary. But when he heard dispatch couldn't raise Collier, he went back out to check on him. His car was in the same spot. ""I parked about 8-10 meters away from Officer Collier's car,"" Henniger said.  ""When I arrived at the cruiser I looked inside and that's when I observed a wound to the head, to the temple. I observed a wound to the neck and I observed a wound to his hand."" Prosecutor Weinreb asked: ""Was there blood?"" ""Yes sir,"" the witness responded. ""Where?"" ""All over the car and his body."" Jurors heard Henniger's frantic call over the police radio: . ""Officer down! Officer down! Get me help! Officer down."" He called for an ambulance, shouting, ""Get on it!!!"" He and another officer pulled Collier out of the squad car to attempt to revive him. ""The amount of blood on his body made it difficult to get a grip on him,"" Henniger said. The other officer urged Collier to ""Hang in there, just hang in there,"" and asked ""Who did this to you?"" Collier did not respond. Cambridge police officer Brendan O'Hearn joined them, and took over applying chest compressions. ""His face and neck were covered with blood. There was some type of wound to his head,"" O'Hearn said. Collier was gurgling and blood was coming from his mouth . ""There was blood everywhere,"" O'Hearn added. Weinreb asked, ""Did it transfer to you?"" ""All over me."" Collier became the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. Campus surveillance cameras captured the encounter between Collier and his killer. The footage was shot from a distance and at times, it is difficult to determine whether the cameras captured one person and a shadow or a pair walking closely together. The video shows Collier's patrol car idling near the front of the Koch Institute building, and a person or two people rounding the corner and walking towards it. The brake lights flash on, then off, and then off again. Two people can be seen running back around the corner. Off to the side, somebody on a bicycle rides by without stopping. Harman, the grad student on the bicycle, often used the word ""they"" in his testimony at first, but said he saw just one person as he pedaled past. ""When I went by, the front door was open, the driver's side door,"" he said. ""There was someone leaning into the driver's side door."" He said the person -- although he used the word ""they"" -- was bent at the waist and leaning into the patrol car. ""They stood up, startled, as I rode my bike by them,"" he added. Later in his testimony, he began referring to ""they"" as ""he."" ""I only saw one person,"" he said. ""He sort of snapped up, stood up, and turned around. He looked startled. We made eye contact."" Asked to describe who he saw, Harman added, ""I remember thinking he had a big nose."" He looked across the courtroom at Tsarnaev, pointed, and said, ""He's right there."" The prosecution's case has brought one dramatic day of testimony after another in the federal courthouse overlooking Boston Harbor. On Tuesday, prosecutors displayed photos of what they called Tsarnaev's ""manifesto,"" scrawled in pencil on the sides of a dry-docked pleasure boat where he sought refuge April 19. Blood streaks and bullet holes punctuated his words, which he does not deny writing. The only issue in dispute is whether it is a confession or something else.","Testimony focuses on shooting death of MIT officer, 26 .

"(CNN)A 30-year-old California woman was abducted from a male acquaintance's residence in the Bay Area and is being held for ransom, police said Tuesday. The male acquaintance, also 30, witnessed the kidnapping of Denise Louise Huskins from the Vallejo home, and he is not a suspect in the case, said Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park. ""Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown, and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom,"" Park told reporters. ""We're worried about Ms. Huskins' welfare. We don't know where she's at. And that's why we're coming to the public asking for their help."" Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said. She works as a physical therapist, police added. She is employed at a Kaiser Hospital, CNN affiliate KGO reported, citing her Facebook page. A cousin of Huskins, Amy Mattison, told CNN affiliate KPIX that the 30-year-old man is Huskins' boyfriend and she was abducted from his residence. Park declined to comment on the nature of the relationship between Huskins and the 30-year-old man who saw and reported the kidnapping. About 75 people from the Solano County Search and Rescue Team were searching for Huskins in nearby woods and on Mare Island, Park said. Huskins' 2000 White Toyota Camry was found in Vallejo and may have been moved from the residence, Park said. Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said. Park didn't disclose the amount of the ransom being sought. ""All I can tell is there was a ransom demand,"" Park said. Police are asking the public's help in locating Huskins, who was described as white, 5-foot-7, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. Vallejo police asked the FBI to help their investigation.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong's newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world's second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. The monastery is funded entirely by Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong's harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect ""important guests."" ""We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,"" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. ""There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,"" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online.

"Lynchburg, Virginia  (CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand from Texas, became the first Republican to announce his campaign for the presidency, and he spent Monday morning telling a crowd at the largest Christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office, and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign. ""These are all of our stories,"" Cruz told the audience Monday, roaming around the circular stage at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to Washington. ""These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant."" Cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future, repeatedly and emphatically asking the Liberty University student audience to ""imagine"" the U.S. under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a Cruz presidency. The senator from Texas, who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to Obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government, presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment Republicans such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- candidates Cruz coyly refers to as the ""mushy middle."" Monday's event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout, following Cruz's announcement of his candidacy in a 30-second video message posted on Twitter shortly after midnight on Monday, roughly 24 hours after the Houston Chronicle first reported his planned announcement. Ten thousand students from Liberty University crowded into the university's main arena for Cruz's announcement. The venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give Cruz an early boost among evangelical voters, who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like Iowa and South Carolina that have early nominating contests. It was a youthful crowd, as students are required to attend the University's tri-weekly convocation address. Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red ""Stand with Rand"" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month. Jerry Falwell Jr., the university's president and son of its founder and evangelical icon, introduced Cruz as a senator who ""has gone against the tide"" and a ""man of great character,"" all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office. Falwell picked up on Cruz's assertion that millions of evangelical Christians did not vote in 2012, pointing out that ""if any candidate can energize that group, it will make a huge difference in any national race."" Asked after the speech how he prepared for the event, Cruz said he ""spent some time in prayer"" thinking about the message he wants to convey. ""At the end of the day it's listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around,"" Cruz told CNN, adding that he was ""incredibly"" encouraged and inspired by the support. Cruz's announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which Cruz has fought in the Senate to repeal. Cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal ""every word"" of the healthcare law as president. Cruz also jabbed at Common Core education standards -- which Bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the IRS, instead suggesting Americans could file their taxes on a postcard. And Cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to ""imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel."" Cruz's advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and Christian conservative circles. A constant and vocal critic of the Obama administration, Cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against Obamacare in 2013, which led to a tense standoff between Democrats and Republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown. The showdown was punctuated by Cruz's 21-hour speech on the Senate floor. While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. A CNN/ORC International survey conducted this month on the hypothetical Republican primary showed Cruz came in with 4% support among Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the field is still relatively open, with the top contender -- Bush -- coming in at 16% support, followed by Scott Walker at 13%. But Cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he is viewed in a positive light by 45% of Republicans, compared with only 8% who don't have a favorable opinion of him. Still, 46% say they haven't heard enough about him to form an opinion. Jason Miller, an adviser to Cruz's campaign, confirmed that the campaign's fund-raising target is $40 million, and the campaign believes it can raise $1 million in the first week. Cruz this month finished an early-voting state tour to Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire -- and he's scheduled to return to New Hampshire on March 28 to speak at a brunch in Rockingham County. Depending on the Senate schedule this week, he could possibly make more early-state trips, according to advisers. After his speech Monday, he'll head up to New York for media appearances and a fund-raiser. Cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in Texas as a little-known candidate, forcing then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment Republican. Along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president (Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), Cruz will likely face questions over experience, an issue that Republicans brought up in 2008 against Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator at the time. Before running for the Senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- Cruz was solicitor general of Texas and argued before the Supreme Court. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother, Cruz was a dual citizen until he renounced Canadian citizenship in 2014. He faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency, though law experts consider him a natural-born citizen because he was born to an American mother. Cruz was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena. He took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour, as his team tried to escort him through the crowd. One girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give Cruz a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $20. A pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to Cruz to tell him that, like his own daughters, they were also named Caroline and Catherine and were two years apart. ""That's just cool,"" he said, as he gave them both high fives. ""That is awesome."" One student who said she was Hispanic said she and her whole family were behind him. ""You have the Hispanic vote,"" she joked, then proceeded to start talking to him Spanish. While Cruz's father is Cuban, he's not fluent in Spanish. ""We grew up speaking Spanglish. My grandmother would be like 'Nino, throw me the remote control',"" he said This is who we are as a people. We got to tell that story,"" Cruz said. CNN's Adam Levy and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Cruz announces candidacy in a video on Twitter .

"(CNN)Idaho wildlife officials have retrieved 2,000 dead snow geese that fell from the sky  this week. The birds, whose carcasses were collected over the weekend, appear to have died of avian cholera, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said Tuesday. ""The migratory birds were on the return leg of their migration from the southwestern United States and Mexico to their breeding grounds on the northern coast of Alaska,"" said Steve Schmidt, a regional supervisor. They died near Dubois,  Terreton and  Roberts -- all in the eastern part of the state. It's unclear where the geese picked the bacteria from, but authorities are scrambling to ensure that other birds don't feed on the carcasses and spread the disease. ""The important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible, to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds,"" Schmidt said. ""Biologists observed about 20 eagles in the vicinity of some of the carcasses. Because of a delayed incubation period it is uncertain where these eagles might be located, if and when the avian cholera affects them."" Though the official lab results are not out, officials said the cause of death points to avian cholera. Humans are not considered at high risk of getting the disease, according to U.S. health officials.","The birds were on the return leg of their migration from the U.S. and Mexico .
Wildlife officials say they appear to have died of avian cholera ."
"(CNN)America used to be a place where we said, ""Give me liberty or give me death."" We live by a credo that ""freedom isn't free,"" and that our Constitution is worth dying for. How inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the Eagle's wings. Unfortunately, whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort, we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts. The latest example:  Nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song. Immediately, the University of Oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech. Forget whether you like the speech or not. That is not relevant. These boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song, on their own time, in a privately rented bus, simply because the government didn't like the content of their song. Opinion: What's the right way to face racism? Censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise. What surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions, and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the First Amendment on its head, because of nine seconds of video. I don't like the song or its message either. I can't imagine anyone reasonable who would. But I want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not I should be punished, based on what words I used. That is not freedom. I understand that most of us hate racism. We are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners. But I am not willing to trade the First Amendment for a society where we don't need to hear racist words. In Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech, and which became the dominant theory in First Amendment jurisprudence. In Abrams, Holmes gave us ""the marketplace of ideas."" And what a brilliant theory it was. Holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right, then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views. ""If you have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep away all opposition."" Those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right. I believe in a racism-free world.  I have marched in counterprotests against the Ku Klux Klan. I've stood up in places you don't want to be, against violent neo-Nazis. And I would do it again. But I feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the First Amendment to fight racism. Some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts. Unfortunately, that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay. I am not. As certain as I am that my views on race are correct, I cannot shake Holmes' wisdom from my mind. He wrote: . ""But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution."" For that reason, I would gladly protest against the KKK, but I would never abide any government official denying the KKK its right to speak. I understand those who would wish to do so. They want to eradicate racism, and the end will justify the means. However, we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements. Of course, some say that these were more than ""offensive."" The song was a ""threat."" After all, it did mention lynching black people. But was that really a threat?  An idiotic ditty in an all-white bus? To call it a threat is disingenuous. What about the disruptive nature of the song? Should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them, and who carry these offensive racist thoughts? Yes. They should be free to have these thoughts, they should be free to say these things. If it crosses the line into action, or even imminent incitement to action, that's another story. In this case, that never happened. The First Amendment prevails here. Opinion: The danger society doesn't talk about . It is easy to claim that these Sigma Alpha Epsilon boys did not deserve First Amendment protection. Many have said so. But, when you hear that, your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism. The First Amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility. In fact, it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges. It is there for the KKK, the Nazis, SAE, and you alike. It is there for words that shock us, challenge us, and that bother us. You should want to protect the SAE boys -- not that they deserve it. You should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular. Once, speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be ""bad speech."" Once, professors were kicked off campus for not being ""anti-gay enough."" But, today, the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace. Let that victory stand, without trying to cement it with the force of law, and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these ""good thoughts"" to flourish in the first place.","University of Oklahoma students were expelled after video surfaced of racist song .

"(CNN)A group of foreign medical students are thought to have traveled to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals, a Turkish lawmaker told CNN Sunday. The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said. Ediboglu, an opposition Turkish lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. ""They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,"" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper. But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle. ""Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors,"" he told The Observer. ""They went there to help, not to fight."" Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated and three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan. Now, at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer. In an interview published Monday in Turkey's Hürriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children. Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter, Lena, who is one of the students. ""I know you want to help people and be of use. But you can do this in another way,"" he told the newspaper. ""There are many who need your help. But this is not the way. Please, come back."" British officials said they are aware of the report. ""We are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the Turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts,"" the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said in a statement. Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS' ranks. Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by. Last year, a 19-year-old Colorado woman was arrested at Denver International Airport as she was about to embark on a journey to an ISIS camp, where she hoped to serve as a nurse. CNN's Nimet Kirac and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","Worried father sends message to daughter: ""Please, come back""

"United Nations (CNN)Tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown-up photos printed on poster board. Suddenly, one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos: a man whose eyes have been gouged out. Manjula Sharma, visiting the United Nations from India, gasps when she realizes what she is looking at. ""How could anybody do this?"" she said, while looking at the photos with a pained expression. ""It's not war. It's not drought. It's not natural calamity. It's torture."" The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U.N. Secretariat Building. It's a no-frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called ""Caesar,"" a Syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police. Caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day, and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country. Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals, and accuse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the torture and killings. The photos show emaciated bodies. Some have eyes gouged out, some have genitals removed. And many are covered with wounds, the flesh peeling from their bodies. It's a sight that gave pause to Anders Frantzen, who works at the United Nations and was running late to a meeting. ""I told myself I really wanted to come back here and take a proper look. It looks like something you haven't seen since the Second World War. It's very bad,"" Frantzen said. ""It's difficult to put a face, an image to the numbers we hear about. So you see these pictures (and) it sort of puts things in a new perspective."" While the photos have been shown before Congress and in media reports, many people, like Sharma, had no idea they existed. That's partly why Mouaz Moustafa, senior political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, said he placed the photos in this location. He wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on U.N. Security Council member states to vote for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. ""If you ask anyone about ISIS from Mississippi to Alabama, everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity,"" Moustafa said. ""If you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the Assad regime, it doesn't get, I feel, it doesn't get the same coverage."" The Syrian Mission to the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit. The exhibit will be at the United Nations until March 24.","35 photos of tortured bodies are on display at the United Nations .

"(CNN)Earlier this month, Shahindokht Molaverdi, Iran's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, led an official delegation to the United Nations in New York to attend the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In her March 11 speech to the commission, Molaverdi said that ""the Islamic Republic of Iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status...on its agenda."" Molaverdi described the significant progress Iranian women have made in education and science, citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women's rights. There was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including Iran's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving Iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment. Unfortunately, Molaverdi's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality. On the day she delivered her speech, Amnesty International released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before Iran's parliament that would further restrict women's rights. One would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed ""traditional"" families in society. The other would ""further entrench gender-based discrimination, particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children,"" Amnesty said. A day later, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, released his fourth report to the U.N. Human Rights Council describing the dire state of human rights in the country. His report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that Human Rights Watch and others had raised during Iran's 2014 Universal Periodic Review, a review of every U.N. state's human rights record every four years by the Human Rights Council. The sobering reality, all too familiar to Molaverdi, is that Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators. The proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women's rights in recent years. To many, the discrepancy between what Molaverdi said in her speech, and what women face in Iran, smacked of diplomatic subterfuge. Activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women's rights in Iran, and called out Molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that Iranian women face. Yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that Molaverdi, who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women's rights at home, and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for Iran's beleaguered rights activists. Just two days before the U.N. session, Iran's conservative Kayhan daily, thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, published an article that showed just what Iran's women's rights activists are up against. The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U.N. commission, describing its notion of ""gender equality"" as ""unacceptable to the Islamic Republic."" The article accused Molaverdi of ""negligence"" for participating in events that could damage Iran's reputation and interests, and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran's security and intelligence agencies. What's striking about Kayhan's attack is that Iran's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups, including women's rights activists. Groups like the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women, were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious ""national security"" grounds. But those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting. Anyone who fails, willingly or unknowingly, to heed their threats may face reprisals, as several activists who attempted to attend similar U.N. events in previous years found out. Yet Kayhan's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women's groups in Iran as they continue to challenge the state's monopoly on the women's rights narrative. While Iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution, their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education, health care, and birth control. The image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by Iran's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many Iranian women today. So while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what Molaverdi said at the United Nations, and what Iranian women face, let us not lose sight of another reality: the paradox that exists in Iran between the state's regressive laws and policies against women, and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied. That effort, at the very least, deserves our respect.","Faraz Sanei : Women's groups in Iran have remained adaptable .

"(CNN)With its snow-capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets, the Bleone Valley, where a Germanwings jet crashed Tuesday, is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot. Tiny villages are scattered along the gorge, which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) above sea level. Many of these villages, which were bustling communities in the 19th century, now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants. One dead-end road, the D107, winds its way through Prads-Haute-Bleone, passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers. But the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the Germanwings plane difficult. Gilles Gravier, director of the tourist office in Val d'Allos, told French newspaper Liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the Trois Eveches mountain, and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area's slopes. ""There is no access by road; emergency crews are coming in by air, using helicopters,"" he said. Capt. Benoit Zeisser from the Gendarmerie in the nearby town of Digne told CNN the aircraft was lying in ""difficult terrain."" Sandrine Boisse, the president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened. ""It was about 11 (a.m.) here. I was outside the garage, and we heard a strange noise, "" she said. ""And at first we thought it was an avalanche, but it was strange at this time because it was 11. ""Something was wrong. ... We didn't know what."" Her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude, she said. French President Francois Hollande warned ""it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site."" Photographs posted on Twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off, and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims' remains. The bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in Seyne les Alpes, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the crash site, which will be used as a temporary morgue. French police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site, urging them ""not to clutter the roads,"" leaving them clear for emergency vehicles.","Resident tells CNN she initially mistook the noise from the crash for an avalanche .

"(CNN)Blue Bell ice cream has added another product to the list of items it's recalling over potential contamination with listeria. The company said Monday that it's recalling 3 oz. institutional/food service cups of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test detected listeria in one of the cups recovered from a Kansas hospital. There have been no illnesses reported from the cups, Blue Bell said. The contaminated cup was produced at a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in April 2014, the company said. Earlier this month the company recalled a group of products that were made at a plant in Texas as Kansas health officials said three people had died in the past year from a listeria outbreak that could be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products. A total of five people have contracted the serious infection in Kansas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had eaten milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. ""We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,"" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. ""Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected."" Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the CDC. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth. The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said ""this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups."" This is the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.","A test in Kansas found listeria in a Blue Bell Ice Cream cup .

"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso will not race in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on the advice of doctors treating him for the effects of a high-speed crash. The double world champion was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test in Barcelona last month. The Spaniard is now recovering at home but doctors have indicated returning to racing in Melbourne three weeks after after the high impact could be too risky. Alonso commented on Twitter: ""It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days ""NO"". McLaren explained in a statement: ""Fernando's doctors have recommended to him that, following the concussion he sustained on February 22nd, for the time being he should seek to limit as far as is possible any environmental risk factors that could potentially result in his sustaining another concussion."" Kevin Magnussen -- who effectively lost his seat to Alonso when the Spaniard returned to McLaren after his Ferrari exit -- will race alongside Jenson Button in the Australian Grand Prix on March 15th. Alonso's return to the starting grid in McLaren colors has been delayed by his freakish crash at the Circuit de Catalunya, home to the Spanish Grand Prix. McLaren had explained that Alonso's ""accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time."" Turn Three, where the accident took place, is an area of the circuit where cross winds are known to affect the balance of the cars. The 33-year-old posted a video on social media on Friday to thank his fans for his support and update them on his condition. Standing in a garden, a smiling Alonso said: ""As you can see I'm completely fine. I will rest and keep you updated next week with progress and see you very soon on the track."" But his return to the racing asphalt has now been delayed until at least the Malaysian Grand Prix at the end of March despite doctors saying he has no symptoms of illness. ""Having performed an exhaustive series of tests and scans -- some of them as recently as yesterday evening --  Alonso's doctors have informed him that they find him asymptomatic of any medical issue; that they see no evidence whatsoever of any injury,"" McLaren said in a statement. ""They therefore describe him as entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives alike."" However, in order to limit the risk of a secondary concussion Alonso has accepted the advice not to race but has continued his preparations for the new F1 season. ""Fernando's doctors acknowledge that he feels fit and well, and that he regards himself as ready to race,"" the statement continued. ""They are comfortable with the fact that he has already recommenced physical training, with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his McLaren-Honda car for the Malaysian Grand Prix. Indeed, his doctors are supportive of that ambition."" Alonso chose to leave Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season and rejoin McLaren, which is also renewing its technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. The Spaniard -- regarded by his peers as the best driver on the grid -- is chasing a third world crown but, so far, he has not had chance to gauge the possibilities of realizing that ambition with McLaren. Early reliability problems meant Alonso had only completed 117 laps in the MP4-30 race car before his preseason was curtailed by the crash.","Fernando Alonso will not race in season-opening Australian Grand Prix .

"(CNN)Tiger Woods won't be playing at Arnold Palmer's charity tournament next week, but he still hopes to be lining up with the golf legend at the season's opening major. While the 85-year-old Palmer has vowed to overcome a shoulder injury to fulfil his ceremonial tee-off role at the Masters, Woods is still trying to get his game in shape. The former world No. 1 has competed only twice this year, missing the cut at the Phoenix Open in early February before withdrawing in the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open due to his ongoing back problems. ""Tiger called me personally to let me know that he wouldn't be playing here at Bay Hill,"" Palmer said on his PGA Tour event's website. ""He said that his game is not quite ready yet and that he was disappointed that he won't be able to play in the tournament, which has always meant a lot to him. I'm sorry that he won't be playing. We'll certainly miss him, but I understand and appreciated that he called me."" Woods has won the Arnold Palmer Invitational a record eight times, the last of which came in 2013. However, he has not added to his total of 14 major wins since 2008, but hopes to be in contention at Augusta from April 9-12. ""I've put in a lot of time and work on my game and I'm making strides, but like I've said, I won't return to the PGA Tour until my game is tournament ready and I can compete at the highest level,"" the 39-year-old said on his website. ""I hope to be ready for the Masters, and I will continue to work hard preparing for Augusta."" Palmer first hosted the Bay Hill tournament in 1979 and it took his name from 2007. It raises money for two Florida hospitals named for the seven-time major winner and his late wife Winnie. ""I am so proud of what has been accomplished at the hospitals over the past 25 years. It is always a privilege to know that we are making a difference in the lives of families throughout the community,"" said Palmer after his medical center was named one of the best for children in the U.S. for 2014-15. He hurt his shoulder in December after tripping on carpet when he was about to make a speech at a PGA Tour father/son event. World No. 1 Rory McIlroy will make his first appearance at Palmer's March 19-22 tournament, which features a restricted field, while top-five players Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and Jason Day will also take part.

"(CNN)An online group claiming affiliation with Islamic State terrorists has threatened American military members and their families in the past, and over the weekend, a new threat surfaced on the Web. A group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division posted the names, photos and addresses of about 100 U.S. troops online, calling for attacks against them. The file, posted online Saturday before being removed, claimed to have hacked military databases and said it was leaking 100 names ""so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you."" The possibility of lone-wolf attacks in the United States, the type that this message calls for, is a threat officials take seriously. A U.S. law enforcement official said that all 100 or so troops named in the file are being contacted. It is believed that ISIS members and sympathizers have been scouring social media sites trying to glean as much information as possible about service members, and have even threatened the spouses of military personnel online. One military wife recalls recently staying up all night and deleting every Facebook picture of her children, every post that mentioned them or where they went to school. She Googled herself, trying to figure out how easy it would be to find where the family lived. In the morning, she went to her car and scraped the military decal off the front window. As the spouse of a Special Forces soldier, she's always tried to be conscious of how much she advertises that she and her three young children are a military family. ""It's hard because I am so proud of what my husband does, but lately so many spouses that I know are actually scared that they could be targets of ISIS or someone who sympathizes with ISIS,"" she told CNN in January, asking that CNN keep her name out of the story for that reason. Pro-ISIS hackers have never been responsible for a major cyber breach but some experts worry their capabilities are growing. J.M. Berger, co-author of ""ISIS: the State of Terror,"" told CNN,  ""There are indications some former members of Anonymous and TeaMp0isoN (another hacking group) are now hacking on behalf of ISIS."" The large majority of those within such hacking collectives are thought to hold very different views. In the wake of the attack against the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris in January, hackers affiliated with Anonymous declared online war on ISIS and al Qaeda. Regarding this weekend's threat targeting troops, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service notified the Marines named in the file, a Marine Corps spokesman said. But the spokesman told CNN that the threat has yet to be verified. The Navy reminded service members to limit the amount of personal information they share online. On Sunday, a Defense Department official told CNN that it cannot confirm the validity of the posting of troops' information, but said it is investigating. The FBI is also looking into the post, a law enforcement official told CNN, adding there are questions about the credibility of the person or persons who posted it. In January, military families were spooked by an online message on Central Command's Twitter account which was in all caps. It read: ""AMERICAN SOLDIERS, WE ARE COMING. WATCH YOUR BACK. ISIS."" The tweet included a link to a statement that said, in part, ""We won't stop! We know everything about you, your wives and children. U.S. soldiers! We're watching you!"" The Twitter hacker managed to post other threatening messages, propaganda videos and some military documents until the accounts were disabled. Central Command quickly made public assurances that it was relatively easy to hack Twitter, no serious security details were revealed and it would find who was behind the hack. Army wife Ashley Broadway-Mack said the messages just amplified the anxiety she already feels after recent terror attacks targeting military personnel, law enforcement officers and civilians. She and other family members told CNN in January that they first began to think about the possibility in May 2013 when a uniformed British soldier in London was murdered by two men who shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" or ""God is great."" Others started to fear the possibility of their service members or themselves being targeted after the killing of a Canadian soldier during an October attack on the country's Parliament. Attacks and plots in Australia have them concerned, too, they said. In September, the Australian Prime Minister said a plot to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag had been thwarted. In December, a self-styled Muslim cleric held hostages in a Sydney cafe for 17 hours, a drama that ended with the deaths of two hostages. The gunman, who was known for sending hate mail to military families, was killed. The slayings in Paris, for which al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has taken responsibility, have prompted Broadway-Mack to think about security at North Carolina's Fort Bragg. ""Before the incident in Canada, I honestly didn't think ISIS was a threat to our family or other military families,"" she said in January. ""I worry about the hundreds, thousands of folks going to and from work in uniform. They, too, could be targets. I think of other areas around the country where there's a large military presence -- an attack, ambush, lone terrorist is something I fear. ""I hate to say it, but I honestly no longer think if, but when and where,"" she said. ""I think it's only a matter of time."" In late November, the FBI issued a warning to U.S. military members that ISIS was calling for attacks against them, a law enforcement source told CNN. The source said that ""overseas based individuals are looking for like-minded individuals in the U.S. to carry out these attacks."" The warning asked members of the military to ""review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists."" The bulletin also said authorities were concerned that ISIS members were ""spotting and assessing"" individuals in the United States who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military, a U.S. counterterror official told CNN. Lori Volkman, who is married to a commanding officer, told CNN in January that she she knows military members and spouses who have stopped openly carrying their uniforms to their car after a visit to the dry cleaners. Some have stopped wearing clothing with military insignia and are more careful when they open their wallet to avoid showing military IDs or payment cards. The small, simple changes don't mean military family members are running scared, Volkman said. But it was difficult when her young daughter was watching television and saw the news about the Centcom hack and the threat that ISIS was coming for soldiers. ""She turned and looked at me and you could see it registering -- we're soldiers. She had a very worried look,"" Volkman said. ""But kids are comforted by whatever their parents tell them. We can't live our lives in fear and we try to reassure them."" A blogger and communications firm CEO, Volkman wondered how she would even begin to scrub her online presence. Angela McCormick Ricketts also said in January that she's thrown her hands up about the matter of online privacy. Her memoir, ""No Man's War"" is a critical success. She's done a lot of press and is omnipresent online. ""I'm probably screwed if ISIS starts targeting yappy military spouses, so it's too late now! There's also a part of me that thinks that's what they want -- to make us always looking over our shoulders. So no. No to all of it,"" she said. It's a matter of principle, she and others said. Why should families bend to fear and stop sharing online when social media has helped many of them get through 14 years of nonstop war? Though the military has at times struggled with how much freedom its members should have on social media, relatives have wholeheartedly embraced it. Military families appear to use social media at higher rates than civilians, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Social media as we now know it wasn't even around when the Afghanistan war began. Facebook launched in 2004, almost exactly a year after the United States invaded Iraq. Now, dozens of military spouses have blogs and Facebook caters to the community. A 2014 survey by military advocacy group Blue Star Families found that 75% of 6,200 respondents considered the use of social media to be very important. CNN's Paul Cruickshank, Mariano Castillo, Barbara Starr, Kevin Bohn, Mary Kay Mallonee, Pamela Brown and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Group called Islamic State Hacking Division threatened U.S. troops .

"London, England (CNN)Along the dangerous northeastern border between Kenya and Somalia, a wave of terror has people in fear for their lives. The ongoing threat from the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab means that remote villages and citizens suffer indiscriminate attacks. In the ongoing conflict, women and children remain faceless victims of beatings, rape and unwarranted assaults. But one courageous woman has dedicated herself to protecting these countless victims. Amran Abdundi runs the Frontier Indigenous Network, a group that provides sanctuary, first aid services and valuable health information to numerous displaced women in the region. Last night, Abdundi's inspiring work was recognized at the esteemed Index Freedom of Expression awards in London -- the Kenyan women's rights activist was the winner in the campaign category. CNN's African Voices sat down with the soft spoken and unassuming awards winner, who celebrated her 34th birthday the same day as her win, to discuss her ongoing mission, fighting on in the face of death threats and empowering young girls through education. CNN: What does this honor mean to you? Amran Abdundi: I feel good about winning the award --  I will celebrate with the team when I go back home. But I will continue to do more and more. I hope to show my people how ... to fight for their rights. I want to give [them] the message to look [out]  for their futures. CNN: How did you get involved in women's rights along the Kenyan-Somali border? AA: I started working with Frontier Indigenous Network in 2006 -- [back then] we were just two staff and 10 volunteers and [now] there are four staff with 20 volunteers. When I first began, I was just doing it in our village and now I move around all over the place up to the Somali border. On the border, there are many issues women are facing; small girls are raped or beaten, rival clans fight, maybe because of land or because of outsiders. But everyday people are dying. Also there is Al-Shabaab. They come to the border and physically stop people from crossing over into Kenya. You never know who is Al-Shabaab, they look like me and you. But they stop people from crossing the border by beating them. When [refugees] are coming, if they want to cross into Kenya, they have big, big problems. Journalism . Safa al Ahmad, Rafael Marques de Morais (Saudi Arabia, Angola) Arts . Mouad Belghouat aka El Haqed (Morocco) Digital activism . Freedom of information website Atlatszo.hu, managed by Tamas Bodoky (Hungary) Campaigning . Amran Abdundi (Kenya) CNN: Through your organization, you've set up shelters along the border and provide relief and medical assistance to refugees. AA: Yes, when we see them or hear they are suffering there, I go in and find them. We take them to Dadaab [the largest refugee camp in the region]. If I take them to the refugee camp, they will get the assistance there. For the ones who have been beaten or raped, I organize for medical assistance. CNN: And how many women are crossing the border? AA: There are just so many. In Somalia, they don't have things there, they don't have good security, they are just running because of bad security in their country -- mothers with their children, others are young. CNN: You've also helped establish a local radio-listening project where women share their experiences and treatment options. Why did you decide to start this? AA: It's about how women are suffering in this place. I used to go to villages looking for them -- seeing what problems they are facing and maybe they don't have the power to talk. I go there and talk to them, then I take them to the radio station. I share how they have suffered. CNN: The region is quite unstable. Is it not dangerous doing this kind of work? AA: It's very, very dangerous. There is this place called Mandera, it's just near the border inside Kenya. That place, every time, people are fighting. People are just coming from Somalia to Mandera. There is fighting and you might just be walking and they will shoot you. But I never faced any problems. CNN: Are you not fearful for your life? AA: I worry but what can I do? I have to save my people. I have to look for those who are suffering. CNN: What is the reaction from men about your work? AA: When I started it was so difficult for me because in our place men are not the same as women. Men are the ones that talk. So when I started this, for example forced marriages, the small girls when they are 13 or 15 they just get married. They do not go to school. They face circumcision. But they have no voice. You'll see a 15-year-old getting married and in 20 years she'll come back with children and without anything. We go there and we advise them to go to school, advise their parents against forced marriage, tell them to take the children to school, stop circumcision. CNN: Last year your organization identified small arms and light weapons were fueling local violence and spent much of its resources mapping conflict zones. You succeeded in creating a regional agreement to stem the illegal arms trade and halt smugglers. How did that work? AA: Yes, I would hear there are some gunmen or they want to do something around the villages, or maybe they want to attack the villages and destroy it or take livestock . We report it to the police and then sometimes I go with policemen, never alone. For now, we don't have that problem with guns anymore -- they've stopped.

"(CNN)Ferguson's police chief is gone. So is the city manager. And the top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails. But are these high-level changes enough to satisfy all residents? Absolutely not, they say. Protesters amassed in front of the Ferguson Police Department on Wednesday night, demanding the entire force be disbanded and calling for Mayor James Knowles to step down. ""Racist cops have got to go,"" some chanted. ""The people, united, will never be defeated,"" others said. Amid the protests, two officers were shot -- one in the face, the other in the shoulder. They were hospitalized in serious condition, and it's not clear who the shooter was. So what will it take to calm Ferguson? DeRay McKesson told CNN that protesters want the entire police department dissolved. McKesson was part of a group that appeared to be the largest crowd since November when a grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. The killing was the spark that started a national wildfire of dialogue about police brutality. Many have decried rampant racism within the Ferguson Police Department. And a scathing 102-page Justice Department report backed up some of their claims -- citing widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks, including targeting them disproportionately for tickets. On Wednesday, Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced he's stepping down, effective March 19. He'll still get one year's worth of pay and insurance. CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said the entire department needs to be gutted. ""The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside,"" O'Mara wrote. ""If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization."" But city officials believe the police department can be reformed without being eliminated, the mayor told reporters. ""We continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was,"" Knowles said. ""The city of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity,"" he added. ""We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness."" Even if protesters get their wishes -- the resignation of Knowles and the disbanding of the police department -- they still won't get what they originally wanted: charges against Wilson. A local grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in November for the shooting death of Brown, who died August 9. The Justice Department launched its own investigation to see if there were any federal civil rights violations. ""There is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety"" when he shot Brown, the Justice Department report said. Wilson resigned from the police department in November, citing security concerns. But he remains a controversial figure in Ferguson. When resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from the crowd. ""I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,"" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. ""The same Justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%."" It's not clear who else may resign or get fired after the critical Justice Department report, which said Ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration and City Council -- to raise revenue through increased ticketing and fining. Read the Department of Justice report . The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. One November 2008 email said President Barack Obama wouldn't likely be President for long because ""what black man holds a steady job for four years."" Another email joked that African-American women should use abortion to control crime. ""Our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined,"" the Justice Department's report said. After the report came out, the city's top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails, and two others were being investigated, the mayor said. But the mayor hasn't resigned -- to the ire of many protesters Wednesday night. ""You got rid of Jackson, but we want Knowles"" gone, protester Kayla Reed said. Knowles said other reforms are already underway in an attempt to ""move this city, its residents and our entire community forward."" But the community is clearly at odds about how to move forward.","Two officers are shot in Ferguson overnight .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Hundreds of troops from Chad and Niger launched a ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria on Sunday, according to residents and military sources from Niger. The sweeping offensive is taking place along the Niger-Nigeria border, sources said, effectively opening a new front in the fight against the Islamist terror group. This comes a day after Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS in an audio message purported to be from leader Abubakar Shekau. Latest developments in the fight against ISIS . ""Early this morning, troops from Niger and Chad launched ground and air raids against Boko Haram into Nigeria, and the operation is still continuing,"" said a military official in the border town of Diffa, Niger. ""It is an intensive operation that is aimed at pulverizing Boko Haram and crippling their capability,"" according to the source.  He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about the operation. ‎Residents said artillery fire and fighter jets pushed Boko Haram fighters into the Damasak district of Nigeria, which is a Boko Haram enclave. ""Around 6 a.m., soldiers from Niger and Chad in huge numbers confronted Boko Haram around the Doutchi area outside Diffa and later crossed the bridge into Nigeria,"" said Diffa resident Ari Boubakarna. ""We heard huge explosions from artillery fire and fighter jets, but the explosions receded ‎as the troops moved further into Nigeria,"" Boubakarna continued. A journalist working in Diffa saw ‎troops headed toward the border with Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters had taken up positions. ‎""They left in a huge convoy of over 200 vehicles, some of them fitted with machine guns, including armored tanks, ambulances, water tankers and cargo trucks, which indicate they were going for a prolonged operation,"" the journalist said. ‎Residents lined up the streets to offer water and tea as the troops drove out of Diffa, residents said, adding that soldiers promised to capture Shekau alive.‎ . ‎Another contingent of troops, backed by air support, moved out from the town of Bosso, Niger, according to residents. ""Soldiers in large numbers crossed into Nigeria this morning, and we could hear thunderous sounds of gunfire and explosions coming from the direction of Malam Fatori,"" Bosso resident Tandja Moumouni said. Nigeria and its neighbors have recently mounted a coordinated offensive against Boko Haram militants in the Borno state, where the Islamist group has seized a large swathe of territory.  Nigeria shares a border with Niger, Chad and Cameroon there. As a part of this alliance, thousands of troops from Niger and Chad were stationed in Bosso and Diffa in January. ‎The offensive has succeeded in reclaiming some of the territory seized by the group. Nigeria has vowed to liberate all of its territories from Boko Haram before the general elections, which begin on March 28, to enable displaced residents return to their homes for the elections.","Troops from Chad and Niger launch offensive against Boko Haram .

"(CNN)Could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses? The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The expression of the mother is priceless. The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. He confirmed Friday that the adult seal was the baby's mom. It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, ""so this Mom was pretty relaxed,"" Link told CNN Friday. ""I have a great shot a few seconds later where Mom yawned hugely. She looked utterly content, to me."" The agency's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media. As the Instagram caption notes, the Weddell seals of Erebus Bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years. ""Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics."" Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close. ""I was awed,"" he said. ""It's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions. It's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold, high winds, no life to be seen except for the seals, an occasional skua or an emperor penguin."" After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. ""Mom doesn't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned, and even then doesn't get to eat. So while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds, Mamma loses about twice that much,"" he said. For more information on the seals, visit WeddellSealScience.com.","The USGS has been studying Weddell seals in Antarctica for more than 40 years .

"(CNN)Even with the national chapter shutting the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma, the school president said the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members. The members have until midnight Tuesday to get their things out of the house, university President David Boren said in a Monday afternoon news conference. ""The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,"" he said, adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members. A Saturday video showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization, which both promptly publicized the nine-second clip. David Boren: Not just another college president . The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant, ""There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me."" By Sunday night, SAE's national chapter had suspended the University of Oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant, but Boren took it a step further. He appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn, ""I have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way. My message to them is: You're disgraceful. You have violated every principle that this university stands for."" He said that he was angered, outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video. Boren stressed that the fraternity members' behavior is not indicative of what University of Oklahoma students, nicknamed Sooners, represent. ""It was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with UO students,"" he said. ""Sooners are not racists. They're not bigots. They are people who respect each other and care about each other."" He called for zero tolerance. ""The only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out. Clearly, I think some of our students wanted this exposed. They wanted this video out there, and I've asked them to please let me know when they're other things like this that happen,"" Boren told CNN. The student newspaper, The Oklahoma Daily, received the video in a Sunday email, said print Editor Katelyn Griffith. The fraternity celebrated its Founder's Day on Saturday, and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening, she said. ""We decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question,"" she told CNN. ""This was something that we knew wouldn't be tolerated by the students at OU and the university at large."" Unheard, a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, received the video Sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to ""let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated, that's it's unacceptable and it's extremely, extremely offensive,"" said the group's co-director, Chelsea Davis. This mentality is not new to campus, and it's not confined to one fraternity, Davis told CNN, but it's the first time people have been caught on video. ""Unfortunately, it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen, but this is definitely not something that is brand-new. It's not something that's only seen within this one organization,"" she said. Davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend, as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved. ""I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day, people that I see every day, could say such hateful things about me and my culture, about my friends, about my brothers and my sisters,"" she said. At a news conference, Boren said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved, especially against those ""who have taken a lead"" in the chanting. While expulsion is an option, any punishment must be ""carefully directed"" if it's to pass constitutional muster. One key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus, he said. Boren emphasized that ""there is no room for racists and bigots"" at Oklahoma. ""I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,"" he told CNN later. That sentiment echoed throughout campus, as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university's North Oval, some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word, ""Unheard,"" written across it. Other students took to social media to express their disappointment, with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in Sooner crimson, ""Not on our campus,"" the ""ou"" in ""our"" offset in gray. OU is shorthand for the University of Oklahoma. Unheard posted the video online Sunday with the comment, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma."" It was addressed to @President_Boren, the university president's Twitter handle. Boren quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off-campus if the allegations were true. The SAE's national chapter also moved promptly, saying in a statement it had closed the chapter ""following the discovery of an inappropriate video."" The group further apologized for the ""unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video."" ""I was not only shocked and disappointed, but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,"" SAE national President Bradley Cohen said in a statement. A group of students gathered to pray over the racist insults. One of them told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV he was ""nauseated, frustrated,"" but he was happy with the SAE headquarters' decision. ""We should be past this. This is disgusting,"" he said. Spray paint marked a wall of SAE's fraternity house at the university. ""Tear it down,"" the graffiti appeared to say. Police posted squad cars in front of the house. Members of the Oklahoma football team protested, marching in lieu of meeting and practice. Backlash extended beyond campus as well, with hip-hop star Waka Flocka Flame saying on Instagram that he was canceling an upcoming show for the SAEs. ""All races partying have a good time and enjoying themselves together peacefully. That's what Waka Flocka is all about. For that reason, I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate,"" the Atlanta rapper wrote. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Chuck Johnston, Nick Valencia, Tristan Milder, Lindsey Knight, Justin Lear and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","""Sooners are not racists.

"(CNN)Levi Pettit, who was expelled from the University of Oklahoma for spouting a racist chant at a fraternity activity, says he's ""deeply sorry."" ""Although I don't deserve it, I want to ask for your forgiveness,"" Pettit said as he read from a prepared statement at a news conference on Wednesday. ""There are no excuses for my behavior. I never thought of myself as a racist. I never considered it a possibility. But the bottom line is that the words that were said in that chant were mean, hateful and racist."" Flanked at the podium by African American leaders who he'd been meeting with at the Fairview Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, Pettit, who is white, said he planned to spend the rest of his life trying to undo the damage he'd done. Pettit's parents released a statement apologizing for his behavior earlier this month. But it wasn't until Wednesday that he spoke out himself. ""Some have wondered why I haven't spoken out publicly. The truth is, I've had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions,"" he said. ""I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country first, until I came here to apologize to the community most directly impacted."" Pettit read from a letter he'd written the university's president apologizing for his actions and said he's committed to taking steps to prevent racism in the future. ""Over the past week or so, I've met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words that I spoke on that bus,"" Pettit said. ""Meeting with a few people does not change what I did, but it has begun to change me, and my understanding of those hateful words."" His comments come more than two weeks after a nine-second clip surfaced showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials expelled Pettit and another student, Parker Rice, because of their alleged ""leadership role"" in the racist chant. Rice has also apologized, saying he'd made a ""horrible mistake"" and that the chant was ""wrong and reckless."" Pettit declined to answer reporters' questions Wednesday about how he learned the chant, but said he now knows that the words he used never should be repeated. ""I'm also upset and embarrassed that I failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant. I now have a clear understanding of what lives behind the words,"" he said. ""From this point forward, I will be the leader that I should have been on that bus and stand up against racism in any form."" CNN's Faith Karimi, Eliott C. McLaughlin and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","""Although I don't deserve it, I want to ask for your forgiveness,"" Levi Pettit says .

"(CNN)If you think ""my teen would never sext,"" you might be mistaken. And if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors, like drinking, using drugs or skipping school, keep reading. Studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit. More than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers, according to the study by Drexel University, which was published last year by the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy. Nearly 30% said they included photos in their sexts, and an astonishing 61% did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners, use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control. Sexting may be the new ""normal' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior, the study concluded. ""There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior,"" said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center. ""I'm not saying that it's healthy or that it's harmless, but it's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it,"" said Englander, who researched sexting, as well as a host of other teenager behaviors, for her recent book ""Bullying and Cyberbullying."" ""It appears to be widespread. It's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it's not very unusual or rare."" You're probably thinking: ""I check my kids' phones. No sexting happening in this household."" But there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents can't find later. Snapchat, Cyber Dust, VaporChat and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient's phones after a certain period of time. These apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous. Brutally Honest: Is it OK to spy on your kids? Diana Graber, who teaches ""cyber civics"" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she, for the first time, included a session on sexting. When she asked her students if they knew what a sext was, everyone in the class said they did, but what they didn't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be, including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states. ""They had no idea what the consequences were,"" said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. ""I mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids, so it occurred to me that no one's ever bothered to tell these kids they couldn't do that."" Graber said she experienced another first that day. A few students wanted to hang around after the class, which is held at the end of the school day, to talk more about sexting and related things. ""That's never happened to me before with this class ... and I realized that I had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives."" She now plans to make it part of her ""cyber civics"" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting. It should be part of sex education, she said. ""We know that throwing the book at them, it's too much too late, so that's not working,"" said Graber, who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships. ""It's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem, and just have these very easy to have discussions."" Englander, the psychology professor and researcher, says in her experience, it's not that adults aren't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public. The problem, she says, is kids don't hear the warnings because the reality doesn't fit them. In a online article, she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield. Since half of car rides don't result in someone going through the windshield, a person might not listen to that warning, she says. ""If you want to convince somebody that something is a danger, you have to convince them that you know what you're talking about, "" said Englander. ""So you can't say to kids 'Oh, you are going to go to jail if you sext.' It's not 100% impossible but even in the early cases of sexting, when (law enforcement) did prosecute kids, they didn't go to jail."" ""People have a hard time with this. It's not that I'm saying we shouldn't teach kids that child pornography is a crime. It is a crime, but if we emphasize that that's the big danger then we've lost our audience."" Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it. In her own research, she said she found that 92% of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward, but that number is only 68% for teens who felt pressured into doing it. ""They felt crummy afterwards,"" said Englander. ""That was actually the most common result, that they just felt worse."" Lori Cunningham, founder of Well Connected Mom, a site specializing in simplifying technology for families, said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth. ""And that no matter how tempting it is to want to be 'liked' by someone, they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else's enjoyment,"" said Cunningham, a mom of two in Los Angeles. ""If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure."" Cunningham also says parents need to be actively involved in their children's online lives. In an eBook, she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone, including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored. ""Phones are a privilege, not a right. They should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis."" What all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law, protecting their privacy and reputation, and respecting everyone's right to keep their bodies private, but also their own values about the issue. ""Your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing, having no idea of what you think is right or wrong, having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it. Those are the only two choices,"" said Englander. ""I don't think in today's world you can assume that they're never going to run across sexting, they're never going to see it, they're never going to know it happens."" ""That's a big assumption to make.""","Sexting is more common than parents might realize, studies suggest .

"(CNN)A man armed with an assault rifle held his family hostage and shot and killed a Navajo Nation police officer Thursday evening, the Native American tribal government said. The suspect fled, and was shot to death hours later. The slain officer, who was not immediately identified, was one of two Navajo Police officers shot after a domestic violence call came in around 4 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Thursday, according to a statement from the Navajo Nation. The officers were responding to a report that a man with an AR-15 rifle was holding his family hostage. That same man shot at the Navajo Police, then ran. A manhunt ensued involving officers from the Navajo Nation's Window Rock and Crownpoint districts. It ended with word around 10:30 p.m. that the suspect was shot to death in the northern Arizona city of Red Valley, just over the border from New Mexico, according to the Navajo Nation government. It was not immediately clear how he died -- whether it was from a shootout with police or a self-inflicted wound. The wounded officer is being treated in the Shiprock-Northern Navajo Medical Center. The officer's condition was not immediately known.

"(CNN)Latest developments: . Full story: . Saudi Arabia has launched military operations in neighboring Yemen, where for months Houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government, the Saudi ambassador to the United States told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Adel al-Jubeir said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region. Yemen, a longtime stronghold for one of al Qaeda's most dangerous branches, has been plunged into chaos since the Houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months. The unrest has led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces from Yemen, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there. How did Yemen get to this place? ""We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,"" al-Jubeir said. ""Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners."" A leading member of the Houthis' political wing, Ansar Allah, said force will be met with force. ""This is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression,"" Ali Al Imad told CNN Arabic. ""The Saudi move will unite all the people of Yemen against the Saudis and the kingdom will pay the price."" If the Saudis try to invade with ground troops, he said, they will fail. ""They probably will try to avoid that, but If it happened then they will pay a very high price,"" Imad said. The Saudi airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds, headquarters and weapons storage areas. Journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital of Sanaa, said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes. ""I do expect the Sanaa of a couple of hours ago to be a different Sanaa in the morning,"" he said. A senior Arab diplomat told CNN that the Gulf Cooperation Council soon will issue a statement that the Yemenis have asked for military assistance and the GCC is prepared to step in. It will be signed by all GCC countries except for Oman. Not all countries will contribute military forces, the source said. Arab and senior administration officials from the United States told CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will likely ask for American air support, satellite imagery, and other intelligence. ""We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,"" a senior administration official said. Al-Jubeir said the United States is not involved in the airstrikes against the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni nation. But the coalition includes more than 10 nations, he said, meaning more than the six GCC countries will be involved. Yemen, which has been in turmoil for months, shares a border with southern Saudi Arabia. ""We hope that the wisdom will prevail among the Houthis and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over Yemen and destroy it,"" Al-Jubeir said. Earlier Wednesday, rebel forces captured parts of the port city of Aden and a nearby Yemeni air base recently evacuated by U.S. forces, officials in the country said, with one rebel spokesman claiming that Yemen's president fled Aden as his opponents advanced. The rebels late Wednesday morning captured al-Anad air base, an installation that the last Yemen-based contingent of U.S. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country, said Mohammed AbdulSalam, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels. The rebel forces -- Houthis and some allies in the Yemeni military -- then advanced on Aden, the nearby port city where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had taken refuge for weeks. There were conflicting reports Wednesday about Hadi's whereabouts. But one Houthi spokesman, Mohammed AlBukhaiti, said Hadi left  Aden on a boat with a Saudi diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city. AlBukhaiti told CNN that Hadi went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But a Saudi Arabian source told CNN's Nic Robertson that the President was still in Yemen in the early hours Thursday. Earlier, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, ""It's pretty clear (Hadi) left voluntarily,"" without saying where Hadi had gone. She clarified that circumstances in Yemen caused him to leave his residence, but that rebels did not expel him. Two senior administration officials said it's unclear if he left Aden. The rebels' advance illustrated the growing power the Houthis have enjoyed since taking over Sanaa in January, and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key U.S. ally in the fight against then Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the Middle Eastern nation. Underscoring rebels' increasing strength, Houthi-commanded Yemeni air force jets on Wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in Aden for the third time in a week, causing minimal damage and injuring no one, two Hadi aides said. The airstrikes happened before reports of Hadi's departure from Aden emerged. Hadi had been staying at the Aden palace since last month, when he fled the capital, Sanaa, after a Houthi takeover there. The United States ""strongly condemn(s) the recent offensive military actions taken in Yemen that have targeted President Hadi,"" Psaki told reporters Wednesday. The Houthi militants -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- moved into the capital, Sanaa, in September, sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called. In January, they surrounded the presidential palace and Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. But Hadi escaped in February, fleeing to Aden and declaring that he remained the country's leader. The Houthis took control of military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force. Some of the forces aligned with the Houthis also are loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in 2012 after months of ""Arab Spring"" protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in Egypt. By last week, opposing Yemeni military forces -- those loyal to the Houthis, and those answering to Hadi -- battled in Aden, with Hadi's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on March 19 after at least 13 people were killed. On Wednesday, with the U.S. forces gone, Houthi-aligned forces took over al-Anad air base, about 40 kilometers from Aden, said AbdulSalam, one of the Houthi spokesmen. The number of casualties, if any, wasn't immediately available. Some Hadi supporters evacuated the base, and Houthi forces arrested some top officials who were there, including Hadi's defense minister, AbdulSalam said. No deaths or injuries were immediately reported in the rebels' subsequent takeover of Aden's airport and the central bank.

"(CNN)Some of the 100 fraternity brothers of the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma have received death threats after the release of a video in which a racist chant was heard, a lawyer for the chapter's board said Friday. Attorney Stephen Jones said other members of the former chapter of the fraternity have been physically assaulted, though he wouldn't go into specifics. Jones told a news conference that he had been retained by the board of trustees -- the alumni advisers for the chapter -- ""to assist them in evaluating certain legal issues and other matters that may impact local chapter of SAE."" There are no plans right now to sue the university, which shut down the chapter's house and disbanded the SAE chapter, he said. The national chapter of SAE also revoked the OU chapter's charter. The school also expelled two members of the fraternity, but Jones said he is not representing them. Jones said the actions on a nine-second video that showed some members yelling a racist chant that included a reference to lynching were inexcusable. There was ""no justification for what occurred. Zero,"" he said. Jones said he is involved to protect the due process and First Amendment rights of members. The fraternity's national office said it is investigating the incident in the video to see if it needs to take action against any of the students. ""We are committed to following the due diligence and protocols that we have set forth in our fraternity laws,"" the national SAE office said after the news conference, ""as they are designed to enable us to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions that reflect our commitment to our standards and to our members."" The office also has said it was looking into incidents involving other chapters. ""Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters ... and each of those instances will be investigated,"" the national office said in a statement. It said some of the incidents date back more than 20 years. Another chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is under fire over alleged racial slurs -- this time in Seattle. University of Washington students are accusing fraternity members of offensive comments during a protest to raise awareness about racism last month. ""People were called monkeys and apes by members of SAE,"" said Maggie Negussie, president of the  university's Black Student Union. SAE's university chapter denied the allegations, saying an investigation determined the culprits were not members of the fraternity. An investigation into the ""grossly insensitive comments"" is underway, said Denzil J. Suite, the university's vice president for student life. The university is gathering information to determine who was behind the remarks, but a preliminary report by some students accused the SAE fraternity, according to Suite. ""If and when we can determine what occurred, we will take appropriate steps,"" he said. About 1,000 people were marching across the street from the fraternity house when the incident occurred, Negussie said. She said the marchers opted to ignore the offensive words. ""At that time it was more important to continue marching ... but that is not the only time,"" she said. ""There are many of us who have those stories."" Negussie also accused the University of Washington fraternity of not allowing black students at its parties. When CNN asked for videos or photos, she said members are reaching out to witnesses. Michael Hickey, president of the fraternity's university chapter, said the chapter was notified of the protest  incident on February 25 -- the same day it happened. ""We were naturally concerned and shocked by these allegations, as we pride ourselves in the diversity of our chapter membership and racism is against the moral ethics of our local and national organization,"" he said in a statement. However, he said, an investigation determined that fraternity members were not behind the insults. The culprits were on a nearby sidewalk and not on the fraternity house property, he said. ""We have determined this due to eyewitness accounts from our members viewing nonmembers of SAE yelling offensive comments on the sidewalk near our chapter house,"" he said. He asked witnesses to come forward and pledged to punish any members found to have been involved. ""We continue to seek any information or eyewitnesses to the incident,"" he said. CNN's Elise Miller contributed to this report.","National chapter of SAE says it is giving due process to members at University of Oklahoma .

"(CNN)Think it's taking you longer to get to work? Has your job moved farther from your home? You're probably right on both counts. A new study from the Brookings Institution says the number of jobs within a typical commute distance for residents in major metro areas of the U.S. fell by 7% between 2000 and 2012. Despite trends that indicate a greater desire for millennials to live in dense urban areas, suburbs are still doing well, according to some researchers. Employers have tended to move toward the suburbs, away from city cores -- and away from many workers, the study says. Moreover, even if you already live in the suburbs, it doesn't mean you live close to the suburb where the jobs are. ""Suburban residents saw the number of jobs within a typical commute distance drop by 7%, more than twice the decline experienced by the typical city resident (3%),"" Elizabeth Kneebone and Natalie Holmes wrote in the study's summary. The issue disproportionately affects poor and minority residents, the authors added. ""Residents of high-poverty and majority-minority neighborhoods experienced particularly pronounced declines in job proximity,"" they wrote, observing that 61% of high-poverty tracts and 55% of majority-minority neighborhoods experienced declines in job proximity between 2000 and 2012. High-poverty neighborhoods were defined as tracts with poverty rates above 20%. The Brookings study comes as metro areas are coping with increased stresses on infrastructure. Tuesday's New York Times was filled with letters complaining about a subway fare increase and crowds at all hours in the New York system. In Atlanta, one suburban county recently added mass transit for the first time since 2010 -- even as the Georgia legislature has been gutting portions of a transportation bill. And a Detroit man garnered nationwide headlines in February because of his 21-mile commute -- a hefty chunk of which he walked due to a lack of transit options. The Brookings study observes that solving commuting issues ""will require collaborative solutions"" across jurisdictions. ""The dynamics that have shaped these job proximity patterns across and within metro areas did not emerge by themselves,"" Kneebone and Holmes wrote (PDF). ""Local, regional, and state leaders put them in play (whether purposefully or by default) through policy decisions. To foster growth that is truly regional in its reach and that does not exacerbate inequality or leave low-income and minority residents behind, communities will need to coordinate and collaborate as they plan and implement policy decisions that affect metropolitan development patterns.""","A new Brookings study says proximity to jobs is declining .

"(CNN)The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging an Alabama law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that's akin to a trial. Generally, laws in the United States require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion. But for some children, parental consent is impossible or even dangerous. This class of minors must seek a judicial bypass. While the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states, this Alabama law may have gone too far. Here are the suspect provisions of this ""bypass by trial"": . • Alabama has turned what is supposed to be an informal, child-centered hearing into more of a trial. • The court can appoint a Guardian ad Litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in, say, a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus. • The minor may be cross-examined by the district attorney and possibly the minor's parents. • Information about the minor's pregnancy may be disclosed to her family, friends and employers, and they might even be brought to court to testify -- against the minor. When it comes to abortion, minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults, free from undue state interference. However, the Supreme Court has also specifically articulated reasons why the constitutional rights of children are not identical to the rights of adults. Children are vulnerable and unable to make critical decisions and, of course, parents have a right to participate in raising their child. States may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement: parental involvement. However, if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion, the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that ""bypasses"" having to get Mom and Dad's permission. The Supreme Court has required that these hearings ""must assure that resolution ... be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained."" Plus, and perhaps most importantly, the procedure bypassing parental consent cannot be a thinly veiled mechanism for an ""absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto."" In plain language, hearings must be quick and quiet, and they cannot be held in kangaroo court. The problem is, this does not give a lot of detailed direction to courts about how exactly to conduct these hearings. It's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly, and that sooner or later, a state like Alabama would experiment with state abortion law. Our system was specifically designed to allow states to experiment with social and economic legislation. Of course, that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court's power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional. In this case, the ACLU's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far. A hearing is fine, it seems, but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible ""undue burden"" on the right to have an abortion. This has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult, or minor child seeking the abortion. The federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether Alabama's law violates established Supreme Court bypass requirements. But what about the actual bypass requirements themselves? They are a creation of the Supreme Court. Striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled Supreme Court precedent is entirely another. What if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox? Consider how it applies in this case. In Alabama, a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either: . (1) that the minor is mature and well-informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own; or . (2) that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor. Abstract concepts like ""mature"" and ""best interest"" are rather amorphous at best. (True story: A respected law professor advised many classes of students that when confronted on the bar exam with a question about a child, do the following: Write ""best interest of the child"" somewhere in the first sentence; then write ""whatever the heck you want"" for the rest of the answer.) So then, the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court's permission to have an abortion. This means the court can then arrive at this Kafkaesque, perplexing alternative: A particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor ... should therefore be ... a parent of an infant?  It gets stranger: What about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby, even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion? How would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child? State courts and legislatures are not completely to blame; after all, the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line-drawing.  Whether we're considering the drinking age, the driving age or the voting age, we've learned over the centuries that kids mature at different ages. Plus there is no easy legal formula to address the myriad situations of messed-up families. Unfortunately, legislatures must draw some lines -- lines that will not always be workable in every situation. And there are surely situations where the bypass might actually be effective: for example, a very young pregnant minor with completely absent parents, who needs court intervention. The problem is, if it creates an undue burden in one situation, then it's constitutionally suspect. But ultimately, building up the procedural hurdles for a pregnant minor almost by definition encroaches upon the limits set some time ago by the Supreme Court.  It's a procedure that needs to be defined; teen pregnancy certainly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Neither are lousy families, unfortunately. Whether the boundary lines of judicial bypass ebb toward the autonomy of minors, or back toward the state interest in the fetus, the broader social ""findings"" of judicial bypass proceedings will always remain the same: It's all very sad.","Cevallos: Alabama may go too far in the process used to decide if a teenager can have an abortion without parental consent .

"(CNN)Another Kardashian heard from. Usually the Kardashian-industrial complex is dominated by comments and social media postings from Kim, followed closely by Khloe and perhaps one of the Jenner children. But on Sunday, it was Rob, the youngest of the four Kardashian siblings, who drew most of the attention. In an Instagram post, Rob Kardashian compared his sister to the sociopathic Amy Dunne, the murderous wife played by Rosamund Pike in ""Gone Girl."" ""My sister kim, the b**** from Gone Girl,,,"" he posted. He accompanied the text with a photo of Pike's character drenched in blood, fresh from (spoiler alert!) killing her ex-boyfriend. He also unfollowed his entire family, though he changed his mind later. It's not the first time Rob has been at odds with the heavily spotlighted Kardashian clan. He missed out on Kim's wedding to Kanye West, with various (unnamed, of course) gossip sources reporting at the time that he wasn't getting along with members of his family. Khloe Kardashian, who has stayed close to Rob, told Wonderwall.com that he may have a ""kind of social anxiety.""

However, composer Alexandre Desplat has revealed that he will be working on 2016's ""Rogue One."" The film's director, Gareth Edwards, worked with Desplat last year on ""Godzilla.""

"(CNN)With tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in Ferguson, Missouri, state and county police took over protest security in the St. Louis suburb Thursday. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol are assuming ""command of the security detail regarding protests,"" St. Louis County Police said, while Ferguson Police will remain responsible for ""routine policing services"" in the city. The takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside Ferguson police headquarters were shot in what St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar called an ""ambush,"" spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers. ""We could have buried two police officers,"" Belmar told reporters. ""... I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was."" Belmar said several people ""have been very forthright"" with investigators, but authorities haven't released the names of any possible suspects. Investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting, and one of them might be the shooter, a law enforcement official said. Police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away. This isn't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security. When clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year, Missouri's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the State Highway Patrol to take over. After that emergency declaration expired in December, Ferguson Police resumed command of protest security. Officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night near the scene of the shooting, religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters. Dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters Thursday night. This time, Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officers Association said, the security situation on the streets is different. ""It's a very tense situation, as you can well imagine,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""In my communications as a union official with police commanders, I've been assured that tactics will be different tonight. I assume that means not only more officers, but a wider perimeter, with coverage, perhaps, of these blind spots from which the shots were fired last night."" Shots rang from a hill overlooking the station out shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department. Officers saw ""muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,"" Belmar said. Protesters have disavowed any ties to the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. ""As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don't know,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. ""In no way are they representative of the thousands of people...who have been protesting."" Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, for a reason. ""These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,"" he said. That department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report came out documenting a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned from his post Wednesday. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works in that St. Louis suburb's Police Department. One is from Webster Groves, a city about 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other wounded officer was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old from St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for the past 14 years. Both men were treated and released from St. Louis' Barnes Jewish Hospital. Brown's parents condemned the shooting as ""senseless,"" saying such violence against law enforcement ""will not be tolerated."" So did the White House, with a tweet signed with President Barack Obama's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling ""violence against police ... unacceptable."" And U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who visited Ferguson in the aftermath of Brown's shooting and unrest that spurred, decried what happened as a ""heinous and cowardly (and) repugnant attack."" ""What happened last night was a pure ambush,"" Holder said. ""This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. This was a damn punk who was trying to sow discord."" Iresha Turner says police banged on her door in the middle of the night. ""I opened the door and stood back. I look at my chest, there's a red dot on it,"" she said. ""I have my hands up, start crying. I said, 'please, don't shoot me."" Turner was one of three people who were questioned for hours by investigators Thursday and eventually released. But they never saw the shooting and had no idea who opened fire, she said. Turner thinks police questioned her because she was in a car of people who sped away after the shooting -- not because they had anything to do with it, she said, but because they were scared after hearing gunshots. It's not known what connection, if any, the shooter or shooters had to Wednesday night's protest. One irony is that, for some protesters, Wednesday was a day to celebrate: They'd called for Jackson's resignation for months, and finally it was happening. But for others, it was not enough. That's why they congregated in Ferguson, to demand changes like disbanding the city's entire Police Department and ousting Mayor James Knowles. Some chanted, ""Racist cops have got to go."" Others held signs with slogans such as ""They don't really care about us!"" and ""Black lives matter."" ""It was a great group (with) great, great energy,"" protester Markus Loehrer said. Three were arrested in a crowd Belmar characterized as agitated and ""pretty rowdy"" at times. Demonstrator DeRay McKesson told CNN that one fight that occurred had nothing to do with the protests. At its peak, some 150 protesters congregated Wednesday night in front of the Ferguson police station, Belmar said. About 70 law enforcement officers from multiple departments came in to stand in front of the station, as they have on many other nights -- with the turnout of demonstrators the highest since the November grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. There's the manhunt, of course. And then there's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well. Even though Jackson, City Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out, some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change. ""We aren't satisfied with this,"" Reed said of the police chief's exit. ""It's a step in the right direction, but it's not what total justice looks like in Ferguson."" Jackson expressed optimism that, in his view, the Justice Department report concluded that Ferguson ""can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be."" But what are the prospects after Thursday's shooting? Loehrer worried that the shooting will undercut the protesters' message against discrimination and violence. ""It's a shame that somebody had to take advantage of this great group,"" he said, ""to do something so despicable."" And Belmar said it underscores the fact that, eight months after Brown's death, the streets of Ferguson are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge. ""This is beginning at times to be very difficult for any law enforcement agencies, anywhere, to really wrap their arms around,"" he said. ""I want everybody ... to understand how difficult this is.""

"Washington (CNN)Jeb Bush's money machine expectations, Al Gore's Iowa trip, Rand Paul's Iran strategy and John Boehner's next move were all topics around the ""Inside Politics"" table this Sunday. Jeb Bush is going to be doubling down on his contrast with Hillary Clinton on transparency, using the emails he released from his time as governor of Florida -- and maybe the U.S.'s largest e-retailer. While Bush has already released the first chapter of his e-book on his website, Ron Fournier of the National Journal reports that Bush is in serious negotiations with Amazon for a big deal that would have the full memoir published across all its platforms, including Kindle. ""He'll use the emails to draw a narrative of his time in Florida -- the highs, the lows, but also some mistakes, some errors,"" said Fournier. Many recent presidential candidates have written books before or during their runs for the White House, but all have to prove themselves in the race for campaign cash. One of the big early tests for presidential candidates is to prove they can raise the money for the long haul. And the first lap in the money primary winds up at the end of this month, when candidates have to report their first-quarter fund-raising totals. CNN's John King reveals that there is a bit of an expectations game clash underway as we head into the final weeks of the quarter. Team Bush got a bit dismayed when several allies started talking about a record-smashing $100 million quarter for his ""Right To Rise"" political action committee. Now, some Bush allies are bragging that a $50 million figure would still be a big deal. Are they trying to truly lower expectations -- or just create space for a bigger number to be a bigger deal? We'll know in three weeks. After Hillary Clinton's email controversy, there's been a lot of talk about who would step in if she bowed out as a potential Democratic presidential candidate. One high-profile politician who's planning his first trip to Iowa in over a decade has a lot of Hawkeye State Democrats buzzing, according to CNN's Jeff Zeleny. ""(Former Vice President Al Gore) says he's not running. I'm sure he's not, but he's doing a climate leadership workshop that's getting everyone there sort of excited,"" said Zeleny. ""By then, Hillary Clinton will probably already be in the race, but Democrats in Iowa who are hungry for a different type of politics might be signing up for these workshops May 5 through the 7th in Cedar Rapids."" As the deadline nears for a nuclear policy agreement between Iran and six world powers including the U.S., all eyes will be on Sen. Rand Paul. Paul has been trying to shore up his foreign policy credentials to satisfy the more hawkish elements in the Republican Party, but Bloomberg's Lisa Lerer questions whether his attempts are working. ""This past week he signed on as a co-sponsor to legislation giving Congress final say over any deal that's struck by the administration,"" said Lerer. ""It's unlikely to be enough to satisfy parts of the Republican base and also satisfy key donors for the party who are very concerned about Israel."" ""He also came under fire this past week for not applauding vociferously enough during Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's speech. I think a lot of eyes will be on him this month as we delve into these issues."" As Congress' slugfest over Homeland Security funding ends, NPR's Juana Summers looks ahead to more tough fights for House Speaker John Boehner, including appropriations battles and the fall's debt ceiling fight. One of the keys to the outcome of these future clashes is Boehner's plan to handle the House GOP's contentious tea party members. ""Is Boehner willing to continually antagonize the far right wing of his party and pass legislation with Democrats? Or will he be passing bills with only Republicans?"" asks Summers. ""And that, I think, will tell us a lot about what the Congress will look like in the next few years to come.""","The Bush money machine faces the expectations game .

"(CNN)In November 2002, the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to Jesus: a 2,000 year-old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in Aramaic: ""James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."" If it was true, this was the first physical evidence ever found of Jesus' existence. And yet, if this amazing ossuary was false, then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history. Underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem: whether or not Jesus actually had any brothers. Though the debate's origins are ancient, the answer still divides Catholics and Protestants. For Catholics, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are a family unit unto themselves. Yet Catholic theology also holds that Jesus was God's son, born of the virgin -- and that Mary did not give birth to other children, divine or otherwise. 'Finding Jesus': John the Baptist Q&A . So who are these ""brothers"" that the Gospel of Mark mentions? The Rev. James Martin, author of the book ""Jesus: A Pilgrimage,"" calls the relationship between James and Jesus ""very complicated."" ""He's called clearly the brother of the Lord, and the Greek uses the common word for brother,"" Martin says. But Catholics also believe in Mary's perpetual virginity, so Martin surmises that James and the other brothers were Joseph's children from a prior marriage.""It makes sense that Joseph would have been older and Mary was younger, so I see them in a sense as stepbrothers."" Other Catholic scholars see James and Jesus  as cousins, an idea that began in the fourth century, when St. Jerome, who translated the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament into Latin, argued the point against the theologian Helvedius, who said Mary and Joseph had other children. 'Finding Jesus': Shroud of Turin Q&A . Jerome countered that these children were instead born to Mary of Clopas, Jesus' aunt. Jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that ""adelphios,"" the Greek word used for Jesus' brothers and sisters, could refer to cousins, as well as to siblings. Protestants, however, see Jesus' family as free of ambiguity, with Mary and Joseph having several children. One of them is Jesus -- but the question then becomes, which one? Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament Interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary, offers the Protestant view that Jesus and James were full brothers, with Jesus being the elder. ""The New Testament says nothing about Mary being a perpetual virgin, it says she virginally conceived Jesus, and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that, and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters,"" Witherington says. Is Judas in hell? Jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in Galilee and Judea, has a ministry and leaves James and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family, according to the scholar. What's more contentious for some Protestants, is the fact that Jesus, as the eldest in the family, essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after Joseph died. Instead he followed his divine destiny, as ordained by his father in heaven. 5 things you didn't know about Jesus . That left James to fill the void. Whatever he was -- brother, step-brother or cousin -- we know that James became important in the early Christian church because of his relation to Jesus. Paul, the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the Roman Empire, says as much in his letter to the Galatians: . ""Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him 15 days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother."" James and Peter and Paul were the prime movers of this new faith, with James the leader of the Jesus followers in Jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 CE, forgiving his killers with his last breath, just as his brother Jesus had done. Given his importance to the early Christian Church, why wouldn't he be connected to his brother, or even stepbrother, on the burial box containing his bones?

James Martin, a Catholic priest, calls the relationship between James and Jesus ""very complicated.""

"Boston (CNN)Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombings trial were shown a key piece of evidence Tuesday: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on the inside of the boat he used as a hideout. Prosecutors presented photos of three panels of the boat that had messages written in pencil. Boston police Officer Todd Brown, a bomb squad member who cleared the boat of explosives, was on the witness stand to talk about the writings. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. On Tuesday, Brown identified Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court as the man he saw come out of the boat and get taken into custody. In the writings on the panels, some of Tsarnaev's words were struck out by bullet holes. ""I'm jealous of my brother who ha (bullet hole) ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me,"" one of the writings said, referring to the word for paradise. ""I do not mourn because his soul is very much alive. God has a plan for each person. Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions."" Tsarnaev's connections: Who's who . Tsarnaev's defense has argued that he indeed participated in the bombings, but that he was influenced by his radicalized brother. In his writings on the boat, Tsarnaev asked Allah to allow him to reach the highest levels of heaven. ""The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. As a (bullet hole) I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. Well at least that's how muhhammad (bullet hole) wanted it to be (for)ever,"" Tsarnaev wrote in the boat. Also Tuesday, prosecutors called on FBI agent Steve Kimball to discuss two Twitter accounts linked to Tsarnaev. One, @J_tsar, contained 1,100 tweets and was the more mainstream of the two. ""I shall die young,"" @J_tsar tweeted on April 12, 2012. And four days later, on the day of the 2012 Boston Marathon, a tweet from the account read, ""They will spend their money & they will regret it & they will be defeated."" Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Prosecutors argued that these tweets indicate an attack on the Boston Marathon was on his mind a year before the bombings. Tsarnaev attorney Miriam Conrad, who opted not to cross-examine the bombing survivors who testified during the first week of the trial, got Kimball to acknowledge that some of his information about the tweets came from other agents and that he didn't check them out for himself. Conrad also established that some of the tweets appeared to be rap lyrics. CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston, and Mariano Castillo wrote in Atlanta.","A police officer testifies about the writings Dzhokhar Tsarnaev scrawled on a boat .

"(CNN)Once again, the lure of ISIS may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time, medical students suspected of traveling to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals. The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Turkish lawmaker Mehmet Ali Ediboglu told CNN on Sunday. Ediboglu, an opposition lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS, and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. ""They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,"" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper. But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle. ""Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors,"" he told The Observer. ""They went there to help, not to fight."" In a joint statement, the students' and doctors' families said their children are humanitarians who went ""to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey's borders."" They have since ""disappeared,"" the statement said. ""We have heard from the British, Turkish and Sudanese authorities that we have so far met, but we hope that the respectable governments of these countries would enforce, speed up and coordinate more effective measures to ensure the safety of our children wherever they are and bring them back to us as soon as possible,"" the statement said. Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated, and the three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan. At least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer. In an interview published Monday in Turkey's Hürriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children. Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter, Lena, who is one of the students. ""I know you want to help people and be of use. But you can do this in another way,"" he told the newspaper. ""There are many who need your help. But this is not the way. Please, come back."" British officials said they are aware of the report. ""We are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the Turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts,"" the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said in a statement. Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS' ranks. Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by. Last year, a 19-year-old Colorado woman was arrested at Denver International Airport as she was about to start a journey to an ISIS camp, where she hoped to be a nurse. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Nimet Kirac and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","Families say the doctors and students went to Turkey to help refugees .

"(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's ""Finding Jesus,"" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the ""Finding Jesus"" Facebook page during the latest episode, ""The Gospel of Judas."" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for ""thirty pieces of silver"" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word ""Iscariot"" is a corruption of the word ""sicarii,"" which means ""dagger bearer,"" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as ""Son of Simon Iscariot"", which makes the ""sicarii"" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in ""Finding Jesus."" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately ""hand him over"") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by ""Finding Jesus"" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, ""Finding Jesus"" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

"(CNN)The first state visit to the United States of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah was supposed to take place in early March. But the visit was delayed because Republican leaders had invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress during the same time period. According to two Afghan government officials involved in the planning for the visit, the Afghan government believed American media attention would be largely focused on Netanyahu, so the first U.S. visit of the new Afghan president was delayed by two weeks, which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders shouldn't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders. Ghani and Abdullah arrived in Washington on Sunday and have had much to discuss with the Obama administration. For the Afghan government, the timetable of President Barack Obama's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue. Obama says that the last American troops will leave Afghanistan at the end of 2016. This happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down America's post-9/11 wars. Ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this U.S. troop withdrawal, telling CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in January, ""deadlines should not be dogmas"" and that there should be a ""willingness to reexamine"" the withdrawal date. Is Obama's withdrawal plan a wise policy? Short answer: Of course not. One only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an Afghanistan without some kind of residual American presence. Without American forces in the country, there is a strong possibility Afghanistan could host a reinvigorated Taliban allied to a reinvigorated al Qaeda, not to mention ISIS, which is gaining a foothold in the region. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for Afghanistan. But it would also be quite damaging to U.S. interests to have some kind of resurgent al Qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks. It would also be disastrous for the Democratic Party, should it win the presidency in 2016, to be the party that ""lost"" Afghanistan. After all, the Democratic Party is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the Republicans and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual American presence in Afghanistan, al Qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the Afghan-Pakistan border region against American interests somewhere in the world. On Tuesday, President Obama announced that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015. But this welcome development does not change the central issue, which is the Obama administration's withdrawal date of December 2016 for all U.S. forces. Merely because the Obama administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 doesn't mean that suddenly at the same time that the Taliban will lay down their arms, nor that the Afghan army will be able to fight the Taliban completely unaided. Nor does it mean that al Qaeda -- and ISIS, which is beginning to establish small cells in Afghanistan -- would cease to be a threat. An easy way for potential Democratic presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to distinguish their national security policies from Obama's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an Iraq-style outcome. Similarly, as the Republican Party starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign, potential candidates such as Jeb Bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist Rand Paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long-term presence in Afghanistan. This U.S. military presence in Afghanistan doesn't have to be a large, nor does it need to play a combat role, but U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan to advise the Afghan army and provide intelligence support. Such a long-term commitment of several thousand American troops is exactly the kind of force that the Obama administration was forced to deploy to Iraq following ISIS's lightning advances there over the past year. Selling a longer-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation's government. Consider that within 24 hours of being installed, the new Afghan government led by Ghani and Abdullah signed the basing agreement that allows American troops to stay in Afghanistan until December 2016. Consider also that the Afghan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the United States lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term U.S. military presence. Consider also that many Afghans see a relatively small, but long-term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability. It is also not in Pakistan's interests for Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban or be thrust into another civil war. The Pakistanis have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the Taliban to flourish on their own soil, most recently in the Taliban attack in December on the army school in Peshawar that killed 132 children. It is in Pakistan's own interest that the Afghan army is able to fight effectively against the Taliban, which is more likely if they continue to have American advisers at their side. Other regional powers such as the Chinese worry about Chinese Uighur separatists establishing themselves on Afghan soil. The Russians are similarly worried about Islamist terrorist groups located in Afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country. Keeping a relatively small, predominantly U.S. Special Forces, presence in Afghanistan to continue to train the Afghan army past December 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both Afghans and Americans. Both the Democratic and Republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign. And Obama should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next President.","President Obama is planning withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by end of 2016 .

"(CNN)The terrorists who attacked the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police, Tunisia's President told CNN. ""They had them, but they didn't work, because the police turned up and they were shot down and they didn't have the time to get these vests to work. Because had they done so, we would have had major catastrophe,"" President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. A third museum attacker remains at large, Essebsi said. Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. Essebsi told Amanpour 15 arrests had been made since Wednesday's attack, in which 23 people were killed. Most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. Essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of ISIS who had been trained in Libya. This echoed comments made by Tunisia's Security Minister Rafik Chelly on Friday, who said two attackers had been given weapons training at Libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The message said the group had targeted ""crusaders and apostates"" with ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" in bloodshed that was ""just the start.""  CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. An uncle of suspect Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. He said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. ""It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,"" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Morales contributed to this report.","The Bardo Museum attackers wore suicide vests, Tunisia's President tells CNN .

"(CNN)The A320, the aircraft involved in a crash in France on Tuesday, has for several decades been a key component in the rivalry between manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. The twin-engined A320 entered service in 1988, some two decades after its single-aisle rival, Boeing's 737. As of March 2015, there have been a total of 11,537 orders for the A320, with 6,452 deliveries to date and slightly fewer aircraft flying globally by more than 300 operators. Airbus says the entire fleet has accumulated 150 million flight hours in more than 85 million flights. The A320 family ranges from the smaller A318 (about 100 seats), to the upgraded A321 (about 185 to 220 passengers depending on the class configuration). The short to medium-range A320 is the most popular version with a range of about 3,300 nautical miles or 6,150 kilometers. It has a wingspan of 35.8 meters (with wing fins called sharklets), a length of 37.57 meters and a maximum payload of 16.6 tonnes, according to Airbus. The aircraft -- Flight 9525 -- involved in Tuesday's crash was operated by Germanwings, a subsidiary of German flag carrier Lufthansa. Airbus said the 150-seat aircraft, which had been flying between Barcelona, Spain and Dusseldorf, Germany, was 24 years old, having been delivered to Lufthansa from its production line in 1991. It said the A320 had accumulated approximately 58,300 flight hours in 46,700 flights. It was powered by CFM 56-5A1 turbofan engines, the latest versions of which are capable of delivering up to 33,000 pounds of thrust. The aircraft manufacturer said it was sending a ""go-team of technical advisers"" to assist French authorities at the scene of the crash. Germanwings' fleet includes 15 active A320s, according to another database, planespotters.net. The A320-200 can seat up to 180 passengers in a single-class configuration. The Germanwings plane was carrying 150 people, including six crew members. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 55 incidents involving the A320, not including Tuesday's crash. In December 2014, an Airbus A320 operated by AirAsia Indonesia crashed into the Java Sea en route from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore. All 162 people on board Flight QZ8501 were killed. ""The A320 has a fantastic safety record,"" said Phil Seymour, the president of the International Bureau of Aviation. ""There have been a couple of incidents, but generally speaking, they're safer than most aircraft out there now."" Seymour adds that at 24 years old, the aircraft involved in the crash was probably nearing the final years of its working life, but that would not affect safety. ""Airlines would usually consider retiring an aircraft at the 25-30 years point because maintenance costs increase beyond that. ""These things fly day-in and day-out and are designed to go on and on. Airlines usually only decide to retire them because maybe there's a younger aircraft that doesn't use as much fuel and doesn't cost so much to run."" The A320 is a twin engine single aisle aircraft seating 150 passengers in a standard two classes configuration. The first A320 entered service in March 1988. By the end of February 2015 nearly 6,200 A320 Family aircraft were in operation worldwide. To date, the entire fleet has accumulated some 150 million flight hours in over 85 million flights. The worst A320 incident in terms of fatalities was the 2007 crash of a TAM Linhas Aereas plane that killed all 187 on board, plus a further 12 people on the ground when it failed to stop and went off the runway during landing in Sao Paulo in wet conditions. In 2009, in an incident known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson, pilot Chesley Sullenberger landed a U.S. Airways A320 on the Hudson River in New York when the plane lost lost power in its engines after hitting a flock of geese. All on board survived. CNN's Barry Neild contributed to this report.","There have been more than 11,000 orders for the Airbus A320 family .

"(CNN)The beauty of Afghanistan -- a country blemished by wars, upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world, and by many Afghans themselves. In the last few decades, little attention has been paid to the other Afghanistan: the sweet melodies, the kind people, and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions. This is understandable. It would be irresponsible to solely focus on those positives while families are torn apart and the noise of war rings in people's ears. Generations of Afghans have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear. Afghanistan has been the largest refugee-producing country for 32 years. One out of every four refugees worldwide is Afghan, according to the United Nations. Recently, I was watching an engrossing reality TV show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program. I explained that it was ""Afghan Star,"" Afghanistan's answer to ""American Idol."" She was shocked by the set and the sophisticated arena stage where the stars were standing. That stage could easily have been in New York, Los Angeles, London or Rome. This, I realized, is the Afghanistan no one believes exists, or has ever existed. Afghanistan has a rich tradition of music, poetry, and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the Silk Road. After all, the famous Sufi poet Mawlana Jalalideen Rumi was from modern-day Afghanistan. I grew up across the river in Tajikistan, hearing Afghan songs and tales of the parties in Kabul, and learning about Afghan singers, who are beloved across the region. I started watching ""Afghan Star"" last year after hearing about contestant Dawood Pazhman from Afghanistan's remote northeastern province of Badakhshan, who traveled 16 hours (sometime on foot) to Kabul to audition for the show. This year, another contestant, Panj Shanbe Maftoon, also traveled from that remote region for a chance to audition. Panj Shanbe told TOLO TV, which produces ""Afghan Star,"" that he did not have enough to eat and didn't have money for his commute to Kabul. But he knew, he said, that in this day and age, in his new Afghanistan, he can hope, dream, and make things happen. Panj Shanbe's story was so compelling, I have tuned in every week for months now to see what he will sing and whether he will be safe from elimination. He is now among the top three contestants. As I watched every show, the beacon of hope of a new Afghanistan became clear to me. Young men and women auditioned, speaking of peace and coexistence, supporting one another outside of tribes or ethnic lines. They wanted what my own children want -- the freedom to explore being a young adult and to follow their dreams. This is the new Afghanistan -- the struggles around poverty, religion and resilience are ever-present, but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter. ""Afghan Star"" is a source of pride, happiness and escape for many Afghans. When you talk to any Afghan around the world, they know all about the contestants and the judges. They openly give their opinions and feel that they are a part of the process; anyone around the world can vote via SMS and call-ins. The panel of judges acts as an amplifier for the voices of the vulnerable, bringing attention to orphans, poverty, and the plight of women. This grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in Afghanistan -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell. The stalwart female judge, Shahla Zaland, comes from a family of famous composers and singers. Last year told the contestants a heart-wrenching story about her father's life abroad as a refugee and how she believes her father ""died of homesickness."" Her presence on the panel of judges is a reminder that women are strong, women do not need to be veiled, and that female contestants who audition should be championed. There is a beacon of hope in just looking at how much the show has changed in its 10 seasons. During the first season, after years of the Taliban's ban on music, a female contestant performed without a hijab, resulting in death threats. The young woman had to go into hiding. This season, for International Women's Day, the show celebrated Afghan women. Male contestants dedicated songs and presented flowers to the women, singing of the strength of Afghan mothers. A young woman performed, dancing with her hair flowing freely. The show ended with a dedication to Afghani poetess Nadia Anjuman. Anjuman studied literature in secret during the Taliban occupation, becoming a well-known published poet before her husband killed her at age 25. He found her writings inappropriate and a stain on his honor. The beautiful irony is that Anjuman's words live on in books and songs today. Shahla Zaland performed a song that put Anjuman's poetry to music. Wearing an Afghan flag around her shoulders, her hair uncovered, she brought Anjuman's words to life: . ""I am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind. ""I am an Afghan woman and so I wail."" With three contestants left, the show will end Friday night, appropriately on Nawruz, the Perisan New Year celebrated in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Iran. Though Panj Shanbe was my initial reason for watching the show, I will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the ""Afghan Star."" The reality is we are all winners because of one TV program. Those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice, away from the homeland, get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country, sparking renewed belief in the new Afghanistan. And people in Afghanistan are given glimpses of what the new Afghanistan can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war, who can pursue their dreams.","""Afghan Star"" is Afghanistan's answer to ""American Idol""
But the TV show is more -- it gives Afghan refugees and the world a look at a changing society ."
"(CNN)In a side room at the American University of Nigeria, four girls chat and giggle. One teenage girl in particular catches our attention. She looks familiar. Then we realize why. We met her just a few weeks after Boko Haram had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students. As the Boko Haram trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants' territory, she and her friend bravely jumped, barely escaping with their lives. She was one of the lucky ones. School, she says, from that day on became a reminder of what almost happened. A place she never wanted to return. But now she is back and the change in her is remarkable. She dreams of remaining in the classroom as a teacher, so that just like her tutors, she can influence and inspire young minds. Studying with her here are 21 other girls from Chibok. They, too, escaped Boko Haram. Like hundreds of others across Nigeria's North East, they were targeted simply for going to school. Choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education, which they hope will bring change back home. ""My people need my support,"" one girl says. ""And me going to school will make that change,"" She wants to be a surgeon. In a part of the world often lacking the most basic health care infrastructure, she has chosen to bring value to her community. One of three students we spoke to who want to study medicine, she's extraordinarily focused and firm in her responses. It is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at Boko Haram's hands, what they almost lost. Some questions, though, they can't answer: any questions about the night of the attack, any reference to the friends still missing. These are too hard. Enrolled on scholarships at the university, these girls are the lucky ones, and they know it. There are 46 other Chibok girls who also escaped Boko Haram, but there are no funds available to pay for their education. Dr. Margee Ensign, the school's vice-chancellor, is hoping to change that by raising funds through the university's foundation. ""The world paid, and rightly so, a lot of attention to the close to 300 that were kidnapped,"" she says. ""We heard through various people that some had escaped that night and when it came to our attention that about a dozen wanted to come to AUN, we thought, we can do that!"" She did more then just raise the funds. When the parents agreed to release their girls into her care, she and her security director traveled -- just the two of them -- to the outskirts of Chibok to go and get the girls, in spite of the insecurity. Even on campus, though, the specter of Boko Haram is never far away. The American University is in Adamawa state, one of the states in North East Nigeria that is under a state of emergency. This calls for constant vigilance at the school: Cars are searched by hand and guards and sniffer dogs are on constant patrol. For the girls, to remain in school, they must draw upon all their reserves of courage. It is a reality these extraordinarily self-possessed young ladies softly acknowledge. When I ask how it is they are able to persevere, one girl says with a slight smile, ""I'm very brave and determined."" She really is. All the girls are. But they're hoping a day will come when they won't have to be.","Nigerian girls escaped after Boko Haram abducted them from school .

"(CNN)Iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against ISIS. But as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS insurgents, there is an important question that the United States and its allies should be asking: Could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring Iraq's stability? The reality is that short-term tactical victories won't be enough to defeat ISIS, especially as the reliance on Iran-backed Shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local Sunni population. Indeed, the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the Shiite militias, whose track record of sectarian violence is well-documented, and their involvement threatens to drive more Iraqi Sunnis into the arms of ISIS. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the involvement of these groups ""will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism."" But based on past experience, many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated ""liberators"" than they are of the vicious extremists of ISIS who have ruled their towns over the past eight months. Historically, Iraq hasn't always needed Shiite militias under Iran's command to fight Sunni extremists. Al Qaeda was expelled from northern Iraq in 2007, when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti-U.S. insurgency, prompting them to make common cause with the Americans in what became known as the ""Awakening"" movement. Unfortunately, once its goal had been achieved, Baghdad rounded on the Awakening, betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted Sunni elected representatives. The United States looked the other way, deeming it a ""domestic"" political matter. That simply emboldened then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to deepen his purge of Sunni elected representatives, and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many Sunni leaders. This undermined the work that the United States had done in persuading Iraq's Sunnis that fighting al Qaeda and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests. Put simply, al-Maliki's actions made a mockery of any Sunni confidence in the electoral system or the national government. It was the resulting Sunni alienation that allowed al Qaeda's successor, ISIS, back into those communities. The growing fear among many Sunnis has been compounded by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's statement to parliament that any Iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with ISIS -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary Sunnis, many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a Shiite-led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated. And ISIS has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation, which persists despite the Obama administration having convinced itself that al-Abadi would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same Shiite Islamist party. All this suggests that the ""Awakening"" experience, which showed that Iraqi Sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so, is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating ISIS. But the outcome must be different from the last Awakening. Sunnis willing to fight ISIS should be given control over their own affairs in northern Iraq in the way that Kurdish aspirations have been accommodated. The alternative, of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists, is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it. Getting to a new political order in Iraq that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise, not only among Iraqis but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- Iraq has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by Iran and the Saudis. Creating a political order capable of stabilizing Iraq will require a new security ""grand bargain"" negotiated between the key stakeholders. Short-term tactical victories won't defeat ISIS, and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal. The reality is that ultimately, only a political deal that guarantees Iraqi Sunnis' inclusion, equality and protection -- one that is implemented by Iran and its allied Iraqi militia -- can resolve the ISIS problem. And unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together, Iraq is likely to remain a battleground where the United States finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem.","Iraqi forces have been involved in an offensive to retake Tikrit .

"Boston (CNN)Dun Meng knew to pull over his Mercedes-Benz SUV to respond to a text message that night in April 2013. That's when a man got out of another car, jumped into his SUV and pointed a gun at him. ""He asked me, 'Do you know the Boston Marathon explosion?' "" Meng told a crowded courtroom Thursday, speaking in halting English. An interpreter who spoke Meng's native Mandarin sat next to him but was not needed. ""He asked, 'You know who did it? I did it and I just killed a policeman in Cambridge,' "" Meng said a man later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev told him. Meng was on the witness stand in the death penalty trial of admitted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tamerlan's younger brother. He recalled seeing the flashing lights of police cars in Cambridge earlier that night. ""After that, how did you feel?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb asked. ""Terrified. The whole world is looking for him at the time. ... I thought it was just a typical robbery."" There was nothing typical about the days after the Boston Marathon bombings, which killed three people and hurt more than 240 others. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Prosecutors say Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev had earlier killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time, does not dispute he was present when Collier was killed on the evening of April 18, 2013, nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier. He is being tried on 30 charges -- 17 of which carry the possibility of the death penalty. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, would not survive the night. He was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an ""officer down"" at MIT. It was after Collier's killing that Meng encountered the Tsarnaev brothers. Tsarnaev's 'manifesto': OK to kill civilians . At the time, he was working on his master's degree at Northeastern University. Meng, a partner at a company that created a food delivery app, recalled feeling tired after work. He drove along the Charles River with no destination in mind. He pulled over after receiving a text message. ""I'm a traffic engineer, and I know it is unsafe to text while I'm driving,"" he said. A car pulled up quickly and stopped. A man in the car walked over. Meng said he thought the man wanted directions. Instead, the man pulled open the SUV door and climbed in. Meng said Tamerlan Tsarnaev demanded cash. He said he had about $45 on him. ""He said, 'That's not enough. Where's your wallet?' So I give him my wallet, but there's no cash in the wallet."" The man pulled the magazine out of his handgun. He showed Meng it was loaded. ""I'm serious,"" Meng testified that the man told him moments before admitting to being the Boston Marathon bomber. ""So don't be stupid."" Jurors see Tsarnaev's writings on boat . After he handed over the cash, Meng said the man ordered him to drive. He said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev followed in a Honda but later got in the backseat of the SUV. ""He ordered me to every direction,"" he said of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. ""We had a conversation. ... He asked me my name and he asked me where I'm from. First few minutes my hands were shaking and I was having trouble driving. I was very scared."" Meng said his name was Manny. The man laughed when he thought Meng said Nanny. ""I said I'm Chinese. He said, 'OK, you are Chinese. I am Muslim and Muslims hate Americans.' I responded, 'I'm Chinese. Chinese are very friendly toward Muslims.' "" At one point, the carjacker asked Meng for the PIN code on his bank card. ""I tell him the PIN code,"" he testified. ""It started with 86, somebody's birthday. He asked me if I was born in 1986, and I said yes."" Meng testified that he asked Tamerlan Tsarnaev: ""Are you going to kill me tonight? He told me, 'I'm not going to kill you. Just relax, man.' "" The witness pointed to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as the man who later sat in the backseat behind him. The men played a CD as they drove around. ""I would say weird,"" he said of the music. ""It sounded religious."" New surveillance footage revealed . At one point, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went into a gas station convenience store to pay for gas and load up on snacks, Meng testified. Tamerlan fiddled with a GPS device. Meng unbuckled his seat belt, opened the SUV door and got away, dashing across the street to another service station. He never looked back. Meng begged a worker to call the police. He hid there until officers arrived. It was ""the most difficult decision in my life,"" he said. ""I could feel he was trying to grab me. His hand was so close to my left hand I could feel the wind."" Cambridge police Officer Michael Nickerson had to talk Meng out of a gas station storage room when he arrived. ""He was trembling,"" Nickerson testified. ""He was very scared. You could tell he was a victim of something."" Tsarnaev's connections: Who's who .

"(CNN)The man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, authorities said. The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. ""What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,"" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. ""I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,"" Richel said. ""I didn't hear him say anything,"" she said. ""Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today."" She said the man came ""within inches"" of whacking her with the machete. ""This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,"" Richel said. ""And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible."" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. ""Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,"" she said. ""I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him."" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. ""What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,"" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. ""The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,"" Normand said. ""Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else."" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said ""there is a mental illness component"" in their investigation of the suspect. ""No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,"" Normand said. ""And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior."" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Suspect dies after treatment for bullet wounds .
