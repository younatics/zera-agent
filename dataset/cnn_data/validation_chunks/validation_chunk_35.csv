"Frustrated commuters spend the equivalent of 16 working days a year sitting in traffic jams, a survey reveals today. It says gridlock in major cities has ‘worsened considerably’ over the past 12 months. In the most congested areas, evening rush hour journeys last 80 per cent longer than they would in free-flowing traffic. Frustrated commuters spend the equivalent of 16 working days a year sitting in traffic jams, a survey reveals today. Pictured: Traffic on the M25 anti-clockwise towards the Dartford Crossing . The poll is published ahead of the Easter Bank Holiday getaway, when 16million people are expected to hit the road. It found that last year, 14 of the UK’s 17 biggest cities had worse congestion than they did in 2013. Delays at morning and evening rush hour are wasting 129 hours a year – the equivalent of 16 eight-hour working days. Belfast has the worst jams, with the average journey lasting 39 per cent longer than it would if the roads were clear. London was the next-worst city for hold-ups with average journeys taking 37per cent longer than in free-flowing traffic and 67per cent in the evening peak. 1 - Belfast: 82 per cent . 2 - London: 67 per cent . 3 - Edinburgh: 71 per cent . 4 - Brighton/Hove: 59 per cent . 5 - Manchester: 72 per cent . 6 - Bristol:  56 per cent . 7 - Nottingham: 57 per cent . 8 - Liverpool: 49 per cent . 9 - Newcastle: 51 per cent . 10 - Leicester: 52 per cent . 11 - Sheffield: 54 per cent . 12 - Leeds/Bradford: 55 per cent . 13 - Cardiff: 49 per cent . 14 - Birmingham: 50 per cent . 15 - Glasgow: 48 per cent . 16 - Southampton: 51 per cent . 17 - Portsmouth: 45 per cent . Source: TomTom Traffic Index 2015 . Other cities where gridlock has got worse include  Nottingham, Leicester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Southampton. Bristol the only destination where jams had eased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013. Figures for Sheffield and for Leeds/Bradford ‘failed to improve’ and were about the same over the period. Analysis of 12 trillion pieces of traffic data worldwide revealed, perhaps not surprisingly, that the evening rush hour is the most congested time of day. Worldwide, the worst city was Istanbul, with average journeys taking 58per cent longer than in free-flowing conditions, rising to as high as 109per cent in the evening peak. At 55 per cent, Mexico City was the second-worst world city, followed by Rio de Janeiro which was 51 per cent. The survey was carried out by sat-nav firm TomTom, which analysed 12trillion pieces of traffic data worldwide. Its vice-president for traffic, Ralf-Peter Schaefer, said: ‘Road authorities and local governments can use traffic data to better manage traffic flow and businesses can plan smarter working hours.’ Roads over the long Bank Holiday and extended school-holiday break are set to be 'twice as busy this Easter', says traffic information firm INRIX which monitors flows on the nation's highways. And journey times to major airports like Heathrow and Gatwick are set to quadruple from Thursday as gridlock on the key M25 orbital motorway between Leatherhead J9 and the M1 at J21 suffers delays of two hours.","Delays at morning and evening rush hour are wasting 129 hours a year .

"The most luxurious, exclusive and powerful production Range Rover ever launched has broken cover in New York – with a £150,000 price tag to match. From the company that is providing most of the villains’ cars in the new 007 movie ‘SPECTRE’, the new flagship 4X4 has been specially engineered at Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) new elite Special Vehicle Operations unit. It was unveiled today at the New York International Motor Show in the US - one of the company’s biggest export markets. Scroll down for video . The luxurious, exclusive and powerful Range Rover SVAutobiography has broken cover in New York, and comes with a £150,000 price tag . The SVAutobiography is designed to take the Range Rover to ‘another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement’, coming with luxurious seating and a chiller compartment . The ‘special ops’ arm of JLR has fitted the Range Rover SVAutobiography with a powerful supercharged 5-litre V8 engine which develops a staggering 539bhp of pulling-power – equivalent to five Ford Fiestas. It is the sort of power normally found in an Italian supercar - and gives the off-roader a top speed of around 150mph. But JLR stress that it isn’t just about performance on and off-road. The SVAutobiography is designed to take the Range Rover to ‘another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement’. A spokesman said: 'The SVAutobiography is the most luxurious and powerful series-production Range Rover in the model’s successful 45-year history.’ The unique front grille is finished in distinctive Graphite Atlas and polished chrome. Passengers in the back can relax in luxurious seating complete with a chiller compartment and powered deployable tables. Stowed in the boot and hand-crafted from Windsor leather, two seats can be deployed to provide comfortable chairs on the tailgate . Solid aluminium coat hooks are incorporated into the rear pillars while, on the floor, aluminium seat rail finishers and deep twist pile mohair carpet mats add to the luxurious feel. John Edwards, managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations, said: ‘Range Rover originally defined the luxury SUV segment and the new SVAutobiography, developed by Special Vehicle Operations, takes Range Rover to another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement.' The car also has what Jaguar Land Rover is calling ‘event seating’. Stowed in the boot and hand-crafted from Windsor leather, the two seats can be deployed to provide comfortable chairs for adults who want to sit on the tailgate. A spokesman for JLR’s Special Vehicle Operations division said: 'For the first time on a Range Rover, customers of the 2016 Model Year SVAutobiography are able to specify a unique duo-tone body colour option. 'The combination of Santorini Black upper body and nine colour choices for the lower body create true distinction and individualism. Finishing touc: The detailing continues to both the front and rear centre consoles, with distinctive materials for cup holders and socket covers . Distinctive: The new flagship 4X4 has been specially engineered at Jaguar Land Rover’s new elite Special Vehicle Operations unit . ‘Much of the driver’s switchgear, including the start-stop surround and rotary controls, are machined from solid aluminium with beautiful knurled details, as are the foot pedals. This detailing continues to both the front and rear centre consoles, with distinctive materials for the cup holder and socket covers. 'New armrest adjusters not only bring a similar level of machined detail, but also make them even easier to use.’ A leather-covered handbook and polished ‘Autobiography’ key fob with knurled finish add finishing touches. Prices for the Range Rover SVAutobiography start at £148,900 – or twice the cost of an entry-level Range Rover and around the same price as the long-awaited Bentley Bentayga 4X4, which goes on sale next year. Gerry McGovern, Land Rover’s design director and chief creative officer, added: ‘With the SVAutobiography we have taken the opportunity to optimise the Range Rover’s luxury execution and precision while delivering beautiful detailing that considerably enhances the customer’s experience of our flagship vehicle.’","Range Rover have launched their most luxurious, exclusive and powerful production vehicle in their history .

"A father-of-two has been living in a Denver church basement for the past six months to avoid deportation to his native Mexico. Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the basement of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October after officials decided to deport him. The church was able to provide sanctuary because U.S. immigration enforcement officials have a policy of not pursuing 'enforcement actions' in churches and schools. Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the basement of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October after officials decided to deport him . Now he is in limbo, and he may have to wait 10 years for his citizenship application to be considered because of huge backlogs in the system. He is hoping to apply for residency under President Obama's Deferred Action for Parents program. But the policy has stalled with a federal judge in Texas waiting to hear legal challenges from 17 states. Hernandez Garcia has been living in the U.S. illegally since 1999, when he traveled from Chihuahua with his wife and infant daughter on tourist visas, and they stayed. To pass the time he plays Su Doku and listens to the radio. He fears that if he steps outside he will be arrested. When the church is empty, he runs up and down the stairs for exercise. To pass the time he plays Su Doku and listens to the radio. He fears that if he steps outside he will be arrested. He settled in Denver where he and his brother co-own a tile-laying business with six employees. In that time his wife also give birth to another daughter and his girls are now 9 and 15. But a disagreement on a construction site in 2010 lead to assault changes being brought against him, The Denver Post reports. He was arrested when a co-worker accused him of pulling a knife on him. Hernandez Garcia was eventually acquitted of the charges, but they resulted in him showing up on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's radar and since then he has been fighting deportation proceedings. After yet another unsuccessful appeal to immigration authorities in August, ICE decided to deport him on October 21, 2014, the same day he took sanctuary in the First Unitarian Society of Denver's church. Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October 2014 after officials decided to deport him . Before his fight with ICE, he and his wife had applied for legal permanent resident visas in 2005 through his father-in-law, who is a U.S. citizen, but because of a backlog it could be 2025 before they receive a decision. Though confined to the church, Hernandez Garcia says he keeps busy. He has painted the walls in the church offices. His family, friends and supporters frequently visit. With help from the American Friends Service Committee and legal counsel, Garcia is also trying to get his case re-opened. 'I don't have a criminal record, I have more than ten years [in the United States], I have kids,' said Garcia. 'I think I have a good case. But the courts say no.' As of May, Garcia could apply under Obama's Deffered Action for Parents Plan. The bill means all parents of legal citizen children born on or before November 20, 2014 are eligible. Since October Hernandez Garcia has been living in the First Unitarian Church where he has painted the walls and watched TV to keep him company . Hernandez Garcia hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country . But getting approved will take months, and Garcia is worried that he could be removed from his family and deported in the meantime. On December 2, Garcia's wife, Ana, as well as their two daughters, traveled to Washington, D.C. to try to halt his deportation. While there, they met with two officials from the Department of Homeland Security and members of the Colorado Congressional delegation. Representatives Diana DeGette, Jared Polis and Ed Perlmutter all signed on to a request for 'stay of removal' for Garcia, and the day after the family returned to Denver, Garcia's attorney sent in the paperwork to re-open his case. He has yet to hear back. Hernandez Garcia says he will claim sanctuary until he knows he will not be deported, he says. He hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country. On December 2, Garcia's wife, Ana, as well as their two daughters, traveled to Washington, D.C. to try to halt his deportation . His campaign is being backed by the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, who have taken in other immigrants who face deportation .","Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October .

"A pet goldfish is recovering from an operation to remove a cancerous eye after its owner paid hundreds of pounds for the procedure. Star the goldfish underwent the fiddly operation at Inglis Veterinary Hospital in Dunfermline, Fife, to remove one eye, which was cancerous and had left the fish blind.

Pictured: Star the fish ahead of the procedure . The operation to remove the cancerous eye was carried out by exotic animals expert Brigitte Lord (right), who received help from a vet to keep the goldfish under anaesthetic (left) and a nurse to monitor its heart rate . The procedure was paid for by the Gordon family, who also shelled out for an operation to remove a lump from their other pet goldfish, Nemo. Both operations, carried out last Friday, cost the family nearly £500 . The operations, which cost nearly £500, were carried out on the same day. Star, a six-inch goldfish, was welcomed into the Gordon family 12 years ago after being won at a local fair by Abby Gordon, now a 21-year-old student in Glasgow. The pet fish live with her mother Janie in Dollar, Clackmannanshire. Mrs Gordon said: 'I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on an operation for a goldfish but what was the alternative? 'I think we've a social responsibility to look after our pets and I know my daughter would have been distraught if anything had happened to the goldfish. 'Star is fine.He's swimming about happily and the vets have shown me how to give antibiotics too. 'I probably couldn't have chosen a better vets. I'm not sure anyone else would have attempted it.' During the operation on Friday, the vets used Doppler ultrasound equipment to listen through earphones to pulse sounds in order to evaluate Star's blood flow. To keep the fish asleep throughout the procedure, the pet was syringed with oxygenated water containing anaesthetic.

After the procedure, Star (right) was delicately held in a bucket of oxygenated water before being joined by the Gordon family's other goldfish, Nemo, who underwent an operation on the same day to remove a lump . After the procedure, Star was delicately held in a bucket of oxygenated water and, with its mouth kept open, was gently moved, mimicking the swimming action. This allowed water to flow over its gills for about for eight minutes, before the fish effectively came back to life. The operation was carried out by exotic animals expert Brigitte Lord, who received help from a vet to keep the goldfish under anaesthetic and a nurse to monitor its heart rate. Ms Lord said: 'This is a highly specialist field, using anaesthetic on a goldfish carries a very high risk and I'm delighted for the owner that everything went okay and the owners are happy. 'The financial value of a goldfish may be quite small but I think the fact that someone should have paid that much for an operation reflects the true value of the bond between pets and humans.' Star and Nemo are now recovering from surgery in their tank, which is situated in the kitchen of Mrs Gordon's home. Adam Tjolle, managing director of Inglis Veterinary Hospital, said: 'In all my years as a vet I have never known anything quite like this. It's been an amazing experience.' Star and Nemo are not the first goldfish to undergo traumatic operations. Earlier this year, Australian veterinarian Dr Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Melbourne - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George. The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on its head, making it difficult for the fish to breathe and swim. The amphibian was also unable to eat properly and the tumour was affecting its ability to see. Its owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour, which was sprouting from its head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105). During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was delicately cut out. Australian veterinarian Dr Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Melbourne - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a large tumour on its head . In January, a devoted pet owner in Norfolk spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated. The man, who was not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste. He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300. The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead. Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside. A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.

"Gisela Triana, 48, says she's 'disappointed in herself' following her drunk driving arrest . A Texas judge has been arrested for drunk driving following a party with several local lawyers at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' in Austin. Travis County civil judge Gisela Triana, 48, had an empty bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her Chevy Suburban when she was pulled over for speeding Friday night, police said. Triana has been on the bench since 1999, when she was appointed to fill the seat of another judge who resigned in the wake of a drunk driving arrest, according to the Austin Chronicle. The judge told cops that she had been with several other Austin lawyers and judges at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' who was in town for South By Southwest. The officer who pulled her over said she was driving 47mph in a 30mph zone. Police say Triana refused a breath test and claimed she had only four drinks before getting behind the wheel, the Austin American-Statesman reports. She claimed she had two drinks at the Jimmy Kimmel show and two more drinks at Zax Restaurant & Bar. She was pulled over less than two miles from the bar. Triana allegedly could not walk a straight line during a field sobriety test. The officer said her eyes were glassy, she smelled of alcohol and slurred her words. Triana says she was at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' with several lawyer friends, including other judges. She claims she had four drinks throughout the night . Triana, a mother of four, was first appointed to the bench in 1999 to replace a judge who resigned over a drunk driving arrest . The cop took the judge in for a blood draw - the results of which are still pending. She was arrested and released the next morning on bail. Triana, who is a former misdemeanor court judge and former prosecutor with the Travis County Attorney's Office, issued a statement saying she is 'disappointed in herself.' 'Regardless of the outcome of the pending investigation, I am very disappointed in myself and am sorry for any conduct that has made this legal process necessary. Whether it is determined that I was legally intoxicated or not, the investigation itself indicates that I have not met my own standards of careful conduct,' she said. The results of the blood test will determine whether Triana faces formal criminal charges.","Gisela Triana had an empty bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her Chevy Suburban when she was pulled over, police say .

"A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a ""girlfriend experience"" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' – which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it – has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, including the rights to privacy, health and protection from degrading treatment. The law may even flout the human right to life. If prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous, Laura has no doubt that deaths will follow. 'Sex workers are going to suffer,' she said. 'I witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when I was working in Dublin. As soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit, violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it wasn't too long before [21-year-old sex worker] Sinead Kelly was stabbed to death by a client.' Last year, a similar law was proposed in the UK by MP Fiona Mactaggart. But after a campaign by the English collective of Prostitutes (ECP), the Sex Worker Open University and the Women's Institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote. Laura Watson of the ECP said they are behind Laura Lee's fight in Northern Ireland. 'Internationally, sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger,' she said. 'Legal challenges, spearheaded by sex workers, are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection.'","Laura Lee, 37, travels between Scotland and Ireland as a sex worker .

"The tomb of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein has been destroyed in heavy clashes between militants from the Islamic State group and Iraqi forces in a fight for control of the city of Tikrit. Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam Hussein's hometown yesterday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of Tikrit within 48 hours. Video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof. Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once adorned the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the piles of rubble. Scroll down for video .

Carnage: Video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that supported the roof . Instead of the posters of the executed dictator, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders can be seen throughout the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Major General Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield. 'This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam's grave is here,' said Captain Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The IS militants, he added, set an ambush by planting bombs around the tomb. ISIS has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that also saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control. The terror group was helped in its conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimized by Baghdad's newly Shiite-dominated government. ISIS claimed in August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt, the building suffered only minor damage.

Reports: ISIS claimed as long ago as August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt, the building suffered only minor damage . Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shiites and Kurds. His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007. The complex featured a marble octagon at the centre of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried. The extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until U.S. forces toppled him in 2003. Iraqi media reported last year that the dictator's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting. Its current location is not known.

Members of Peace Brigades - a Shiite militia group loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr - are seen heading to Tikrit, where Iraqi troops backed by Shiite fighters and Iranian advisers are fighting Islamic State extremists . Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month. Concerns are mounting that Iraq's Shiite militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents. Amnesty International last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones. Its statement noted 'numerous atrocities' against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces. Shiite militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the Sunni towns they capture from the Islamic State group, making it impossible for residents to return. Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence. Members of Peace Brigades sit with their weapons in an armored vehicle as they leave Baghdad for Tikrit .

Innocent: A boy holds a white flag as he passes through a checkpoint manned by Sunni fighters who have joined Shi'ite militia groups allied with Iraqi forces against the Islamic State . A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the United Nations, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged. Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shiite militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and U.S. officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group. Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shiite militias, said that the Islamic State militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror. 'We want to take revenge on those IS militants who killed our children,' he said.","Executed dictator's once-lavish tomb is now just a mountain of rubble .

"Youngsters who get themselves Saturday jobs like Brooklyn Beckham or Jamie Oliver's kids may end up harming their grades, a report has found. While it may do celebrity children – like David and Victoria Beckham’s son, who grabbed a few weekend shifts at a coffee shop – the world of good to get some work experience, research suggests it could come at a cost to young people’s education. Celebrity chef Jamie recently revealed he intends to keep his daughters ‘real’ by having them work in his pub on the weekends. Youngsters who get themselves Saturday jobs may end up harming their grades, a report has found. Jamie Oliver (pictured with his wife and children) says he will encourage his kids to work in his pub on weekends . But a new study by the Institute for Social and Economic at the University of Essex found teenagers who take on part-time jobs experience a slip in their GCSE results. This is because earning extra cash makes it more likely for youngsters to spend it unwisely – including on alcohol, cigarettes and and cannabis. And the effect was found to be more drastic for girls. Despite having millionaires for parents, Brooklyn Beckham took on weekend shifts at a coffee shop . Results showed an extra hour of work per week in Year 10 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year. The study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time, other activities and their grades at GCSE level. Dr Angus Holford, who wrote the report called Youth Employment and Academic Performance, says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16-year-olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time. ‘This can be a good thing – they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills, which might help them find full-time work in the future,’ he said, according to The Observer. ‘However, they may spend that hard-earned money on less than useful things, or fall in with a different group of people. ‘We did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly, smoke or consume cannabis.’ He added the long-term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for ‘borderline students’ – those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed (five A*-C grades, including English and mathematics) to progression into further education. Dr Holford added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers, the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential.","David and Victoria Beckham’s son took on a few shifts at a coffee shop .

"Residents who were expecting an ‘upmarket store’ to set up shop in their leafy village have been left furious after discovering that discount chain Netto is moving in. Villagers in historic Lymm in Cheshire, who were promised a luxury supermarket as part of a new retail development, had believed a high-end chain such as Waitrose or M&S might be opening its doors. But after keeping the villagers guessing for almost ten months as to the identity of the store, it emerged that the Danish discount chain, famed for its value goods, would be moving on to the site. Historic: Residents of the village of Lymm, Cheshire, pictured, were promised a 'high quality' supermarket . High hopes: Villagers expected an upmarket supermarket such as Waitrose, M&S or Booths to move in . Disappointed: It emerged developers had leased the site to Danish discount chain Netto (file image) The announcement was met with outrage by residents of the picturesque village, who set up a petition demanding their council oppose the move. Rob Jones, who has spearheaded the campaign against the discount store, said: ‘The development was described to residents as an upmarket supermarket and that the client wanted to remain anonymous until a later stage. ‘The applicant it would appear is Netto – not a high-end supermarket as promised.’ The plans for the new food store had originally been unveiled last May by the developers, The Brookhouse Group, which boasted of an ‘upmarket store’ creating 35 jobs with parking space for 57 cars. A public exhibition was also held detailing artists’ impressions. Planning permission was approved but the identity of the retail chain was still kept under wraps. However, last week residents discovered they were not getting the supermarket they hoped for, after Netto bosses applied for an operating and liquor licence to the Labour-run Warrington Council. Netto is a Danish discount supermarket which traded in the UK under its own name until it was bought out by Asda in 2010. It launched its first ‘new look’ store in Leeds last year, in a joint venture with Sainsbury’s, promising ‘the best of the low-price discount model with a unique Scandinavian twist’. New development: An artists' impression of the new supermarket site, where the brand is not revealed . Netto is a Danish discount supermarket which traded in the UK under its own name until it was bought out by ASDA in 2010 before returning in November 2014 in a joint venture with Sainsbury's. Its first 'new look' store was launched in Leeds last November, promising customers 'the best of the low-price discount model with a unique Scandinavian twist'. Stores offer shoppers more than 2,000 products, according to an online statement. Each week, Netto highlights special limited-edition 'Spot Deals' - which have included two sirloin steaks for £3.69 and Andolini Proscecco for £5.50 a bottle - on both food and non-food items. In addition to its own branded products, Netto stocks '100 of the most popular brands that people expect to buy in their weekly shop'. In a statement released in November, the company said that 15 stores would be launched over the coming year. The supermarket in Lymm is expected to open later this year. Lymm resident Colin Fuller said locals were ‘hoodwinked’ and called for a public inquiry. He said: ‘They very clearly led us to believe it would be a high-end supermarket. We have been misled and conned.’ Conservative Councillor Sheila Woodyatt said: ‘I am not happy as I would have preferred something more upmarket. I just hoped it would be Waitrose or Booths. ‘I know it makes me sound like a terrible snob.’ Almost 200 people have now signed a petition against the store, which is due to open later this year. The historic village, where the average house price is nearly £300,000, is home to a number of high-profile residents including Coronation Street star Chris Bisson and football legend Sir Bobby Charlton. Lib Dem councillor Ian Marks said: ‘There is a clear impression that high quality meant an upmarket store – therefore the belief was that it would be a Booths, M&S or Waitrose. Netto is not what people expected.’ A spokesman for Warrington Council said ‘no final recommendation has been made’. A Netto spokeman said they would ‘surprise our new customers in Lymm’. He added: ‘We’re confident we’ll replicate the success we’ve seen at our other UK sites.’ Charming: The leafy Cheshire village of Lymm, where an average house costs nearly £300,000 .","Residents of Lymm, Cheshire, were promised a new 'high quality' store .

"A team of experts has found a way to bypass the iPhone lock screen using a DIY hacking kit . Apple phones are designed to ward off hackers by locking the phone after too many incorrect attempts at entering a passcode. But a team of experts has found a way to bypass this security feature using a DIY hacking kit made from parts bought online. The gadget plugs into a phone and simulates the PIN entry over USB meaning it can bruteforce every possible combination until it finds the correct one. Importantly, by connecting directly to the phone's power source, it can override the 'Erase data after 10 attempts' setting. The hack and device was devised by experts from London-based MDSec, authors of The Mobile Application Hacker's Handbook. It takes advantage of a flaw in iOS 8.1 that creates a tiny delay between the PIN code being entered and the phone unlocking. MDSec's device cuts the power source immediately after each failed attempt but before the attempt has been synchronised with the phone's flash memory. 'We recently became aware of a device known as an IP Box that was being used in the phone repair markets to bruteforce the iOS screenlock,' said the researchers. 'This obviously has huge security implications and naturally it was something we wanted to investigate and validate. 'Although we’re still analysing the device it appears to be relatively simple in that it simulates the PIN entry over the USB connection and sequentially bruteforces every possible PIN combination. 'That in itself is not unsurprising and has been known for some time. The hack and device was devised by experts from London-based MDSec. Its gadget uses an IP box used by some phone repairmen to bruteforce iOS screenlocks on handsets. It takes advantage of a flaw in iOS 8.1 that creates a tiny delay between the PIN code being entered and the phone unlocking . 'What is surprising is that this still works even with the “Erase data after 10 attempts” configuration setting enabled.' MDSec's total setup cost around £200 ($297), and the researchers explained that because each PIN entry takes approximately 40 seconds - including the phone shutting down  - it can take more than four days to bruteforce a four-digit code. The hack also only works if a criminal has stolen or found the phone, and it only applies to phones running iOS 8.1 or older. Apple has reportedly fixed the bug in 8.1.1 and people running older versions of the software are advised to update to the latest version.

"A rookie Los Angeles police officer is wanted for questioning in a fatal shooting that left a 23-year-old man dead in Pomona. The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta belonging to Officer Henry Solis, 27, of the LAPD, was found a short distance from the site where Salome Rodriguez Jr was gunned down early Friday, but the cop remained at large. Solis was off-duty at the time of the shooting and failed to report to work the next day. Police said they have reason to believe he knows that detectives want to interview him about the shooting. This afternoon, an arrest warrant was issued for the missing officer, who is considered armed and dangerous, according to a statement released by the LAPD. Scroll down for video . Wanted: LAPD Officer Henry Solis (left), 27, is wanted for questioning in the Thursday night fatal shooting of 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr (right) outside a Pomona nightclub . Rookie: Police say Solis joined the force last June and had not completed his probationary period . Cmdr. Andrew Smith, am LAPD spokesman, said Solis was assigned to a station in the San Fernando Valley and had not completed his probationary period since joining the force last June. Rodriguez, 23, of Ontario, died after being shot in the lower torso at around 3.30am. He worked at a Williams-Sonoma warehouse and was out with co-workers at Vive Tequila Lounge and Nightclub Thursday night, relatives told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. The LA Times reported that Rodriguez ran bleeding for more than a block before he collapsed to the ground in a parking lot. Rodriguez, the oldest of six children, was also a missionary with St. Vincent Catholic Church in Los Angeles, said his mother, Lidia Angelica Rodriguez. Pomona police have issued a poster calling Solis a 'person of interest' in the shooting that occurred in a downtown bar district after two men got into a fight. Witnesses told police the attacker fled the scene, and they saw a compact car leaving the area. Hotspot: Rodriguez was out with co-workers at Vive Tequila Lounge and Nightclub Thursday night .

Salome's aunt Aracely Monlina suggested that his killing may have resulted from a case of mistaken identity. 'Witnesses said Henry Solis got into an altercation earlier,' Monlina told CBS Los Angeles. 'Then I guess he confused Junior with that person, or something and confronted Junior. Junior said, ""It's not me, it's not me.""' Monique Ortiz, a friend of Rodriguez's, was with him at the club before the shooting. She shared a video with NBC Los Angeles showing the 23-year-old dancing and laughing in the hours before the deadly confrontation. A man who gave his name as Gene said he was also with Rodriguez at the club until closing time. Afterwards, the two friends, who had been drinking, got into Gene's Audi and settled in for a nap. Gene said when he woke up, he found his vehicle surrounded by police and paramedics. Neither Monique Ortiz nor Gene remembered seeing Henry Solis inside the club.

"Now it’s not often that I can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend. But a few weeks ago I was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing — apparently, the must-have fabric this season, as we experience a Seventies revival. As someone who remembers the Seventies all too clearly, and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round, I was interested to see how I felt about it now. I didn’t know I was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided Britain’s women, who, it seems, all have an opinion on that skirt, as it is now known. Scroll down for video . Jane Asher (pictured) was recently invited to a photoshoot to give her verdict on a new range of suede clothing, what she didn't realise was that the skirt she is pictured wearing would cause such a sensation . For the few who haven’t heard, I’m talking about the Marks & Spencer A-line suede skirt, which has been labelled: ‘The Skirt That Will Save M&S.’ Yet when I spotted it a few weeks ago, it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail, so I had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way. And . . . I didn’t much like it. I found the suede stiff and heavy, and the colour and shape channelled the Seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort. Some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them. Soon after that, all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt. It was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me — first Alexa Chung, then socialite Olivia Palermo at New York Fashion Week, both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it. Vogue heralded it ‘pure Ali MacGraw chic’ in reference to the star of the Seventies film Love Story, and suddenly it was the next big thing. Alexa Chung (pictured) was spotted in the M&S skirt in February this year . Well, I can be as easily influenced as anyone, and a horrible guilt crept over me that I hadn’t spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had. I wondered: should I rush out and grab one from M&S? Well, not much point, as it won’t be on sale to us ordinary punters until April 10. So, should I trust my first feeling that it wasn’t for me? After a bit of thought, I came full circle back to my original decision: I’m still not a fan. Yesterday, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine was one of the first to shout ‘Emperor’s New Clothes!’ when she criticised M&S for its aggressive marketing of the skirt, which, she felt — correctly in my view — seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that doesn’t follow any trend. ‘Just because a couple of Voguettes have given it their stamp of approval, we loyal M&S customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one, too,’ she said. ‘Can’t M&S see how patronising this is?’ For this suede skirt didn’t work in the Seventies and it doesn’t really work now. When I was young, most suede skirts and jackets were stiff, unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that didn’t flatter anyone — especially those of us with gingery, tan-coloured hair — and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard. Sadly, this reincarnation gave me flashbacks. The unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages, but you’ll know about it while you’re wearing it: the waistband is far from forgiving and I can’t imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down, making it stick out unattractively in front. I’m not crazy about the mid-calf length, either. Unless you have the endless legs of a model, it’s hard to carry off. It would look better with boots, of course, but with spring already here I’m hoping those can be left in the wardrobe. And I can’t see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering. Sorry, M&S, I’m giving it just three out of five: wearable for a few outings, after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe, never to be worn again. A costly foray into a brief trend — something that, at my age, I have mostly learned to avoid. UPDATED CLASSIC . Jane (pictured) loved this flattering suede dress from H&M, finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting, without the stiffness of some other suede garments . Wraparound suede dress, £199.99, hm.com . Suede block-heeled sandals, £129, reiss.com . Bangle, £39, reiss.com . Button diamond ring, £210, monicavinader.com . My favourite: It’s an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour, which suits most skin tones. The suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well. It certainly doesn’t have the stiffness that some other suede garments have, and the just-above-the-knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress. Who would have thought I’d want to be back in a wrap dress again? I thought we were over those for some time. The fabric updates this classic look. I love it — especially the great price. 5/5 . SHOULD YOU FAKE IT? The suede culottes Jane is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 . Tweed top, £129, baukjen.com . Suedette culottes, £24.99, hm.com . Heels, £225, russellandbromley.co.uk . No! No! No! Culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they’re made in a fluid fabric. These certainly don’t suit me, and I’m proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt. They cut off my legs at the least flattering part, the calves, and look more Dickensian urchin than fashion-forward fabulous. The faux fabric does feel like the real thing, but I suspect that it might crease. If I wanted some suede trousers I’d save up for a better design. 2/5 . COMFY AND CHIC . Jane (pictured) says this suede top may be worth the £249 you'd have to shell out to buy it. She found the item 'extremely chic and wearable', saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt . Suede top, £249, baukjen.com . J. Brand jeans, £180, trilogystores.co.uk . Heels, £5, everything5pounds.com . Jewelled necklace, £85, stelladot.co.uk . Deceptively simple, this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it’s extremely chic and wearable, whether teamed with tight Brand jeans or a smart skirt. I love the boxy on-trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion, as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections. This suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk, and I like the tunic slit at the top. 4/5 . MAKE A SPLASH . Another top scorer was this lilac suede dress. Jane (pictured) says it fits beautifully, skimming fluidly over the body, with the colour adding to the classy look . Suede dress, £429, baukjen.com . Blue necklace, £50, stelladot.co.uk . Suede strappy sandals, £250, lkbennett.com . This fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body. Yes, it costs a lot, but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy. The suede has an almost silky feel. I adored wearing this, but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash. Remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather, tending to show rain spots and stains easily, and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use. It may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray, and they will also need expert cleaning. 4/5 .","The A-line, suede skirt has had people talking all week, with mixed reviews .

"The NHS has spent nearly £350,000 on removing tattoos after people changed their minds about their body art. More than 2,000 people have been given free laser treatment – courtesy of the taxpayer – in the past four years, described by MPs as a ‘sheer waste’ of scarce NHS funds. Tattoo removal is not routinely provided by the NHS, but guidance states it can be carried out ‘to protect a person’s health’ if their doctor believes it is causing them ‘significant distress or serious mental health problems’. The NHS has spent £350,000 on removing people's tattoos for them once they have second thoughts (file image) It would also be considered if the dye had caused a ‘significant allergic reaction or infection’ or if someone had been tattooed against their will. A patient must be referred by their GP. Figures obtained by The Sun under Freedom of Information laws show 2,016 people had tattoos removed since 2010 at a cost of £330,182. However, the true cost is likely to be much higher, as many trusts did not provide breakdowns of the reasons for laser treatments. The number of tattoo parlours in the UK has soared from about 50 in the 1970s to 1,000 today. Their popularity has been boosted by celebrity fans, including David Beckham and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Even the Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, has a small dolphin tattoo on her ankle. However, four in ten people are said to regret having a tattoo and one in six want them removed. Laser removal uses beams of different coloured light to break down the ink into minuscule fragments, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the liver and digestive system. The popularity of tattoos has been boosted by celebrity fans, including David Beckham (pictured), Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and even Samantha Cameron . Private clinics charge around £150 a session for a small tattoo and up to £800 for a larger one. Typically eight to ten sessions are needed for large tattoos. One patient to benefit was John, 22, who had a large swastika removed from his chest and hoped to have other Nazi symbols removed from his back and arms. He told the BBC he wanted them removed so he could move abroad and take his top off while working out. He added: ‘You can’t really do that with something that is going to offend everybody... I want to move on in life. If I got them removed I’d be able to change my image.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be furious that they’re funding what amounts to cosmetic surgery. You can’t go a day in politics without someone calling for more money for the NHS, but it’s clear that too much is already wasted. ‘With Britain’s finances so stretched we have to prioritise spending on essential services, not on covering up ill-advised body art.’ Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘People will struggle to see how this sheer waste of precious NHS money can be justified when hospitals do not have enough staff. ‘Patient care is already heading downhill and more nurses could be lost under Tory spending cuts.’","More than 2,000 people have had tattoos removed by NHS since 2010 .

Don't be shy: The actress gives it her all in the gym and says women shouldn't feel embarrassed about being seen working out . Explaining the benefits of Pilates, Nicole said: 'It primarily works your core, but not just the front. 'You'll work the entire body - front, sides, back, your whole midsection, trunk - it pulls everything in and together. 'You'll become tighter, more toned, and stronger. It makes you stand taller, makes you have more confidence, makes you more grounded. You'll lose inches and get that leaner, longer look. After the first 10 sessions, you'll feel different. After 20 sessions, you'll see a difference!' Kate has proved she's passionate about health and fitness and advocates everyone giving exercise a go, regardless of their current ability. She adds that women should not feel embarrassed about working out in public. Healthy eater: Maintaining a good diet also contributes to her amazing figure but she said she still enjoys M&Ms and wine . Dazzling: The mother-of-two on stage and on the red carpet at last night's awards . 'When you get into fitness classes, nobody cares, nobody's looking at anyone else. It doesn't matter what you do or where you come from, you just become a class and everybody's there supporting everybody, and you're all there for the same reason,' she said. The actress has founded the website Fabletics with the goal of getting more people active. Members of the site can gain access to fitness programmes and support from other users. She said: 'One of the reasons I love this company is that we are trying to make something affordable that could reach a demographic that don't necessarily have the means to go to a personal trainer every day, and to motivate people to just feel good in themselves. I think that all starts with being active.' Kate has also released an accompanying fashion range of fitness clothing which she says is functional and flattering for women of all shapes and sizes. As a mother to Bingham, ten, with ex-husband Chris Robinson, and Ryder, three, with Matthew Bellamy, Kate said getting the energy to exercise isn't always easy. So when she needs a good night's sleep, she calls on her mother Goldie Hawn to babysit. She revealed that diet is also an integral part of her health and wellbeing. 'Healthy food inspires me. It's important to know what you're eating because food is fuel, and we don't want to fuel our bodies in a way that could make them sick,' she said. But she added that she's not 'a health nut' as she'll tuck into M&Ms occasionally and loves to drink wine.","Actress pictured this week looking toned in skimpy bikini on the beach .

"Britain's First World War debt has finally be repaid in full – more than 100 years after the outbreak of the conflict. The Government repaid some £1.9billion still owed to more than 100,000 people who held 'War Bonds', issued in 1917 to help fund the military effort. George Osborne said he could pay off the debts because he can borrow the money cheaper elsewhere. More than 100 years after it started, the First World War debt has been paid off by the Coalition government . The Government was paying 3.5 per cent in interest to the 120,000 people who bought the bonds in 1917. The Debt Management Office estimates that Britain has paid some £5.5 billion in total interest on the loans since 1917. Current low interest rates mean the Government is able to pay off the debt with new bonds which pay a much lower rate of interest. Mr Osborne said: 'This is a moment for Britain to be proud of. We can, at last, pay off the debts Britain incurred to fight the First World War. 'It is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it's a good deal for this generation of taxpayers. It's also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past.' British artilleryman in action during the Battle of the Somme in France in 1916 . British soldiers negotiating a shell-cratered landscape along the River Somme in late after the close of the Allied offensive . The debt repayment comes after the Government repaid £218million of debts from the First World War in October – the first time that the government paid off the war's debts in 67 years. The Tories claim that Britain can borrow at such low interest rates because the Government has got a grip of the public finances and international investors know they will get their money back if they lend it to the UK. They claim the Labour Party's spending plans would see billons added to the national debt. Treasury Secretary David Gauke said: 'There is a clear choice at this election: sticking with the competence and stability of David Cameron and the Conservatives' long-term economic plan that's securing a better future for Britain – the deficit has been halved, there are 1.85 million more people with the security of a regular wage and the economy is recovering from Labour's Great Recession. British soldiers in a trench in France with paper hats from Christmas crackers while a sentry uses a mirror to keep watch on No Man's Land . 'Or abandoning that plan for the SNP and Labour with hardworking taxpayers paying the price for the economic chaos that would result.' The warning came after Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls claimed George Osborne's spending plans would mean £70billion of cuts – more than double the amount admitted by David Cameron and George Osborne. He said if the Tories were to keep to their promises to protect spending on health, schools and overseas aid, this would mean the Foreign Office and Department for Transport being shut down altogether. Mr Balls said the government's cuts were 'so extreme that they would lead to the smallest police force since comparable records began, the smallest army since Cromwell and over a third of older people receiving social care losing their entitlement to it'. He added: 'The Tories now have a choice. They can either say that these unprecedented, extreme and close-to- impossible cuts to our police, armed forces and social care are the true consequences of their spending plans,' he said. 'Or they can confess that their plans are in fact impossible to achieve without breaking their promise to protect the NHS. 'If David Cameron and George Osborne cannot spell out how their sums add up for non-protected departments in order to achieve their fiscal surplus, the British people can only conclude - and would be right to conclude - that alternative plans do exist: to cut NHS spending and introduce charging. 'David Cameron and George Osborne must come clean or the British people will draw their own conclusions.'","Government repaid £1.9billion still owed to more than 100,000 people .

"They have long been a favourite among A-list celebrities. But it seems Mulberry handbags also have a fan in Cheryl Prudham – a pregnant mother of 11 who receives more than £39,000 a year in benefits. She was seen taking her brood to one of the store’s branches, where she splurged on the brand’s luxury products. In the bag: Cheryl Prudham with her purchase after emerging from the Mulberry store at Westfield Shopping Centre in East London . The family pose for a picture outside the store. Mrs Prudham is a pregnant mother of 11 and receives £39,000 a year in benefits . Her husband Rob, 29, pointed out an £850 red shoulder bag in the window display, before they entered the outlet at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London, last week. After browsing the designer wares, they left with a small grey Mulberry carrier bag. It is not known exactly what Mrs Prudham, 32, purchased but a purse costs £275, a wallet £295 and the classic Mulberry Bayswater handbag £895. And it is certainly not the first time the Prudhams, from Gravesend in Kent, have been spotted enjoying an indulgent lifestyle. Mrs Prudham's husband pointed out an £850 red shoulder bag in the shop window before entering the store . The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000 . Last year the family attracted attention for taking a £7,000 holiday in Menorca, with Mrs Prudham telling Closer magazine: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ And just last month, it was revealed the couple had reunited after a brief split so they can have more babies. ‘I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family,’ said Mrs Prudham, whose 12th child is due in July. The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000. They have managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. Mr and Mrs Prudham have been together for six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife's youngest children and they live in a five-bedroom council house . They live in a five-bedroom council house – but are on the waiting list for a seven-bedroom home because their current accommodation is ‘too cramped’.

"A medical student who tried to blame his ex-girlfriend for stabbing a Georgetown classmate has been found guilty of his murder. Rahul Gupta, 25, was found guilty of first-degree murder after Mark Waugh, 23, was found stabbed to death in Gupta's apartment in Silver Springs, Virginia in 2013. It took the jury just 4 1/2 hours to reach the verdict - Gupta appeared to be wiping away tears when it was announced. Scroll down for video . Rahul Gupta (right), a medical student on trial for stabbing Mark Waugh,  (left) a Georgetown law student to death has been found guilty of murder . It took the jury just 4 1/2 hours to reach the verdict - Gupta appeared to be wiping away tears when it was announced. Pictured: Gupta and his ex-girlfriend Taylor Gould . FOX5 DC . Gupta initially confessed to the crime saying he did it because Waugh was cheating with his girlfriend. But in court, Gupta's attorneys claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend Taylor Gould, who had in fact killed Waugh, reports the Washington Post. 'This was an act of violent, crazy rage,' one his attorneys, Jennifer Page, told jurors, later adding, 'You bet she was capable.' Gould who has not been charged with anything and is not on trial, testified, telling jurors that she'd been too drunk on the night in question to remember what happened. 'I had no reason to hurt anyone,' she said. My Fox DC reports Gupta took the stand during the trial in his own defense. In testimony he claimed he went to the aid of Waugh and was trying to stop the bleeding. In a 911 call placed by the girlfriend, he is heard in the background saying ""Come on Mark."" Gupta, his 23-year-old girlfriend, Waugh and one other had spent the night celebrating Gupta's birthday. Gould consumed at least six drinks, including red wine, a whiskey-and-cranberry, an Irish coffee, and a margarita. Dark turn: The group spent a Saturday night out celebrating Gupta's birthday. The first three later returned to the girlfriend's apartment where they continued to drink shots . After drinking, Gupta and Waugh returned to Gupta's girlfriend's apartment in Silver Springs at 1:30am where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol. Taylor Gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember anything clearly . Neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment, like people were moving furniture. Shortly before 3:30am Sunday morning, police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend. When they arrived on the scene, police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked. Police opened the locked door and Gould approached the officers with blood on her and said: 'I don't know what happened. Can you tell me?' Officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and Gupta lying on the floor, covered in blood. They asked Gupta if he was hurt but he said: 'I don't think so'. Prosecutor Patrick Mays told the court that when asked what had happened, Gupta told them: 'My girlfriend and my buddy were cheating. I walked in on my girlfriend and my buddy cheating. I killed my buddy.' Officers found Waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead - he had been stabbed six times  and slashed five times. His lung was punctured and his jugular vein cut. The prosecutor said: 'Mr. Waugh did not die immediately.' 'He could have lived for several minutes before dying from loss of blood.' Mays told jurors that a palm print and fingerprint — in Waugh’s blood — also implicate Gupta. At police headquarters, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake, but added: 'He tried to kill me, though'. While Gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling, the girlfriend told police she was woken up by Gupta's yelling. She says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding Waugh and he told her to call police. Above, a picture of Waugh . Defense? While being questioned by police, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that Waugh tried to kill him . Gupta's attorneys argued the reason he was covered in blood was because he had been performing CPR on his friend. Defense attorney Philip Armstrong told the court that Gould, who is now a biomedical engineer in Washington, had got blood on the red dress she was wearing and then changed her clothes before the police arrived. He asked Gould why one of her contact lenses was found stuck to the back of Waugh’s pants. My Fox DC reports that during closing arguments assistant state's attorney Timothy Hagan told the jury 'Police ask him what happens. What he confesses to is first degree murder… He's caught.' There was also a recorded phone call from jail that Gupta made to his father after his arrest saying, ""Mark and I got into a fight and he tried to get the knife."" Waugh had graduated Magna Cum Laude from James Madison University in May 2012, and went on to spend the following year in Daegu, South Korea teaching debate. Waugh had started his first year of law school at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honors society. Gupta had a similarly bright future. He earned his undergraduate degree from George Washington University and was back at the school studying to become a doctor. He also earned a master's degree in physiology from Georgetown. Fellow Langley High School-alumnus David Barton spoke about both men in The Breeze - James Madison University's student newspaper. He remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields, Waugh in liberal arts and Gupta with science and math. 'It's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved,' Barton told The Breeze. 'You think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place. You just hope that the situation could have de-escalated'.","Rahul Gupta, 25, was found guilty of first-degree murder after Mark Waugh, 23, was found stabbed to death in Gupta's apartment in Virginia in 2013 .

"A paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by My Kitchen Rules chef Pete Evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. One recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of Evans' signature Paleo creations. Scroll down for video . Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way was marketed as 'simple, delicious paleo recipes for new mothers, babies and toddlers' by 'health crusaders' Carr,  Padarin and Evans, who 'have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families' wellbeing'. The greatest concern, especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications, lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula, which is made primarily from liver and bone broth, reported The Australian Women's Weekly. Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . The broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A for infants, but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance. Professor Yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet, which excludes dairy and grains, parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force 'unproven' beliefs on them. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding. If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected,' she said. Further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes, which contradicts national health guidelines. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. In July last year, the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) criticised the paleo diet, with the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat labelling the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.' Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet, and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the Australian food industry. Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism, taking aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA)  as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. Pan MacMillan has been contacted for comment.","Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way was set for release on Friday March 13 .

"Architects in Oklahoma have planned a skyscraper for the city of Tulsa shaped called Tornado Tower. The city, which sits in Tornado Alley and sees a large number of the tower's namesake weather events, has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part-time garage. Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc, an architecture firm based in Tulsa, was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea, and has now unveiled the concept for the Tornado Tower, which would hold a severe weather museum and research center. Scroll down for video . Architecture firm Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc have designed a building for downtown Tulsa called the Tornado Tower . Architect Andrew Kinslow told Daily Mail Online that the plan 'has kind of taken on a life of its own' after it was released late last month. Plans for the funnel cloud-shaped tower currently range from 20 to 30 stories, and would multiple floors would feature outdoor terraces. Mr Kinslow said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister. The building's similarities to its real-life counterpart also include LED lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning. A restaurant on the top floor would also spin counter-clockwise, the direction of tornadoes. Mr Kinslow said that they have been contacted by multiple potential investors interested in finding out more details about the project. The firm says that the reaction has been largely positive and that two Tulsa City Councillors have already voiced support. The funnel cloud building would hold a weather museum, multiples gardens, a revolving restaurant and a research center . While the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong Oklahoma winds, its creators say the structure would be stable. A solid core would go up the middle of the building with elevators and bathrooms, according to Fox23. The building would also feature a 360-degree rotating restaurant on its top floor,  and the revolving action seems appropriate given the tower's swirling inspiration. Architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety. 'If you think of St Louis, you think of the Arch. In Seattle, you think of the Space Needle. Tulsa's one of those places where nobody thinks of anything but Indians and dust. And well, maybe tornadoes,' Kinslow said. Tornado Tower, which does not yet have a client to build it, would be held up by a strong core section with elevators. It would be located near the BOK Center (left), a 19,000-seat arena . Tornado Tower would be visible from most of the downtown Tulsa area, and the architect said his team was looking to make 'an elegant looking building'. The state of Oklahoma saw more than 80 tornadoes in 2013, though the number did not reach the 145-tornado record set in 1999, according to the National Weather Service. On top of the tower there would be a terrace designed for reporters to do weather broadcasts. Tulsa's skyline features a number of skyscrapers that would remain taller than the proposed Tornado Tower, including the 52-story Bank of Oklahoma Tower that was designed by the same architects who built the original World Trade Centers. The new tower would be located near BOK Center, the 19,000-seat home of the Tulsa Oilers. Kinslow said that discussions have also been had about moving the prospective building to a different area with more ground space. The weather museum and research center would add another skyscraper to the Tulsa skyline if it is built near the BOK Center (right)","Kinslow, Keith and Todd came up with idea to rejuvenate downtown space .

"This is the husband who allegedly burst into a busy pediatric clinic in California and shot dead his estranged wife, before killing himself, in a murder-suicide sparked by a bitter custody dispute. Neng Moua, 43, stormed a medical office  near Mariposa and S Street in Downtown Fresno on Tuesday morning and starting arguing with a 33-year-old female employee, Fresno police said. Armed with a 'large shotgun', he then apparently shot the woman - believed to be his estranged spouse with whom he had five children - several times, causing other terrified workers to flee. SWAT officers surrounded the building and ordered people to evacuate to a nearby church. A short search of the building led police to the body of the woman, a receptionist at Sang Pediatrics. Scroll down for video . 'Murder-suicide': Neng Moua (pictured in a previous mug shot), 43,allegedly burst into a busy pediatric clinic and shot dead his estranged wife, before killing himself, in a murder-suicide sparked by a custody dispute . Crime scene: Moua, 43, stormed into the door of a medical office (pictured) near Mariposa and S Street in Downtown Fresno on Tuesday morning and starting arguing with a 33-year-old female employee, police said. The victim - who had another two children from a previous relationship - was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers also discovered Moua had killed himself, leaving the couple's five children orphans. On Tuesday afternoon, Fresno Police Lt Joe Gomez confirmed the shooting and said no other injuries had been reported. Police are not searching for other suspects in relation to the incident. According to a witness, Moua was armed with a large shotgun when he entered the building just before 11am Pacific Time and opened fire after having a verbal dispute with his wife. Officers arriving on the scene heard one gunshot, followed by more shots as they began to enter the premises to conduct a sweep and an evacuation, Fresno Police Deputy Chief Pat Farmer said. There were eight staffers and eight patients at the office at the time of the shooting. Some of them hid in bathrooms, while others were seen climbing out of first-floor windows, ABC reported. Frantic messages: A woman who works at the office texted her husband, David, telling him she had witnessed the gunman shoot his wife in the chest . Bloody morning: Officers arriving on the scene heard one gunshot, followed by more shots as they began to enter the premises to conduct a sweep . Police broke at least one window to help workers trapped inside the office escape, Gomez said, adding about half the building had been searched as of about 12.30pm local time. It has since emerged that the couple at the center of the deadly incident had been locked in a custody battle over their five children. The feuding husband and wife had a pending court date in May, and the victim's co-workers believed it may have prompted the shooting Tuesday, Deputy Farmer told reporters this afternoon. Moua had a criminal history, which included an arrest on a domestic violence charge 11 years ago. SWAT officers surrounded the building near Mariposa and S Street in downtown Fresno and ordered people to evacuate . Nearby St John's Cathedral had to be evacuated during what police initially described as a hostage situation . Images on local ABC30-TV showed a large police presence at the downtown office building and the station reported that witnesses heard several gunshots there. The news channel tweeted text messages sent by an office worker to her husband saying she had witnessed the gunman shoot his wife in the chest at close range. According to ABC30, a cathedral down the street 'from a hostage situation' was being evacuated, and a helicopter flying overhead was making announcements asking anyone who had seen a man wearing a white overcoat to call 911.","Neng Moua stormed medical office in Fresno, California, Tuesday morning .

"A stag party were ordered off a flight bound for Spain after they were accused of being 'disruptive' and reducing an air steward to tears because of their behaviour. The group of 20 revellers from Wrexham in North Wales said they had paid more than £4,000 for the weekend break to Benidorm, in order to celebrate Wayne Roberts' wedding next month. After they made a male flight attendant cry, the pilot called the police and ordered the party to leave the plane - which was due to take off from Manchester Airport and fly to Alicante. Ryanair defended the decision and said it 'will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time.' A group of 20 men who were due to go on a stag do to Benidorm were thrown off a Ryanair flight after they boarded at Manchester, following claims their behaviour was 'disruptive.' The group claim they have lost £4,000 between them after they were forced to get off the plane and celebrate in Wrexham instead . The incident took place Friday, March 13, after the 20 strong group boarded the plane. Police were called, with some members of the group removed and others leaving voluntarily. One of the group, Chris Jones, 32, who lost around £200, said : 'We had a bite to eat and a beer and got on the plane. 'No one was drunk. We were not wearing stag T-shirts or being loud or offensive. We took our seats and were talking in groups, as you do. 'About five to ten minutes later, we heard a whisper the police had been called to kick someone off. We had no idea it was us. 'We had been joking around, saying how embarrassing it would be for the person, and the next thing the officers came up to us and asked us to leave.' They claim they received no warnings before being ordered off the flight. According to the group, a male steward said he 'couldn't cope' with them and broke down in tears. Mr Jones added: 'The police did try reasoning with him but the captain then came out and put his arm round the steward and said he wouldn't fly with us on board.' Ryanair backed the decision and said it would not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour on any of its flight . He claimed police told them to go and book another flight because they were not overly drunk but there were none left that evening. The group went back to Wrexham in an attempt to salvage the celebrations. The planned trip was meant to be similar to a previous stag party they had all gone on, when they travelled to Prague last year. It is understood every member of the party - including the 'devastated' groom, have now made formal complaints to the budget airline about their treatment. A spokesman for Ryanair denied the group was treated unfairly. He said: 'The crew of this flight from Manchester to Alicante requested police assistance prior to departure after a number of customers became disruptive during the boarding process. 'Police removed a number of individuals from the aircraft, while others disembarked voluntarily. 'Ryanair apologised to the other customers for the slight delay to their flight departure, but reaffirmed that the safety and comfort of its customers, crew and aircraft is its priority. 'Ryanair will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Officers attended and, as requested, the group left the aeroplane in a peaceful manner. 'No offences were committed.' British visitors on a Spanish news website backed the airline's tough action. Ken Devey wrote: 'Few beers down them and they forget they are not the only ones on board the flight. Good on Ryanair.' Another Briton, Steve, said : 'Quite right too. I find noisy hen and stag parties on flights most annoying.'","A group of 20 men from Wrexham were heading to Benidorm for stag do .

"A cheeky brown bear soaked its patient canine friend when it sprayed it with water from a garden hose. Tima, a 300kg bear that has travelled the world performing with the German Shepherd dog since it was adopted in 1995, shows it knows how to have fun, delighting in the hose and even aiming at its companion. Holding a garden hose in  its paws, the bear lunges its arms back and forth and initially appears to get itself wet. The playful pair were filmed enjoying the sunshine – and the chance to cool off – near the southern city of Jaen, in Spain. The  bear, originally from Siberia, holds the hose straight out in front of it to allow the fountain of water to land just beside the dog.

Flinching slightly when sprayed, the German Shepherd moves from its resting position and jumps up to its feet. The bear holds the garden hose in its paws and initially manages to spray itself with water . The dog then sits with its ears pointing upwards as the bear moves to position itself better, still holding the hose in its paws.

"This is the touching moment  a doting dad dances with his daughter at home. But  the dance party for Eliza, 5, was arranged by her dad, Glenn O' Neil, 42, at their South Carolina home because she has the AAV9 virus and the family are under a self-imposed quarantine. The five-year-old suffers from a rare and ultimately fatal genetic condition called Sanfilippo Syndrome and has to avoid interacting with people's germs or it could kill her. Scroll down for video . Dance: Glenn O' Neil, 42, dances with his little girl Eliza, 5, who has Sanfilippo Syndrome and the family has chosen self-imposed quarantine to increase her chances of getting life-saving treatment . Family bond: Mom Cara, dad Glenn and brother Beckham, 8, stay at home with Eliza 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her from germs . The family are under a self-imposed quarantine, so that Eliza does not contract and build up immunity to one particular virus, AAV9. If she built up immunity to this virus she would likely not qualify for a clinical trial, as AAV9 will deliver the medicine in the body. This is her only chance at life. Her family have put themselves under a voluntary quarantine  for the past nine months in a bid to avoid interacting with other people. The family has chosen to avoid interacting with people and anything people have touched. It means mom Cara, dad Glenn and brother Beckham, 8, stay at home with her 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her. Her mom, Cara quit her job as a pediatrician while Glenn works remotely as a consultant at Symantec and Beckham can no longer attend his school, instead doing his schoolwork remotely. The family get their groceries delivered and on the rare occasion they do have to interact with people, they wear masks and gloves. They only leave their house once a week to go to an empty beach or field, where the kids can run free. Since Eliza was diagnosed with the illness in July 2013, the family have raised $2.2 million with a GoFundMe page and other traditional fundraising efforts in the hope to help her survive. Her father Glenn told People: 'We heard that there was a clinical trial that might cure Eliza of this disease. So of course we knew that we had to raise every dollar that they needed for it.' But since reaching their goal in December 2014, they have experienced delays with the trials due to difficulties in drug production. And even when the medicine is ready, they don't know if Eliza will be picked for the trial. 'This is our only chance,' Glenn says. 'Not only for Eliza, but other children with Sanfilippo.' Support: Mom Cara, right, dances with her husband, Glenn as their daughter Eliza, left, reads a book . Quarantine: Little Eliza's daddy/daughter dance came after she missed a Frozen-themed dance at her school . Isolated: Her mom, Cara, left, quit her job as a pediatrician while dad Glenn works remotely as a consultant at Symantec . Little Eliza's daddy/daughter dance came after she missed a Frozen-themed dance at her school. It took a lot of planning because the family needed to make sure that Eliza did not catch any incoming diseases. Her father writes in a Youtube video: 'Every little girl deserves to go to a special dance.' The disorder means that the pretty girl with blonde pigtails will slowly lose her ability to speak and by the age of six will most likely not be able to talk at all, according to People. By the time she turns ten-years-old, she is expected to be in a wheelchair and need constant care. The family are choosing to stay under quarantine because other parents who have children with Sanfilippo warn that if children get sick it could accelerate their Sanfilippo symptoms. Glenn said: 'This is a personal decision that we made. Doctors understand why we're doing this but they didn't tell us we had to.' 'I can't say if looking back one day I would regret anything we have done for Eliza and Beckham. We constantly make sure we both still agree that this is the right move.'

"An amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top Nazi Heinrich Himmler - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather. Chris Mannion, 52, found old military papers which show his grandfather Lieutenant Sergeant Patrick Mannion caught Adolf Hitler's right-hand man. The evil Nazi was then the world's most wanted man and is known to have been found by a unit of four British and two Russian soldiers as he tried to flee Germany in 1945. An amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top Nazi Heinrich Himmler (right) - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather, Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion (left) Himmler, who was one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and was head of the SS, was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured. He was taken to a checkpoint, quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified  - before killing himself. The names of his arresting officers has always been known but the four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment - had been shrouded in mystery. Mr Mannion, from Manchester, says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather's military career. He spent £30 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 Battery. But he was stunned to find the records show Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion was one of the men who found Himmler. Historian Chris Mannion discovered documents (pictured) revealing his grandfather captured Himmler when researching his military career . An arrest report he was sent shows Himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners. Mr Mannion says the documents show they were Gunner John Fletcher, Gunner Michael Faye, Gunner N Carlston and his own grandfather. The official records show one of the men fired a shot before Faye grabbed Himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint. Mr Mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about Himmler's capture - and the men who found him. He said: 'As a young boy I looked up to him for being a soldier, and would play with his medals and bits and pieces he brought back from the war. 'I never knew what he had done in the war, I was always curious, but no one could tell me for certain. 'In the end I set out to find out myself. There was a rumour in the family about a high-ranking Nazi official but I didn't think in a million years I would find out anything like this. 'I decided to get his service records, paid £30, and was sent 2,600 pages. They had the records of the capture of Himmler - and there was my grandfather's name.' When Himmler received the news of Hitler's death, he travelled to Flensburg where he remained for the first week of May. On May 15, 1945 he dismissed his staff and left with his two companions for a hide-out in the Harz Mountains. The three men set out on foot, moving across country, seeking cover in the woods, and sleeping in sheds or haystacks. The four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment (pictured, with Lt Sgt Mannion third from right, front row) - has been shrouded in mystery . Himmler's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through, until they tried to cross through Meinstedt on May 21. When they were about to travel through Meinstedt they were surprised by a British patrol of the four men from 196 Battery. They tried to evade capture but, after warning shots were fired, they stopped to be searched, taken to a military checkpoint and detained. Over the following two days, Himmler was moved to several camps and then the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, south of Hamburg, where he admitted who he was. A doctor tried to examine him but Himmler bit into a cyanide pill he had concealed, collapsing and dying shortly afterwards. Mr Mannion's documents showed that his grandfather fought in Normandy, Belgium, Holland and Germany. He landed in Normandy the day after D-Day, and was also involved in peacekeeping after the war, routinely patrolling Germany arresting fleeing Germans and preventing further unrest. According to the files, it was on one such patrol that Lt Sgt Mannion and three other members of his patrol stumbled across the group of Germans, who were acting suspiciously. Himmler (left) - one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and head of the SS - was Adolf Hitler's right-hand man . The report reads: 'On 21 May 45, at about 1930 hrs, one of the patrols which the Regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages, saw three men emerging from a wood, at Meinstedt. 'The patrol hailed the men, and when they failed to stop, fired a warning shot. 'The three men then approached. As they held no allied release permits, the serjeant in charge of the patrol sent them back by truck.' The amateur historian said: 'The report says that Himmler was in disguise with an eye patch, having grown a beard. 'What gave it away was his papers were just too correct, they were brand new, and he also had a bag stuffed full of money, it's all in the report. 'He had two men with him, who were obviously SS, and they knew Himmler wasn't who he said he was, so they handed him over.' Mr Mannion, who never met his grandfather, added: 'I was proud of him anyway, for going to fight for his country as millions did, but this is just the icing on the cake. 'It took me a few weeks just to take it in, all the pictures of Himmler now I can't see it in the same way, because my granddad caught him. 'When you see the records you realise they did momentous things, it's really something to be proud of. It's made me feel closer to my grandfather. I'm in awe of him.' Lt Sgt Mannion died in in 1948 following complications of injuries sustained in the war. The son of a school teacher, Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich on October 7, 1900, and went on to become the architect of the Holocaust and one of the Nazi party's most dreadful chiefs. His first involvement with the Nazis was in 1923, and he was their propaganda leader between 1926 and 1930. He was made head of the S.S. - the Schutzstaffel - a major  organisation and Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard, which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the Third Reich. Himmler developed it from a 290-man battalion to a huge group with its own military. He became president of the Gestapo (Secret State Police) once the Nazis had come to power in 1933, and set up the very first Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, the same year. Himmler was obsessed with the idea of the Germans as the Aryan race and racial purification and encouraged Aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up. During the Second World War, after Hitler had successfully invaded Poland, he was able to force more than a million Poles and 300,000 Jews out of the west of the country. In 1941, Himmler was present at the shooting of 100 Jews by firing squad in Minsk. He deciding that having to witness such killings might affect the mental health of his S.S. men, and declared that alternative methods of genocide be found. In 1942 he was charged with control of 'the final solution to the Jewish problem' - the Holocaust. He was given control of the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and by spring that year it was greatly expanded to include gas chambers. In total, close to six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. When it became clear that the Nazis were going to lose the war, Himmler attempted to bargain with the Allies, and Hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties. After the surrender he used a fake identity to try and escape, but was captured. He committed suicide while being held by the allied forces on May 23, 1945, by swallowing a cyanide capsule.","Chris Mannion discovered his grandfather captured Nazi Heinrich Himmler .

"A woman claiming to be the wife of an Australian Islamic State terrorist has posted a photo of his bloodied dead body on Twitter, announcing that he has been killed while fighting in Syria. Melbourne man Suhan Rahman's twisted wife said: ‘May Allah accept my husband, Abu Jihad al Australi.’ ‘Promised Allah and fought in the front lines until he obtained shahadah,’ she added. Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January. ‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria. The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’ A woman claiming to be Suhan Rahman's wife posted a bloodied photo of her dead husband on Twitter. A rifle was placed on his body . Melbourne man Suhan Rahman has reportedly been killed while fighting with the Islamic State terrorists in Syria . The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.' ‘And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead,’ she added. She also posted a photo of a man that looks like Rahman praying. The 23-year-old was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar earlier this year and was also friends with playboy Melbourne jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif. Rahman and Abdullatif regularly conversed via Twitter before Abdullatif was reported dead in January. In November Rahman confessed to Abdullatif it was his ‘first time using twitter its tripping out bruv [sic]’. Abdullatif replied: ‘Lol I know I still don’t how to use it.’ The woman asked for Allah to 'accept' her husband, who she called Abu Jihad al Australi . A researcher at the London based terrorist research centre ICSR posted this photo of Rahman on Twitter . The 23-year-old (left) was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar (right) earlier this year . ‘Ye how do I retweet to others and what duz dat mean.’ Rahman asked. ‘I’ll explain when I come home insha Allah,’ Abdullatif responded. Along with his recent postings on Twitter, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47. Referencing the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in January, where two Islamist gunmen killed editor Stéphane Charbonnier and 11 other people, Rahman wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.’ His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn. Rahman's family made a desperate plea for him to return home in January after his father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities that he was fighting with IS, The Daily Telegraph reports. A woman claiming to be Rahman's wife posted this photo of a man that looks like him praying . Abdullatif and Rahman chatted about how they didn't know how to use Twitter back in November 2014 . Australian-born jihadist Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was reported dead in January, was friends with Rahman . Mr Rahman was told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they were monitoring his son's every movement overseas. His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to go to Syria. 'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph. 'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.' Rahman's death comes after Abdulllatif's widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France . In another image, the women are pictured posing in head-to-toe black dress under an Islamic State flag . Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he ' Vile caption: The former Melbourne woman sprayed a series of hateful messages on social media on . Vanished: Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif, married . Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also featured pictures of her late reported partner, Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'. Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr. Duman congratulated her husband on his death in January, saying: 'You won the race!' The identities of the jihadist women in Ms Duman's pictures are unclear. However, the BMW bears resemblance to the same vehicle Australian jihadist and former underworld figure Mohammed Elomar was pictured smirking and wielding a Glock next to in September 2014. Same car? Notorious Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar was pictured in front of a white BMW which was reportedly from France . Defensive: Zehra Duman justified boasting about her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - but was then forced to defend the posts, telling her followers to 'chill n stop jujjing' Shortly after boasting about the expensive vehicle, Duman became defensive on social media and said 'no one is trying to be flashy' 'The m5 was driven here from france (sic) and is meant to be sold here. Chill n stop (judging). No one is trying to be flashy in sham (Syria).' Duman fled Australia late last year, leaving behind a distraught family, who told reporters she had been 'brainwashed'. The tweets, pictured here, have since been deleted . The Herald Sun quoted her father, Duvat Duman, saying: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' Khaled Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton is among the Australian females who have joined the Islamic State. Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reported dead in a suicide bombing in Ramadi, Iraq, last week.","Melbourne man Suhan Rahman has reportedly been killed in Syria .

"How extraordinary that so much effort, by so many royal advisors and politicians, should have been expended in keeping secret what a future head of state has written to government ministers. All those who deplore the Supreme Court’s decision, however, are wrong. For I believe this is a great day not only for the freedom of information which the law demands and allows. It should also be seen as a great day for the monarchy. The Supreme Court ruling that Prince Charles' 27 'black spider' memos should be released marks not only a great day for the freedom of information, but also one for the monarchy . One Tory bigwig recently told me that the Prince’s letters would reveal him to be ‘barking mad’, but when I questioned him, he admitted he had not read a word of them. I thought this was a good example of how much damage the secrecy over his letters has done the Prince of Wales. When we are told that his correspondence is so hush-hush that it must be suppressed, we naturally imagine his letters will be inflammatory, or embarrassingly eccentric. We remember some of the Prince’s strong turns of phrase, as when, in his leaked diaries, he described senior members of the Communist Chinese government as ‘appalling old waxworks’. We remember, too, his tendency to self-pity and self-absorption, and the round-robin letter to friends in which he complained about being seated in club-class on a plane to China for the Hong Kong hand-over to the Beijing government in 1997, saying tetchily his seat was ‘uncomfortable’. But despite this, many of his views are eminently sensible. He is bursting with ideas on subjects as varied as the environment, architecture, town planning, Shakespeare, agriculture, the King James Bible and much else besides. What’s more, his opinions on architectural carbuncles or on the need for caution over genetically modified food are shared by countless numbers of Britons. Contrary to popular belief, the Queen has not always been completely above the political fray . For decades, he has been a sort of one-man Opposition to many of the idiotic or ugly things going on in our country. Many commentators have said that they deplore the Prince sounding off and getting involved in the day-to-day running of this country’s affairs. They fear that if he expresses views, he will be seen as having a political bias. This, they claim, could not be more different from the approach which has been so successfully pursued by the Queen – who is believed not to express opinions to individual ministers. The monarchy is deemed to be strengthened by Her Majesty’s silence. But the Queen has not always been completely above the political fray – and for all we know, she might have made any number of interventions and recommendations to ministers of which we know nothing. How else, for instance, did we all come to be told the story that she deeply disagreed with Mrs Thatcher about the PM’s refusal to impose trade sanctions on South Africa during the apartheid years? The Queen certainly had a vested interest – as she feared for the future of her Commonwealth and even lined up with her Commonwealth leaders against the British prime minister. The story was impeccably sourced – to the Queen’s Press Secretary of the day, Michael Shea – yet it was denied by No. 10. The row over South Africa was undoubtedly an example of the monarch so-called ‘interfering’. Anyway, the truth is that we no longer live in an age of deference. Nor do we live in an age of secrecy. Yesterday’s judgment makes plain that Charles cannot hide the contents of the 27 letters to Labour ministers. It is entirely right that letters which he writes to publicly elected representatives about matters of government policy should be made available to the public. But ever since an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act in 2011, any such correspondence is legally deemed to be private. Ever since an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act in 2011, any correspondence by the Royal Family is legally deemed to be private . Regardless, I would support to the utmost not only his right, but his duty to get involved in political issues – as long as he does not undermine his position or that of the monarchy. But answer this question: would you rather have a king who spoke up for the silent majority against self-appointed experts on agriculture, architecture, defence, youth employment, education, Islam – or would you rather have an ignoramus? What is the point of his having established so much expertise in certain fields if he cannot share it with ministers? The corollary of his ‘interference’ is that when he does speak up, he should be prepared to argue his position in public, rather than in spidery secret memos. For my money, I’d far rather have a head of state who ‘interferes’ occasionally – as Charles is likely to do – than one who sits back and leaves everything to politicians who think only of their own interests rather than the country’s.","The Supreme Court ruled that Prince Charles' memos should be released .

Robert Opie started Museum of Brands in 1984 and has collected over half a million wrappers and packages . Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising . Where: Notting Hill, London . As the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to discarded wrappers and packaging. The man behind it is Robert Opie, who has amassed a treasured collection of over half a million items, although only about 12,000 are displayed here. His light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and had just finished some Rowntree’s Munchies and McVitie's and Price ginger nuts. His thinking was that if he threw away the wrappers a small fragment of history would be consigned to rubbish. The consumer historian has since become an authority on the history of supermarket brands and written twenty books on the subject. As well as biscuit tins and soap powder expect nostalgic toys, games and posters. The light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and polished off some snacks . Captain Beany has curated a collection of bean tins,  money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia . Baked Bean Museum . Where: Port Talbot, Wales . Congratulations are in order for the 10-year anniversary of the world’s only museum dedicated to baked beans. Captain Beany (previously Barry Kirk - he changed his name by deed poll) installed the exhibit dedicated to Heinz in his Port Talbot council flat back in 2005. From a second-floor flat on the Aberavon seafront the bean enthusiast has curated a collection of bean tins, bean money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia. The walls, ceiling and curtains are all orange and, when the opportunity arises, he dresses up in a cape, green pants, orange jumpsuit and painted face to become his alter ego, Captain Beany.

World Worm Charming Championships . Where: Cheshire . This only happens once a year but it is well worth the wait. Competitors gather in an attempt to charm as many worms from the ground as possible in a set time. The sport was officially born on 5 July 1980 when a local Willaston farmer’s son, Tom Shufflebotham, charmed 511 worms out of the ground in half an hour. The competition has been running ever since and a regulatory body  has been formed to enforce 18 rules and prevent cheating. The event has a history of people cheating by hiding worms up their trousers and sprinkling them on  grass . There’s even such a thing as the International Federations of Charming Worms and Allied Pastimes. Quite necessary, as it turns out, as the event has a history of people hiding worms up their trouser legs then sprinkling them onto the grass and even chopping worms in half to boost their final worm-count. The date for this year’s event has yet to be released but it typically falls in June. The cement menagerie was sculpted by local builder John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son . Cement Menagerie . Where: Branxton . Just off the A697 between Cornhill-on-Tweed and Milfield there’s a spectacle not to be missed. The cement menagerie was sculpted in the 1960s and '70s by a local builder called John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son Edwin. The 300-odd charming statues of animals and humans  include models of zebras, sheep, Lawrence of Arabia on his camel, and Winston Churchill. Each was based on drawings and sculpted in galvanised wire netting stuffed with paper, then cemented over and painted.

"The white police officer who shot and killed a black Air Force veteran while he ran around his apartment complex naked has been pictured. Robert Olsen responded to a call at the Heights of Chamblee in Atlanta on Monday and gunned down Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, who had been climbing over balconies and crawling along the floor. One witness said the cop told Hill to go inside otherwise he was going to get arrested, but was shot when he started running toward Olsen and ignored orders to stop. On Wednesday, the former soldier's girlfriend Bridget Anderson revealed he was being treated by a Veterans' Association (VA) doctor for bipolar disorder but stopped taking the medication a week or two ago because he didn't like the side effects, including stiffening in his jaw. She described how she was on the way to his house to cook and celebrate their three-year anniversary when she found out he was dead. Scroll down for video . Robert Olsen gunned down Air Force veteran Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, who had been climbing over balconies and crawling along the floor at his Atlanta apartment on Monday . Concerns: Neighbors called police to report the naked man on balconies and knocking on doors . Hill had served more than four years in the U.S. Air Force when he was medically discharged a few years ago. Anderson, 22, said she didn't notice any changes in her boyfriend after he stopped taking his medication and she'd never known him to behave strangely. 'This is totally out of the blue,' she said, referring to the strange behavior police and others described before Hill was shot. Hill is black and the officer who shot him is white. No weapon was found, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting. More than 100 protesters gathered in the city of Decatur on Wednesday night to protest his death. Most said they hoped the latest shooting would become part of an ongoing national discussion on how police officers interact with citizens, especially minorities. Veteran: Police said it was reasonable to assume that Hill, who was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East, was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the incident .

The relationship between law enforcement and civilians — particularly in poor, minority and high-crime neighborhoods — has become a contentious issue in many states across the U.S. following the high-profile deaths of unarmed men and teens by police officers, some of whom have been exonerated of wrongdoing after saying they perceived the males they shot as threats. Authorities described how Olsen approached him and Hill turned towards him. 'When the male saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer,' said DeKalb County Director of Public Safety Cedric Alexander. 'The officer called on him to step back, drew his weapon and fired two shots.' Witness Oscar Perez told ABC11Alive: 'The man, he was liked drugged, but he was naked and he was crawling. I think the police officer thought he was going to attack, so he shot him.' Hill was shot in the upper torso. The officer, who is white, is a seven-year veteran of the Dekalb County Police Department. He has not been identified. County police chief Cedric Alexander told reporters that the officer had been equipped with a Taser at the time of the shooting. He would not comment on whether the officer should have used the Taser but said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation would take over the probe into the shooting. Heartbroken: Bridget took to Twitter on Monday to share her anguish over the death of her boyfriend . Shocked: Bridget said the couple had been celebrating three years together on Monday . He added that he could 'reasonably assume' that Hill was possible suffering from mental illness at the time, given his behavior. On his social media profiles, Hill had used the hashtag '#IAmBipolar'. In his final Facebook post on Monday morning, Hill wrote: 'Where i once saw death i only see life.' Social media also shows Hill was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East. His girlfriend, Bridget Anderson, wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'My boyfriend was SHOT AND KILLED today by an officer. HE WAS UNARMED. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. 'I thought cops were suppose to protect and serve???? THEY TOOK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AWAY!!!!!' She added on Twitter that Monday had been their three-year anniversary. Scene: Hill was shot twice by a white officer at the Heights of Chamblee apartment complex in Atlanta . Dekalb County police chief Dr Cedric Alexander, pictured last year, said the officer was also carrying a Taser . 'Who will I share my secrets with now?' she wrote. 'Who will I call when something good happens? How will I move on from this? Lord give me the strength.' Police forces across the country have come under fire for their use of lethal force, especially against ethnic minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. Mr Alexander added: 'We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how do we expand our mental health training. It appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who may be in distress.' Hill is at least the third African-American since last Friday who has or has appeared to have been unarmed when killed by police. Police near Denver last Friday fatally shot an unarmed man who was a wanted fugitive. On the same day, an officer in Madison, Wisconsin fatally shot a biracial 19-year-old, prompting some 2,000 students to march in the state's capital on Monday.

"They have not been photographed together since their 2012 divorce so it was not much of a surprise when it was reported on Wednesday that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are not on speaking terms. The next day TMZ added more to their story, explaining why the the 52-year-old Mission: Impossible superstar and the 36-year-old Batman Begins beauty are not fond of each other. 'Tom feels betrayed by Katie,' a source said adding that Katie felt 'he sucked the life out of her.' Their 'bad feelings' explained: Tom Cruise felt 'betrayed' by Katie Holmes while she thought he 'drained' her, according to a Thursday report from TMZ; here they are pictured in May 2011 . Katie filed for divorce from Tom Cruise in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July. Afterwards he hinted he was blindsided. The mother of Suri - aged eight - quickly found her own apartment in New York City and the divorce proceedings were wrapped up in record time. The site explained that since they posted their first article, sources called them up and added more kindling to the fire. They were once a close family unit: Katie, 36, filed for divorce from Tom, 52,  in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July; afterwards he hinted he was blindsided. Here they are pictured in October 2011 . TMZ claimed one of those source is from the Church Of Scientology and that insider explained the Church is not involved in their feud. 'Well-placed sources with the Church tell TMZ, Katie was NOT declared a Suppressive Person. What's interesting, we're told Katie actually thinks she's been declared one ... but she hasn't,' wrote the site. It was then explained, 'An SP stands for several things, including people who disavow the Church. The Church has a procedure for declaring people SPs. Once they're declared an SP, people in the Church are told not to associate with them.' It was also stated clearly again that the two stars 'are not at war over the Church Of Scientology' and that they don't talk because 'they have an intense dislike for one another.' Earlier it was reported that Tom and Katie don't even talk about Suri. Rather they leave that up to intermediaries. 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site. Their only child: 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site; here Suri, aged eight, is pictured with Suri in June 2012 . Even planning visitations and discussing how the little girl should be raised is done through others, it was alleged. 'There is no desire on either Tom's or Katie's part to mend fences,' it was added. It was claimed that Tom has not seen Suri 'in months' because he has been shooting Mission: Impossible 5 in London. No turning back?: Tom and Katie have 'no desire to mend fences,' it was alleged; here they are seen in December 2011 leaving The Meatball Shop (left) and in February 2012 at the Vanity Fair Oscar party (right) They had the wedding of the year: Katie became Mrs Tom Cruise in Italy in November 2006 . With a rich pal: The couple in February 2006 with James Packer in Sydney Harbour . But his team has insisted many times since his 2012 divorce from Holmes that the Top Gun star does make time for his child and sees her often. Reps for Cruise have not returned calls to Daily Mail. TMZ insisted that Katie is upset the Oblivion actor doesn't see their child more. The site added he has wrapped his film and will be back in LA soon, where Katie and Suri now reside. New love talk: On the Wednesday cover of UsWeekly, it was claimed she has 'sleepovers' at Foxx's house . She moved on: It has been claimed by People, UsWeekly and TMZ that the 36-year-old actress is now dating Jamie Foxx, 47, who used to be friends with Cruise . Katie is raising their daughter in the same Calabasas neighborhood where Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian live. The former Dawson's Creek star is in LA to film her arc on TV's Ray Donovan. Holmes does not seem too concerned about these reports. Very early on Wednesday morning she posted to Instagram a video of herself in dance class with a male instructor. Her caption read, 'Kicking into Wednesday! Have a great day!' In early March the Miss Meadows star shared the quote from Nelson Mandela, 'May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.'

"Mechanic Clive Howard carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps on lone women in Norwich, Suffolk and Cambridge over a 28 year period . A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said: 'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off.  The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to get part of the car's number plate from CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman . Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman . Detectives found 'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in Cambridge park Christ's Pieces. The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces. Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det Sgt Burgess said: 'All were in the early hours of the morning. 'Each of the women were approached by a man who had got out of a car and attempted to get them into it.' He lived a double life with his parents as a mechanic but carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps . He added: 'I'm concerned there are other victims out there either in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridge and would urge other women to come forward. 'It's very rare.' As well as the rape in Norwich, Howard also admitted six counts of rape against a woman between November 1986 and March 1993. Howard, who is understood to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the court on April 20. Judge Stephen Holt told him: 'You've pleaded guilty and the one thing that can be said is your victim has been spared the ordeal of giving evidence. 'I'm sure you will understand I need to have a full pre-sentence report and the whole issue of whether you need to be sentenced as a dangerous offender will be made.' Det Sgt Burgess said: 'Reliving an experience such as this is never easy for a victim of sexual assault. 'I recognise the bravery shown by all victims in this case who would have been prepared to give evidence, had the case gone to trial. 'Howard's guilty plea demonstrates the strong case police had against him and I believe women are safer with this dangerous man off the streets,' he said. 'A striking similarity between the cases is that Howard would prey on women walking alone at night. 'I hope his guilty plea goes some way to helping his victims move forward from this terrible experience.' Howard was a respectable garage mechanic who didn't have a criminal record and lived an extraordinary double life with his elderly parents in Battisford. He also had his own house in nearby Stowmarket. He is thought to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend but was 'actively seeking sexual partners' on internet dating sites.","Clive Howard is a mechanic who lived calmly with his Suffolk parents .

"Despite the recent news that Ryanair had been given approval to offer low-cost flights from Europe to America, it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all. A statement, issued from Dublin, Ireland, shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the US. 'In light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings Plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so,' it reads. Despite earlier reports that Ryanair was developing low-cost transatlantic flights, the company is now denying such plans . However, it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored, but with the intention that Ryanair would not operate the flights. Instead, any sort of budget Europe to America service, should it come into fruition, would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand. Earlier this week, it was reported that Ireland-based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing as little as $15 (£10). The news came on the heels of a statement made by Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, last year. He told the Irish Hotels Federation conference that Ryanair would be offering $15 flights to Boston and New York, but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. Chief executive Michael O'Leary, has said that $15 flights were in development but 'four or five years off' 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats,' he reportedly said. He's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low-fare, transatlantic flights for awhile, but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' It remains to be seen whether or not Ryanair's possible plan will develop further or if a new sister company will emerge.","This week, Ryanair announced plans for low-cost Europe to US flights .

"An Australian wildlife warrior has gone where most people would not dare by filming himself swimming alongside deadly saltwater crocodiles. Beau Greaves has tried to show off the 'sensitive side' of the predators and released extraordinary footage of him up close and personal with the reptile on his YouTube channel. The 24-year-old crayfish diver took a dip in the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland's far north, to capture hours of video, exploring the wildlife it had to offer - including stingrays and wobbegongs, commonly known as the carpet shark. Scroll down for video . Beau Greaves has always had a fascination with wildlife and in a new video he swims dangerously close to saltwater crocodiles . Mr Greaves spends nine months of the year on a trawler working as a crayfish diver near Cape York . On his YouTube page, Mr Greaves said he was a thrill seeker who never did things in halves. His sister, Ebony, told Daily Mail Australia this had always been the case. 'Beau is a very extreme person, as a little kid we grew up at Lake Cooroibah [north of Queensland's Sunshine Coast],' she said. 'Ever since I could remember he would go out for hours by himself, and trawl up and down the lake and catch all kinds of snakes, spiders and eels and other exotic wildlife. 'One time he came home with a crab attached to his finger when he was five years old.' Ms Greaves said her brother had an unexplained connection with wildlife, which helped him swim unnoticed by animals. When asked if she and her family even feared for Mr Greaves' safety, his sister answered: 'Absolutely.' The 24-year-old is seen swimming alongside crocodiles in the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's far north . At no point in the video does the crocodile appear to behave aggressively towards the Sunshine Coast man . He said he had 'absolutely no fear' but he respected crocodiles and does not touch them with hands . 'To be honest, he's an extreme person. When he's not catching wildlife, he's into surfing and into extreme motocross riding,' she said. 'He always finds the extreme in everything he does. 'No matter how worried our family is... he loves what he is doing. 'I can't ever imagine him being an office person, he loves the wildlife.' Mr Greaves told The Sunday Mail it was 'unbelievable' to be able to swim so closely with the crocodiles, an act which wildlife experts warned was detrimental to his safety. 'They're just a big old dinosaur, and they've got big teeth too,' the wildlife warrior said. This is a carpet shark, also known as a wobbegong, which Mr Greaves also dares to interact with . Here he is seen swimming with his head resting underneath the carpet shark, which looks to be unfazed with this . Mr Greaves also dares to give the shark a pat as he continues to explore the Great Barrier Reef . Mr Greaves is also a reptile carer on the Sunshine Coast and works for nine months of the year diving the coral reefs in remote Cape York for crayfish on a trawler. He uses his time living in the area to film his wildlife videos and gives him an opportunity to learn about dugongs, snakes, turtles, dolphins and whales. Mr Greaves believes he had a 'primal connection' with the dangerous beasts, which he helps them remain calm around him. 'I just gauge their mood, and if they're relaxed, it's all cool. I jump in and swim around with them,' he said. 'I love crocs. I've got absolutely no fear. But I do respect them. And I've learnt my lesson not to touch them.' At one point in the video, the 24-year-old is seen swimming near a stingray with its tail facing the diver. In a terrifying moment, he reaches out and prods the back of the animal with a rod close to its barb. A barb through the chest was what killed Mr Greaves' idol, Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter'. The 24-year-old also dares to swim close to stingrays - which killed crocodile hunter Steve Irwin . He daringly reaches out and prods the stingray's tail with a rod in a terrifying moment . But Professor Grahame Webb, from wildlife sanctuary Crocodylus Park, said Mr Greaves was reducing his life expectancy by swimming so closely with crocodiles. 'Unless he is Doctor Dolittle and can talk to the animals, he's a croc snack waiting to happen,' Prof Webb told News Corp. 'Wow. He's got big kahunas. But that's really asking for it.' For those who think crocodiles that live in open water or reefs are not as deadly, Prof Webb said this was simply not the case. According to News Corp, 10 per cent of the 111 attacks that have happened since crocodile hunting was banned in Australia in the 1970s involved scuba divers, snorkellers or spear fishermen - putting Mr Greaves in the 'very high-risk category'.","Beau Greaves is seen swimming alongside saltwater crocodiles in a video .

"The Vatican has announced that it was sent a £72,000 ransom demand for two letters written by Renaissance master Michelangelo who painted the Sistine Chapel. Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a cardinal in charge of St Peter's Basilica, which Michelangelo also helped to design, had been offered the documents for 'a certain price'. Rome newspaper Il Messaggero said the person, described as a former Vatican employee, had asked for 100,000 euros (£72,000). The Vatican said a cardinal was sent a ransom demand asking for £72,000 to return two letters by Renaissance master Michelangelo (pictured, St Peter's Basilica, which the artist helped to design) This is the first time the Vatican has acknowledged the theft of the two letters, one of which supposedly contains Michelangelo's signature. Lombardi said the cardinal 'naturally refused because these are stolen documents'. He added that a nun who worked in the Vatican archives informed officials back in 1997 that the documents had gone missing, but he did not say why the Vatican had not disclosed the theft before. While the newspaper spoke of only one letter signed by Michelangelo, who lived from 1475 to 1564, the spokesman said two documents had gone missing. He added that Vatican police were now investigating the case with their Italian counterparts. No further details have been given about either of the documents, which were taken from the archives of the Fabbrica di San Pietro which looks after the upkeep of the basilica. The demand is believed to have come from a former Vatican employee. Until a spokesman confirmed the threat, it was not known that the documents had been taken back in 1997 . However, The Times reports the signed letter is believed to discuss art commissioned by the Pope. The archives contain numerous documents concerning the history, design and construction of vast holy site. The basilica took more than 100 years to build and was completed in 1626. Michelangelo took over the construction of the basilica in January 1547, while in his seventies, after the death of Pope Paul III's preferred candidate, Giulio Romano. Drawing on the complex plans laid down by a chain of architects before him, Michelangelo brought them together into a workable model, and is responsible for much of the basilica as it stands today.","Vatican says it was sent demand by man believed to be a former employee .

"The real victim: Kayode Modupe-Ojo spent three weeks in jail after falsely being accused of rap . A businessman who spent three weeks in jail after falsely being accused of rape by a woman he met on the internet is suing the police for malicious prosecution and wrongful imprisonment. Kayode Modupe-Ojo, a former boyfriend of David Beckham’s sister Joanne, said his reputation has been destroyed and he lost his business because police failed to investigate properly the woman’s fictitious allegations – including that he possessed firearms – or the glaring inconsistencies in her story. The 28-year-old former spa owner was arrested at his home in Cheshire shortly after spending two days with the woman. His accuser gave a harrowing but entirely false account of being tied up and moved around the north-east of England against her will, after a sexual encounter turned terrifyingly violent. Mr Modupe-Ojo, who has lived in Britain since the age of three, was dragged from his bed by the police, handcuffed and questioned for three days without legal representation before being charged with multiple counts of rape and kidnapping. On the basis of the woman’s lies, Durham Police declared he was ‘a danger to women’ and he was remanded in jail for three weeks. Last week the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee called for people accused of sexual offences to be given anonymity. Mr Modupe-Ojo’s lawyer has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Paul Schofield, of Farleys Solicitors, said: ‘It illustrates the flaws of a legal system that names and shames those accused of sex crimes, without giving them any protection when the accusations turn out to be untrue. 'Even though it was obvious in court that the woman lied and lied, she is still protected by the legal system because no criminal charges have so far been brought against her. 'As things stands she has a lifetime anonymity while my client remains tainted by the abhorrent stigma of a rape charge. It’s also clearly a case that would not have gone to trial if the police had done their jobs correctly. It was as if they couldn’t be bothered.’ Mr Modupe-Ojo was acquitted when his trial at Newcastle Crown Court collapsed last year due to glaring discrepancies in the prosecution case. But he said that by then the damage had already been done. ‘The judge directed the jury to acquit me, but my reputation was left in tatters,’ he says. ‘There are people out there who think, “no smoke without fire”. Kayode Modupe-Ojo's former girlfriend Joanne is pictured right with her brother David Beckham . ‘It is grossly unfair that my details have been in the media, while my accuser gets away without a blemish to her name. Rape is one of the most repulsive crimes there is. ‘A false claim not only ruins the lives of innocent men, but it damages their families. I did nothing wrong and yet this case almost destroyed me.’ He is supporting the demands of Tory MPs Mark Pritchard and Nigel Evans – both cleared after being falsely accused of rape – that the accused also remain anonymous, unless convicted. What Mr Modupe-Ojo describes as ‘the most terrifying period’ in his life began in August 2013 when he responded to a ‘friend request’ on Facebook from a beautiful blonde woman he had never met before. The law prevents us from naming her even though the court found her allegations to be entirely false. He says: ‘She was very attractive. We texted and Skyped each other before meeting. She was the driving force behind our meeting and I was flattered by her attention.’ During their time together Mr Modupe-Ojo took the woman to restaurants, a club and they stayed in two hotels which she booked and paid for. He also drove her home to pack an overnight bag and spent 30 minutes talking with her mother. ‘My accuser was alone in her room upstairs and could have used her phone to call for help if I had been the mad rapist she made me out to be,’ he added. ‘I told all of this to the police questioning me. 'I also gave them the passwords to my phone and laptop so they could check the correspondence between us.’ He still has text messages she sent after they parted. There were also numerous CCTV images of the pair cuddling, kissing and holding hands. Eleanor de Freitas (pictured) killed herself after being accused of making a false rape claim . Eleanor de Freitas, 23, killed herself last April after being accused of making a false rape claim against Alexander Economou, son of a Greek shipping magnate. Police dropped the case against Mr Economou because of insufficient evidence. Mr Economou, 35, said the allegation has devastated his life. Ben Sullivan, 21, was president of Oxford Union when arrested after a false rape claim in May last year. He was held in a cell for 12 hours before being released on police bail. The case never came to court. The alleged victim has exercised her right to have it reviewed. Terry Brown, 33, from Basildon in Essex, was stabbed and attacked by a mob after he was wrongly accused of rape. His accuser, Lisa-Jayne Samuels, was later jailed for 20 months. ‘There was ample CCTV evidence and witnesses to prove she was all over me in public, but the police didn’t seem to be interested in proving my innocence. They seemed convinced they had their man,’ he says. ‘When the female officer told me I would be remanded because I was a danger to women and a flight risk, my legs buckled. I had done nothing wrong, yet I was facing a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty.’ Further charges for firearms offences and a threat to kill were dropped because no weapon was found in his flat. Once Mr Modupe-Ojo’s case came to trial, alarming discrepancies emerged. The accuser claimed she had known her attacker for years. Yet in her opening message on Facebook, she admitted they’d never met. She said she had been tied up and moved around against her will. Yet it emerged she texted her boyfriend to tell him she was OK. ‘She told the court I had stolen her phone and written the text,’ Mr Modupe-Ojo says. ‘But this fell apart when it was revealed she had also texted her friend to say happy birthday and called her mum while we were together.’ Incredibly, the police did not examine the outgoing texts or calls from her mobile. By the time the judge instructed the jury to acquit him, his name had been reported, his bank accounts frozen on order of the police, and he’d lost his salon. ‘I lost everything,’ he says bitterly. ‘I was even evicted from the gated community where I lived after women residents complained about living with a potential rapist.’ But what hurts him most is that the stigma of being a rapist still follows him ‘like a bad smell’. It is the key factor – along with his financial losses – in his decision to sue the police. ‘I want it made clear I did nothing wrong and I was the real victim.’ A spokesman for Durham Police confirmed there was ongoing correspondence but made no further comment.

"A former jailhouse informant testified Thursday that someone other than the man on trial for killing 6-year-old Etan Patz admitted decades ago to kidnapping and molesting him. Jeffrey Rothschild, now 67, took the stand for the defense representing Pedro Hernandez, who confessed to police that he killed the boy. His attorneys say the confession was a delusion and their client is mentally ill. Etan vanished on his way to school in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood in 1979. His disappearance helped galvanize the modern-day missing children's movement, with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton. His body was never found. Testimony: Jeffrey Rothschild, now 67, took the stand for the defense representing Pedro Hernandez (pictured), who confessed to police that he killed the boy. His attorneys say the confession was a delusion and their client is mentally ill . Never found: Etan Patz vanished on his way to school in 1979. His disappearance helped galvanize the modern-day missing children's movement, with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton . Hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at the convenience store where Etan was headed the morning of May 25, 1979. In hours of a videotaped confession, Hernandez calmly recounts choking the boy, putting his body in a bag and putting the bag in a box, then walking it down the street. Prosecutors point to admissions he made over decades where he told a prayer circle, his ex-wife and a friend that he'd killed a child in New York. Hernandez's lawyers, however, suggest that another longtime suspect, convicted pedophile Jose Ramos, is the real killer. Argument: Hernandez's lawyers have suggested that another longtime suspect, convicted pedophile Jose Ramos (pictured), is the real killer . Rothschild said Ramos admitted molesting the boy while the men were roommates in prison. Ramos was never charged in Etan's disappearance, but he was considered the prime suspect for decades. Rothschild said Ramos recounted in horrifying detail how he molested Etan and many other boys. 'I've never been the same since that day,' Rothschild said. 'I thought my life was just a total wreck and a complete and total mess, but there are other people deeper or darker than me.' Ramos never admitted killing Etan. Rothschild met Ramos when they were both at a prison in Otisville, and Rothschild agreed to help prosecutors by trying to get a confession. Rothschild, a self-proclaimed con man, had been in and out of prison for various scams when he crossed paths with Ramos. He said Ramos told him he 'loved' Etan and 'honored him every day.' When Rothschild asked if the boy was dead, Ramos spat: 'Of course he's dead. But there is no proof.' Ramos told then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart GraBois that he picked up Etan at Washington Square Park and took him back to his apartment to molest him. But the boy refused, and he put him on the subway. Rothschild recounted how Ramos told him he lied about saying he picked up the boy in the park and drew him a map of the neighborhood that included 'X' marks where he actually grabbed the boy. Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon sought to show that Rothschild was a career con man who would do anything to get what he wanted, even make up stories for law enforcement. He denied that. Ramos could have known Etan because his girlfriend, Susan Harrington, had been hired to walk Etan and other neighborhood kids home from school during a bus strike. Ramos spent more than 20 years in prison for molesting two boys in separate incidents in Pennsylvania and remains jailed on a Megan's Law violation.","Jeffrey Rothschild, now 67, took the stand for the defense representing Pedro Hernandez, who confessed to police that he killed the boy .

"An illegal immigrant was sliced to death by a ferry's 'machete-like' propellor after launching a bid for freedom across the North Sea  to avoid deportation. Albanian Artur Doda, 24, plunged to his death alongside fellow countryman Leonard Isufaj, 27, after jumping from one of the world's largest ferries, minutes after it had taken off from British shores. The pair were said to be 'tantalisingly close' to the port in Harwich, Essex, when they decided to launch themselves into the sea. Albanian Artur Doda, 24, and fellow countryman Leonard Isufaj, 27, plunged to their deaths after jumping from one of the world's largest ferries, the Stena Britannica (pictured), while being deported from the UK . An inquest heard how the pair, who were being taken to Holland, were just 500 metres from the port - but that even an Olympic swimmer would have struggled to swim through the currents. The incident, which took place in February last year, came after the pair had arrived in the UK with 13 other stowaways hidden in the back of a lorry on a freight ferry. They were believed to be part of a group which had broken into the vehicle without the driver's knowledge. After today's hearing, the coroner said the incident was part of 'a bigger picture on immigration and how it's handled'. The inquest heard how the vehicle had been randomly selected for X-ray as it entered the port six hours earlier. After Border Agency checks, all but two women were sent back on the Stena Britannica 9am ferry the same day to the Hook of Holland. But, at around 10am, it was reported to the captain that two immigrants had jumped from the ship. The inquest heard how an eyewitness saw them jump from the railings on the side of the ship before resurfacing briefly then disappearing back into the water. But despite an extensive search  involving 21 vessels and two helicopters, neither man was rescued. Mr Isofaj, who died from drowning, was found on March 20, 2014, washed up on a beach in Felixstowe. He was identified by fingerprints taken during his deportation by Border Force agents. Mr Doda's badly decomposed body was found floating in the North Sea on April 29, 2014, and could only be identified by DNA from his mother in Albania. The two men had been deported from Harwich International Port, Essex, to Holland when they decided to jump into the North Sea. A huge search operation was launched but neither man was found alive . Inspector Christopher Willis, from Essex Police, told the inquest that the sea would have appeared deceptively calm, instilling a false belief that it would be possible to swim to shore. But even if they had not been sucked under the ship, they were unlikely to have survived fierce competing tides, he said. 'To swim to land with those tides and the water temperature would have been nigh-on impossible - an Olympic swimmer would have struggled,' he added. Mr Willis said a tide heading out to sea at about four knots met another northerly tide at about the point where the men jumped. This, combined with a sea temperature of about 7C, meant the conditions were virtually unsurvivable, he said. 'It may have been that the were used to warmer and less tidal waters in their home country and this gave them a false sense of security that they could make it,' he added. Giles Young, senior officer with Border Force at Harwich International Port, revealed that the men had been part of a routine deportation and immigrants, during which they are treated like ordinary passengers on the return journey and not put in handcuffs. He said: 'This is not a case of being marched on in handcuffs. 'During the process, neither offered any verbal or physical resistance to being moved onto the vessel.' He added that the organisation saw 'a lot of these particular cases'. 'The same people will turn up two or three times,' he said. 'We have individuals this year who are already on their second attempt and it is only March. It's a carousel system.' Pathologist Dr Ian Calder, who performed a post-mortem examination on Mr Doda, described his injuries saying: 'This was a very forceful cut across the vertebrae by a sharp, curved blade. 'It is the sort of injury you would get from a machete. 'This would be quite compatible with the sharp blade of a propeller.' Coroner Eleanor McGann recorded a conclusion that both men died accidental deaths. She said: 'On face value it is easy to conceive of a situation where they jumped off the ferry in their desperation intending to drown, but there is no evidence of that. 'The evidence suggests they were intending to swim back to England, something that they could see was tantalisingly close to them. 'In fact they did not know about the effect of a moving ship on somebody who jumps over the side, and they were sucked underneath.' Mrs McGann said it was difficult to make recommendations to the Government based on this case. 'This is all part of a bigger picture on immigration and how it's handled, and nothing I could say could help prevent such sad deaths in future,' she added. The Stena Britannica is one of the largest Superferries in the world and can cater for up to 1,200 passengers. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Isufaj's cousin, Besnik Vata, 33, from north London, said the case highlighted the plight of many other immigrants . He added: 'They had come to the UK for better a life and it seems they were determined to stay. 'We heard that they weren't escorted on board the ship so there was always a risk this would happen - if I was in that position I would have done the same. 'There are lots of people in the same situation and they are just desperate. 'I think there should be better security to stop this happening because they're not just immigrants, they are people too.'","Artur Doda, 24, and Leonard Isufaj, 27, both Albanian, jumped in North Sea .

"The weekly shop has become something of a modern day nightmare with stores asking us to either scan as we shop or use self-service tills. But now one of Britain's biggest supermarkets has turned its back on technology in favour of human staff manning stores. Morrisons's new CEO, David Potts, who took over last week has scrapped the Intelligent Queue Management (iQM) system used in shops after receiving feedback from customers and staff. Morrisons has ditched its Intelligent Queue Management system in favour of returning to using humans to decide how many checkouts to open in stores . The technology, which was introduced in 2008, used infrared sensors to determine how many checkouts to open by monitoring the number of customer flowing through the store. It meant that during quieter periods staff could be taken off the tills and placed in other parts of the store. The company's retail team, along with the new boss, concluded that checkout teams would make better and more balanced decisions compared to the iQM computer system. But while they have brought humans back to monitor queues, the controversial self-scan tills will be here to stay. Ex-Tesco executive Mr Potts, who took over as Morrisons’ chief executive on March 16, spoke with customers and staff and after feedback decided to scrap some of the modern day technologies . Morrisons was the only British retailer to use iQM, which used infrared sensors both at the entrance to the store and over each checkout lanes. It was supposed to enable checkout managers to predict exactly when shoppers would arrive at the checkouts so the tills were open for them when they got there. When the iQM system was first rolled out as part of a trial with the promise of cutting customer waiting times it had a five per cent success rate, however, staff claimed the system was pointless. Some took to online job review website Glassdoor to complain, with a department manager in Felixstowe, Suffolk, describing it as 'a waste of time and money'. The unnamed manager had added: 'It [the iQM] messes up all the departments in the store and it has a major knock on effect to all other departments with the waste and markdown and rotation.' A checkout operator from Portsmouth, writing in October last year, said: 'Morrisons needs to go back to basics. We are a superior supermarket and that's what we need to install in customers old and new. 'Customers want to be treated. Show them we care more than the other leading stores.' After listening to colleagues executives have also decided to scrap another computerised system which measures the amount of products scanned every minute by checkout staff. The  'scan rate' was introduced in 2012 after imposing new time targets of one item every three seconds, which prompted an outcry from members of the public, who branded the supermarket as turning into a 'battery hen farm'. Mr Potts, a former executive at Tesco, said: 'We intend to be an organisation that listens very hard to its customers and staff and, wherever possible, responds quickly. 'Our colleagues in our stores are best placed to use their experience and personal judgement in deciding how best to serve their customers, keeping queues low at the checkouts and improving the customer’s shopping trip.'","The Intelligent Queue Management (iQM) system has now been scrapped .

"Disgraced MP Mike Hancock is to stand for Parliament again, months after being forced out of the Lib Dems after a string of sex scandals. The veteran Portsmouth South MP resigned from Nick Clegg's party after being forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances. But he has now vowed to stand as an independent candidate, continuing a colourful political career, which has included an affair with a woman accused of being a Russian spy. Scroll down for video . Disgraced MP Mike Hancock is to stand for Parliament again, months after being forced out of the Lib Dems after a string of sex scandals . After being removed from the Lib Dem party, it was expected that Mr Hancock would walk away from the seat he has held since 1997. But the 68-year-old has vowed to stand again, despite major heart operations and spending time in a mental health unit. He told BBC News: 'I'm going to stand for sure, I've made this decision because my health is so much better and I think I owe it to a lot of people who have supported me. 'Once you've been an MP for as long as I have it's hard to just walk away. 'I think if enough people realise that I'm like everyone, I'm a fallible human being who made a mistake but paid a very high price for it... I think I could [win].' It pitches him against Lib Dem candidate Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who faces a challenge from the Tories and Ukip. Mr Hancock was first elected as an SDP MP in the city in a by-election in 1984, but he lost the seat to the Tories in 1987. He was elected as a Lib Dem a decade later . In June last year Mr Hancock gave an 'unreserved' apology at London's High Court over an 'inappropriate and unprofessional friendship' with a single mother known as Annie, who had sought his assistance as her MP and local councillor. Solicitors for the woman said the apology was part of a 'confidential settlement' in which the 'vulnerable woman', who suffers from mental health problems, brought a claim for damages against him. Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had previously called on Mr Hancock to resign his membership and said he had 'no future' in the party. He was first elected as an SDP MP in the city in a by-election  in 1984, but he lost the seat to the Tories in 1987. He was elected as a Lib Dem a decade later. Ekaterina Zatuliveter, accused of being a Russia spy, had a four-year affair with Mr Hancock . ■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat. ■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’ ■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. ■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann, a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’ ■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. 'He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’","Portsmouth South MP vows to stand against Lib Dem candidate in city .

Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming ‘horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS’. Mr Scurfield's body was flown to Manchester last week because the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), who he was fighting alongside, has a large base in the city.

There were shouts of 'martyr' and 'hero' from the crowd, many of whom carried his picture. His mother Vasliki said she was proud of the her son for standing up for the freedom of Kurdish people in Syria. 'Although he did not die fighting for a British cause he died representing British values,' she said. Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Hozen Kasen, a prominent member of PYD in Manchester, added: 'We are very proud that Konstandinos Erik Scurfield went to represent us in a plight that was not his own. 'He is not just a Kurdish hero but a humanitarian hero and will go down in history as such.' Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' Mr Scurfield also revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds' 'skills and drills'. But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting . 'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote.","Ex-Marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was brought down by mortar fire .

"Killed: Jordan Brennan, 17, pictured, suffered a fatal blow to the head during a scuffle with a 16-year-old boy at a corner shop in Manchester in October . A boy who attacked and killed a teenager after interpreting his Gangnam-Style dance as 'racist' has been jailed for eight months. Jordan Brennan, 17, had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy  at a corner shop in Gorton, Manchester. But it enraged the other boy, 16, who was shopping in the same store and thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked. After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker, who was with his girlfriend, tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle. As they struggled near the doorway, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below. The attacker then kicked him in the legs before returned to his shopping. College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when his mother Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. The teen, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had earlier admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted. The tragedy occurred at around 7.30pm on Friday October 10 when Jordan who attended Manchester College and described as 'polite, very bubbly, happy-go-lucky type of lad' was with two friends. They went into the N.A Grocer shop on an errand but inside he began doing the Gangnam style dance and within 17 seconds there was a 'flashpoint' between him and the other teenager. Discussing the tragedy at NA Grocers, Mr Hall said CCTV in the shop captured Jordan 'dancing' in the shop before an argument took place. Weeping was audible from a public gallery packed full of Jordan's family and friends throughout prosecutor Rob Hall's opening address. He said: 'In a relatively short period of time, the defendant is in the queue at the checkout, Jordan is waiting around while others are in the check out queue and while he is waiting he proceeds to dance. 'That dance was accompanied by a reference to the well-known song Gangnam Style. 'It appears that this defendant perceived that dancing and reference as being a racist slur upon him. Jordan is of good character and so to that extent there is nothing to suggest he had racist intentions in any way. 'Needless to say that raised the defendant and he began to remonstrate about what happened. As they went to the exit door the two came into physical contact with the defendant raising his hands and pushing and pulling and in effect the physical contact put Jordan to the ground outside the exit and regrettably the back of his head made heavy contact with paving slabs outside. Jordan (pictured) fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below . Jordan Brennan had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy whilst in high spirits at a corner shop (pictured) in Gorton, Manchester . 'Within a relatively short period of time the incident ended. The defendant was outside for 18 seconds. The whole thing lasted less than 18 seconds. 'The defendant returned back to the store to pay for his shopping and was only absent from the queue for 24 seconds which reflects how fleeting this incident was.' The court was told that the defendant, a straight-A student, had no idea he had caused any injury until he saw coverage of Jordan's death in newspapers and on TV. Jordan returned to his home which was just minutes from the shop and told his mother he was feeling unwell, it was said. The incident happened on October 10 when Jordan was with two friends . Tragically, his mother became so concerned upon his appearance and knowledge of the incident that she suggested they call an ambulance, but Jordan did not want to go to hospital. Mr Hall added: 'Jordan, being as he was, said even if his mother called an ambulance he would send it away. It is regrettable he in effect was not medically examined at the time. 'He had been sick at about midnight and again Jordan was asserting he was fine and wanted to be left alone. It is with much regret and feelings of guilt that she did not do more.' Jordan was checked on by his mother at 3.30am at which point he was sound asleep but when the family rose for the day at around 9am he was unresponsive in bed. Paramedics arrived just six minutes later but it was clear he had been dead for some time. The impact of his head hitting the pavement following the attack fractured his skull and caused bleeding on the brain. Had he been treated in hospital, he could have survived his injuries, it was said. In mitigation, Kate Blackwell QC said: 'This is a case which has led to a tragic outcome for two families. The death of Jordan was in any view devastating for his family. 'It doesn't take much to imagine for those of us who haven't lost any young family member to understand the pain and wretched loss that prevails when this happens. This case has in other ways been a terrible ordeal for the defendant and his family.' The court heard the teenager moved to the UK at the age of nine, from his native Mongolia, and excelled in his studies, receiving exemplary references from his teachers and peers which were put forward at court. She added: 'He is polite, respectful, bright, kind, with an impeccable manner. He loved school and the whole experience was grabbed by both hands. 'This was a chance encounter and his reaction to that situation was not thought by anyone to be serious and there was certainly no intention to cause serious harm and none was expected to be caused.' At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. Pictured are floral tributes left outside the Brennan home . Sentencing him to eight months in youth custody, Judge David Stockdale said: 'Your assault on him was quite inexcusable. Your mood of aggression was demonstrated first by your pursuit of him out of the shop and by subsequently kicking him after he fell. 'You had everything going for you. But so did Jordan Brennan. A boy of 17, happy, healthy, a young boy of good character, he too had everything going for him. 'This case serves as a reminder if a reminder was necessary of the lethal consequences, unforeseeable consequences, that so often follow as a result of what might be described as low-level violence. 'Despite all of the mitigating factors I have heard and read and taken into account, I reach the conclusion that the sentence of this court must be custodial.' In a statement Jordan's mother said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend. 'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him.'","Jordan Brennan broke into dance at a corner shop in Gorton, Manchester .

"Two thieves were part of a 'prolific and dangerous' organised gang that armed themselves with machetes and meat cleavers to intimidate people and steal jewellery, cars and cash. Jack Hunter, 20, and Jamie Ellis, 24 were part of the organised group that terrorised people in Liverpool to steal cars, wallets and handbags and committed a number of cash in transit robberies. Hunter took photos of bundles of cash the gang had stolen as well as pictures of himself, posing menacingly with a machete. He was jailed for his role in several burglaries, including one involving a pregnant woman. Jack Hunter was part of a gang of armed raiders that equipped themselves with machetes and knives to steal jewellery, cars and cash. Hunter posted pictures of their spoils as well as him posing with one of the weapons . The pair were caught after boastful and brazen images of their spoils were sent to a gang member who was serving time in prison, where they were intercepted by prison staff and handed to police. The gang are believed to have targeted members of the Chinese community involved with restaurants because they believed they may have taken their takings home with them. This left a number of Chinese people in Merseyside living in fear of being attacked. Hunter, of Anfield, stole a number of cars from the Merseyside area including a VW Passatt, a VW Golf and a Jaguar XFS. He was also part of a four-strong gang armed with knives and a meat cleaver who stole cash, wallets and handbags from the occupants of a house in Allerton, Liverpool. Hunter took a number of intimidating pictures of himself when he had been involved in the robberies . In one picture the gang show off their weapons and tools, as well as part of the car they had stolen . Hunter was jailed for 16 years after previously being convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. Ellis, of Roby, took part in cash in transit robberies at the Showcase cinema on East Lancashire Road on November 25, 2013, and a McDonald's restaurant on Edge Lane on December 4, 2013. He was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit cash in transit robberies. Ellis received another 12 months each for three counts of handling stolen goods, to run concurrently, and a further 15 months in prison in relation to the breach of a previous suspended sentence. Jamie Ellis (left) was sentenced to seven years in prison for the cash in transit thefts, while Jack Hunter (right) was jailed for 16 years for his role in the gang that robbed people while armed with knives . DCI Tom Keaton of Merseyside Police said: 'Jack Hunter and Jamie Ellis were part of a prolific and dangerous organised crime group which carried out a string of burglaries, car thefts and cash in transit robberies. 'During November through to the early part of February, Hunter was part of a group responsible for a string of domestic burglaries both in Merseyside and Worcestershire, in which high value cars were often targeted. 'Hunter's criminality culminated in a robbery and an aggravated burglary in south Liverpool in which members of the Chinese community were targeted. 'The offenders armed themselves with a range of weapons, including knives, machetes and an axe, and didn't hesitate to subject their victims to truly horrific ordeals in which they were intimidated and threatened though thankfully not physically injured. Pictures of bundles of cash stolen from people targeted by the prolific gang were taken . 'During one of these incidents, the gang threatened the occupants of a house, then forced a pregnant woman, her baby daughter and two elderly female relatives into the living room where they stole jewellery.' The gang committed 12 burglaries in Merseyside and Worcester, three cash in transit robberies, two motor vehicle thefts and two offences of handling stolen goods. The offences took place between November 2013 and February 2014. DCI Tom Keaton said they worked with members of the Chinese community across Merseyside to bring the offenders to justice. He added: 'Some of the pictures we have released show Jack Hunter appearing to glorify the use of weapons and showing delight in the results of the group's criminality. 'I'm convinced Merseyside is now a far safer place as these two offenders will be off the streets for a significant period of time.' Members also took pictures of the watches and expensive jewellery that had stolen from people's homes . Designer handbags also formed part of the gangs spoils as they targeted homes and committed cash in transit robberies and thefts . Craig Lister, Daniel Challinor and Marlene Currie pleaded guilty to various offences at a previous hearing in relation to the conspiracies and will be sentenced at a later date. Head of community engagement, Chief Supt Rowley Moore, said: 'The offences against Chinese nationals living in Merseyside brought fear to what is a tight knit and very proud group of people. 'I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their bravery and recognise the contribution the victims have made in providing evidence and securing these court results. 'We provided support throughout the justice process and also worked closely with senior members of those communities and a range of partners to provide reassurance and advice'","Jack Hunter and Jamie Ellis were part of a 'prolific' crime gang in Liverpool .

"Patients lying in their hospital beds are charged 10 times more to watch 'free' TV programmes than prisoners incarcerated in their cells, it has emerged. To use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at Southport Hospital, patients are charged £10 every 24 hours. Meanwhile inmates at nearby Maghull's HMP Kennet pay just £1 a week to have a TV in their cell. The stark disparity has prompted patients and their families to hit out at the costs, saying they add a huge expense to a stay in hospital. To use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at Southport Hospital, patients are charged £10 every 24 hours. That is 10 times more than prisoners are required to spend to watch the same 'free' TV programmes. Relatives have branded the disparity 'shocking and unfair' (file picture) Mike Gillett, whose relative was a patient at Southport Hospital after breaking her leg, said the family paid £140 over the course of a two-week stay. He said: 'To charge £10 is just unfair because you have nothing better to do but to watch TV while you are in hospital. 'What else are you supposed to do? 'But to find out that people in prisons pay just £1 just beggar's belief. 'Hard working tax payers are forking out £10 per day to watch TV from their hospital bed when they have nothing better to do, but criminals pay a small fraction of the same amount - when they're supposed to be locked up. 'It just doesn't seem fair. I understand they have costs to meet but I would be shocked if it costs as much as £10 a day. 'Some patients on the ward were complaining that they only watch one soap a day, and it still costs them the same amount as if they were watching 24 hours of TV.' Hospedia provides bedside TV services in NHS hospitals across the country. Patients are all charged similar amounts for access to TV, phone and internet services, across the UK. Meanwhile inmates at nearby Maghull's HMP Kennet pay just £1 a week to have a TV in their cell (file image) A spokesperson for the company defended the charges to patients, saying it also paid for installation costs. They said: 'Hospedia provides bedside media to both Southport and Ormskirk hospitals across the majority of their wards. 'We have 323 TVs installed at Southport and 134 at Ormskirk.

'If a patient is staying in hospital for one day only, we have a number of options for them to purchase but it is important to note that there are many longer term packages providing a wide range of further options too. 'We give very serious consideration to the packages we offer and customer feedback has been the driving force in selecting the durations and options we currently have available.'

"Labour supporters demanding an end to trivial speculation about their leader's kitchen are in for a disappointment: Ed Miliband has invited the cameras into his home again. Days after it emerged his £2million house has a large family kitchen and a smaller 'functional kitchenette' upstairs, ITV is expecting to film him relaxing in at least one of them. Confusion about why the family have two kitchens deepened today, when it emerged that the larger family kitchen picture on Mr Milband's Christmas card last year is in fact used by the live-in nanny. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room . Mr Miliband tried to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements on Friday, insisting he prefers the 'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras as part of a short film about his wife, Justine. The poky room the couple were pictured in last week, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth £2.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail . 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' But now it has emerged that the kitchen will appear on screens again. ITV has already filmed David Cameron and Nick Clegg at home. An ITV told the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Cameron and Clegg have already been filmed in their kitchens and elsewhere and we are due to begin filming in Ed Miliband's home in the next day or two. We were always going to shoot in the family kitchen so we shall have to see what happens.' It was also claimed that the second bigger kitchen is used by the live-in nanny who looks after the couple's children Daniel and Sam. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in the paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their £2million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen . Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day . Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence – by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his £2million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.' Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.","Mr Miliband has a second kitchen for 'tea and snacks' next to sitting room .

"A family of 12 siblings with a combined age of more than 1,000 years have officially been named the oldest in the world. The Tweed family - comprising seven brothers and five sisters - are aged between 76 and 95 became Guinness World Record holders yesterday, confirming their place in the history books. Between them, they have 33 grandchildren, 59 great-grandchildren and 17 great-great-grandchildren, and live across the UK. Scroll down for video . The Tweed family have been named the world's oldest family with a combined age of 1,019 years, 336 days. L-R: Front row: Ralph, Reginald, Elsie, Robert, Noel, Eric.  Back row: Eunice, Phyllis, Valerie, Malcolm, Ronnie . The brothers and sisters are: Elsie, 95, Reginald, 92, Robert, 91, Cynthia, 89, Ralph, 87, Noel, 85, Eric, 83, Ronald, 82, Malcolm, 81, Valerie, 79, Phyllis, 78, and Eunice 76. A grainy black-and-white photo taken in 1939 shows the siblings in the back garden of their three-bedroom council house with parents Flo and Percy. Brewery drayman Percy and barmaid Flo brought up their large family in Coventry and had a staggering 16 children in 21 years. The siblings grew up in Coventry with four others who have now died L-R: Phyllis, Valerie, Ronnie, Noel, Eric, Ralph, Cynthia, Jessie, Robert, Reginald, Julia, Elsie, Joseph and Eunice, with mum Florence and dad Percy . Four of the siblings have since died and some of the rest have moved further afield, living in Wolverhampton, Leicester, and Wales. The Tweed's world record for the oldest family was officially dated on November 25 last year when their combined ages totalled 1,019 years and 336 days (a combination of their years and additional days). The third youngest child Valerie McCaffrey, 79, received an official certificate from Guinness World Records this week confirming the family's remarkable achievement. The retired telephonist, who lives in Coventry with her husband Walter, 83, says that the achievement had been a long-time coming. The third youngest child Valerie McCaffrey (pictured) was presented with certificate from the Guinness Book of World Records this week following the record being announced in November last year . 'It took over a year for the record to come through. 'They need proof of everything so I was going to and from the registry office to get birth certificates and marriage certificates. 'My son Daniel also had to help with all the computer side of things.' However, Valerie added that when they were finally awarded their certificate it had been well worth the wait. Valerie puts her mother's constant pregnancy down to a lack of television when they were younger . 'Everyone was delighted when it was confirmed and we couldn't wait for the certificates to come. 'When they arrived we were all very excited, they will definitely be going up as pride of place in our houses. 'It is incredible to think we are the oldest family in the world. I knew we were a big family but to be over 1,000 years old is a remarkable achievement.' The 12 siblings remain close and still meet up every year at their gigantic family gatherings. Eight of them still live in Coventry where they were brought up by the mum Flo, who died aged 59 in 1956, and dad Percy, who was 73 when he died in 1958. Valerie has traced her family tree back to 1417 when wool merchant George Tweedy moved down to Essex from Scotland. ELSIE, 95 - The twice-wed widow once did a milk round on a horse and cart, lives in Coventry. REGINALD, 92 - Widowed dad-of-three, retired butcher, lives in Coventry. ROBERT, 91 - Married with two children, he caught malaria in WW2, lives in Measham, Derbs. CYNTHIA, 89 - Married for 65 years with four children, lives in Wolverhampton, West Mids. RALPH, 87- Married dad-of-one, worked 36 years for GPO, lives in Coventry. NOEL, 85 - Retired brewery driver who lives in Coventry with sister Elsie. ERIC, 83 - Married with three children, former head of market traders' association, Coventry. RONALD, 82 - Married with two sons, ex-hairdresser, lives in Leicester. MALCOLM, 81 - Widower with two children, worked in  Australia for eight years, lives in Wales. VALERIE, 79 - Married mum-of-five, retired telephonist, lives in Coventry. PHYLLIS, 78 - Married with two sons, she was a clerk, lives in Coventry. EUNICE, 76 - Married with four children, retired machinist, lives in Coventry. TREVOR - The baby died aged 18 months from meningitis in 1930. JESSIE - The dancer died of rheumatic fever aged 18 in 1944. JOE - The milkman died aged 71 in 1989. JULIA - The GP surgery worker died aged 72 in 1993. She added that growing up with so many siblings had been very entertaining and puts her mothers regular pregnancies down to a lack of television. 'Growing up was fun all being in the same house together. 'I think 23 months was the longest time our mother went without being pregnant. But there wasn't really any television in those days.' Valerie says that when they are reunited it is just as it once was with all the siblings getting along famously. 'We all keep in touch and we are having a big family gathering in June for my 80th birthday. 'It is great when we all get together. We all natter away for hours and the older brothers talk about their war service.' Second youngest sibling Phyllis Smith, 78, said: 'We all go on holiday together once a year and five of my brothers and sisters meet up every week for a game of whist. 'We have our moments when we disagree and we do have little cliques but we never fall out or bear a grudge. 'Val and Eunice and I are very close because we are the three youngsters. We go off to the theatre together and do the things women do. 'But Eunice rules us all with a rod of iron. Even though Eunice is the youngest she's the mother figure who has to be obeyed. She is very caring and kind.' The siblings are so close that they even refused to fall out with each when one of them blew their chance of becoming millionaires. Phyllis added: 'We all do the lottery together in a syndicate organised by Ralph. 'We always used to include number 39, the number of the house where some of us grew up. 'But because 39 had been coming up a lot Ralph decided to change it one particular week and unfortunately for us we would have won the jackpot. 'We got £300 each instead of being millionaires. Poor Ralph was devastated and came round to each of us and apologised profusely. 'Other families might have broken up over that but we didn't. We were not meant to be rich.'","The Tweed family of 12 siblings have a combined age of nearly 1,020 years .

"A British artist living in Dubai has created a collection of tongue-in-cheek posters, depicting life as an ex-pat in the United Arab Emirates. Clare Napper, 36,used her artistic skills to gently poke fun at everything from ubiquitous holiday snaps in front of the Burj Al Arab building to the childcare and home help habits of foreigners living in Dubai. The former Saatchi & Saatchi graphic designer said the poster collection is a celebration of one of the world's most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities. Scroll down for video . Making Dubai holiday snaps since 1999: Graphic artist Clare Napper's take on the obligatory Burj Al Arab holiday photo . 'Thank goodness for nanny': Many ex-pats lead a priveledged life in Dubai, employing domestic help, which is the subject of this poster . Napper, from London, juxtaposed the striking modernity of the UAE with a vintage style, similar to the popular travel and tourism adverts that materialised in the 1930s and 1940s when commercial airlines were really taking off, typified by French artist Roger Broders. Inspired by the good life led by ex-pats in Dubai, Napper first got the idea when working on a campaign for the Dubai Metro at Saatchi & Saatchi. 'Dubai is a new city and there are none of these old commercial printed ads, so I thought it could be a nice new art space to explore here,' she tells MailOnline Travel. Dubai is known for its many high-end shops, which Napper addresses in this 'Poverty Sucks' poster of ex-pat surrounded by purchases . One of the themes in Napper's illustrations is to poke good-natured fun at the frequency with which ex-pats employ hired help, such as maids . With temperatures of up to 40C in summer, activities such as playing golf are far from recommended in the United Arab Emirates . But is living in Dubai really as glamorous as these posters make it out to be? 'It depends on where you're from and what your socioeconomic background is like,' Napper says. 'For people like myself, an average middle-class ex-pat from the UK, day to day life in Dubai is generally like living in any cosmopolitan city in the world. 'People go to work, they take the kids to school, they get coffee, go to the supermarket, you name it, we do it here. 'The differences - aside from living in sunshine all year round, which improves everyone's mood massively - are that earnings are tax-free, we have a huge selection of great beaches and you can get anything delivered to your doorstep. 'I would also say that Dubai is one of the safest places in the world - every apartment building has a pool, gym and 24/7 security.' JBR, or Jumeirah Beach Residence, is a 1.7 km waterfront area, frequented by ex-pats looking to soak up the sun . Despite the joking tone of her travel posters, Napper insists that most middle-class ex-pats live a relatively normal day-to-day existence . 'Real food at Ravis': In Dubai, this cheap Pakistani eatery is known as a great place to get a quick and unpretentious bite . Taxis are readily available and inexpensive, due to the prices of petrol in the region, but it still may take awhile to get to your destination . Despite such a reality, Napper recognises that it's not uncommon for Britons to have many misconceptions about Dubai. 'Yes, the United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country, so there are certain laws and rules that might take a bit of getting used to, but the UAE is extremely tolerant,' she explains. 'After all, there are about eight million expats living here from all over the world. 'Many friends ask about the nightlife here and while we do let our hair down here, it all happens within the confines of licensed bars and clubs, or at home. 'You don't walk down the street being openly intoxicated. We all respect the culture.' Napper admits that one of the best things about living in Dubai is seeing the city develop - both in its infrastructure and also artistically . From excursions to Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah to having to renewing a visa: Day tripping possibilities are endless in Dubai . In a gentle mockery of ex pat living, this image depicts a scruffy - and presumably lazy - young woman takes delivery of a chocolate bar . As for Napper, who has been in Dubai for eight years after intending to stay for just 12 months, she can't imagine living anywhere else. 'The best part is seeing how the place is developing,' she adds. 'Both in terms of infrastructure but also artistically. 'As more people arrive, you get more diversity. 'There are so many talented people doing amazing things here and you get the feeling that there's something exciting happening all the time. 'People say that Dubai has no history or soul, but I disagree. How much history or soul did London or Paris have when they were only 40 years old?'","London born Clare Napper, 36, is a graphic designer who moved to Dubai eight years ago to pursue her career .

"A bench-clearing brawl during a women's college basketball game on Saturday  ended the contest before the winner of the Southwestern Athletic Conference regular-season title could be crowned. Texas Southern trailed Southern by two points at TSU's H&PE Arena in Houston, Texas, with 12:37 left in the second half when the brawl broke out. SU was leading 51-49 when TSU's Miracle Davis took a charge underneath her basket. Scroll down for video . Southern and Texas Southern were playing at H&PE Arena on Saturday when a massive brawl broke out . The two teams began fighting after TSU's Miracle Davis took a charge underneath her team's basket . The physical play prompted the melee to begin between the players, but it spread to include fans and cheerleaders as well. TSU's Alexus Johnson and Diamonisha Sophus threw punches during the fight, the Advocate reported. Johnson was so heated, security officers had to prevent her from entering the SU locker room. Footage of the fight was captured by a cellphone. SU coach Sandy Pugh said he had never seen such an 'embarrassment' in more than 30 years of being involved with basketball. He said. 'I just saw two kids standing up looking at each other, and someone else push and yell. 'My first reaction is to tell everyone to stay on the bench. But I look up and TSU has two kids running in. 'One of their kids throws the first punch, and one of our kids was on the ground and someone was just pounding her. Next thing I know, it was a melee.' The physical play prompted the players to fight, but fans and cheerleaders got involved in the fracas as well . TSU's Alexus Johnson (left) and Diamonisha Sophus (right) reportedly threw punches during the fight . Officials ruled the game ended in a double forfeit, but the SWAC later decided SU, which is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, won and both teams would share a piece of the regular-season title. SU athletic director Dr. William Broussard said: 'I haven't reviewed the film as much as I'd like, but my initial response is that there was a significant show of and attempt at restraint on the part of our bench as the melee unfolded, . 'At a certain point it's difficult to distinguish whether or not we interacted out of aggression or to defend teammates as Texas Southern's game-day staff and security personnel attempted to respond.' If both teams advance in the SWAC tournament, they could meet in the conference final over the weekend . Officials ruled the game ended in a double forfeit, but the SWAC later decided SU won the game by 51-40 . The SWAC women's tournament starts on Tuesday but TSU and SU won't play until Wednesday. The TSU Lady Tigers are then No. 1 seed and the SU Lady Jaguars are seeded second. If both teams advance, they could meet in the conference final over the weekend. TSU athletic director Charles McClelland said: 'At Texas Southern University we hold our student-athletes to high standards in regards to sportsmanship and personal conduct. 'An unfortunate incident occurred during the second half of our women's basketball with Southern University that undoubtedly does not reflect the core values and principles that we expect our student-athletes to exhibit at all times. 'Both institutions along with the conference office are in the process of reviewing the incident and gathering additional information.'

"A mother-of-two claims she is forced to spend £2,000 a month on the school run after her son was denied a place at four local primary schools. Frustrated Louise Beard, 26, from Orpington, South London, says she spends around £100 per day ensuring four-year-old Archie gets to school. But instead of walking her son to the local school like most parents, she is forced to drive 25 miles to Archie's current school in Kings Hill, Kent. Louise Beard claims she spends £100 per school day - £2,000 a month - on the school run after son Archie, four, did not get a place at a local school. They are pictured with father Byron and little Poppy, aged two . This map shows the journey Mrs Beard does every day to ensure her son gets to his school 25 miles away . The accounts manager  then drops her two-year-old daughter Poppy at a nearby nursery, before parking at the closest train station and getting the train to work in south Bromley - just a few miles from her home. And at the end of the day, she has to do the entire journey in reverse, before picking them up from a childminder. She eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning. Mrs Beard said: 'It's awful at the moment. We are under a lot of stress. 'The kids are always sleeping in the car on the way. Archie is just exhausted.' The family estimate they spend around £2,000 a month on the school run - or £100 per school day. Every day they have to pay for: . More than 50 miles worth of petrol: Costing £5 to £10 a day . Parking at West Malling Train Station: £4 . Return train ticket from West Malling to Bromley South: £21.70 . Childminder: £20 at approx. £5 per hour . Nursery: £35-£50 per day . Breakfast club for two children: £5 . Total: Minimum spend of £95 per day . Mrs Beard and recruitment manager husband Byron, 30, have already spent around £12,000 on the school run since Archie started in September. They say they spend the money on petrol, train tickets, parking, a childminder, breakfast club and nursery fees. Now the couple are so fed up with the daily grind that they have decided they have no choice but to sell their £400,000 home and move closer to the school. A spokesman for Bromley Council refused to comment on the case specifically. The spokesman said: 'Bromley Council is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a Bromley school are offered a school place. 'In common with the rest of London we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place. 'The high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius, particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings. 'The pan-London admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant's permanent address and the number of places available at each school. 'Many schools are over-subscribed and cannot offer to all who apply, and only reach limited distances under the proximity criteria.' The family say they spend £100 a day on petrol, train tickets, parking, childminder, breakfast club and nursery .","Louise Beard is forced to drive son Archie, aged 4, to school 25 miles away .

"Getting through senior school has never been easy, but with the invention of smart phones and social media, running the teenage gauntlet has become twice as hard. A new documentary series called Teens, which airs its first episode tonight on Channel 4, follows a group of teenagers from Davenant Foundation School in Loughton, Essex for a year and charts how modern technology has changed the way young people interact. The cameras started to follow the group in January 2014 and continued to record their antics until the end of December. Scroll down for video . A new Channel 4 show called Teens followed group of sixth formers from Davenant Foundation School in Loughton, Essex (pictured), for a year . They monitored more than one million texts, Snapchats, WhatsApp messages and tweets over the 12 months, charting the highs and lows of friendship at the age of 16. What becomes clear early on in the programme is how much each teen uses their phone – whether it is to engage on social media or simply text their parents. This first episode meets Jess and Harry D, who have both have just joined school for sixth form. Harry D, 16, uses his Twitter account for three main functions – stirring up emotions among his friends, pranking his mates and family members to appear cool among his peers, and lastly, to meet young women. He finds a girl on twitter who looks attractive then follows her and sends her a couple of public messages, before long they are sending each other private messages. Harry D and Jess feature heavily in the show and come to blows over Twitter . He tells the cameras: ‘When you’re on DM’s you’re on good ground, then she gives you her number. ‘When she gives you her number, that’s it - you‘re so close to succeeding. ‘That’s when you [use the number to] go on WhatsApp. ‘You don’t text because that’s too serious, who do you text now? Your mum and dad.’ Jess, who is also 16, uses Twitter to get involved in campaigns like No More Page Three. This episode shows how social media can be a force for good among teens, by engaging them in current issues and broadening their horizons. But it also shows that having teens so closely linked 24/7 also allows tensions to become inflamed and how easy it is for bullying to start. In the show, Jess is seen inviting a campaigner from NO More Page Three to come and give a talk at the school about the issue. Rebecca and Harry M, who feature on a later episode of the documentary series . During the debate, many of the pupils side with Page Three, believing that a woman with her breasts out does no harm. When Harry says that it is simply tradition, the anti-Page Three campaigner says that is not a good reason to keep something and likens it to slavery, which she also calls a tradition. The comment has an inflammatory effect on the pupils present, who quickly take to social media sites like Twitter to attack the lecture, with many blaming Jess because she organised it. Later that evening, the pupils continue to whip up a storm on social media and Jess reads multiple comments about herself being an attention seeker and that someone has called her fat which is retweeted several times. She cries in front of the cameras and says that the comments have really affected her self-esteem. The producers then talk to a group of girls from the school who have also been attacked on social media. One says: ‘It’s hard on twitter because you don’t have to tag someone’s name on it, so you can twist it and say it wasn’t about them, even when it clearly is. Another adds: ‘Someone wrote “These are the ugliest girls in the year” on Twitter and listed lots of my friends’ names underneath, I was on there as well.’ Shauna, Melissa and James all take part in a later episode of the programme . But while Jess labels the Twitter drama ‘World War Three’ during the evening when the abuse is at its worse, the next day everyone is back at school and smiling and joking. It becomes clear that although the teenagers are able to be highly aggressive to each other when behind their computers, they have also become very adept at recovering from the situation the next day. Harry says: ‘When you say something to someone on social media, you aren’t aware of the consequences. ‘They can’t come and find you and that’s why people find it quite good. ‘Twitter beef is probably the most entertaining thing in society. ‘I stick to the thing where I’d say to someone on social media what I would say to them in real life.’ But possibly the biggest change is how nothing, not even the amount of sleep you had the night before, is private any more. The schoolmates tweet about everything from a failed biology test, two six hours sleep and how they were let down by a girl. Just fifteen years ago, a teenager could leave Year 11 as a preppie schoolboy and come back three months later as a goth in the sixth form. These days that kid would be papped heading down to the corner shop for a pint of milk mid-transformation and it would be on the web for their peers to see within minutes. Social media and unlimited internet on smart phones has given these teens the freedom to interact with their friends all night, but they've paid a hefty price - real expression.

"A Michigan man got the help of a baby kangaroo to propose to his girlfriend - but she didn't notice the ring around its neck after several minutes of holding the little animal. When she found the ring on the marsupial's collar, however, she was speechless. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to Jessica Harrington, 22, on March 7 in Summit Township, near Jackson. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Harrington, 22, with the help of a baby kangaroo on March 7 in Summit Township, Michigan . He hid the ring on the kangaroo's collar, which he made several references to before Harrington noticed. When she did, Day got down on one knee and she was left speechless . The couple have been together for five-and-a-half years, have a three-year-old son named Payton and have been talking about marriage for the last year. 'It kind of took my breath away,' Harrington told MLive about Day's surprise proposal. The couple plan to wed on October 31 of this year. In a video that captured the proposal, Day makes several references to the kangaroo's collar being too tight before Harrington spotted the ring. Saying the collar was to tight was simply a ruse to get Harrington to find the ring and there was no animal cruelty involved, according to the New York Daily News. 'You missed it like 20 times,' Day said after he got down on one knee. Harrington said yes and was visibly overwhelmed with emotion. Day and Harrington have been dating for five-and-a-half years and have a three-year-old son named Payton together. They've been talking about marriage for the last year, but Harrington didn't know when Day would get down on one knee . A friend of the couple is attempting to start a small zoo and recently came across the baby kangaroo, named Boomer. Harrington fell in love with the animal when she spend a few months in Australia when she was 13 years old and was touched by her fiance's special gesture. 'The fact that he used something so special to me from my past brought back a lot of happy memories and he used that for a day that will be one of the biggest days of our lives,' she said. To add another personal touch to the proposal, Day used some familiar stones in Harrington's engagement ring. 'He actually used a stone from my mom's old ring and a stone from his mom's old ring so that made it even more special than what it already was,' Harrington said.","Jordan Day, 23, proposed to  Jessica Harrington, 22, on March 7 in Summit Township, Michigan .

"First-time buyers are being pushed out of the housing market by the rise of ‘granlords’, say experts. A recent buy-to-let boom has been partly driven by retired Britons looking to invest in property. And estate agents say the interest from older investors in property is putting an even greater strain on Britain’s limited housing stock. Retirees have increasingly turned to buy-to-let to get a better return on their savings at a time when banks are offering the worst interest rates on record. First-time buyers are being pushed out of the housing market by the rise of so-called 'granlords' who are looking to invest their pensions in property, experts have warned (file picture) The industry is now predicting that even more ‘granlords’ will buy homes to rent out from April, when reforms make it easier for the over-55s to cash in their pensions. This is likely to drive up prices even further at the lower end of the market, making modest, first-time properties even more unaffordable for young buyers who are trying to take their first step on the property ladder. Miles Shipside, of property website Rightmove, said: ‘While many pension pots may not fund a sufficiently large tax-free lump sum to facilitate a property purchase, for some it will provide enough for a deposit. ‘Agents report a high level of interest from “granlords” – new landlords who are typically first-time, retirement-age, buy-to-let investors.’ David Blythman, of Scottfraser estate agent, Oxfordshire, said: ‘Since the beginning of the year there has been no let-up in demand for properties across Oxfordshire and our investment search division are now receiving a significant uplift in enquiries including many from ‘granlords’ - first time, retirement age, buy-to-let investors diversifying their pension investments. ‘We foresee these buyers having a positive impact on the quality of the private rental sector as they have no intention of squandering their hard earned funds on anything other than the best properties.’ Estate agents say the interest from older investors  is putting an even greater strain on Britain’s limited housing stock (file picture) Britain is in the middle of a buy-to-let boom as middle-income ‘amateur’ landlords invest in property. Thousands of middle-class families fed up with rock-bottom interest rates are making their first foray into the renting market. The value of buy-to-let mortgages on new purchases rose by 34 per cent to £11.6billion between January and November last year. The number of landlords taking out mortgages on new purchases in the UK also grew by 21 per cent to 93,970 between January and November 2014 - with 8,500 handed out every month. Ken Hume, of James Alexander estate agents in Norbury, South West London, said: ‘We’ve had enquiries from a number of older people considering buy-to-let, with interest expressed particularly in smaller flats where yields are higher.’","Recent boom partly driven by retirees wanting better return on savings .

Since then she has spoken at various events including co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project Charity Event with actor Charlie Sheen. Controversy has long surrounded the mysterious religion which counts Tom Cruise as one of its devout followers. A controversial documentary premiered on HBO on Sunday and at the Sundance Film Festival claims the Church of Scientology broke up Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who divorced in 2001. Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife, pictured at Mission Impossible 2 premiere in LA . Going Clear, created by Alex Gibney, makes a number of startling revelations about the organisation - including allegations they used aggressive intimidation tactics to force the Hollywood couple apart.

Interviews with former senior members and officials also included descriptions of a 'prison camp' and claims that Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions. The claims have been disputed by the Church, who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.'

"It took just one juror to spare the life of convicted murderer Jodi Arias on Thursday - and the woman had to survive an attempt by her colleagues to boot her from the jury before she could do it. In the end, the jury voted 11-1 in favor of death - but not enough to send Arias to death row in the case that became a global sensation with its tawdry revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. The deadlock took the death penalty off the table and left a judge to decide whether to sentence Arias to life in prison or to life with the possibility of release after 25 years. That decision is expected at an April 13 hearing. Arias was convicted in 2013 of killing her lover, 30-year-old Travis Alexander, but that jury also deadlocked on her punishment, prompting the sentencing retrial that began in October. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Convicted killer Jodi Arias (pictured in court on Thursday) was spared execution by the vote of one juror who voted against the death penalty . Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . The holdout juror did not speak to the media on Thursday. But other jurors said they thought Arias lacked remorse and that her attorneys had presented an inaccurate portrait of Mr Alexander. The jurors did not elaborate but during the trial, defense lawyers said Alexander had used Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, to quench his sexual urges, called her demeaning names and told her she was soulless. Most of the jurors said they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. The other jurors asked the judge on Tuesday if the woman could be replaced with an alternate, but the request was denied and jury was told to keep deliberating. The one juror who voted against the death penalty for Jodi Arias admitted to having seen the 2013 Lifetime Television movie (pictured) about the convicted killer entitled, Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret . One male juror said on Thursday that he became angry when the holdout indicated the death penalty would be a form of revenge. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Jurors also note that the woman had acknowledged seeing a 2013 cable TV movie, made by Lifetime Television, about the Arias case, entitled Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret. Jurors apologized to the Alexander family for the deadlock and said they felt Arias was trying to manipulate the jury. None of the jurors would give their names. The identities of jurors are kept secret in Arizona. Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . The jury deliberated for about 26 hours over five days. They said they started with about half of the members voting for the death penalty, eventually reached the 11-1 vote then got stuck. They described having knots in their stomachs and problems sleeping at night during the trial. Arias will begin serving her sentence in a 12-by-7 foot cell in a maximum-security unit at the Perryville prison for women, west of downtown Phoenix. If officials deem her behavior is good over time, she could be moved to a medium security unit. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis 'Greg' Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' Nearly $3 million of taxpayer money was spent during both trials. Arias' court-appointed attorneys billed the state for $2.7 million. Prosecutors say they spent more than $132,000 on expert witnesses, transcripts, travel expense and other costs, though that figure doesn't include the salary of the prosecutor. Prosecutors said they don't regret trying again to send Arias to death row. 'Regret is a place in the past I can't afford to live in,' Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said. Alexander's family members wept when the judge announced the deadlock. His distraught sister, Tanisha Sorenson, was overcome with grief and held her face in her hands while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said: 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' His brothers and sisters said in a statement that they 'are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty, however, we understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said the killing was a tragedy and 'no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness'. Prosecutors say Arias killed Alexander as revenge because he wanted to date other women and was planning a trip to Mexico with his latest love interest. Authorities said Arias shot him in the head and stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times then left his body in his shower at his suburban Phoenix home, where friends found him about five days later. Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . During closing arguments in the penalty retrial, prosecutor Juan Martinez repeatedly showed jurors gruesome crime scene photos of the victim's slit throat. The images were a counterpoint to the happy photos of Arias that her attorney displayed in arguing there was more to her life than her actions in the killing. Nurmi told jurors that Arias deserved a second chance because she was the victim of verbal and physical abuse throughout her life. Arias initially courted the spotlight after her arrest, granting interviews to '48 Hours' and 'Inside Edition.' She testified for 18 days at her first trial, describing her abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, relationship with Alexander and her contention that he was physically abusive.","Eight women and four men sat on the jury in Phoenix, Arizona .

"Supermarkets are blocking efforts to tackle a deadly bug found in chicken, a watchdog declared last night. The Food Standards Agency has found that up to 79 per cent of raw birds on sale are contaminated with campylobacter – the country’s most common cause of food poisoning. Levels are dangerously high in 19 per cent of chickens and the agency has demanded this figure should be below 10 per cent by year’s end. Tests last month revealed 73 per cent of chickens in supermarkets contained potentially lethal food poisoning bug campylobacter, which makes 280,000 people ill every year . It says however that Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Waitrose and the Co-op are failing to help. Only Marks & Spencer is giving updates on its plans and progress in tackling campylobacter. Professor Paul Wiles of the FSA said the industry’s response had been ‘unacceptable’. Chief executive Catherine Brown said supermarkets had ‘pushed back’ against providing information and claimed the stores were unhappy over the FSA’s publication of campylobacter league tables. Experts fear the stand-off will make it more difficult to tackle a bug that hits an estimated 280,000 people every year, killing 100. Campylobacter also costs £900million in terms of NHS treatment and in lost productivity due to victims being too sick to work. To date, only M&S has given the FSA details of its comprehensive plan to tackle campylobacter, which involves changes on farms and in slaughterhouses. To date, only Marks & Spencer has given the FSA details of its comprehensive plan to tackle campylobacter, which involves changes on farms and in slaughterhouses . Miss Brown said this had helped meet the 10 per cent target, adding: ‘This is great news – demonstrating that when businesses attack campylobacter with real focus, they can make a difference.’ Professor Wiles, who was previously chief scientific adviser to the Home Office, condemned the other firms’ refusal to detail what they were doing: ‘In terms of the scientific evidence and how to reduce campylobacter that is not acceptable.’ In the agency’s research, which looked at raw roasting chickens bought in 2014, Asda came out worst on virtually every measure. It had a contamination rate of 78.9 per cent, with 31.1 per cent at the highest level. Morrisons was second with a total contamination rate of 76.2 per cent and 22.9 per cent at high levels. Richard Lloyd, of the consumer group Which?, said: ‘People need reassurance that supermarkets are doing everything they can to make chicken safe.’ Shamed supermarkets are refusing to give the FSA useful details of what they are doing to reduce levels of the potentially lethal bug and what success – if any – they are having . Lib Dem MP Andrew George, who campaigns on supermarket issues, said: ‘I would have thought they would have learnt lessons. 'I would strongly urge supermarkets to reflect on what happened to each of their reputations as a result of the horsemeat scandal. ‘It’s not directly related but it’s one that they should remember because you undermine consumer confidence.’ Tory MP Andrew Percy said: ‘The FSA are quite clear on campylobacter and this needs to be tackled. The supermarkets don’t have any excuse for not complying.’ But Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium said: ‘We are surprised to hear this. 'As Catherine Brown would know, her officials are meeting experts from the major retailers regularly through the Acting on Campylobacter Together campaign. 'This is when we share details of progress in the various pilots we are sponsoring.’ The Co-op said it met the FSA last month to spell out its action plan. The other stores insisted they were co-operating.","Tests found 73 per cent of supermarket chickens contained campylobacter .

"Amazon.com and caffeine powder distributors didn't provide proper warnings about the supplement's dangers, resulting in the death of an Ohio high school student last year, the teen's father said in a lawsuit filed Friday. Logan Stiner, 18, was just days from graduating high school in northeast Ohio when, on May 27, his brother found him unresponsive in the family's home in LaGrange, southwest of Cleveland. A coroner ruled that Stiner died of cardiac arrhythmia and seizure due to acute caffeine toxicity. The amount of caffeine in his system was about 23 times greater than the level in a typical soda or coffee drinker. Scroll down for video . Cardiac arrest: Logan Stiner, 18, a popular student who was voted prom king and was on the wrestling team, died in May after ingesting about 23 times the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee or soda . Contentious: Stiner's parents have claimed in a lawsuit the caffeine supplement their son bought on Amazon, called Hard Rhino, was not properly packaged pharmaceutical-grade powder . Family torn apart: Katie and Denis Stiner (pictured with Logan, right, and younger son Dylan, left) are suing Amazon.com and caffeine powder distributors . Stiner was a popular student who was voted prom king, wrestled and planned to study chemical engineering at the University of Toledo. The lawsuit names as defendants a classmate who gave Stiner the caffeine powder; Amazon, which shipped it to the woman last March; and six Arizona-based companies that the father's attorney said packaged and sold the pharmaceutical-grade powder under the name Hard Rhino. The lawyer, Brian Balser, said Friday that the Arizona companies appear to be related. An Amazon.com Inc. spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit. Messages left with the Arizona companies were not returned. There is no number listed for the former classmate. Balser said that after the death of a college student in Georgia in June and a consumer warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Hard Rhino stopped selling caffeine powder on Amazon. Balser said, however, that he ordered powdered caffeine from another company off the Internet two weeks ago. 'It's still out there,' he said. The lawsuit focuses on the Hard Rhino package label. Popular: Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine . The lawsuit says the package informed users that a cup of coffee contains about 1/32nd of a teaspoon of caffeine. The package label also warned that the powder 'can be dangerous if abused,' and 'failure to follow safety guidelines can result in serious injury or death,' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that the label lacked specific instructions on proper use. 'The difference between life and death is a pinch and a smidgen,' Balser said. Hard Rhino sold the powder as a dietary supplement, which allows the company to bypass FDA regulations, Balser said. The attorney said Amazon has a team of compliance specialists that is supposed to review products before they are allowed to be sold through the site. The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $25,000. Denis and Katie Stiner have previously urged federal regulators to ban the sale of such substances. 'Before May 27, 2014, we had never heard of ""caffeine powder."" Now we think about it every day,' the Stiners said in a statement in December.","Logan Stiner, 18, was found dead at his home in LaGrange, Ohio, in May .

"The mayor of Ferguson has refused to step down in the midst of rising calls for his resignation and a scathing Department of Justice report that has already cost the jobs of six city employees. Mayor James Knowles III, who makes just $4,200 a year, said he will stay to see the city through the changes it must make. On Friday, five residents filed an affidavit seeking to recall Knowles. They have 60 days to collect enough signatures, which is 15 percent of registered voters in the last mayoral election, to qualify for a special election. Scroll down for video . Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III has refused to step down in the midst of rising calls for his resignation and a scathing Department of Justice report that has already cost the jobs of six city employees . A Justice Department investigation found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. Knowles said he will stay to see the city through the changes it must make . Justice Department officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in Ferguson, Missouri, were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops, even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband. African-Americans were 68 per cent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal court judge. And from April to September of last year, 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black, the six-month inquiry found. Of the cases in which the police department documented the use of force, 88 per cent involved blacks, and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black. Overall, African Americans make up 67 per cent of the population of Ferguson, about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis. Critics believe Knowles had to have known about the widespread racial profiling and bias that the Department of Justice report revealed was occurring in both the Ferguson police department and the city's municipal court. The city's manager, police chief and a municipal court judge are among the people who have since been fired or stepped down. But Knowles has opened a City Hall office and said he has no plans to step aside. 'Obviously there are people on the street calling for my resignation, but my voicemail, my text messages and my Facebook are full with literally hundreds of people who want me to stay,' he said. 'Somebody has to show leadership, and I'm focused on how we can move this community forward.' Knowles, a Ferguson native, said the public servant position was merely a ceremonial position until Officer Darren Wilson shot 18-year-old Michael Brown and the city was suddenly thrust in the national spotlight. After the shooting Knowles and Police Chief Tom Jackson became the public face of Ferguson, holding news conferences, hosting public forums and reaching out to civil rights leaders and protesters. Meanwhile, City Manager John Shaw, who made $120,000 a year until he resigned Tuesday, remained out of sight. On Friday, five residents filed an affidavit seeking to recall Knowles (pictured here with pro-police demonstrators). They have 60 days to collect enough signatures to qualify for a special election . Knowles was elected to his current post in 2011 and became one of Missouri's youngest mayors. He was re-elected without opposition in 2014. He also has a full-time job as general manager of the state-contracted motor vehicle license office in the city. Knowles said he typically works 60-hour weeks and evenly splits him time between his two jobs, which are walking distance from each other. Former Mayor Brian Fletcher believes Knowles, who isn't up for re-election for another two years, will be able to ride out the storm. 'He's in a tough situation,' Fletcher said. 'He's taken a lead.' 'From the people I've talked to, they're very pleased with the way he's handled himself under a very difficult circumstance, a very difficult time for our community.' Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson (pictured August 2014) resigned on Wednesday . Ferguson municipal court judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer (left) resigned on Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice. City manager John Shaw (right) resigned on Tuesday . At a council meeting Tuesday, Knowles sat patiently as some residents loudly called for his ouster. He was equally passive as others praised him and the council. When a brief shouting match began between a city critic and supporter, he urged both sides to calm down. Rasheen Aldridge, director of Young Activists United St. Louis and a member of the Ferguson Commission appointed by Gov. Jay Nixon, is one of the people who believes the time has come for Knowles to resign. 'When all of this stuff was going on, there's no way you can be the mayor of the town and not look at how much money is coming in,' Aldridge said. 'This is his city. He's the mayor, and he needs to be held accountable.'","Mayor James Knowles III said he will stay to see the city through the changes it must make .

"The remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in Siberia by oil workers. Two tusks, teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles (50km) from Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Oil workers had been digging at a site owned by Rosneft close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Ancient: Two mammoth tusks (shown above) together with fragments of jaw, teeth, tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of Siberia. Oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket . Using shovels they then unearthed a second tust, a tibia, ribs, teeth and fragments of the animal's jaw. Aton Rezvy, head of palaeontology at the Khanty-Mansiysk Museum of Nature and Man, said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old. Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. He estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female, around 30 to 40 years old when she died. He said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth. He told the Siberian Times: 'We can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date. 'Genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - European or North American.' Recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in Siberia may have originated in North Ameria and migrated across the Bering Strait when sea levels were lower. Many believe the original Siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago, with North American mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago. The exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise. Others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Palaeontologists who examined the mammoth's remains (shown above) estimate it died 10,000 years ago . Oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from Nyagan in Russia (above) when they found the mammoth. They estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female, around 30 to 40 years old . A recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western Europe around 30,000 years ago. Just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on. Dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in Siberia, including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice. The mammoth's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia . Vladimir Bednyakov (pictured above) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks . Vladimir Bednyakov was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth. He said: 'I noticed something in the excavator bucket. It turned to be a mammoth tusk. 'We have the rule - if we find something, we stop the work and call the bosses. 'But I was also interested myself, in what this was. 'I took the shovel and began to dig.... found more remains, the second tusk, teeth and other bones.' Woolly mammoths, like the one shown in the artists impression above, lived from about 200,000 years ago until around 4,500 years ago when the last isolated populations are thought to have  died out completely .","The remains of the woolly mammoth were found close to Nyagan in Russia .

"A Liberal Democrat candidate has done a bold interview about his struggle to be accepted as gay, which led him to contemplate suicide and to intentionally set out to catch HIV as he embarked on a path of self 'annihilation.' Adrian Hyyrylainen-Trett, a candidate for Vauxhall in London, hopes that by speaking out he will help to reduce the stigma surrounding the disease and give people who suffer mental health problems from homophobic bullying the courage to do the same. The 36-year-old revealed he attempted suicide on a few occasions, took countless drugs, got involved in the gay wrestling scene and put himself in vulnerable situations after he decided that catching HIV could be one way for him to die. Lib Dem candidate Adrian Hyyrylainen-Trett has spoken about his struggles with being accepted as gay, which led him to attempt suicide and go on a path of destruction to contract HIV as a way of 'ending things' He told Buzzfeed: 'I thought, ""What's another way of doing it?"" Even though I knew people were surviving from HIV, I thought, ""Perhaps if I can make myself so ill, get the worst strain possible, that would be one way of getting rid of myself.''' But the prospective MP said he realised once he was diagnosed he did not want HIV at all, and that all his actions were just an attempt to 'annihilate' himself. The disclosures have made Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett the first parliamentary candidate to discuss being HIV positive publicly. Labour MP Chris Smith previously announced his HIV positive status when he was leaving the House of Commons for the Lords. Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett recalled times when he was teased, bullied and beaten at school for being gay, leading him to attempt suicide twice while he was still at school. He even developed fibromyalgia as a result of the stress, leaving him housebound and bedbound at the tender age of 14. He moved from Norwich to London in 2001 after completing his degree in European Studies with Italian and French at the University of Kent. In the city he experienced another form of the isolation he felt while a teenager and started meeting men on the internet before he got involved in the gay wrestling scene. Some of these sessions led to more and during one he was asked to appear in a gay wrestling pornographic film, and agreed. Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett is being supported by the Liberal Democrats and is pictured (right) talking to Nick Clegg . Adrian Hyyrylainen-Trett (left) is pictured with Brian Paddick (centre) at an event for the Liberal Democrats . Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett is pictured with  Julia Cambridge, parliamentary candidate for Chesterfield . Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett is a dedicated Liberal Democrat, pictured at a campaigning event in London . This led to him doing dozens of drugs and moving from one partner to another, before he contemplated how to catch HIV. The politician put himself in risky situations, engaging in sex sessions fueled by drugs that would often see him abused or overdosing, and frequently left him unconscious. 'If you don't care about yourself any longer you then do things that will harm you and think in a way that puts you in danger. This is what mental ill-health does. I was thinking, ""Who can I find who's the most dangerous person to go to, who isn't well, who could deliver that knockout blow?""' As he descended into this dangerous spiral, Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett, got his wish and was diagnosed with HIV. But it was only after he was diagnosed, and found he had a form that was also resistant to a number of retroviral drugs, that the prospective parliamentary candidate realised he had not been seeking HIV, but just an escape from himself. The LGBT activist, who married his partner earlier this month, said he feels he owes it to people in similar situations to speak about the issues. He has called for drugs to become 'a health issue not a criminal one', and said the mental health and wellbeing of gay people must be addressed. Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett, who married his partner last weekend, also said same-sex education should be compulsory in all schools from a young age. A number of people posted messages supporting Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett's disclosure about being HIV positive . His frank interview has been praised, and the Liberal Democrats have also pledged their support for him. A spokesman said: 'This is a very brave step from Adrian. He has a lot of support in our party and we wish him all the best. He speaks on behalf of many people who will hopefully look to him as someone who has come through difficult times, and is now dedicating himself to helping others and standing up for his community.' Others have posted words of encouragement on Twitter, praising the candidate for his courage and honesty. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs. The pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide. But research published in July by the United Nations showed AIDS-related deaths worldwide dropped to 1.5 million last year, from 1.7 million the year before. That was the sharpest annual decline since the epidemic's peak in 2004 . and 2005 - and marked a 35 per cent drop from the 2.4 million deaths in both those years. New infections also fell to 2.1 million last year, down 38 per cent compared to the 3.4 million in 2001. But with more than half of the 35 million people with HIV unaware they are infected, the battle is far from over however, warned Michel Sidibe, head of UNAIDS - the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Writing on Liberal Democrat Voice, Caron Lindsay said: 'I am feeling incredibly emotional this evening. What I’m feeling ranges from intense pride in a friend whose courage in telling his story will help others, to equally intense, ice-cold rage at what he has had to endure over the years.' She said she hoped the interview would help tackle homophobic bullying. Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett joined the Liberal Democrats in 2006 and has twice stood in local council elections. Dr Rosemary Gillespie, Chief Executive at Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'Adrian has made a really brave decision in speaking so openly about his HIV status. More than 100,000 people live with HIV in the UK. They come from all walks of life. However, we know that many people may not feel able to speak openly about their experiences, for fear of judgement and discrimination. 'Anyone in the public eye who speaks out will help raise awareness and is in a position to challenge the stigma and misconceptions around HIV. 'We agree with Adrian that the best starting point to address this issue is compulsory sex and relationships education throughout the schools system. Young people leaving school should feel confident about who they are, and empowered to have healthier relationships, regardless of their sexuality. Politicians have the power to make this happen.'

"A Los Angeles-based artist claims Versace has ripped off one of her designs. Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house. She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (£20) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.' She also uploaded a snap of Versace's £440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment. In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this. 'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work. ' But this is also my face! I can’t understand how something like this could happen.' Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa’s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.' MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. Speaking to MailOnline, Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh’s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh’s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh’s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it. 'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry. 'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws. If Kesh has a registered design, she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now.'","Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, a London-born is a Los Angeles-based artist .

"TSA agents allowed a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terrorist group to pass through an expedited security line, Homeland Security's internal watchdog has revealed. The passenger, whose identity has not been released, has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office said as it revealed the 'significant aviation security breach' in a statement on Thursday night. The watchdog was asked to investigate the June 2014 incident last October after a whistleblower came forward. It did not release specific details of the passenger's criminal history or where the incident took place. The passenger, who is a U.S. citizen, had not registered for the TSA's PreCheck program, but if they had, they would have been rejected because of their convictions, the office said in the statement. 'Significant security breach': A passenger who has convictions for murder and offenses involving explosives was allowed to pass through the TSA's PreCheck line (file picture) despite an agent recognizing them . Instead, they were selected for the screening through the Secure Flight program's 'risk assessment rules', the watchdog said. The program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the Terrorist Screening Database, No Fly lists and other intelligence-based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low-risk passengers for expedited screening. After determining a passenger can be pre-screened, it allows them to print documents carrying the PreCheck sign. The TSA was unable to show the traveler's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel, the Inspector General's Office said. When the passenger reached the airport, an agent looked at their documents. 'After checking the traveler's boarding pass and identification, an alert Transportation Security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor,' the watchdog said, CNN reported. 'However, the supervisor directed the [officer] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the TSA pre-check lane.' As part of the PreCheck system, the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry-on luggage. Investigation: The TSA responded that all passengers, including those with PreCheck tickets, are subject to 'robust' checks. It is not known where the June 2014 breach took place . The incident was brought to the attention of the Inspector General's Office's after a whistleblower went to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency. A classified report was issued to TSA detailing the need to make changes to the PreCheck vetting and screening process. On Thursday, the TSA said in a statement that it 'takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously'. 'All passengers, including those with TSA PreCheck on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen,' it said. The TSA added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists. Still, the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to TSA officers and supervisors to ensure they 'clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security'.","The unidentified passenger had convictions for murder and offenses related to explosives, said Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office .

"With less than a week before British Summer Time starts on March 29, British Grooming Time has kicked off in earnest. Do you want to present perfectly primped limbs to the world when the weather heats up and opaque tights and cardies are cast aside? Then you need to get to work. Here, we test the latest beauty gadgets and creams and give them a BGT (British Grooming Time) rating. Scroll down for video . There's less than a week now until British Summer Time starts, after the long winter are you ready to show off your perfectly prepped body to the world? BRIGHTEN DULL HAIR . PROBLEM: Spring sunshine means it’s time to lighten your locks. ‘Going two or three shades lighter will keep hair looking natural, but fresh for spring,’ says Jack Howard, Poppy Delevingne’s colourist at Paul Edmonds salon in Knightsbridge. ‘Or you can freshen up your existing dye job with an at-home mask.’ SOLUTION: I decide to lighten my five-week-old highlights with Maria Nila Golden Blonde Colour Refresh (£16.99, sallyexpress.com, launches on Monday). Maria Nila Golden Blonde Colour Refresh (£16.99, sallyexpress.com) This fruity-smelling non-permanent hair mask promises to revitalise dyed hair using temporary pigments. I do a strand test first, then, reassured, squeeze a little orange-gold liquid into my hand and massage into wet hair. To my relief, my highlights do, indeed, look a couple of shades lighter and my hair is glossy and groomed. BGT rating: 7/10 . REGAIN YOUR GLOW . PROBLEM: ‘The beginning of spring needs to signal the end of lacklustre skin,’ says Dr Mervyn Patterson, cosmetic doctor at Woodford Medical Aesthetics. ‘Months of cold weather and central heating have taken their toll. The top layer of your skin is full of dead cells. Microdermabrasion is a great way to get rid of dead cells and dirt.’ PMD Personal Microderm (£150, harrods.com ) SOLUTION: The PMD Personal Microderm (£150, harrods.com) is a hand-held gadget for at-home microdermabrasion. It looks like an electric toothbrush, but at the end is a clear plastic lid with a hole at the top. Under this is a small, flat head covered in fine aluminium oxide crystals. Read the instructions carefully — this could damage your skin if used incorrectly. Epionce Intensive Nourishing Cream (£79, epionce.co.uk ) I choose a medium-strength head and turn it on, running the end of the nozzle up the back of my hand. There is a faint tingling. I try it on my face, holding the skin taut and running it carefully and slowly up my cheeks and chin. When I’ve finished I look much brighter, my fine lines are reduced and my skin is clear and glowing. I’m impressed with the results around my nostrils, which had lots of blocked pores. Expensive, but seriously effective. I follow this with celebrity favourite, Epionce Intensive Nourishing Cream (£79, epionce.co.uk), for hydration. BGT rating: 9/10 . ULTRA SMOOTH LEGS . PROBLEM: ‘Winter can leave your legs as scaly as a thirsty lizard,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘Those comforting hot baths will have leached away natural hydrating lipids.’ This season’s fashionable ripped jeans and off-the-shoulder tops mean every bit of you needs to be petal-soft. SOLUTION: ‘Exfoliate away dead dry skin and use a rich moisturiser all over,’ says Dr Patterson. Marks & Spencer’s Huile d’Olive Miracle Oil (£10, marksandspencer.com) I whizz up a body scrub by slugging a glug of coconut oil into a jam jar, adding a mound of sea salt and shaking well. I smear the gloop all over me in the shower and get to work with a loofah. After rinsing, I apply Marks & Spencer’s Huile d’Olive Miracle Oil (£10, marksandspencer.com, out at the end of the month). It smells divine and the next morning my skin feels clean and silky. BGT rating: 8/10 . FIRM UP ARMS . PROBLEM: ‘As skin loses collagen with time, it begins to sag, including on your upper arms,’ says Dr Patterson. Not a problem when you can cover up with a cardigan, but tricky in a sleeveless dress. I have noticed that my arms look saggy. I have my eye on some sleeveless tops from Zara, but I’m reluctant to remove my cardies. SOLUTION: Ultrasound waves stimulate collagen production to make skin plump and radiant. I try the ACCELerator Ultra (£175, harrods.com), by U.S. skin specialist Nurse Jamie. I apply conductor gel to the metal head and move it in a circular motion over my left arm. All I feel is a slight warmth. Apparently, results may be seen within three minutes — but not on me. The company claims any benefits will appear over a few weeks. BGT rating: 4/10 . Veet Natural Inspirations Hair Removal Cream with Shea Butter, £6.99 . PERFECTLY PALE . PROBLEM: The fashion for pale skin means you can’t conceal wispy hairs under a layer of fake tan. ‘Pale, end-of-winter skin means dark hairs on arms stand out more,’ says Dr Patterson. SOLUTION: ‘Hair removal creams will probably be better than waxing,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘It’s hard to hold skin taut and pull off a waxing strip with one hand.’ I invest in Veet Natural Inspirations Hair Removal Cream with Shea Butter, £6.99 ( boots.com) and smooth it on my forearm.After five minutes I remove it with the spatula and wipe the area clean.

SOLUTION: ‘Marine algae is good for hydrating, especially super-dry areas such as knees and elbows,’ says Dr Patterson. So I try a Casmara Algae peel-off mask (£9.99, boots.com).

"The mother of a man who stands accused of murdering 12 people in a movie theater gun rampage has begged prosecutors to stop pursuing the death penalty, terming their legal case a 'quest for death'. Arlene Holmes, whose son James, 27, opened fire at a busy screening of Batman film The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, also insists that she and her husband Robert 'were good parents'. The Holmes family claim that mental illness is to blame for the murder spree, which left 70 injured as well as the 12 fatalities. Scroll down for video . Begging for his life: Arlene Holmes prayed for prosecutors to stop their 'quest for death' in seeking a death penalty punishment for James Holmes, left, who killed 12 people in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 . 'Good parents': Holmes and her husband Robert, pictured above this week, have said the killings are the fault of their son's mental illness . Massacre: James Holmes opened fire at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 70 who were watching Batman film The Dark Knight Rises . They believe their son was having a psychotic episode during the killings, and should therefore be spared death in his trial, which is due to begin on April 27. Mrs Holmes begged the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in an entry in her prayer book, which she published earlier this month and is selling for $15. Her prayer for the prosecutor reads: 'I do not know what you have been through in life. I do not know why you want to pursue execution of a mentally ill man. 'But I pray for you, so that you will find peace in your life. I pray you will change your mind. Please stop this quest for death so you may focus on those who are alive.' She also also gave an interview on the book to the Del Mar Times local newspaper from her home in Rancho Penasquitos, California, saying that offering her son a plea deal would prevent a painful trial. 'Good parents': Holmes suggested that she and her husband Robert, right in the above image, had not done anything wrong . She said: 'This would all come to a grinding halt if [James] could plead guilty, and the DA would accept the plea for life without parole.' Mrs Holmes also defended herself and her husband from charges that they contributed to the massacre. She said: 'Because so many people like to blame the parents if a child is mentally ill, we have to reaffirm to ourselves every day that we were good parents and good people, and this still happened anyway.' Mrs Holmes did, however, say the couple feels guilt 'that we didn’t recognize he was ill and needed treatment.' On sale: Holmes published a book of prayers for people involved in the murder, which sells for $15 . According to her, the killing was completely out of character, and the first time she was aware of her son having anything to do with guns. She told the Del Mar Times: 'Our kid was quiet, compliant, obeyed all the rules. He never bothered anyone, he never harmed anyone... We never owned a gun and he showed no interest in guns.' This is the first time Mrs Holmes has been interviewed since the killings in July, 2012. The couple had remained entirely silent until last December, when they wrote a letter to the Denver Post newspaper, insisting that their son 'is not a monster'. Other parts of Holmes's book deal with her feelings at each stage of discovering her son was responsible for the massacre. In an entry from Jan. 12, 2013 called Preliminary Hearing Memories, she wrote: 'What were you thinking, Jim? And what are you thinking now? Praying for Jim in jail; please don't commit suicide. 'You lived so that we could understand you and others could study you and learn to prevent future tragedy.' In another from March 22, 2013, titled Memories, she again defended her son. She wrote: 'My son never harmed anyone. People think he is a monster, but he has a disease that changed his brain. ... Praying for good men and women engulfed in psychosis and alone with their disease.' Mrs Holmes writes in the book that proceeds will be donated to mental health services, not to her son or his case. But victims' families have questioned the timing, as defense attorneys have asked a judge to move the proceedings, saying pretrial publicity has made many prospective jurors biased against Holmes. 'I can only think this is some kind of ploy. This is some type of strategy cooked up by the defense to try to save someone's life,' said Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex was killed in the shooting. 'Ploy': The father of victim Alex Sullivan, pictured, described Holmes's book as a 'strategy cooked up by the defense' Holmes' mother's thoughts and apologies mean little to him, he said. 'As far as people I think about on a daily basis, they are so far down the list it's not worth mentioning.' Neither Holmes' parents nor an attorney representing them immediately responded to requests for comment. Mrs Holmes said her son's defense team had no knowledge of the book. 'This book is being published to raise awareness of the immorality of the death penalty and the futility of seeking justice through execution,' she writes. A spokeswoman for District Attorney George Brauchler declined to comment on the book, citing a gag order that prevents those involved in the case from talking about it. But in court filings released Monday, prosecutors, arguing against a change in venue, wrote that the one thing jurors remembered most clearly so far was their sympathetic letter to the Denver Post.","Arlene Holmes, whose son James killed 12 in massacre, has spoken out .

"Katie Hopkins has been reported to police by Labour MP Simon Danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking Pakistani men to the Rochdale child sex abuse scandal . Outspoken former reality TV star Katie Hopkins has accused the Labour MP Simon Danczuk of reporting her to the police  to deflect attention from being 'caught watching porn'. Mr Danczuk said he had received death threats after asking Manchester Police Commissioner  Tony Lloyd to investigate whether Ms Hopkins had incited racial hatred in a series of tweets linking Pakistani men to the Rochdale child sex abuse scandal. Ms Hopkins sent the tweets after Mr Danczuk attended the raising of a Pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on March 23 to mark Pakistan's National Day. Ms Hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the MP tweeted a picture of himself at the event. In response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences, asking Mr Danczuk if they were his friends too. Mr Danczuk said the messages were 'inciting racial hatred'. He told LBC radio tonight that he had seen the police today and will do so again tomorrow and revealed he had received death threats as a result. Ms Hopkins sounded unconcerned and said she laughed when she heard Mr Danczuk had reported her to the police. She said she will stand up herself and 'defend the right of British people to have the Union flag flying'. She added that Mr Danczuk is 'wasting police time'. The businesswoman said Mr Danczuk was just covering up the fact that he had been 'caught watching porn' and because he has a wafer thin majority and 'needs the Pakistani vote'. It came after Mr Danczuk this weekend confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who 'live in the real world'. The husband of selfie-loving Karen Danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on Twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iPhone. However, the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe. He stressed he does not use porn regularly, but insisted: 'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do.' Mr Danczuk tonight dismissed Ms Hopkins' claim that he had only reported her to cover up his embarrassment. But Ms Hopkins said she stood by her comments saying: 'For me, in somewhere like Rochdale, you can't raise a Pakistani flag and talk about community cohesion in the same sentence.' 'If we look at why someone didn't call the police earlier when our white girls were being attacked by these gentlemen, if someone had called the police earlier then that would have been a good thing wouldn't it?' Hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after Mr Danczuk attended the raising of a Pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on March 23 to mark Pakistan's National Day . Mr Danczuk said Rochdale has faced up to the 'heinous crime' of child grooming 'in a way that's managed to keep our communities together'. He said: 'That's why Katie Hopkins' crass comments are not helpful. They are a clear attempt to divide communities, undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of Pakistani origin is a child abuser. 'To equate the Pakistan flag with child abuse, as she has done on social media over the last week, is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable. 'We have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and I'm not prepared to allow people like Hopkins, who know nothing about our town, to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists. 'As a result of her comments last week, I have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town. I am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group.' Earlier this week Ms Hopkins sparked outrage after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband – even though his Jewish parents fled from the Nazis. 'Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion,' she added in another. 'It is inflammatory. ‪@SimonDanczuk you & your party disgust me' She wrote: 'Are these your friends too ‪@SimonDanczuk? Is this why you are raising the Pakistani flag in Rochdale? 77 years inside' The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife   Justine  in a message on Friday. She tweeted: 'Pollsters say Justine is the least popular of party wives. He might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas.' The outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her 'vile' tweet, with one saying: 'You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.' She has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the Germanwings disaster. The TV pundit tweeted saying: 'Sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry. If you are suicidal, for goodness sake top yourself in private. Attention seeking b******s.' The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife Justine (pictured together) She followed this up with a number of tweets about depression, including: 'Most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation. Like being caught in torrential rain with a bag from Primark.' Meanwhile, Mr Danczuk confessed yesterday to watching pornography. The husband of selfie-loving Karen Danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on Twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iPhone. However, the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe.

"A mother has described her horror after an autistic teenager attacked her three-month-old baby son in his pram, leaving his face scratched and bloody. Janet-da-Silva, 30, a mother-of-two, said she was getting off a bus in Denaby Main, South Yorkshire, with her son Gabriel Jones and her mother when the attack took place last Wednesday. She said three men were walking towards her when suddenly one launched himself forward, clawing at Gabriel's face. Janet-da-Silva, 30, a mother-of-two, was climbing off a bus  when a teenager launched himself at her son Gabriel's pram, scratching at his face (pictured right with a scratch on his cheek and below his left eye) It later emerged that the 17-year-old was a pupil at a nearby special needs school who was out walking with two carers. Ms da-Silva said: 'He shoved both hands in and clawed Gabriel’s face. He could have blinded him. 'I screamed: “What the hell are you doing?” Then he stood up, looked at me and laughed. 'Gabriel was screaming out and I saw blood on his face and I started screaming. 'The other two men then grabbed the guy on either arm and stood him up against a wall. Neither of them said anything to me, I didn’t know who they were or where they were from. 'It happened so fast I didn’t have time to stop him.' Despite Ms da-Silva asking the men to stop, they turned their backs and walked away. It later emerged that the boy was a 17-year-old pupil with autism who studied at nearby Fullerton House School, and had been on a walk with two carers . She added: 'They wouldn’t listen to me or stop. One of them said: “We’ve got to get him away before he gets more angry and violent."" 'I kept asking them where they were going but no-one gave me any information.' Ms da-Silva left baby Gabriel to be comforted by grandmother Debbie Rojas Marinero and followed the men, eventually seeing them going into Fullerton House School. The institution caters from teenagers with learning difficulties. The pupil in question is said to have complex needs arising from his autism and has been at the school for some time. A spokesman for the school said that both carers have been suspended and an internal investigation is underway. The spokesman said: 'Due to the complexity of his disability he does not have the mental capacity to be charged.' Chris McSharry, chief executive of the Hesley Group which runs Fullerton House said: 'This is an incredibly unfortunate incident and my thoughts are with the baby and his family.' Ms da-Silva said she has been left afraid of going out with baby Gabriel following the attack, which took place last Wednesday (pictured, the road where the attack took place) However, Ms da-Silva said: 'I was disgusted by their attitude. I understand people need their freedom and sunshine but they knew the teenager was violent so why was he not walking within the school premises?' She has now been left scared to go out with Gabriel. 'It was the worst day of my life,' she added. 'It’s broken me. I pray Gabriel does not remember but unfortunately we will.' A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said they were aware of the incident and no arrests had been made. Any decision on a prosecution would rest with the Crown Prosecution Service.","Janet-da-Silva, 30, was getting off bus with three-month-old Gabriel Jones .

"They say nice guys finish last. Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage – at least when it comes to salaries. A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked. Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. A University of Sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues . Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic. The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap. Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study . 'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.' The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics. They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages. It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career. While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace. Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure.","Study found friendly staff receive lower wages than unpleasant colleagues .

"Before Nikki Reed starred in the $3.3 billion dollar Twilight franchise, the now-26-year-old actress was more of a regular at McDonalds than Nobu - and she wasn't exactly splurging on super-size meals. 'I grew up eating off the dollar menu at every fast food restaurant,' she told Yahoo Style. 'When you have a single mother that makes $15,000 a year for her two kids in a major city like Los Angeles, money runs out quickly.' If her mother could have afforded organic vegetables she would have bought them, Nikki says, adding that they simply didn't have the money to be healthy while she was growing up. Scroll down for video . Kids meals: Nikki Reed, 26, says her family couldn't afford to buy healthy food while she was growing up in LA, so she often ate off the dollar menu at fast food restuarants . That's why Nikki and her fiancé Ian Somerhalder, 36, who have been engaged since January, became involved with US-based Thrive Market, a 'socially conscious online store' that sells natural and organic products at wholesale prices. For every paid membership, the site offers a free one to a low-income family - and so far has signed up 650,000 members since November 2014. Nikki's upbringing also encouraged her to develop a love of animals; the big screen star often adopts pets from shelters, or adopts and fosters them with Ian and her mother. Whirlwind romance: Nikki and Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder got engaged in January after dating for six months . Full house: Nikki has joked that she has a farm in her house, including two horses, six dogs, and a cat . 'My mom deserves every bit of credit,' Nikki says. 'She basically takes in any and everything that has a heartbeat.' Nikki followed suit, fostering and adopting animals during the past decade, including dogs, cats, horses, and even rats. More recently, Nikki built a guest house on her LA property where her mom could live and help her take care of her many pets. The actress even testified at California’s State Capitol in early March in support of Assembly Bill 147, or the Research Animal Adoption Bill, which would help animals that have been tested on find homes.

While fans may be surprised that Nikki dedicates so much of her time to her furry friends, it's actually a lot closer to her initial career dreams than acting - her next film, The Sunday Horse, comes out later this year - producing - she has a new production company with Ian - and directing - her documentary Think Normal appeared on ESPN last year. 'I wanted to be a vet and take care of animals,' says the star, who made her acting debut as a teenager in the indie film Thirteen. 'I didn't ever think of myself as an actress.'","Nikki's mother raised her and her younger brother on $15,000 a year .

"Retirees are returning to work in their droves as many seek to boost their pension income, figures suggest. One in eight workers aged 65 to 74 were not in employment a decade earlier – either because they were retired, unemployed or caring for a loved one.

Tate's story first came to light when friends and family launched a MyCause fundraising campaign to help pay for Tate's care and more research into the condition, with Mrs Burley telling the Sunday Telegraph: 'We just want him to cry'. The campaign raised over $15,000 for the Brain Foundation which the family planned to partially use on a respiratory sleep machine and correct bedding and feeding apparatus.

'Granny and I watched Tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air, dropping saturations and an excessively weak heart rate, white with blue lips, eyes rolled in his head, body flopped,' she said. 'Today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things I cannot change for my son and except reality as it challenges me,' Ms Burley wrote on Saturday. 'No one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ...stand up, be an advocate for your child, don't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because I learnt today that I'm educated in what a palliative care patient is.' There is no cure for the condition and babies rarely live out their childhood .","Tate Burley was born with Miller Dieker Lissencephaly and died at 8 weeks .

"A derelict block of public toilets certainly doesn't jump to mind when thinking of your ideal holiday home - yet these crumbling conveniences on the Cornish coast could fetch a staggering £100,000, thanks to the stunning view. The 502 sq ft block, which looks out over St Austell Bay and its historic harbour, would make the perfect getaway for one lucky bidder, auctioneers have claimed. Of course, the toilets, in Charlestown, on the south coast, will need a revamp at least - if not completely rebuilding. Auction: This block of toilets on the south Cornish coast could fetch £100,000 last this month . Stunning: The view across St Austell Bay make it one of the best residential opportunities in Cornwall today, according to Graham Barton, auctioneer and regular on BBC One's Homes Under The Hammer . The block is being auctioned later this month and has a freehold guide price of £75,000 to £95,000 - a bargain in the small town, where the average property price is £260,400, according to property website Rightmove. Plymouth-based Graham Barton, auctioneer and regular on BBC One's Homes Under The Hammer, said: 'This is arguably the most gloriously located residential development opportunity for sale in Cornwall today. 'It has stunning panoramic and jaw dropping sea views. The property looks southwards across St Austell Bay with the historic harbour at its western edge. 'We are expecting strong interest at auction as there is huge potential for a fantastic family home or holiday home with extension or complete replacement among the options subject to planning consent.' The auction, by Clive Emson, will take place at the St Mellion International Resort, near Saltash, at 11am on Thursday, March 26.","The 502 sq ft block of toilets is going up for auction later this month .

"The Belgian Deputy Prime Minister has been accused of racism after blacking up his face during a charity event in Brussels. Foreign Minister Didier Reynders painted his face and dressed up as an '19th century African nobleman' as he joined charity organisation Les Noirauds (The Blacks) for a fundraising rally. The 56-year-old liberal politician later posted pictures of himself during the event on social media, captioned: 'The singing blacks'. Ciriticised: Belgium's Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Didier Reynders posted this picture of himself on Twitter after he appeared at a charity event dressed as a '19th century African nobleman' Reynders has since faced criticism from minority organisations and prominent Belgians of African descent, who have said the minister's behaviour was 'unacceptable'. Wouter Van Bellingen, the director of Minority Forum, called the Deputy PM's actions 'deplorable', adding that Belgium still lacks a national anti-racism plan, despite making a commitment to devise one 14 years ago. Peter Bouckaert, from Human Rights Watch, tweeted: 'Belgium FM @Dreynders I have question: will u wear #blackface outfit 2 next meeting with African leaders? Shame on you!'. Twitter user Olivier Wah added: 'Considering what Belgium did in The Congo, this sucks to the max, right? No shame?' 'In other civilised countries his political career wouldn't . survive this, but in Belgium he just continues,' said . Nigerian-born author Chika Unigwe. Under fire: Reynders has been criticised by minority organisations and prominent Belgians of African descent, who have called his actions 'unacceptable' Questionable actions: The liberal Deputy PM, pictured far right, captioned this image 'les noirauds en ballade', which rouchly translated means 'the singing blacks' Other users of the microblogging site called the Foreign Minister's actions 'racist' and 'disgusting'. Les Noirauds is an organisation under royal patronage founded in 1876, which collects money for children's charities. Members of Les Noirauds blacken their faces and dress in white top hats, ruffled collars, bright green trousers and stockings, emulating what they call #19th century African noblemen'. The group, accompanied by Reynders, appeared during a charity rally in Brussels last Saturday accompanied by a band dubbed the 'Conservatoire Africain' (African conservatory). Despite the criticism on Twitter, very little response has come from withing the Belgian political sphere, with even the left-leaning Green Party saying Les Noirauds were innocuous folklore. Reynders, who on his website stresses the importance of . Central Africa in Belgium's foreign policy, posted pictures of . himself with blackened face on his blog and Twitter, describing . how he collected funds for children's charities.

"Charged: Nykerion 'Kaca' Nealon, 17, has been arrested for killing an Iraqi neighbor last week . A 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of an Iraqi newlywed who was gunned down as he took pictures of his first snowfall just weeks after arriving in the U.S. Nykerion 'Kaca' Nealon has been charged with killing Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, who was shot outside his Dallas, Texas apartment block on March 4 as he played in the snow with his wife and brother-in-law. Earlier that evening, Nealon had been at his girlfriend's apartment in a neighboring complex when shots were fired on her building. Nealon and three friends went to look for the possible shooter, police said at a press conference on Friday. A witness told police that when they saw Al-Jumaili and his family outside their apartment block, Nealon raised his gun and fired. 'The witness stated he observed Nealon raise the rifle and he took cover behind some mailboxes,' said Dallas Police Major Jeff Cotner. 'The witness then heard one shot, followed by several more.' After the shooting, Nealon and his friends returned to his girlfriend's home and called police to report the earlier shooting on her apartment. Six days after the death, a witness went to the Richardson Police Department and gave them Nealon's nickname, 'Kaca', in connection to the crime. He voluntarily spoke to police and admitted that he had been at the scene of the shooting, but he blamed another member of the group for firing the shots. Torn apart: Ahmed Al-Jumaili (right) was shot dead just 20 days after arriving in the U.S., where he was reunited with his wife Zahara (right). He had saved up for more than a year to be able to join her . Found: Dallas Police Major Jeff Cotner, pictured next to Alia Salem of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Dallas, showed surveillance footage of Kealon at the scene of the crime on Friday . Thankful: Salem, standing beside the victim's emotional father-in-law Mohammed Altaae on Friday, thanked the police, the media and the community for their support and help in catching the alleged shooter . Police said evidence, including a distinguishable hat, pointed to him being the one carrying the firearm and ultimately firing the shots. A search of the apartment also yielded rifle cartridges that matched those at the scene. At the press conference on Friday, Major Cotner said they are continuing to investigate to see whether any charges should be brought against Nealon's friends. He added that the group did not know Al-Jumaili or his family. Al-Jumaili's father-in-law, Mohammed Altaae, also appeared at the press conference but was too emotional to speak. He could be seen wiping his eyes as Alia Salem of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Dallas thanked the police and the media for their help. Devastated: His father-in-law Mohammed Altaae wept as he described how the young couple had just wanted to start building their life together after more than a year apart and have children together . Widowed: His distraught wife Zahraa is pictured outside the Dallas apartment they shared with her family . 'I know that he is grateful,' she said of Mr Altaee. 'We are just humbled by the community outpouring. 'Our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this death... We just want to see justice happen here and this is the first step in that.' Al-Jumaili's death is all the more tragic because, fearing the rise of ISIS, he had fled Iraq just weeks earlier. Once in Texas, he was reunited with his wife Zahraa, whom had left Iraq a year earlier. Before he was able to join her, Al-Jumaili worked hard providing Internet connections to Iraqi homes so he could head to America, according to his father-in-law Mohammed Altaae, CBS reported. His wife had moved to the Dallas area to be near family members and her husband joined her just 20 days before he was murdered. He had a car and was looking for a job, his father-in-law said. 'For a young man and a young woman, oh God, so many dreams together,' Altaae told CBS. 'They wanted to have children and educate them well. It was the dreams of young people. Search: Police in Dallas released this security footage earlier this week as they looked for suspects . Investigation: Police said they are looking into whether they should bring charges against the other three . 'We're looking for safe place... What he got was a bullet in his heart.' Earlier this week, authorities released surveillance footage showing the four young men walking from the complex at the time of the shooting. No words were exchanged before the gunfire broke out. Salem explained in an account on Facebook that Al-Jumaili had taken cover behind a pickup truck when the men opened fire - but a bullet pierced the truck and struck him. Al-Jumaili was shot in the chest and ran towards the nearest building, where he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital, where he passed away the following day. 'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' A LaunchGood fundraising page explains Al-Jumaili and Zahara married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State. Refuge: Just weeks earlier, the couple had been reunited as Al-Jumaili joined his wife in the United States . Truck: Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest . The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees. The fundraiser has raised more than $30,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. North Texas Crime Stoppers offered a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. Salem said the Council on American-Islamic Relations raised an additional $7,000 reward for information to help in the investigation into the killing.

"A landlord has been caught selling dangerous 'screen-wash' spirits in fake Kommissar vodka bottles. Police found the knock-off bottles contained three toxic ingredients- any one of which would have forced the drinker to have to seek immediate medical attention. Sukhdev Singh Gill, who held licences for the Coach and Horses and Chaplains pubs in County Durham, has now handed over his drinks licence ahead of a criminal investigation. Sukhdev Singh Gill, who held a licence for the Coach and Horses in County Durham, has been caught selling dangerous 'screen-wash' spirits in fake Kommissar vodka bottles . Durham County Council's licensing committee heard the spirit contained potentially lethal iso-propanol, methanol and t-butanol. It also had an alcohol content of just 29 per cent - where vodka is expected to be around 40 per cent. Sergeant Tim Robson, of Durham Police, confirmed that officers and Trading Standards will carry out a full criminal investigation into the sale of the fake vodka which he described as 'screen wash' in his initial report. 'These are criminal offences. It is an indictable offence to sell any product that tells a lie about itself,' he said. Durham County Council's licensing committee heard the spirit contained potentially lethal iso-propanol, methanol and t-butanol, and had an alcohol content of just 29 per cent - where vodka is expected to be around 40 per cent . 'An interview will take place after this hearing, he has been away in India.' Methanol . Highly toxic and potentially lethal, methanol ingestion can cause blindness and death. Only a small amount is sufficient to produce acute damage to the central nervous system leading to permanent neurological dysfunction and irreversible blindness. Iso-propanol . Used in the manufacturing of resins, inks and acetone, iso-propanol can cause serious medical complications. When ingested, it can cause bradycardia- slowing of the heartbeat. In severe cases, this can lead to heart failure. It also affects the nervous system causing nausea and dizziness and if absorbed through the skin, can lead to extreme difficulties in breathing and eventual coma or death. T-butanol . Used a pesticide, t-butanol is a carcinogen and highly toxic. If ingested it can also cause neurological damage. He added that the style of label on the bottles had been out of use for around three years while the meeting heard that the labels did not have authenticity stamps. Councillor Edward Bell, vice-chairman of the licensing committee, said: 'Potentially someone is going to get killed by this gut rot.' Star Pubs and Bars - the firm that owns the Coach and Horses - is now planning to sell the venue to Amber Taverns who plan on investing up to £500,000 to make the venue into a 'community pub'. The firm said it will complete the purchase of the pub and, subject to planning, aims to have it revamped, up and running by July. The meeting heard how Gill, who did not attend the meeting, has no hand in running either premises. Andrew Cochrane, solicitor from Star Pubs and Bars, the company that owns the building, said: 'Mr Gill was the tenant and DPS (designated premises supervisor). 'Obviously it's immensely regrettable that Mr Gill has chosen to go down that line stocking vodka that was substandard and dangerous. 'I am aware as part of the investigations carried out that Mr Gill fell on his sword.' The application to revoke the licence for Chaplains was adjourned.","Sukhdev Singh Gill found selling fake vodka at  pubs in County Durham .

"Stripped of its skin, and showing every bone and sinew, this gory display of an elephant is part of the latest exhibition from the infamous Dr Gunther von Hagens. Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out, in which animal carcasses are preserved and displayed, opens today at Ambassador Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Created by plastinator Dr von Hagens and curator Dr. Angelina Whalley, the exhibition offers visitors an 'anatomical safari' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals. Scroll down for video . Samba the elephant, which at 3.2 tons and 6metres by 3.5 metres in size is the largest animal ever plastinated, is on display at the Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out exhibition . Some  have been given the full-body plastinate process, while a series of 'single specimens' offer preserved organs or even slices of animal. The graphic exhibition features Samba the elephant which, at 3.2 tons and a size of 6 by 3.5 metres, is the largest whole animal ever plastinated. Samba is joined by a gorilla packing 120 kilograms of muscle, watched on by its human close relative, as well as a giraffe, bear, shark and many more. 'It is fascinating to see the anatomical similarities of the vertebrates on the one hand, and how many different anatomical variations have formed on the other hand in response to an animal's living conditions—such as the elephant's trunk or the giraffe's long neck,' says the curator Dr. Angelina Whalley on the exhibition website. Step 1. Embalming and Anatomical Dissection He halts decay by pumping formalin into the body through the arteries. Using dissection tools, the skin, fatty and connective tissues are removed in order to prepare the individual anatomical structures. Steep 2. Removal of Body Fat and Water The body water and soluble fats are dissolved from the body by placing it into an acetone bath. Step 3. Forced Impregnation A reactive polymer - silicone rubber -  replaces the acetone. The specimen is immersed in a polymer solution and placed in vacuum chamber. The vacuum removes the acetone from the specimen and helps the polymer to penetrate every last cell. Step 4. Positioning After vacuum impregnation, the body is positioned as desired. Every single anatomical structure is properly aligned and fixed with the help of wires, needles, clamps, and foam blocks. Step 5. Curing (Hardening) The specimen is hardened with gas, light, or heat. Dissection and Plastination of an entire body requires about 1,500 working hours and normally takes about one year to complete . It aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals' insides, and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats. The exhibition uses plastination, a technique developed by German anatomist Dr von Hagens in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen. The process is used in anatomy to preserve bodies or body parts, by replacing water and fat with certain plastics, to create specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay. Plastination was originally used to preserve small specimens for medical study. It was only in the early 1990s that techniques were developed to plastinate whole body specimens. Each could take up to 1,500 person-hours to prepare. Plastination is now used at more than 40 medical and dental schools throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection. Von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993 which made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the Body Worlds public exhibitions, showing whole bodies, donated by willing donors, plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. More than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination. Past exhibitions have included a display in Barcelona, Spain which was mainly composed of plastinated Asian body parts and embryos. His most complex work so far is said to be the giraffe which appeared in 'Body Worlds 3 & The Story of the Heart'. The specimen took three years to complete – 10 times longer than a human. The current exhibition, which is at Ambassador Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was was made possible through cooperation with various veterinary programs and zoos with no animals harmed or killed for use. Student Kifah Ajamia looks at a horse's head, as nearly 100 anatomically dissected animals go on display at the Ambassador Theatre in Dublin . An intricate display shows a chicken's blood vessels and veins which have been preserved using a technique called plastination . But many of Dr von Hagens' exhibitions- dubbed Dr Tod (Dr Death) in Germany - have drawn criticism from religious groups. Members of the Catholic Church said that his displays of human remains is disrespectful. But that hasn't stopped museums and venues in cities across the world hosting Body Worlds, which has attracted more than 29 million visitors. The professor has continually courted controversy throughout his career and in 2005 in a four-part series on Channel 4 called Anatomy for Beginners, he dissected cadavers on live TV. He followed up in 2006 with Autopsy: Life and Death. His laboratory later angered German Christians when it began to offer body parts for sale online, including plastinated 'slices' of corpses including a human head. In 2011, he announced he was dying of Parkinson's disease and has said he wants his own body displayed in the same manner as his specimens when his time comes. Dr Gunther von Hagens at the opening of his plastinarium in Guben, Germany . Born in Poland in 1945, von Hagens was diagnosed with a rare bleeding disorder and almost died aged six. Aged 20, he entered the University of Jena medical school where he began to oppose the Communist system under which he lived. Attempting to flee to Austrian in 1969, he was imprisoned for two years. Aged 26, his freedom was bought by West Germany where he completed his medical studies and entered the field of pathology. In 1975, he began to experiment with the preservation of body parts using reactive polymers. He said: 'I wondered why the . plastic was poured and then cured around the specimens rather than . pushed into the cells, which would stabilise the specimens from within . and literally allow you to grasp it.' By 1982, von Hagens patented the plastination technique which has been adopted in laboratories across the world. In 1995, he premiered Body Worlds in Japan and the show has been seen by more than 28million people since, despite fierce opposition in some quarters.

"Blackberry is hoping that a luxury phone designed by Porsche could help it claw its way back inot the mobile phone market. The new Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite smartphone from BlackBerry boasts a hand wrapped leather battery case, 'glass-like' keys and even a personalised PIN so everyone know you own one. However, it also comes with a high price - around $2,000 . Scroll down for video . The new Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite smartphone from BlackBerry boasts a hand wrapped leather battery case, 'glass-like' keys and even a personalised PIN so everyone know you own one. Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. Then came a new generation of competing smartphones, and suddenly the BlackBerry looked ancient. Apple showed that phones can handle much more than email and phone calls. Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete. BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. 'This new member to the P'9983 family will provide exclusive graphite-metallic colored elements and the finest, hand-wrapped leather on the back door cover,' the firm boasts. 'This new Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite smartphone from BlackBerry will combine a unique stylish design from an iconic, timeless brand with the fluid and effortless productivity experience of BlackBerry 10 technology.' Porsche Design worked with BlackBerry to design the keyboard to use glass-like keys, blackened glass and a graphite stainless steel color frame. 'The iconic styling of the new P'9983 Graphite from BlackBerry is technically inspired with longevity, integrity, and individuality at its core,' says Roland Heiler, Chief Design Officer of the Porsche Design Group. 'And it will offer a new way to express individual style with the luxury of being one step ahead.' 'Finally, an exclusive Porsche Design PIN ID group - 2AAXXXXX, sets you apart and makes you instantly recognized among other Porsche Design users.' The firm also hopes a physical keyboard will help sales. The physical keyboard is something traditional BlackBerry users prefer because they find it easier than touch screens to type with. The company is also emphasizing battery life and security. 'A lot of people say the Classic is aiming for loyal customers. And that is true,' CEO John Chen said at the gadget's launch event, tellingly held in New York City's Financial District. But he also invited people who haven't used a BlackBerry 'especially people who are young,' to try the BlackBerry Classic. The handsets have a legion of loyal fans. 'I love a BlackBerry,' Kardashian West admitted to the Code Mobile conference earlier this year. 'Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don't understand that reaction.' 'BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I'll never get rid of it,' she said. 'I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.' The BlackBerry Classic iwas released earlier this year, bringing back the keyboard to Blackberrys handsets.","Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite from BlackBerry has physical keyboard .

"England's population is up 565,000 in the past three years because of a fresh influx of migrants, experts said yesterday. The migrant population in England is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years, research from the University of Oxford has revealed. Around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other EU countries, the study by the university's Migration Observatory said. Today the former head of the European Commission taunted David Cameron over this issue and said it was 'impossible' for Britain to reverse the trend. Scroll down for video . Picture of Britain: England's population is up 565,000 in three years just because migrants. Here is a regional picture of the total foreign population of England and the percentage it has risen in since 2011 . Jose Manuel Barroso said: ‘When you have 28 countries it will be impossible to say, let’s say, the French can come to Britain to work in the City but the Poles cannot come to Britain – this is not possible. This will be a violation of the principles of no discrimination. ‘Having said that, the European Union is very much aware that there is the abuse of social benefits. If you have not the means to be in the country, you cannot go there just to benefit from the social security. ‘But you have the right, if you are a citizen of a European country to go to another country to establish there.’ Poland is trying to call its skilled workers home from Britain. Ambassador Witold Sobkow said it cannot afford to lose its best young people and wants to persuade them to return. The Polish authorities also hope EU freedom of movement rules will encourage other Europeans to look for jobs in the country, boosting its economy. Mr Sobkow said efforts were under way to bring back some of the millions of young Poles who left for Britain and after Poland joined the EU in 2004. He told BBC Radio Four: ‘We have a special programme called Returns and the government is trying to attract these people back home. ‘We are worried that we may lose some well-educated people, and also skilled workers, because we need them.’ But he added: ‘We have other nationalities in Poland ... so this is a kind of free movement of brains.’ Plea: Witold Sobkow . He said as long as the principle of freedom of movement is not called into question, a deal can be reached to restrict migrants’ benefits. The majority moved to London and the south-east but the north-east and Yorkshire and Humber saw the biggest percentage increases, figures show. Every council area of England has seen an increased migrant population, it was said. Researchers, who stressed that the numbers are estimates, said the projections give a more up-to-date picture of the migrant populations across England than the 2011 census. It came as the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that rising number of migrants has led to council services spending by being cut in half - and those with highest migration numbers were hit hardest. Official estimates on population are expected in June from the Office for National Statistics. The greatest increase in the number of foreign-born residents has been in the capital. Almost 200,000 more migrants were estimated to live in London last year, compared to 2011. The South East saw the second-highest rise of 79,000, while the smallest increase was in the North East where an extra 26,000 migrants are thought to have arrived since 2011. Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory, said the study was done to provide more insight ahead of the general election. 'These data show how different local experiences of migration have been across the UK,' she said. 'There are large variations in the size of migrant populations, as well as the share that come from EU countries. Figures: The study shows how all regions have seen thousands more migrants from within the EU since 2011 . Embarrassing: Despite pledges from David Cameron thousands of migrants from outside the EU also came to England . 'We have undertaken this analysis to provide a resource for anyone looking to understand local demographics of migration in the run-up to the general election.' The news piles more pressure on David Cameron, whose promise to curb immigration has been shattered, . Last week it emerged annual net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – has reached nearly 300,000 - a record. When he took power in 2010 Mr Cameron pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000. A total of 624,000 people migrated to Britain in the 12 months up to last September while 327,000 left. The inflow is up 94,000 on the year before. Official figures: Last year 300,000 migrants arrived in Britain, with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the EU . Net migration from the EU hit 162,000 in the year ending September 2014, up from 130,000 in the previous year . A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months .","New Oxford research reveals every region has seen increase in migrants .

"This is the moment a fugitive DUI killer prepared to face justice - by topping up her lip gloss. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, admitted drunkenly smashing her car into a truck being driven by Donald Goodwin, 57, killing him instantly - but dodged her prison sentence by fleeing to Thailand. She had pleaded guilty to a charge on vehicular homicide following the 2004 crash in Hoover, Alabama - but flew to the tropical country while on bail, and had been hiding there until Thai authorities tracked her down. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Miller was hauled in front of the media by police in Phuket this week.  But rather than showing contrition in front of the cameras, she took a moment to put her make-up in order. Local outlet Phuket News pictured her looking nonchalant and resting her head on her hands at the event. According to members of the grief-stricken Goodwin family, the apparent lack of concern for her crime is typical of Miller. The victim's sister, Faye Dees, told Daily Mail Online that she 'didn't seem too concerned' for her slain brother - even moments after she killed him. During her trial, Dees said, she continued to act as if 'she didn't understand what the big deal was', even when family members confronted her directly. Miller was busted after years of island-hopping in remote parts of Thailand, where she traveled around on an expired visa. Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . Extradition: Miller is due to be brought back to the United States to face justice, after she appears in Thai court on charges of living in the country illegally . Although she entered the country legally, Miller should have returned to the U.S. to start her jail sentence. During her illicit stay, she even gave birth to a son, whose father is thought to be an American living in Thailand legally. It is not clear whether he knew about Miller's conviction. She is expected to appear in a Thai court for staying in the country without proper documents - and is then likely to be deported to face U.S. justice. A spokesman for the Thai Tourist Police said: 'She flew to Thailand legally after she was granted bail in her car smash case. 'A few months after she disappeared, the U.S. canceled her passport but she had already thrown it away, and had been moving around Thailand a lot.' The authority vowed to tighten its procedures to stop people using Thailand as a bolthole from justice in future. Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Authorities say they were tipped off last month about Miller, who was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. She is thought to have been surviving on money wired to her by family. According to AL.com, Goodwin was killed shortly after pulling over had pulled over onto an emergency lane of the highway to check the tires on his tractor-trailer. Miller side-swiped the vehicle moments later in the fatal collision, which took place not long after midnight. She was arrested  on DUI charges but released the next day after posting $1,000 bond. In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond. Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison - but never showed up for her sentence. Family members said that, had Goodwin lived, he would have retired in 2009 and planned to work on a small piece of land he had bought.","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was busted on remote island after hiding from justice .

"The number of British and Irish holidaymakers taking cruises fell by almost 80,000 last year – the first annual drop for a decade, according to industry figures. Cruise Lines International Association data showed bookings fell 4.8 per cent, from 1.72million to 1.64million. Such holidays survived and even thrived during the economic downturn as a greater variety of destinations became available. Rule Britannia: Her Majesty the Queen christened Britain’s largest cruise liner last week as figures show cruises were less popular with British tourists last year . But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost. Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola. The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise. That may change this year with the launch of several routes from ports like Southampton, including the massive liner Britannia christened by The Queen last week. The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year. Closer to home: Cruise bosses hope the launch of the Britannia, pictured, will lead to a spike in Brits booking cruises after figures from last year showed a dip in popularity . Overall, the number of Europeans taking a cruise rose by 0.5 per cent to 6.39 million passengers last year said the CLIA report, so Britain's fall bucked an overall trend. Andy Harmer, of CLIA, told website TravelMole: 'The UK and Ireland continue to have one of Europe's highest rates of market penetration for cruise holidays. 'We're confident that the future prospects continue to be bright.' CLIA Europe chairman . 'We're confident that the future prospects continue to be bright.' CLIA Europe chairman Pierfrancesco Vago said the European rise was the most significant statistic. He said: 'This may sound like a small achievement, but if we consider the European economic climate, we can see that this is an extraordinary result, and continues our industry's trend of steady growth year-on-year. 'While Europe is struggling to recover from the economic crisis, our industry has continued to grow.

"A Detroit woman charged with child abuse after the bodies of two of her children were found in her home freezer was ordered to stay in jail Thursday, unless she can post a $1 million bond. Mitchelle Blair, 35, appeared in court via video feed from police lockup for her arraignment today and entered a plea of not guilty. In setting the high bond, 36th District Court Magistrate Renee McDuffee said 'the charges in this matter are so heinous', while the prosecution said Blair could face two counts of first-degree murders once an autopsy determines how they died. The children, Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry died, are believed to have been 13 and 9, respectively, when they died. Investigators suspect the children died up to two years ago. Held: Mitchelle Blair, 35, appears via video link from police lockup Thursday for her arraignment. She entered a plea of not guilty for charges of child abuse after the bodies of two of her children were found in her freezer . Mother: Mitchelle Blair, seen here in a photo from her Facebook, has been charged with five counts of child abuse. The bodies of two of her children were allegedly found in her chest freezer on Tuesday . Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Police sources allege Blair killed the girl a year ago and put her body in the freezer . Scene: Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her son, Stephen Gage Berry . Investigation: Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Police are seen at the low-income apartment complex near downtown Detroit on Tuesday . Police sources told The Detroit News earlier this week that Blair confessed to killing the two, after reportedly discovering they had been molesting a younger relative. Blair allegedly killed her son two years ago and then her daughter in 2014 after learning of the abuse. According to WXYZ, she strangled her son and tortured her daughter. She has been ordered not to have any contact with her two surviving children - a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy - who have been placed in protective custody. Blair and the children were living in a nearby apartment when an eviction crew arrived her apartment on Tuesday near downtown Detroit. It was then officers discovered the bodies buried deep in the chest freezer by the front door, according to reports. The children's bodies were still thawing Thursday and the medical examiner was planning to conduct the autopsies on them Friday. Blair faces an April 2 probable cause hearing and April 9 preliminary examination. So far she  has been charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. Neighbors said they hadn't seen the dead children in about a year. None of the four children was enrolled in Detroit schools, and friends said their mother was home-schooling them.

'Heaven is where you belond': Teddy bears and notes are left at the town home in Detroit on Wednesday, a day after the bodies of two children were found in the freezer inside . Under state law, Michigan parents have the right to homeschool their children. The state was not notified that Blair's children were being homeschooled this year, but such registration is voluntary. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. Despite her money and other problems, friends call her a good mother. Blair is known throughout the complex of low-income townhomes as 'Angel'. But neighbors rarely saw the four children outdoors. In announcing the charges against Blair, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said 'the alleged facts in this case present examples of why we must all be diligent and involved citizens.' Online: Blair posted this photo  in January . Bailiffs first found the girl's body in the chest freezer while entering the apartment to serve the eviction. They then called police, who discovering the boy's body. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News. Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. On January 30, the posted a photo with the message: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Blair filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. She then filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. Her brother Marlon Blair told the Detroit News earlier this week: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told the Detroit News: 'This is a terrible situation.' No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house.

"The bitter battle between Lady Gaga and the 'Svengali' ex-boyfriend who started her out on the path to superstardom has spilled out in a fight over her testimony which helped a friend win a whopping $7.3 million judgment. Rob Fusari says he now wants another trial in a case in which he was trying to prevent talent scout Wendy Starland from taking the multi-million dollar cut of the profits he made from Gaga . He claims Gaga's 'highly inflammatory' words made jury members hate him so much they didn't take the rest of the evidence into account. Fusari, 47, maintains the judge in a New Jersey federal court should never have admitted 28-year-old Gaga's deposition - especially the parts where her words made him look so bad that, he claims, the jury ignored the facts of the case. 'Svengali': Ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari started Lady Gaga on the path to superstardom - and even came up with her name. The animosity has spilled out in a fight over her court testimony which helped Wendy Starland win a whopping $7.3 million judgment . Conflict of interest: Gaga and Fusari reportedly became lovers in 2006 when Gaga was 20 and Fusari was 38. Their personal relationship ended within seven months and their business relationship soon followed suit . Blame game: Fusari says he now wants another trial in a case in which he was trying to prevent talent scout Wendy Starland from taking the multi-million dollar cut of the profits he made from Gaga . 'This court erred and the error was exceptionally prejudicial,' Fusari - also known as 8Bit - said in court documents filed this month. 'A new trial on all issues is the only remedy.' Papers released by the court black out most of Gaga's testimony — given under her real name Stefani Germanotta — so it is unclear exactly what she said. But court papers acknowledge: 'They had a personal relationship and it went sour.’ Gaga and Fusari reportedly became lovers in 2006 when Gaga was 20 and Fusari, at 38, was nearly twice her age. Around that time, Gaga claimed to Howard Stern in a radio interview last year, she was raped by a much older man, although she has never identified her alleged attacker. Lady Gaga explained to Stern that she wrote the song Swine about sexual violence. 'The song is about rape, the song is about demoralization, the song is about rage and fury and passion - and I had a lot of pain that I wanted to release,' she said. The singer told Stern that she had not previously revealed the assault because she did not want 'to be defined by it.' Her personal relationship with Fusari ended within seven months and their business relationship soon followed suit. 'We had our time, and like anything in life, nothing good lasts forever,' Fusari said in a 2012 interview. By 2010 when Gaga's career was really taking off, Fusari was asked by Billboard if the two were still friends. 'I don't know,' he replied. 'I feel like I may have been demoted to…what would be one level beneath friend?' 'Professional acquaintance,' suggested interviewer Craig Marks. 'Yeah, there you go. That's it,' said Fusari. Fusari and Gaga have been involved in bitter court battles for years over her fortune. He initially wanted $30.5 million claiming he received none of the 20% he should have received for songs such as 'Paparazzi' that he is credited as co-writing. In September 2010 they came to a private agreement. Poker face: The latest court battle with Starland - who wants half of the money Fusari made from his connection with Lady Gaga - has reignited the animosity between the Poker Face singer and the man who helped write much of her first album, The Fame . Talent scout: Gaga's career took off after Fusari asked Wendy Starland (above) to find him 'the female equivalent' to Julian Casablancas, lead singer of The Strokes . Rolling Stone magazine has described him as her 'Svengali.' Gaga's career took off after Fusari asked Starland to find him 'the female equivalent' to Julian Casablancas, lead singer of The Strokes. Starland discovered then-teenager Germanotta fronting the SGBand, playing in small clubs in New York and Fusari says he immediately knew she had the potential to become a huge star. Fusari, who had previously worked on hits for Destiny's Child, Beyonce, Whitney Houston and Will Smith, says Germanotta traveled virtually daily from New York to his studio in Newark, New Jersey and they started dating within two months, despite the age difference. He claims that he came up with her stage name when he misspelled a text he sent her about the 1984 Queen hit 'Radio Ga Ga' and his phone's autocorrect changed Radio to Lady. The future megastar, who was looking for a catchy stagename, is said to have texted back: 'That's it. Don't ever call me Stefani again. Now the latest court battle with Starland  - who wants half of the money Fusari made from his connection with Lady Gaga  -  has reignited the animosity between the Poker Face singer and the man who helped write much of her first album, The Fame. Gaga said in her deposition that she believed Fusari and Starland planned to split money they earned from her career down the middle. 'My understanding was that Wendy and him had initially agreed upon 50/50 perhaps before Wendy ever found me,' she said. Motion: Fusari is demanding a new trial as he believes the testimony given by Lady Gaga about him was highly prejudicial . Fusari charges that Starland used Gaga's testimony to impugn him . What else did Gaga testify? Court papers are blacked out in the most intriguing place . 'After I was signed to Rob and made music Rob began to change his mind. 'Rob told me himself. Wendy told me herself,' Gaga, 28, continued. 'They both spoke of the deal – agreement – in front of me.' But in the new papers, Fusari said the superstar's testimony should never have been allowed. Before the case with Starland even started Fusari tried to stop Gaga testifying, saying she had previously made statements that 'impermissably [sic] attack Fusari's character in general.' And he said the jury would be starstruck by her presence. 'It will be impossible to find even one potential juror who is unaware of the star,' he said, saying they were all likely to be influenced by her presence in court. Rob Fusari aka 8Bit of Cary Nokey performs at Tipitina's on October 22, 2014 in New Orleans . In her deposition, Gaga said her first deal with Fusari, 45, had him taking half of all her future earnings. She called the contract 'very one-sided and very daunting and concerting for a young female artist.' 'I really wanted to move forward with my music career,' she added. 'But I remember I was advised very early that the terms of the agreement were not normal. She said she was offered other deals but Fusari used 'many inappropriate words to threaten her. 'He dangled the paperwork in front of me until he got me signed. 'I believe that Rob led Wendy to believe that he would include her in the development of my career but had no intention of doing so,' she added.","Ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari started Stefani Germanotta, aka Gaga, on the path to superstardom .

"English raspberries have made what is thought to be their earliest-ever appearance on supermarket shelves after the sunniest winter on record. Waitrose will stock the Chichester glasshouse-grown Diamond Jubilee berries from today, claiming it is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March. The berries are grown in glasshouses by Harry Hall, who supplied the supermarket with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month. The early delivery is thanks to the weather this winter, which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929 . Laurence Olins, of industry body British Summer Fruits, said: 'This is probably the earliest we've seen English raspberries.' Waitrose raspberry buyer Nicki Baggott said: 'It's incredibly unusual to have these ready in March, but a combination of growing techniques and perfect weather means we can sell these juicy delights earlier than ever.' Just 200kg of the berries are expected this week, but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards.

"Detectives investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence have released new CCTV footage which shows two people walking near her home on the evening she vanished. Police believe the footage - recorded just one hour before she spoke with her parents for the last time - could 'hold the key' to unlocking the six-year-old mystery. This afternoon, on the sixth anniversary of the chef's disappearance, the previously unseen clip was broadcast on a giant screen near Miss Lawrence's house in York. In a determined attempt to locate the two murky figures seen on camera, officers have marked the footage with the words 'Is this you?' and 'who is this?'. Police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence have released CCTV footage showing two people walking near her home on the night she vanished. The first man is seen walking near the rear of her home . One minute later, the man, who is carrying a bag, comes into view again. He stops as a second man walks past before carrying on to Heworth Place, from where the back of Miss Lawrence's home could be accessed . The university chef, 35, was last seen on Wednesday March 18, 2009 and reported missing by her father two days later, when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at York University. Police believe she was murdered. The new CCTV footage, taken at about 7.15pm, shows a tall man walking down Heworth Place, which leads to the rear of Miss Lawrence's house. The person then returns just over a minute later, with what appears to be a bag over their shoulder. The same figure is then seen stopping in the glare of the streetlight, as someone else walks past. He then continues onto Heworth Place, in the same direction as the second man. The five-minute footage, taken from a security camera on student flats, focuses on the area near the alleyway at the back of Miss Lawrence's terraced house. That area was searched by police last month and is said to be of 'growing significance' to the investigation. The footage was filmed at 7.15pm on Wednesday 18 March 2009, an hour before Miss Lawrence, 35, spoke to her parents on the phone. for the final time . The footage, taken from a security camera on nearby student flats, shows a second man walking nearby . North Yorkshire Police is now appealing to residents for help in identifying the people seen in the footage. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The footage shows two people who we need to identify.' He continued: 'Of particular interest to the investigation team is the person who is seen walking down Heworth Place which leads to the back of Claudia's house. The university chef was last seen six years ago. Police believe she has been murdered . 'The person goes out of camera shot but reappears just over a minute later. They appear to be carrying a bag over their shoulder. 'As the person heads back towards Heworth Road they suddenly stop when another unknown person walks past. 'Who is this? Do they live locally? What were they doing? 'If you can help to identify either person, please contact us as soon as possible. We are waiting to hear from you.' Yesterday, the detective said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013. He said the team may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months. He warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward - or risk arrest. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef. The original probe is thought to have worked on the theory Claudia was attacked on her way to work early on the 19th. But the new team believe she may have let someone into her home, who then escaped through the alley. A number of new searches have been carried out since 2013, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's house in Heworth, York, and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. The previously unseen footage was broadcast this afternoon on a giant screen near Ms Lawrence's house in York in in a bid to try and obtain further clues about the missing chef . The footage shows an area near an alleyway at the rear of Miss Lawrence's terraced house, which was searched by police last month and is said to be of 'growing significance' to the investigation . Police leafleted the area around Miss Lawrence's home earlier this week to encourage residents to attend Heworth Place to watch the footage on the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Speaking in York, Miss Lawrence's father, Peter, said: 'This clearly shows someone who is very distinctive. 'Whoever it is is very tall. If it's not a man then it's an extremely tall woman. They're acting very strangely, but it could be completely innocent. 'I only hope that whoever it is comes forward and speaks to the police. I think this person could hold the key to finding out what happened that night. Police believe Miss Lawrence - seen on CCTV on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered . 'Even though this footage was taken earlier on in the evening before I spoke to her on the phone, it doesn't mean it's not someone involved in Claudia's disappearance, or someone who may know something vital. The map showing Miss Lawrence's usual route to work. She did not turn up for her shift . 'The whole purpose of releasing it is to find who was in the area that night and interview them.' Mr Lawrence added: 'If anything, this CCTV shows that the investigation is still very much active and that police are getting the public to look and say something. 'Everything is another step forward to finding out what happened. 'This person in the footage may still be walking around unaware they're part of a major investigation, so as I've said consistently for the past six years anyone who knows anything or was in the area that night should just come forward. 'The fact that this new police team are very experienced has given us more confidence than ever. 'But the fact that anyone might be hampering the investigation by staying silent is just dreadful.' He said: 'To have had six years without her company, without her chat, her smile, her laugh, meeting her for a drink, days out and meals out - it tells. I just miss that companionship, that love so much that it just really hurts so much. 'It galls me that someone out there knows what happened Claudia but has not said anything.' He added: 'Six years on, it does not get any better. All we can hope is that we find out what happened to Claudia. If she was murdered, as the police believe, then I want to be able to bury her. 'As I have been saying for six years, it's the not knowing that makes it worse and it means that the family just cannot move on at all.'","CCTV taken on March 18, 2009, an hour before she last spoke to parents .

"A Comic Relief fundraiser sparked a large-scale police alert when he was seen walking along a busy road in full camouflage carrying a 'large rifle'. Armed police, a helicopter and patrol cars were called to the Whitefriars area of Norwich after members of the public raised the alarm this morning. But officers have now revealed that the man, who lives locally, was just on his way to a fundraising event in a costume complete with a toy AK47. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks said the man surrendered the 'weapon' and was 'apologetic and very embarrassed'. Armed police are hunting a 'gunman' in full camouflage clothing seen walking through a busy city centre . 'As a result of the media attention we had a phone call come in saying they thought they had identified the man,' he said. 'We went to see him at 2pm and he was very apologetic and very embarrassed. Two of our officers offered him some strong words of advice. 'He surrendered the weapon which was an imitation firearm. It was a plastic model AK47 which he had painted himself to make it more realistic. 'What he has been told and what we would tell other people is that anybody who wants to do something out of the ordinary should think about it first. 'Obviously when you have dressed yourself like that you know what your motives are but clearly some people this morning were not and they rightly called the police. 'We were relatively certain that it would be something around the fundraising issue but we couldn't be sure so we responded with our armed unit, our dog unit and a helicopter.' There have been no sightings of the man since officers responded to a number of calls this morning . 'This is the second similar high profile incident which has taken place in the last month. 'We would like to remind people to think carefully about the consequences of carrying imitation weapons and of their general appearance which, as in this case, could be misconstrued by other members of the public.' No offences were committed, but the man was visited by officers and has been given strong words of advice about the  consequences of his actions. Officers were called to the Whitefriars area of Norwich - near the city's law courts - at about 8.30am today and a helicopter was  deployed to help with the search. A taxi driver, who captured video of the 'gunman', said: 'I saw a man in the full combat clothing carrying a rifle in his right hand. 'I wasn't sure if it was an imitation but I thought it was a bit strange.' Eliza O'Hara tweeted: 'Arrive at work to find the area surrounded by police with guns and a helicopter circling.' John M Hayes ‏tweeted: 'Our Norwich Office was surrounded by armed police and helicopters, thankfully none of the team was wearing camouflage.' Police mounted a full-scale search operation in Norwich on February 18 when a teenager was spotted waving around a machete. It turned out he was a second-year media student participating in a film project - and was actually waving a toy sword. Do you know the charity fundraiser?

"Lara Bingle has reportedly given birth to her first child with actor Sam Worthington. According to Woman's Day magazine, the model welcomed a baby boy at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. The 27-year-old's publicist declined to comment on the report when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. There is no word yet on what the celebrity couple have called the bub. Big day: Woman's Day magazine has reported that Lara Bingle has given birth to a baby boy at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles . Lara has recently been seen spending time with Sam in California ahead of the big day, her blossoming baby bump on show. The reports come after the polarising beauty all but confirmed her marriage to Worthington via her blog website, The Base By Lara Bingle on Tuesday. Writing about a new range of makeup brushes she was road-testing, she wrote: 'My husband is extremely happy because the bathroom now has the beginnings of order!' Her pregnancy was heavily speculated for months, beginning in October when she was spotted shopping for baby clothes in West Hollywood. Around the same time, the former reality TV starlet aroused more suspicion while promoting skincare line The Base - as she would make her public appearances wearing outfits that kept her tummy covered. It's time: Lara has recently been seen shopping for the impending arrival in California, her blossoming baby bump on show . Origin: Her pregnancy was heavily speculated for months, also fueled by the tummy-obscuring outfits she wore while promoting her The Base skincare line . Lara's pregnancy was confirmed in late January when the beach babe showed off her baby bump for the first time in a white T-shirt while holidaying in Palm Springs. Meanwhile, rumours have separately been swirling of a marriage between the beautiful blonde and Avatar star Sam. The speculation was directly sparked by the entrepreneur, who in late December changed her Instagram name to Lara Bingle Worthington. She rang in the New Year at the gorgeous Maldive Islands, leading to ideas that the vacation served as the couple's honeymoon, and throughout the month visited Istanbul, Budapest and Switzerland. In November she foreshadowed her cryptic social media activities, opening up on her thoughts of Twitter and Instagram to Marie Claire and explaining: . 'I think there's no mystery anymore. Everyone knows everything...sometimes it's nice to not know things.' Showing: Lara's pregnancy was confirmed in late January when she showed off her baby bump for the first time in a white T-shirt . Rumour mill: Meanwhile, rumours have separately been swirling regarding a marriage between the beautiful blonde and Avatar star Sam . Everything appeared to be business as usual for Lara on Sunday, who posted a pretty shot of a beach in Los Angeles to her Instagram account. She and Sam have been dating since 2013, and early last year she relocated from Sydney to New York with the Hollywood action star.

"A bridesmaid hanged herself just hours after her sister's wedding, an inquest has heard. Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fiancé Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with. 'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died. 'On the 8th of November 2013 Boo's sister was married. Boo had played a major role in planning the hen do, which albeit stressful, seems to have gone very well. 'I heard that during the course of the wedding in the main Boo was her usual bubbly, lively self and that she, as her father told me, had been the 'life and soul of the party.' 'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.' He ruled out a verdict of suicide, as he could not find any clear intention, such as leaving a suicide note and Rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days. 'Consequently I conclude Rebecca died from self-inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear,' he said.

"The baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped inside a chicken cage has met another ape for the very first time. Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when a British  charity discovered him in Borneo. After making a remarkable recovery, an new astonishing video shows him interacting - and playing with - an equally adorable baby orangutan called Jemmi. They have both been raised by workers at International Animal Rescue - the charity who care for them - hope their friendship means they will become less dependent on 'human babysitters'. First encounter: Budi (right) - the baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped in a cage - has met another ape for the very first time . Playtime: Budi (top) was much more shy than his new friend Jemmi (bottom) who curiously inspected the rescued orangutan . New friends: After spending ten months caged and alone, a new video shows Budi (left) joyfully playing with another primate . Reaching out: International Animal Rescue - the charity that saved Budi (bottom) - hope his friendship with Jemmi will mean they both become less dependent on humans . Recovery: Budi (top) was too weak to even open his mouth when they discovered him inside a chicken cage in December, but he is now strong enough to swing and play . Momentous: The charity's chief executive said the 'first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies' The video released by charity International Animal Rescue captures Budi and Jemmi's incredible first encounter and shows them curiously inspecting each other before exploring their surroundings. Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never  given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent. But the wonderful new footage shows his transformation from that frail and helpless baby into an inquisitive animal who is now strong enough to swing from trees. He looks visibly shy when he first meets new playmate, who looks delighted to have a new friend and reaches out to touch him. Eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet. Despite Budi's initial hesitation, it's not long before the two are climbing the hammock together and a 'bond of friendship is beginning to form between them'. The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Alan Knight said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.' Tough start: Budi's new playmate Jemmi (right) was orphaned when his mother was killed - and then illegally sold as a pet . Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Healthy: Now the baby orangutan is strong enough to support his own wait - and even swing and play . First impressions: Budi was very shy when he first met his new companion Jemmi (pictured), who confidently inspected his fellow primate . Confident: Although Budi is initially quite shy, his new friend Jemmi (pictured) curiously inspects him and coaxes him to play . Despite Budi's initial hesitation, it's not long before the two are climbing the hammock together and a 'bond of friendship is beginning to form between them' Freedom: The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day . Neglect: Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent . 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' Budi was in a critical condition when International Animal Rescue found him in Indonesia in December and immediately took him to their orangutan rehabilitation centre. At just over one year old, he should have been able to climb and swing but the helpless baby was too weak to even open his mouth. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Recent videos released by the charity showed Budi drinking from a bottle unaided, eating pureed food from a spoon and doing some physical therapy. In another video he is shown fast asleep, exhausted after his physical exertions. The baby orangutan become an internet sensation after his story was first told by MailOnline. Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo . Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . Release: International Animal Rescue's chief executive said: 'They will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'","Baby orangutan Budi was too weak to move when he was rescued in January .

"Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell has publicly attacked Labour candidates turning down donations from Tony Blair - and warned they should prepare for another Tory government. Two candidates have already rejected Mr Blair after he offered 106 key battleground seats £1,000 each to fight the election. The former Prime Minister said the swing constituencies were 'where the election will be won for Labour'. Mr Campbell this morning accused the candidates of being 'attention seeking' and questioned whether they wanted to win. Alastair Campbell has slammed Labour candidates turning down a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair . Writing on Twitter he said: 'To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?' The message sparked an angry backlash from Labour activists who said they were glad candidates were rejecting the money. But Mr Campbell hit back, warning they should 'enjoy another Tory government then'. Mr Campbell's remarks came after Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan said her constituency would not be accepting the money. Writing on Twitter she said: 'Received donation from Tony Blair. Instinct was to not accept. Discussed with team. Dundee East is not accepting the £1000.' Northampton candidate Sally Keeble has also turned down the money. She said: 'The £1,000 donations are being offered to key seats – of which we were one. I have emailed them back to say we won't be accepting.' Former minister Sally Keeble (left) and the Labour candidate in Dundee Lesley Brennan (right) have rejected Mr Blair's donation . Mr Campbell became embroiled in an online row with Labour activists over Mr Blair's donation . When the donation was announced last week a Labour spokesman said the party was 'delighted' that Mr Blair had put his own money behind the effort to get Ed Miliband into Downing Street. In a letter to the 106 candidates Mr Blair said: 'As the final countdown to the general election begins, I am writing to wish you every success in your efforts to be elected and also to make a donation to your campaign. 'I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital.' He added: 'This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns. 'As one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government. 'So, good luck and here's to a Labour victory on May 7.' Mr Blair is in a position to donate £100,000 after making a fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007. Leaked documents published yesterday revealed how he proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy.","Tony Blair has donated more than £100,000 to help Labour campaign .

"A new technique that involves folding the stomach into pleats is being tested as a potentially less risky form of weight-loss surgery. It involves no incisions, the entire procedure can be done via a tube passed down the throat and the patient can go home the same day. Weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is available on the NHS to those who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of over 40 — or to those who have a BMI of 35 to 40, but whose weight is causing a serious, obesity-related health complaint, such as type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . The new surgery does not require any incisions to be made and involves folding the stomach into pleats, shrinking it and preventing it expanding to accommodate food . Thousands already have the surgery each year and, recently, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence proposed that those newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who have a BMI of 30 or above should be considered for it, too. Currently, the procedures most often performed involve using a gastric band that reduces the stomach size, so less food is needed to make you feel full, or a gastric bypass. This involves re-routing the stomach to join a lower section of the intestines, reducing the size of the stomach and bypassing part of the small intestine, cutting the amount of calories and nutrients absorbed. The other option is a sleeve gastrectomy, involving removal of part of the stomach. However, these all involve incisions in the abdomen, which carries risk of infection (affecting around one in 20), blood clots in the legs or lungs and internal bleeding, each of which affects around one in 100. Patients also need to stay in hospital for a least a night, if not longer. The new technique, called Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal, is less invasive and, researchers say, causes less post-operative pain, has reduced risk of infection and leaves no external scars. The surgeon works through a tube or endoscope, which goes down the throat into the stomach. Once in place, it is used to gather up the stomach wall and lining. A stitch is pushed through the gathered tissue and ‘anchors’ placed on either side to hold the fold in place. The process is repeated, making several folds to shrink the stomach and prevent it expanding to accommodate food. The technique has already been tested in small trials in Europe. In a Spanish study, 22 patients reported feeling full faster after the procedure and, after a year, had lost an average 62 per cent of their excess weight. Most returned to work without bandages or signs of surgery within two to three days, unlike traditional bariatric surgery, where it can take weeks or months to resume normal activities. In a Spanish study, most of the patients returned to work without bandages or any signs of having had the surgery within two to three days (file image) Around 300 people are now taking part in a new trial to further test its efficacy at a number of centres in the U.S. — the treatment is already approved for UK use. Dr Thomas Lavin, of The Surgical Specialists of Louisiana, who is leading the new trial, says: ‘It could mean tens of thousands of patients may have an incredibly compelling new option to consider if they’ve struggled to lose weight with diet and exercise, but aren’t candidates for, or are not prepared to accept the risk of, traditional bariatric surgery.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, says: ‘This is a very interesting concept and seems plausible. It is less invasive and more patient-friendly than other therapies — and that is something we really do need. ‘Over the past ten years, there have been a succession of advances in bariatric surgery, and we have moved from the scalpel to the endoscope. This could be a very useful treatment.’ Meanwhile, obese adults who lose at least 5 per cent of their body weight will feel and sleep better, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. In a two-year study involving 390 obese adults following a variety of weight-loss programmes, those who lost at least 5 per cent of their weight at six months managed to sleep 21.6 minutes more than at their heaviest. Those who lost less weight had only 1.2 minutes more sleep each night. Similarly, patients who lost more than 5 per cent reported improvements to their symptoms of depression, compared with participants who lost less than 5 per cent.","It is called Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal and is far less invasive .

"Police have said a 16-year-old who drove a quadbike into oncoming traffic at rush hour in Liverpool city centre is 'lucky to be alive' after the stunt was caught on film. The boy, who has not been named, was caught speeding down Strand at 5.30pm  when he suddenly swerved into four lanes of oncoming traffic, weaving through cars as they tried to avoid him. Police say the dangerous stunt led to him being arrested, banned from the roads for 12 months, and being given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew. Merseyside police said this 16-year-old is 'lucky to be alive' after he was caught driving his quadbike into four lanes of oncoming traffic in Liverpool city centre . The teenager (top centre) was banned from the roads for 12 months and given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew after the stunt which took place at the peak of the evening rush hour . Footage of the daylight crime was released by Merseyside Police during a crackdown on illegal and antisocial use of off-road bikes during which 28 bikes were seized during early morning raids. Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roy said: 'He is lucky to be alive and the case clearly highlights the risks for the entire community when off-road bikes are ridden in this way. 'Today's action is all about responding to the concerns of communities across Merseyside and targeting those people who we believe have been using scrambler bikes in a dangerous or anti-social way. 'We know that many people are plagued by the problem of off-road vehicles and actually find them incredibly intimidating. 'When they are ridden dangerously, they pose a huge risk, not only to the safety of the rider but also to pedestrians and other law-abiding road users. 'We know that there are still scramblers, quads and other vehicles out there which are being ridden dangerously or anti-socially, and I hope today shows that when we have information, we will act on it to tackle the problem.' The footage was released as part of a police crackdown against the illegal and antisocial use of off-road bikes in Liverpool, during which 28 bikes were seized . The teenager was captured on CCTV driving the correct way down Strand road moments before swerving into the opposite lane as car try to dodge around him . He added: 'I would appeal to people across Merseyside to carry on calling us if they know where nuisance bikes are being stored or they have information about the people who are using them.' Merseyside's Police Commissioner Jane Kennedy said: 'Residents, farmers and businesses have raised with me many times their concerns about the illegal and anti-social use of scrambler and quadbikes. 'These nuisance bikes can blight communities and present a real danger to members of the public. Sadly, we have recently seen the devastating consequences of using these bikes. 'I welcome this crackdown by Merseyside Police. It demonstrates their commitment to taking action, removing these vehicles from our roads and footpaths and tackling this problem.'","Boy, 16, was captured driving along four-lane road into oncoming traffic .

"In November 2014, plasma physicist Dr John Brandenburg revealed his theory that an ancient civilisation on Mars was massacred in a nuclear attack. Now, he’s back, and he’s going to be presenting new evidence for his theory at a Nasa-sponsored conference today. He claims there is no other explanation for his proposal that a ‘weapon’s signature’ remains from the attack on Mars. Dr John Brandenburg is to present his theory in Houston, Texas today. He says an ancient Mars civilisation was wiped out by a nuclear bomb. A thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium (shown in graphic) and radioactive potassium on the surface supposedly provide evidence for this theory . Dr Brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas at the Town Center Exhibit Area this evening. If you missed the story first time around, be mindful that there’s quite a lot to take in. He says that ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. Although he does not go into much detail about the alien races, he points to a number of ‘artifacts’ on the surface that he says are remnants of an intelligent society. Aside from this outlandish theories, Dr John Brandenburg has led a rather more normal, and prestigious, career. He has a PhD in Theoretical Plasma Physics from the University of California at Davis. Currently he works as a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies in Madison Wisconsin. He has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on Space Missile Defense and Directed Energy Weapons. Dr Brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest being Death on Mars: The Discovery of a Planetary Nuclear Massacre. And he warned we should also be fearful of an attack from this supposedly hostile alien race that wiped out the Martians. A thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium on the surface provide evidence for this theory. And nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on Mars, Cydonia Mensa and Galaxias Chaos. ‘We have now found evidence of the nuclear melt-glass Trinitite (formed on Earth at the site of nuclear weapon air-bursts) at both sites of the hypothesised explosions and this will be presented at the conference,’ Dr Brandenburg revealed to MailOnline ahead of his talk. ‘This strongly supports my hypothesis of massive nuclear airbursts.’ ‘So far no scientist has offered any other explanation for this body of data.’ Dr Brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas at the Town Center Exhibit Area this evening. Nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on Mars, Cydonia Mensa and Galaxias Chaos . Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars (pictured) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race . However, at the conference Dr Brandenburg said he would not be talking about his belief in the ancient civilisation. ‘The earlier result of a nuclear massacre stands,' he said. ‘However, for this conference paper I chose to focus on the most important part of the hypothesis, the enormous nuclear explosions, which is the most extraordinary new evidence of past intelligent activity on Mars. ‘My goal is establish the reality of the explosions to the scientific community, and their non-natural origin, and then focus on their targets. ‘Rest assured the whole hypothesis will be discussed tomorrow. I will be waving around copies of my book: Death on Mars.’ Dr Brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that Mars was once covered in an ocean, which Nasa recently announced. ‘This is a fine old blood feud on Mars,’ he added. He also says there is no natural explanation for his theory, as they were ‘fast neutron’ midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of Mars into glass. Shown is a ground level view of a nuclear device in Nevada, US on 15 April 1955 . Dr Brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that Mars was once covered in an ocean, which Nasa recently announced. The agency said they now had evidence that 3.7 billion years ago the planet had more water (shown in illustration) than than the Arctic Ocean does today . On the reaction he is expecting, Dr Brandenburg said: ‘I expect the paper to be controversial, with perhaps statements to the effect that ""this theory is so ludicrous I am not going to comment on its abundant evidences!"" by pundits.’ But he said this would be ‘followed by private conversations by other scientists saying, in hushed tones: ""Oh my God! Who do you think did it?"" and ""Do you think they could come back here?"" He also says there is no natural explanation for his theory, as they were ‘fast neutron’ midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of Mars into glass. ‘This cannot be asteroid explosions, as that would have created large craters, and as at Hiroshima and Nagasaki no craters were created,’ he said. ‘This is a weapon's signature.’ Dr Brandenburg will also be presenting another of his theories at the conference, that Mars once has a ‘biologically stabilised greenhouse.’ He says that the planet once had Earth-like temperatures and atmospheric pressures, and was abundant with life and an oxygen-rich atmosphere. And he says these would have been ideal conditions for life to form.","Dr John Brandenburg is to present his theory in Houston, Texas today .

"Fresh from having her paleo baby food book canned earlier this month Charlotte Carr has come in for more negative headlines after it was revealed that she has been doing voice-overs for fast-food favourites KFC, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's. Carr is co-author with celebrity chef Pete Evans and Helen Padarin of cookbook Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, which was dumped by its publisher after it was reportedly deemed 'potentially deadly for babies' by health experts. The baby food blogger’s website Bubba Yum Yum makes statements such as: 'My focus is on fresh and organic produce. No numbers, no additives. Just real food!'

Mrs Carr is a big advocate of the paleo children's diet for the likes of her son Willow . She has been with KFC for more then seven years Carr’s agency RMK Voices confirmed. Most recently she worked on a ­KFC nuggets advert. On the agency’s website her profile also states she has 'voiced some of the country’s most well-known campaigns' which includes Diet Coke, Uncle Toby’s and Cadbury. Carr, who has appeared on Aussie TV staples including All Saints and Offspring and, in 2006, Home and Away, has long been a vocal advocate for the 'paleo way' for children. She married Wes Carr, the winner of Australian Idol 2008, in 2012. Her cookbook with MKR host Pete Evans, was due to hit the shelves in weeks, but was canned by publisher Pan Macmillan after heavy criticism from health experts. The book will still get a worldwide digital release in April, according to a post on the chef's Instagram page. He said a print version of the book would also be published eventually. 'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that ""Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way” will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' post read. Charlotte married Wes Carr in 2012. Wes is best known for winning the sixth season of Australian Idol in 2008 . The book's publishers, Pan Macmillan Australia, cancelled the release of the book amid growing concerns from health experts and dietitians. Evans and his co-authors announced they would be releasing the book independently, and it would get a digital and print release . 'We didn’t want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support. 'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.' Earlier publisher Pan Macmillan Australia announced it was ditching plans to publish the book. The cookbook was first delayed before being cancelled. 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' the statement read. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been panned by dietitians and doctors over the past week. The Public Health Association of Australia said the book could lead to the deaths of children across the country. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . One recipe in the book - a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - was said to have the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. The criticism came as it emerged Evans' Facebook page was being scrubbed clean, with comments that were negative towards the paleo lifestyle were being deleted. After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. Evans visited a primary school in Ballarat, Victoria, last week to promote the paleo diet to children . The cancellation of the book comes as critics of Evans and the diet have claimed the chef deletes negative comments from his official Facebook page . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Despite the criticisms, Evans has been a passionate defender of the paleo lifestyle . Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, husband of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'","Charlotte Carr has done adverts for fast food and soft drink products .

"Phones have been blamed for creating a generation of people who can only communicate in so-called ‘text speak’ and smiley faces. But a pair of New York developers is hoping to expand our vocabularies with the launch of its Words U app. The app uses an algorithm to automatically replace words in messages with synonyms – and users can collect words to compete with their friends. Scroll down for video . The free Words U iOS app was created by New York-based Sam Mendelson and Allan Zhang. It changes the words used in text messages while keeping the sentence structure and meaning the same. The original words are shown right and the updated words are shown left . ‘Learning new vocabulary can be stressful and challenging, but it doesn't have to be,’ explained Sam Mendleson and Allan Zhang. ‘With Words U, your casual conversations become learning opportunities.’ They added that Words U is ‘much smarter than an electronic thesaurus’ because it maintains the sentence structure and the idiomatic usage of words it replaces. There are more than 800 words that can be used, and subsequently collected, and the aim is to achieve the ‘words crown’ by collecting them all. The general meaning of a new word is the same as the word it is replacing, but users can tap it to see a full dictionary definition (pictured). They can also revert it back to the original word, and recipients can press the lightbulb icon to see what the sender initially typed . With Memrise, users commit Chinese characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics. For example, the symbol for 'cow' resembles a cow carrying a neck yoke. And 'noodles' look like a bowl of noodles being eaten with chopsticks. Users then review the characters periodically - a technique known as 'spaced repetition'. The firm compares the learning process to 'growing a garden of memory', with the premise being that when users learn words, they plant virtual seeds, which 'grow and bloom the more they review and practise.' The general meaning of a new word is the same as the word it is replacing, but users can tap it to see a full dictionary definition. This also shows the history of the usage of the word. They can also revert it back to the original word, and recipients can press the lightbulb icon to see what the sender initially typed. It is only currently available in the US and the words have been taken from college curriculums including those used in English SAT exams. And once the initial list of words has been learnt and collected users can download extension packs for $6.99. Words U is also only available in English, but the firm told The Next Web it is hoping to develop foreign language versions if the app is a success.","Free Words U was created by developers Sam Mendelson and Allan Zhang .

"From satellite photography to five million miles of street-level imagery, detailed maps have transformed our view of the world. But while maps such Google Street View help us better find places, one designer claims our understanding of the wider landscape remains far too basic. Now London-based Michael Pecirno is attempting to change this using minimalist maps of the US that single out specific features such forests, crops and the nation’s urban sprawl. Using minimalist maps of the US landscape that single out specific features, London-based designer Michael Pecirno is hoping to give people a better understanding of the US landscape. This map shows the grasslands of America. Much of these prairielands have been converted into some of the richest agricultural regions on Earth . ‘With advances in mapping technology we're still primarily left with two dominate maps – the political and the physical,’ Mr Pecirno told DailyMail.com. ‘While internet maps, allow users to zoom in to an incredible level of detail, we're not necessarily told anything new; our understanding of the landscape is still the same, just higher in resolution.’ Mr Pecirno  inspiration came from road trips as a child through the Midwest where he would pass through miles of cornfields. Cornfields take up 91 million acres of the American landscape or around 4.83 per cent of the continuous US. The urban sprawl map reveals lack of development across stretches of the West, and the emerging Southeast chain of metropolitan areas . By focusing each map on a single subject, the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live. Pictured are the spread of evergreen forest across America . All the maps for this project were created using data from the US Department of Agriculture. ‘My inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography,’ said Mr Pecirno . London-based designer Michael Pecirno used freely-available data from from the US Department of Agriculture. This program, known as CropScape, documents a large majority of the American landscape over numerous years. 'Using this data and digital mapping tools, I've plotted the most dominate types of the American landscape into their own maps,' said Pecirno. 'And while they are perhaps still physical maps, where they differ is that they do not attempt to curate numerous features into a collaged map.' While hearing that value is impressive, there is little way right now for us to visualise what 4.83 per cent of the American landscape looks like, Mr Pecirno said. By focusing each map on a single subject, the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live. His maps look at features such as the distribution of grassland, urban sprawl, shrubs, evergreen, deciduous forests, water and corn. The urban sprawl map, for instance, reveals the lack of development across huge stretches of the West, and the emerging southeast chain of adjacent metropolitan areas. The map of deciduous forests - or trees that lose their leaves during the winter - shows how in some places, like New England, the forest has made a comeback as rural populations have moved to cities. All the maps for this project were created using data from the US Department of Agriculture. ‘My inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography,’ said Mr Pecirno. ‘Mapping has always been done through the collection of information, which was then plotted into a projected system to create a general understanding of a place. ‘With a new wealth of data designers have been able to improve maps, but this has primarily been through the increase of resolution, rather than a change in narrative. ‘The maps I've worked on attempt to take this wealth of data and ask what story can be told when we have so much available. Mr Pecirno now wants to map these pieces of data digitally over Google Maps, allowing users to layer different features.

"These fascinating black and white photographs show the state-of-the-art gyms and exercise equipment installed on some of the world’s most famous early 20th century cruise liners including the Titanic. From rowing machines and exercise bikes to punchbags and horse-riding simulators, the equipment available to first class passengers was of high quality for the era. The pictures reveal how passengers had the option to keep fit while on board some of the world’s most prestigious passenger liners including the SS Bermuda Star, RMS Homeric (1922), RMS Franconia (1922), Victoria Motorship and the stricken RMS Titanic. The Titanic in particular boasted a first class gymnasium, which was open from 9am until midday for women and between 2pm and 6pm for men. The gym, which was just one of a host of exceptional facilities available to first class passengers alongside squash courts and Turkish baths, was looked after by the cruise liner’s physical educator Thomas McCauley. He remained in post on the fateful morning of April 15, 1912, when the passenger ship sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.

The liner, which was originally called Columbus, was taken over from the Germans by the UK's famous White Star Line and operated from Liverpool from 1922 until 1935 . The Titanic's gymnasium featured a host of equipment including a mechanically-worked saddle (pictured). The gym was looked after by the cruise liner’s physical educator Thomas McCauley who remained in post even as the ship sank in the North Atlantic on April 15, 1912 . The Titanic was built by Harland & Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland during 1910 and 1911 and departed Southampton, UK, on its maiden voyage in 1912. It sank on April, 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland and a total of 1,522 passengers and crew died . RMS Franconia (pictured) was among the early 20th century cruise liners to feature a gymnasium. The ocean liner was operated by the Cunard Line until 1956, after being launched in Scotland in 1922.

"Shocking video footage has emerged of the extraordinary moment a Brazilian minibus was swallowed up in the middle of the road and then swept away in a furious torrent of flood water. Filmed in a remote area of Para state in the north of the country, the clip begins by showing the silver bus being evacuated after becoming stuck on a rapidly collapsing road. Seconds later a massive sinkhole opens up beneath the vehicle causing up it to plummet into the fast-moving flood waters below. The stricken bus is then seen being carried off into the distance by the raging deluge. Calm: Filmed in a remote area of Para state in the north of the country, the clip begins by showing the silver bus being evacuated after becoming stuck on a rapidly collapsing road . Good decision: Having spotted the road surface rapidly disintegrating, the driver of the bus decided to evacuate and abandon the vehicle before it is too late . Sinking: Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the raging deluge below . The shocking video shows the bus grinding to a halt as it travels along the Amazonian mud track. With a flooded river running beneath the road, it becomes clear to the driver that the surface is rapidly disintegrating, so he decides to abandon the vehicle before it is too late. Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the furious waters below. The sheer power of the flooded river is immediately evident as the massive vehicle is washed away by the current, bucking and bronking in the water, which has taken on a yellow colour due to the amount of mud and silt it has washed away from the surrounding area. Thankfully nobody was injured in the incident, which is believed to have been filmed after recent heavy rainfall in remote areas of Para state.

No resistance: The stricken bus is seen being carried off into the distance by the rampaging flood waters . The incident comes just a week after more than 50 people died after a tour bus plunged off a ridge into a wooded ravine in the mountains of southern Brazil. The bus fell 1,300ft after swerving off a bend in Santa Catarina state as night fell, with at least 11 children among the dead. Highway and weather conditions at the time of the accident in Santa Catarina were good as the bus made its way from the neighbouring state of Parana, a police spokesman said. Although no immediate cause for the crash had been determined, police said it appeared the brakes on the bus had failed. Around 43,000 Brazilians are killed in car crashes every year, with the accident rate increasing 24 per cent from 2002-2012.","Vehicle was travelling along a mud track in a remote stretch of Para state .

"An unarmed black teenager has been shot dead by a police officer at a Wisconsin home - just days after the release of a damning report into racial prejudice by cops in Ferguson, Missouri. Tony Robinson, 19, who was suspected of a recent battery, was reportedly gunned down by officer Matt Kenny, 45, who had followed him into an apartment in Madison at 6.30pm local time Friday. A struggle had ensued in the seconds before the shooting, it is reported. The officer then performed CPR on Tony and the teen was rushed to hospital. However, he later succumbed to his injuries. The killing, which sparked a mass protest outside the home, came only two days after a Justice Department report revealed that seven racist emails had been sent by officials in Ferguson. It also came just hours before President Barack Obama will lead this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat protesters marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery.

Angry: Videos have appeared online showing around 100 protesters at the scene of the shooting, chanting slogans like, 'Who can you trust? Not the police'. Above, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, at the protests . Demonstrating: Many of the demonstrators moved the protest to inside the Madison City County building Friday night, according to footage posted on Twitter. It was not immediately clear if there were any arrests . Over the past 20 hours, videos have appeared online showing around 100 protesters at the scene of the shooting, chanting slogans like, 'Who can you trust? Not the police,' in front of a row of officers. Many of the demonstrators moved the protest to inside the Madison City County building Friday night, according to footage on Twitter. It was not immediately clear if there were any arrests. Tony, who is yet to be formally identified but has been named by family and friends, was a graduate of Sun Prairie High School. Officials have confirmed he was unarmed when he was shot dead. Late Friday, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told broadcaster WKOW Mr Kenny had responded to a disturbance at an apartment in Williamson Street the African-American teenager had gone into. He said Tony had previously been seen dodging in and out of traffic and was suspected of a recent battery. The officer had forced his way into the home, where he was attacked by the teen, he said. '[The] subject assaulted my officer and in the context of mutual combat, the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject,' Chief Koval told the broadcaster. Friends: Tony, who is yet to be formally identified but has been named by family and friends, is pictured in a Facebook photo alongside a friend. He was described as being a 'happy person' by former classmates . Relatives: During Friday night's protests, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin (right), and aunt, Lorien Carter (left), told the gathered demonstrators that relatives had not been allowed to see the teenager after his death . Criticizing the authorities: 'We were told he was evidence,' Ms Carter told the crowd shortly before midnight, according to The Daily Cardinal. She added: 'He wasn't referred to as 'his son' or 'your son,' just 'evidence' Police face protesters: Cheered on by young and old protesters, Ms Irwin said: 'He [Tony] wouldn't hurt a fly. He was unarmed.' She asked: 'Why would you shoot him five times? What happened to your taser gun?' Mr Kenny, who has more than 12 years'  experience, was reportedly knocked down by a blow to the head during the struggle. He was taken to hospital, where he was treated and released. However, speaking to 27 News, Tony's tearful mother, Andrea Irwin, claimed her teenage son has 'never been a violent person', adding: 'To die in such a violent, violent way, it baffles me.' Ms Irwin also said that although she was pleased to see protesters supporting Tony at the scene, she does not wish to see violence like that in Ferguson after Michael Brown's death. During Friday night's protests, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, and aunt, Lorien Carter,  told the gathered demonstrators that relatives had not been allowed to see the teenager after his death.

He was unarmed. Why would you shoot him five times? What happened to your taser gun?' In a press briefing, Chief Koval said: 'In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting. And we understand that. '[But] we would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint, calm and allow the Division of Criminal Investigation(DCI) to conduct their affairs.' Mr Kenny is on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation by the state's Division of Criminal Investigation and the Dane County District Attorney's decision on whether to press charges. Chief Mike Koval said the officer was previously involved in a fatal shooting in 2007. However, he was cleared of any wrongdoing because it was a 'suicide by cop-type; situation, he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said an out-of-area investigation would be launched into the death of Tony, who was apparently planning on attending Madison College. Above, some demonstrators held up accusatory banners . Scene: Late Friday, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told broadcaster WKOW an officer had responded to a disturbance at an apartment  the African-American teenager had gone into. Above, police at the scene . Emergency response: Chief Koval added that Tony had appeared to be unarmed. 'The initial finding at the scene did not reflect a gun or anything of that nature that would have been used by the subject,' he said . According to The Wisconsin State Journal, friends of Tony were left shocked by his death. 'I still can't even fully wrap my head around this,'17-year-old Jack Spaulding told the Journal. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said an out-of-area investigation would be launched into the death of Tony, who was apparently planning on attending Madison College, Badger Herald reported. The investigation is required under a newly passed state law, Mayor Soglin told the Journal, adding: 'It's a tragedy beyond description. I expect there will be a lot of anger and frustrations.' In recent days, protests have been held in Los Angeles and Washington state over police killings of unarmed men from minority groups. They followed nationwide protests over the deaths of 18-year-old Brown, from Ferguson, and 43-year-old Eric Garner, from Staten Island, at the hands of police. In the spotlight: The shooting comes at a time of increased scrutiny of police violence against minorities across the US. Above, Barack Obama has labeled the police system in Ferguson, Missouri, 'racially biased' Violent: Obama spoke in commemoration of 'Bloody Sunday' (pictured) on Saturday. The violent images broadcast on TV of the famous march helped lead to the historic passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Earlier Friday, Obama said the investigation into police in Ferguson had exposed a 'broken and racially biased system'. 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,'he said. He told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere. Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College came the day before he led the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', on which people protested against lack of voting rights. The violent images broadcast on TV helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The President gave a powerful speech in commemoration at Edmund Pettus Bridge on Saturday.","Tony Robinson, 19, shot dead by a police officer at Wisconsin apartment .

"A man sent to prison for 25 years for sexually assaulting a child has been sentenced to another 40 for hiring a hit man to kill the prosecutor in his case. Edward Carreon, 32, of Chicago, was convicted earlier this year for solicitation of murder for hire after he planned to kill the pregnant lawyer who has handling the child molestation case against him. Carreon, who planned to pay hit man 'Marcus' when he got out of prison, had received the name of an alleged assassin from a fellow prison inmate while awaiting sentencing for his 2011 assault. Scroll down for video . Convicted child molester Edward Carreon, 32, was sentenced to 40 additional years in jail after conspiring to hire a hit man and kill the woman prosecuting his sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl . Correspondence between Correan and an undercover officer who went by the name Marcus reveals that the prisoner wanted to pay $25,000 for the prosecutor to be murdered with 'two shots to the head' However, the call he made from jail to was actually to an undercover sheriff's department official who he offered $25,000 for the murder. 'Two shots to the head is what I want,' Carreon wrote to the officer in a early 2013 letter, according to WGN. Carreon signed the letter 'Love Eddie' and talked about Marcus 'doing his homework' in finding the prosecutor. Profanity- laced jailhouse conversations between the two were also recorded, during which Carreon said that he wanted the evidence used against him to be destroyed. Over the course of multiple meetings in early 2013, he also identified the prosecutor, who has not been named by media reports, in photos. Correan, who met with the undercover officer multiple times in early 2013 before his sentencing, signed his letter 'Love Eddie' The child molester, who was convicted in 2013 of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old multiple times, used to live two blocks from an elementary school . 'While this was an extremely alarming threat to the safety of one of my assistant state’s attorneys, we also consider it a threat to the integrity of our entire criminal justice system, so we are extremely grateful for this verdict,' Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement. The targeted prosecutor has said that the plot rattled her and her entire family. She is still working for the attorney's office. Carreon was given 25 years for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl on numerous occasions in 2011 and then trying to convince her that the relationship was consensual after she turned 13. He formerly lived in the Brighton Park area of Chicago two blocks from an elementary school, according to the Chicago Tribune. If he serves all of his terms, Carreon will not get out of jail until he's 97. He has two previous convictions of domestic battery against his children's mother.","Edward Carreon, 32, was serving 25 years for sexual abuse of 12-year-old .

"See a piece of art you like and want to know more about it? Soon you could 'Shazam' it. Shazam, the app created to recognise an artist from a few seconds of music, says it wants to branch out into identifying objects, such as food, paintings and books. The London-based company behind . the mobile app has raised $30 million from several unidentified billionaires to finance the change. Shazam, the app created to recognise an artist from a few seconds of music, says it wants to branch out into identifying objects, such as food, paintings and books . 'Shazam is already a verb,' chief executive Rich Riley told Reuters at the Mobile World Congress industry fair in Barcelona. 'We want to expand the universe of . what you can Shazam' The latest funding comes on top of $40 million raised . from Mexican telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim in 2013. Riley said these additional funds would help the . venture-capital backed company add to its 250-strong staff and . sign additional partnerships with publishers and content . companies. The London-based company behind the mobile app has raised $30 million from several unidentified billionaires to finance the change. The company has yet to reveal details about how it would work, but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes . 'The famous blue button that our users love will remain on . the home screen but will be able to do much more,' he said. Just in time for spring, scientists hope to launch a 'Shazam for birds' that will help people identify the tweets that are waking them up in the morning. The app, dubbed Warblr, claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species, and could help track their migration patterns. Like Shazam, it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones to analyse it in real-time and identify the bird species according to its tweet . Whenever the app identifies a bird, geo-tracking allows it to map which species is being spotted where and when, with the information made public. The information will be made publicly available to allow zoologists and ecologists monitor species growth and decline, as well as patterns of migration. The company has yet to reveal details about how it would work, but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes. This would make it similar to Amazon’s Fire phone which can already identify products by scanning these codes. Shazam has evolved markedly since 1999 when it was founded, . gaining popularity with its ability to recognise a piece of . music with the click of a button on the phone. It now sells . songs that its users identify, having secured deals with all the . major streaming music services including Spotify and Deezer. Lately it has also become a port of call for advertisers who . want to find ways to instantly link up with their target . audiences. Although Shazam does not disclose its revenues or other . financials, it says the latest funding round valued it at over . $1 billion. It also has the attributes of a listed company, Riley said, . such as a strong brand, scale and revenue, although the company . is not yet profitable since it is still seeking to grow.

"Tori Spelling was taken to an emergency room in LA on Friday by her husband, Dean McDermott, adding to what has been a sickness-plagued 12 months for the reality star. The 41-year-old mother-of-four appeared pale and tired as she stepped out of the passenger side of her husband's black Ford Flex station wagon at Encino Hospital Medical Center. Wrapped in a cardigan and beanie, she then took herself into the emergency room. Spelling was seeking treatment for a migraine, which she tweeted about the next day. She was last hospitalized in October. Emergency: A tired-looking Tori Spelling is pictured dropped off at the Encino Hospital Medical Center on Friday by her husband, Dean McDermott .

The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital on Saturday, Oct. 18, having a coughing attack. At the time she was reported to be suffering a nervous breakdown. Spelling was later diagnosed with with severe bronchitis and possible pneumonia. The Mystery Girls access spent two weeks in hospital and described the stay as 'my rock bottom'. Appearing on The Dr. Oz Show after being charged, Spelling said what upset her most was that her children 'weren't fazed' by the fact she was in hospital. 'They're used to it. And I don't want them to grow up thinking, ""Mom's sick"",' she said. I need to change. I need to prioritize me, and my problem is I put everyone before me.'

"Streetwise urban ants from New York have developed a taste for the kind of diet frequently chosen by their human neighbours. Tests on insects collected from pavements and traffic islands in Manhattan show that their bodies contain the molecular fingerprint of junk food. The same was not true of more genteel ants that frequent leafy park areas. The scientists tested more than 100 ants representing 21 species from dozens of sites in the Big Apple. Lead researcher Dr Clint Penick, from North Carolina State University, said: 'Human foods clearly make up a significant portion of the diet in urban species. These are ants eating our garbage, and this may explain why pavement ants are able to achieve such large populations in cities.' The scientists tested more than 100 ants representing 21 species from dozens of sites in the Big Apple. Their diet was assessed by analysing the kind of carbon in their bodies. All animals, including humans, take in carbon from food, but the atomic 'strain' of the element found in the ants was specifically associated with corn and sugar cane. Corn and refined sugar are both abundant in human processed foods where they are used as sweeteners and flavour enhancers. Evidence of the signature carbon-13 isotope indicated that the ants had adopted a junk food diet. The species with the highest levels of carbon-13 was the most common ant on the street, the 'pavement ant' Tetramorium caespitum. Like members of inner city gangs, Tetramorium soldiers engage in violent turf wars as rival colonies fight for territory. They also do a lot of breaking and entering of people's homes, and are a recognised house pest. Tests on insects collected from pavements and traffic islands in Manhattan show that their bodies contain the molecular fingerprint of junk food. The scientists, whose findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, discovered one street-living ant that turned its antennae up at human food. Lasius emarginatus, only identified in New York City in the past five years, was also found in high numbers on Manhattan's pavements and traffic islands. But the isotope analysis showed no evidence of a human-like diet. Instead, the ant appeared to divide its time between subterranean nests and foraging in the branches of city trees. 'This highlights the complex nature of urban ecosystems and how much we still have to learn about how these species relate to each other and to the environment,' said Dr Penick. 'We wanted to learn more about why some ant species are able to live alongside us, on sidewalks or in buildings, while other species stay on the outskirts of human development,"" says Dr Penick, . ""This could also help us determine which species are doing the most to clean up our trash."" Read more at: .","Insects were collected from pavements and traffic islands in Manhattan .

"Charlie Lee, 19, tricked his vulnerable victim out of tens of thousands of pounds . A teenage conman was jailed for tricking a grandfather out of almost £50,000 for fake home repairs. Charlie Lee, 19, had followed his vulnerable victim home and claimed he needed tens of thousands worth of work to fix a crack in his home's foundations. A court heard Lee and his 17-year-old accomplice even sent a fake solicitor's letter demanding more and more cash from the man, 61. A judge told the baby faced pair that they had acted like 'hardened criminals' during the con. Judge Gregg Bull QC: 'It was planned and persistent. 'The victim was cajoled and threatened to give money. It is the thinking of hardened criminals.' Lee had spotted the 'lonely and vulnerable' man, who would not be named for fear of further scams, walking home from work. The conman noticed the victim stumble and decided to target him and follow him home, the court heard. Lee and his 17-year-old accomplice, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stopped the car and 'saw they could take advantage'. They offered to do some work on the roof at his home in Monmouth, South Wales, then pressed him to hand over more and more money. Newport Crown Court heard how their victim handed over £47,000 for just £2,200 worth of repairs during a three week period. Lee, who lives on a caravan site in Northampton, was jailed for 19 months and the 17-year-old received 18 months in a young offenders institute. Gwent Police DC Mark Price said: 'This was an incident where two people took extreme advantage of a someone's vulnerability to con them out of a significant amount of money. Lee had spotted the 'lonely and vulnerable' man, who would not be named for fear of further scams, walking to his home in Dixon Road (pictured) in South Shields . 'This kind of crime is dealt with robustly and we will continue the work we do locally to raise awareness of rogue trader activity and promote steps members of the public can take to better protect themselves, family members and their neighbours.' The scam comes on the eve of major government reforms  that will hand millions the chance to cash in their pension pots – giving them access to huge sums previously locked away. On April 6 over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension but the shake up has renewed fears it could trigger a flood of scams on the elderly and vulnerable whose newly-available funds will be rich pickings.

"At first glance, it looks like any other F-16 fighter jet - except for one difference. Boeing's new QF-16 is a actually a retired US Air force jet converted into a drone. The pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground, and will used for target practice by 'top gun' pilots. Scroll down for video . Where's the pilot? Boeing has revealed video footage of an F-16 jet converted into a drone. 126 of the converted planes will be used by the US Air Force as flying targets to train top gun pilots. Length: 49 ft, 5 in. Span: 32 ft, 8 in. Takeoff weight: 37,500 lbs . Max speed: 1,500 mph . Max altitude: 50,000 ft plus . Range: 2,425 mi . Engine: One 27,000-lb-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100 . The first production Boeing QF-16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the US Air Force (USAF), Air bosses have revealed. Aircraft QF-007 arrived at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida on 11 March, ahead of being pressed into service by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATS). Boeing has delivered six pre-production QF-16s, and in all, the USAF expects to receive 126 QF-16s. The unmanned McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II currently used is no longer truly representative of the air-to-air threats USAF pilots are likely to encounter on future operations. The QF-16 will be able to represent threats in the class of the MiG-29 'Fulcrum' and Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker', bosses say. In tests, two U.S. Air Force test pilots in a ground control station at Tydall remotely flew the QF-16, which is a retired F-16 jet modified to be an aerial target. While in the air, the QF-16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers, reaching supersonic speeds, returning to base and landing, all without a pilot in the cockpit. 'It was a little different to see it without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,' said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. 'It's a replication of current, real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target. Now we have a 9G capable, highly sustainable aerial target.' For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. The drones have been adapted from F-16 jets that have been retired by the Air Force. The QF-16 is a retired F-16 (pictured) turned in a remote controlled drone. The US Air Force has ordered 126 craft to be used as 'target drones'. For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. The F-16's most innovative design feature is its 'fly-by-wire' control system, the first on any aircraft. The F-16 is designed to maneuver at up to nine g's. This allows it to turn tighter than other fighters, a big advantage in a dogfight. But at such high g-loadings, the pilot is crushed down into his seat by almost a ton of force, and can barely lift a finger. So the F-16 has a small side-mounted control stick on an armrest. Instead of moving back and forth, the F-16's fixed joystick responds to hand pressure. In a tight, high-g turn, an otherwise immobilized F-16 pilot can literally fly with the twitch of a finger.","US Air Force has ordered 126 craft to be used as 'target drones'

"Beacons will be lit from coast to coast, church bells rung and street parties held during a three-day commemoration for the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe, it was confirmed yesterday. The long weekend of events beginning on Friday May 8, the day after the general election, will include a televised Forties-style concert in London’s Horse Guards Parade. The VE Day celebrations are a victory for the Daily Mail which had highlighted mounting concern that the anniversary risked being overshadowed by the election. Street parties will be held to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe. Above, revellers celebrate the 50th anniversary in 1995 . Singer Dame Vera Lynn, the Forces’ Sweetheart who will be 98 on Friday, was among those who called on the Government to do more to mark what is likely to be the last major anniversary at which the generation that fought at home and abroad in the war is able to gather in strength. Last month David Cameron responded and asked Cabinet minister William Hague to draw up plans for three days of national commemorations, which he unveiled yesterday. Party leaders, senior royals, veterans and organisations whose members played a part in the war effort will gather on May 8 to mark a day of remembrance at the Cenotaph in London. The timing will make it an even more extraordinary occasion, starting as final results are announced for a general election most pollsters predict will result in another hung Parliament. Ministers and their shadows are likely to gather not knowing with any certainty who will be in power after any coalition negotiations. At 3pm, the moment on May 8 1945 that Winston Churchill declared an end to war in Europe, there will be a two-minute silence across the country. Schools are being encouraged to hold events and observe the silence. On the Friday evening, a chain of more than 100 beacons will be lit at locations from Unst in the Shetlands to Lowestoft in Suffolk. Crowds cheer and wave outside Buckingham Palace on VE Day in 1945 as the King and Queen appear on the balcony . Party leaders are expected to gather at the Cenotaph during the festivities. Above, Winston Churchill waves to gathered crowds on May 8 1945 . On Saturday May 9, communities are being encouraged to organise street parties. At 11am churches and cathedrals are being asked to ring their bells, as they did in 1945. The celebrity Forties-themed concert that evening in Horse Guards Parade, behind Downing Street, will be shown on BBC1. Then on the Sunday, May 10, a service of thanksgiving will be held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a parade of Armed Forces personnel and veterans from the war. They will march past the balcony of the Treasury where Churchill made his famous appearance in front of the crowds on VE Day. There will be a flypast of modern and Second World War aircraft and a display of period vehicles in St James’s Park. Mr Hague said the commemorations would ‘pay fitting tribute’ to the wartime generation. Eric Goldrein, 94, from Liverpool, who was in Italy with the Royal Artillery when the war ended, said: ‘I’m looking forward to being part of these 70th anniversary celebrations. We celebrated in a field. The signallers set up speakers playing music and the locals came out and joined in too.’ The Prime Minister said: ‘VE Day is one of the most pivotal moments in our nation’s proud history. After years of all-out war – and the untold sacrifice of millions at both home and abroad – this day marked the moment when the threat of Nazi brutality was finally lifted. As a nation, it is vital that we remember the 70th anniversary of this historic day.’ The 50th anniversary of VE Day in 1995 saw celebrations across the country, while hundreds of thousands of people assembled in Hyde Park for concerts and ceremonies.","Long weekend of events will begin on May 8 after the general election .

"George Osborne’s pre-election budget next week will be a ‘steady as you go’ exercise. Above, the Chancellor pictured ahead of the budget last year . Slashing £12billion from the nation’s bloated benefits bill will be at the heart of the Tory pitch for a second term in office. George Osborne’s pre-election budget next week will be a ‘steady as you go’ exercise with the emphasis on sustaining growth and reducing the deficit. But the Chancellor is planning to use a section of his speech – kept separate from measures agreed by the Coalition – to highlight proposals to ease the income tax burden. Tory sources say other measures that appear ‘nailed on’ for their election manifesto include: . The measures would help Mr Osborne find the £30billion he needs to erase the budget deficit by the end of the next Parliament in 2019. Treasury officials believe £5billion can be raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion on top of the £12billion annual welfare saving. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. The Tories say they will raise the point at which people pay higher rate income tax to £50,000 by the end of the next Parliament – lifting hundreds of thousands of middle class professionals out of the 40p band. Another objective is to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 a year. The Chancellor is also thought to be considering granting pensioners the right to take money out of their retirement funds. The move would be a radical extension of his decision last year to free retirees from having to buy what are often poor-value annuities with their pension savings. Although public borrowing for 2014-15 is expected to come at below the £91billion projected in the autumn statement last December, the Chancellor will have little wriggle room for electoral giveaways. His Liberal Democrat coalition partners are reluctant to allow him to use the Budget as a launch-pad for the Tory election campaign. However, another tax break for millions of workers is expected with a hike in the personal tax allowance, which is already due to rise to £10,600 next month. It is expected that the Chancellor will take the opportunity to announce a full review of the business rates system. Retailers have long been pushing for reform of rates – which have existed in various forms since Tudor times – to ease the pressure on the high street. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. Above, Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) Sources suggest that moving away from a charge based on the rateable value of a commercial property to a modern alternative – such as a sales tax – is one option. Critics of the existing system say that it is absurd in the internet age to base company taxes on the physical space they occupy. There is speculation that the Chancellor will use his budget to unveil populist measures such as a cut in the duty on beer and wine. Key tax avoidance and evasion measures to be announced by the Chancellor will include an end to ‘umbrella’ arrangements. One scheme – used by collapsed delivery firm City Link – allows companies to escape corporate and national insurance tax by employing their workforce as freelance sub-contractors. 'Google' tax: The HMRC will assess the British turnover of low tax paying companies such as Starbucks and Amazon and will tax them proportionally on the earnings in the UK. Above, file image . Mr Osborne is planning heavy penalties on tax advisers, including the big accounting firms, banks and others that set up and promote tax avoidance scams. Changes in the tax regime will make it unlawful for individuals or companies to raise new debts solely for the purpose of writing off the interest payments on that debt against tax. This technique is widely used by private equity firms. The budget will herald the final closure of the loopholes that allow companies and individuals to hide their tax affairs in secretive overseas jurisdictions. So far more than 90 countries – including Switzerland, Luxembourg and the British crown territories such as the Caymans – have signed up to a convention that requires them to be fully transparent and hand over the details of tax residents to HMRC. Mr Osborne plans full implementation of the so-called ‘Google’ tax.

Individuals inside police headquarters tried to edit the entries of Eric Garner (left) and Sean Bell (right with his fiance and daughter) They also edited the entry of Amadou Diallo (above) was shot dead in 1999 when police mistook his wallet for a gun . These changes were all traced by Capital New York by following the public IP addresses. The Garner entry seems to have been edited the most, with numerous changes made on the page. 'Garner raised both his arms in the air' was edited to say 'Garner flailed his arms about as he spoke' and 'Use of the chokehold has been prohibited' became 'Use of the chokehold is legal, but has been prohibited.' A sentence was also added to say that Garner was bigger than the officers on the scene. As for Bell, who was shot dead on November 25, 2006 by undercover officers at his bachelor party the night before his wedding despite being unarmed, his entry was not only edited but there was also an attempt to have it removed completely. On the Articles for deletion page, someone from the department wrote, 'He [Bell] was in the news for about two months, and now no one except Al Sharpton cares anymore. The police shoot people every day, and times with a lot more than 50 bullets. This incident is more news than notable.' The entry was not removed. An individual also changed the entry for the British alternative Chumbawamba, swapping out three of the band's members with members of the police department . Information about NYPD Officer Kenneth Boss was changed on the page of Diallo, saying that the cop shot an 'armed' and not an 'unarmed' man in a previous incident. None of the cops involved in any of these three incidents were found guilty of any charges. 'The matter is under internal review,' NYPD spokeswoman Det.

"Gorillas are considered to be highly intelligent mammals. So much so in fact that one named Koko was able to learn a subset of sign language. But one cheeky gorilla showed off a form of its own sign language while being filmed at a wildlife park – by appearing to give the middle finger. The blackback gorilla can be seen annoying its fellow ape by sticking up his middle finger . Captured at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida, US, the large silverback gorilla can be seen interacting with an older blackback. Picking up a toy, the blackback throws it at the silverback who protects itself by lifting a hand to its face. Continuing to annoy the silverback, the blackback reaches over and picks up the toy as if intending to throw it again. But before he gets the chance, the silverback casually gives it the middle finger. The video maker and the surrounding people can be heard laughing in shock at the cheeky gesture being made by the large mammal. Responding in playful fury, the blackback once again throws the toy against the silverback before picking it up a few more time and repeating the process. Writing online about the experience, the filmmaker said: ‘A very spunky blackback gorilla continues to pester the older silverback to play with him. To the surprise of the group of people behind the camera the silverback gorilla appears to give its fellow ape the middle finger . ‘His tactic was to throw a ‘KONG’ at his fellow gorilla’s head, as if that was going to coerce the old gorilla into play mode! Then this happened!’ Silverback gorillas are generally more than 12-years-old, and feature a distinctive patch of silver hair on their backs. They also have large canine teeth, and like other great apes have the ability to laugh, grieve, make and use tools and develop loving bonds with their families. The blackback responds to the gesture by throwing the toy against the silverback a few times more .","A blackback gorilla annoys a silverback by throwing a toy at it .

"A tonne of deadly asbestos has been found dumped on an Adelaide beach. The building material was found submerged in piles of corrugated roofing material and dumped in bags on the beach on Thursday night. CFMEU SA secretary Dave Kirner said he was tipped off about the waste at Pelican Point, northwest of Adelaide, by an environmental group. 'There's about a tonne of asbestos in three piles,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'In our view it was probably a commercial contract job and they've gone and made a bigger profit on the job by going and dumping this asbestos.' Asbestos was found dumped at Pelican Point, northwest of Adelaide, on Thursday . CFMEU state secretary Dave Kirner says he found more than a tonne of asbestos dumped at the beach . The beach is a popular spot for quad bikers who may have driven over the asbestos, Mr Kirner says. 'When I was there, there was a family there with a five-year-old kid,' he said. 'There's community interaction all around the asbestos, so we want to get it stopped straight away.' 'Asbestos contractors are worried that people are entering the industry and not operating properly,' Mr Kirner told Adelaide Now. 'It had been dumped off a really big truck or skip... it had been packed up properly.' The Environment Protection Authority has sent an emergency response team to the site to take samples of the asbestos . Individuals caught dumping waste can be jailed for a maximum of two years or fined up to $120,000 .

"Look out for Barbary apes, grins our guide: 'We often get raided, especially in the harvest.' Ahmad, aged 72, finds most things funny. He owns a donkey called 'Easyjet' and tells us that most of his neighbours will live to 105. Our week in the Rif, a mountainous region of Northern Morocco, follows this pattern - it is full of surprises. The tops of the mountains are dusted with snow, and yet, around the bottom, you can buy oranges as big as a baby's head. A Rif you'll want to hear forever: The Rif mountains are a beautiful - yet less known - part of Morocco . On Ahmad's country walks we see mountain women wearing wide-brimmed hats festooned with pom-poms. One minute we're clambering through gorgeous terraces of onions and fruit, the next we're in a paddock of cannabis (or kif). 'Just for the farmers,' says Ahmad airily. 'The long-haired ones don't come any more.' But strangest of all is our first town, Chefchaouen. The old parts are all a bluey-purple, as if the entire medina has been flushed with ink. To my daughter Lucy, aged ten, this is enchanting, and we tour every alley and knobbly passage, poking our heads into all the old caravanserais. There are no cars in this beautiful labyrinth of mauve, and in the mornings everyone rushes out to the public taps. We stay at the Lina Ryad, a little bit of the 21st century dropped in among these dreamy scenes. It even has a modest swimming pool, in a town where most people think a traffic jam has hooves. This is not a place for ordinary shopping. We somehow end up with an old pair of slave's manacles (£7), a large flag (£6) and a very battered silver headdress (£30). Most of the time it is enough just to wander. From the kasbah (or citadel) we can peer down into people's lives. As the day warms, housewives head out to the stream to rinse out their carpets. After a few days, we head north. Country and city: A woman from the Rif region in traditional dress (left); the back streets of Tangier (right) The Rif may not be Morocco's tallest range, but it's thrillingly wild. Great rivers burst through the boulders, and we can just make out tiny villages perched high up in the valley walls. Then, suddenly, we tumble out into Tangier. This fabulous antique city feels only half-African. For a long time, it was 'The International Zone' (1923-1956), and Europeans appeared in droves. They left cafes, cannon, art deco, a long corniche and a whole cemetery of kind hearts and baronets. Some came for the view, and we tour the celebrity roosts. There's still a piano bar at The El-Minzah (Churchill and Rex Harrison), although the Hotel Cecil (Tennessee Williams) now has palm trees growing through the roof. Meanwhile, at Grand Hotel Villa de France, you can visit Matisse's bedroom (Number 35) and gaze out at the scenes he painted. Others came to misbehave, particularly the Beat poets. It's fun trying to find their old haunts around the medina. Although Dean's Bar was wreathed in dust and padlocks, you can still get a whiff of the Fifties at Cafe Baba. However, for Lucy, the best moments are when we head for the souk. One stall sells huge blocks of nougat (which have to be chopped with a cleaver); another has only magic charms and musket balls. Captivating: Tangier - with its medina to the forefront - has long tempted European travellers to Morocco . Deep in the medina, little alleyways turn into grand Arabian palaces (like Al-Makhzen), or perhaps the house of Barbara Hutton, once the richest woman in the world. My favourite is the old American legation of 1821. From the outside, it looks typically dusty and medieval, but step inside and a glorious Georgian residence appears. Such excitement requires a cosy bolthole, and we have La Tangerina. Hidden in the ramparts, this tiny hotel has been lovingly restored. There are log fires and almond cake for tea, and time seems to have paused at 1956. Enjoy this mad city, walk everywhere, do everything and then retreat to the hotel's roof. In one direction lies Spain (only eight miles away, across the Med) and in the other lies the Rif, now looking pink and mysterious and deceptively tame.

"If you've ever wanted to have Daniel Craig's steely gaze or Angelina Jolie's sultry stare, a new laser treatment could be the answer. A Californian company says it hopes to offer a $5,000 (£3,400) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue, permanently. The technique, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, works by using something known as 'scavenger cells' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface. Scroll down for video . The technique, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, works by using something known as 'scavenger cells' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface. A specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye, before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris . The procedure applies a computer-guided, low-energy laser to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment. A specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye, before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris. This causes the body to 'initiate a natural and gradual tissue-removal process. Once the tissue is removed, the patient's natural blue eye is revealed,' explains the website . By removing the pigment, light can enter small fibres in the eye. When the light scatters, it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths, which appears blue. 'Under every brown eye is a blue eye,' Dr Gregg Homer, chairman and chief scientific officer at Strōma Medical said. 'The only difference between them is that a brown eye has a thin layer of pigment covering the blue iris.'

A Californian company says it will soon be offering a $5,000 (£3,400) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue, permanently . Saj Khan, an ophthalmologist at the London Eye Hospital, told CNN that the procedure could clog up the eye's normal drainage channels. This can in turn cause the pressure inside the eye to go up,' he said. 'If that happens significantly enough, for long enough, it's how patients develop glaucoma,' he said. 'We were concerned about this issue right from the start, so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies,' the company wrote on their site. 'Thus far, pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies.' Dr Mark Korolkiewicz, an optometrist and clinical services director at Ultralase, a nationwide laser vision correction specialist, says that there are fundamental differences between the Stroma laser procedure and corrective laser eye surgery. By removing the pigment, light can enter small fibres in the eye. When the light scatters, it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths, which appears blue . The basic rule of thumb is that as soon as you go inside the eye with a laser, you can cause more damage,’ he says. ‘We only use lasers on the cornea, the surface of the eye. This new treatment involves using a laser inside the eye.’ 'Our procedure is limited to the treatment of stromal pigment,' Dr Homer told DailyMail.com. 'It does not dislodge or even contact any of the the ""iris pigment epithelium"" or IPE on the back side of the iris. 'In addition, our procedure does not actually remove any pigment. 'The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. We are now well into our clinical trials, and thus far, there has been no intraocular pressure increase in any subject.' But it may be the moral question which gives people most pause for thought. Dr Homer, who has Jewish roots himself, rejects he is promoting blue eyes over brown. ‘I’ve heard the eugenics remark a few times, but I don’t understand it. Is the charge that there is something racist about giving people the option to have blue eyes?’","A low-energy laser is applied to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment .

"UConn men's basketball coach Kevin Ollie is refusing to  travel to the Final Four this week, the university announced. Ollie, who led his team to the NCAA men's basketball championship last year, is abiding by a travel ban ordered by Connecticut's governor because of Indiana's new religious-objections law. Governor Dannel P. Malloy and other critics contend the law would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs. Scroll down for video . Coach: UConn men's basketball coach Kevin Ollie (seen with players in January 2015) will not be traveling to the Final Four this week, the university announced Tuesday . Champions: UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship . The Democratic governor on Monday signed an executive order banning state spending on travel to Indiana. Malloy left the decision to travel to the Final Four up to Ollie and the university, which had already paid for much of his trip. 'That's a decision for them and UConn to make, um, what I'm saying is, let's not be silly here,' he was filmed telling reporters. 'There are gay men and gay women who participate in intercollegiate sports.' UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship. University President Susan Herbst issued a statement Tuesday evening in support of the governor's ban and said neither Ollie nor any other member of the basketball staff would travel to Indianapolis. 'In support of Governor Malloy's travel ban to the state of Indiana, Kevin Ollie and other members of the UConn men's basketball staff will not travel to Indianapolis for the NCAA Final Four and events surrounding it,' Herbst said. She continued 'UConn is a community that values all of our members and treats each person with the same degree of respect, regardless of their background and beliefs and we will not tolerate any other behavior.' Issues: Many, including Democratic Indiana State Rep. Ed DeLaney (pictured on Saturday), have protested the state's new law . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (seen Tuesday) urged lawmakers Tuesday to send a bill to his desk by the end of the week to clarify the intent of the new law . NBC Connecticut reported Ollie and staff members would have gone to National Association of Basketball Coaches. The convention will be held in Indianapolis from April 2 to April 6. Warde Manuel, UConn's athletic director, told The Associated Press on Monday that he also finds the law unacceptable. Manuel said he hopes the state of Indiana rectifies the situation before UConn or any other institution considers a boycott of the 2016 women's Final Four, which also is being held in the city. 'They have a choice to make and I think others have choices to make on whether they'll spend money at the businesses in the state of Indiana,' he said. Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told NBC Connecticut 'I wouldn’t presume to give advice but if I were in their shoes I would stay away. I think they can send a very powerful message as all of us can.' The University of Southern California's Athletic Director Pat Haden also tweeted Tuesday 'I am the proud father of a gay son. In his honor, I will not be attending the [College Football Playoff] committee meeting in Indy this week. #EmbraceDiversity.' Indiana Gov.

"A pair of animal-loving police officers have returned a missing dog to her owner after a cheeky post on social media helped reunite them. Constable Emily Atkinson, and First Class Constable Nick Morgan were on duty in Narrogin, about 200 kilometres south-east of Perth on Sunday when they got a call about the canine. 'We were on patrol and the stepdaughter of my colleague phoned us up and said there was a dog hanging around,' Constable Morgan told Daily Mail Australia. Narrogin Police posted this adorable photo of Sophia on Sunday, who was allegedly in trouble for 'ruff conduct', in an attempt to find her owner . First Class Constable Nick Morgan was on duty and helped reunite Sophia with her owner . After picking up the dog from outside the local bakery and trying the ranger - who had the day off being Sunday - the pair thought they'd try their luck online. 'Both of us being dog lovers we thought we’d try and do the right thing and find the owner,' Constable Morgan said. They posted a photograph of Sophia Jenks, complete with a sign around her neck alleging the dog had been involved in 'ruff conduct' and was facing 25 to life. 'Today on patrol a lost dog was handed to us. Sophia has now made bail and been collected by her owner,' Narrogin Police posted on Twitter. Constable Morgan said they were 'lucky' it was a quiet day around town, and they had been encouraged to have a bit of fun with social media to help get messages across. When asked where the dogs owner was, he said he believed Sophia's owner had been away overnight when the dog made the escape. 'I think he (the owner) was away for the night and came back to realise his dog had done a runner.' Constable Morgan said. 'It’s not the first time that we've had to return a dog, being a small town we like to go above and beyond and being dog lovers that’s the second time we've actually found a dog’s owner,' he added.

"It is now official: when it comes to swimming naked, no one does it better - or at least in bigger numbers - than Australians. On Sunday, a group of brave, brazen Aussies took part in a mass-skinny dip at a Perth Beach, successfully setting a new Guinness World Record for the largest group 'nude swim'. Although it is yet to be officially confirmed, it's understood that the team at Fremantle's South Beach surpassed New Zealand's standing record of 749, thanks to around 790 swimmers in the nuddy. All skinny dippers had to stay in the water together for at least five minutes, with all competitors required to be submerged at least to their waists. On Sunday, a group of brave, brazen Aussies took part in a mass-skinny dip at a Perth Beach, successfully setting a new Guinness World Record for the largest group 'nude swim' All 790 skinny dippers had to stay in the water together for at least five minutes, with each person required to be in as deep as their waist . The 2015 Naked Fig Skinny Dip Challenge also raised an estimated $10,000 for The Butterfly Foundation to support people with eating disorders and negative body image. Devastating statistics prove the toll of negative body image as almost 2000 people die from eating disorders every year. Additionally, around one million Australians must struggle with disordered eating and harmful thoughts about their appearance every single day. The event was the perfect way to encourage people to embrace their bodies and be happy within themselves. It was a day 'to celebrate diversity and health', with many couples, families and friends hitting the sand together. 'In my 23 years of existence, I have never felt as accepted and as comfortable as I did today, standing naked with 790 people,' said participant Sarah Jimmy. 'If I had been given this experience as a teenager, to see everyone as they are, and to realise just how different and beautiful everyone is in the own way, it would have saved me from years of self doubt. 'Everyone had a smile on their face.' Teams of people took to the shore wearing little more than body paint, ready for a day of fun. Those that took part were ecstatic, raving about the liberation they felt splashing around. 'I don't skinny dip - I chunky dunk!' a participant said proudly, without a hint of self-consciousness. 'In my 23 years of existence, I have never felt as accepted and as comfortable as I did today, standing naked with 790 people,' said participant Sarah Jimmy . 'Such a great day! Awesome turnout, the whole 'vibe' of the day was so much fun!' said Mitch Barrows. 'See you all next year when we beat our own record!' 'There were people of all shapes and sizes having such a great day,' said event organiser Lorna Marns. 'Some were very hesitant and nervous at the beginning but after they stripped off and ran into the water they forgot about their concerns and bobbed around in the water happily.' The inspirational ambassador for the challenge was Jessica Smith, a Paralympian and award-winning spokeswoman for positive body image. The city of Fremantle were fully onboard with the fundraiser, officially reserved the beach for those taking part to ensure privacy. 'The councillors were so wonderful. They were really open-minded to the idea. It was so enjoyable to enjoyable to work with council who were open to embrace new idea and charitable events.' No other approved phones or cameras were allowed on the beach for the sake of privacy. The event also promised to be a 'creep-free zone'. However, beautiful aerial photos were taken at long-range to capture the carefree moment the throng ran into the ocean. The first ever Skinny Dip Challenge was held in 2014 and was marred by cold, windy conditions which left a few too nervous to drop their dacks. 'We couldn't have asked for more different or better conditions than we had last year. It was 32, 33 degrees and just spectacular,' said Ms Marns. 'We did supply a lot of sunscreen which was very necessary!' 'What a fabulous day to get naked!' remarked one of the skinny dippers. 'The Skinny Dip Challenge' raised money for charity but was also a fantastic event for those wanting the opportunity to frolic in their birthday suit. 'It feels good to skinny dip – seriously, how long has it been since you last had a nudie swim?' the organisers had implored people before the event. 'You can get naked in public without being arrested,' they joked. The funds raised will go towards supporting to counsellors, research programs, workshops and school programs. 'In a society where so much focus is put on how we look and the size and shape that we are, the Butterfly Foundation strives to change this perception as well as what is promoted in health policy and practice,' said the event organisers. Ms Jimmy was moved by the experience. 'With the barrier of clothing removed, everyone could laugh and talk freely amongst each other. Bonded in our own private experience,' she said. 'There were no strangers by the end of the event.'

"If you find your hour in the gym leaves you exhausted, spare a thought for four determined British women about to embark on an epic adventure that will test them to their limits. The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia. Throughout the 8,446-mile journey, the women will have to spend  two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months solid. Scroll down for video . The women (front to back, Laura, Natalia and Emma) will be alone on the vast ocean for six months of mentally and physical activity .

The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia, which will involve spending two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months . Apart from issues like sleep deprivation, adverse weather conditions, injury, salt sores, sun exposure and potential equipment malfunction, the coxless crew also need to train themselves to deal with psychological challenges of  monotony, confined living quarters and limited contact with the outside world. That's on top of the fitness and strength training needed to take on the momentous rowing feat. Yet, the formidable foursome set to  embark on this exceptional journey - in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris - describe themselves as 'ordinary'.

The coxless crew, who are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors, have just over two weeks to go before they embark upon their voyage. Taking on the challenge of a lifetime: Isabel Burnham,  Laura Penhaul, Emma Mitchell and Natalia Cohen will row the Pacific in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris . Laura said: 'We say that this row is 85 per cent psychological in how we cope and 15 per cent physical, but our psychological state will be affected by being dehydrated, calorie deficient, sleep deprived and hormone imbalanced. So if we can optimise these variables then it will will help our mental state.' Natalia added: 'Our mental strength is going to be vital. I believe that we all have our own Pacific to cross, in whatever form that comes. 'We want to empower others to have faith  and dig deep to fight and overcome whatever adversity life throws your way. I believe you can do anything you set your mind to.' So how are the brave four ensuring they are in peak mental and physical health? We look at their intense preparation for the dangerous journey of a lifetime. The team (left to right) Isabel, Emma, Natalia and Laura on board their pink boat, Doris, where they will be spending six months as they row 8,446 miles . Emma and Laura in action on board Doris: The four formidable women about to embark on this exceptional journey, describe themselves as 'ordinary' PILING ON POUNDS AND MUSCLE . Natalia said: 'Our physical training  involves weight sessions to increase our lean muscle mass and strengthen certain key areas of the body to help prevent injury. 'The main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts, bench press, leg press, seated row, single arm row and core strengthening.' The women are also channeling their efforts into gaining weight. They need to increase their body weight by ten to 15 per cent in lean muscle and fat for reserve energy stores. That’s between seven to ten kilos each. The cabin where the team will spend most of their time is  the size of a small-to-medium two-man tent . 'It's not quite as fun as it sounds,' she added. 'Drinking wine and eating lots of cakes and chocolates is unfortunately not the answer to this challenge. 'The weight has to go on in a controlled way, alongside a tailor-made exercise and weight training regime. 'We need lots of protein shakes along with high volumes of red meat, chicken, fish, eggs and nuts, while still  maintaining balance with fruit and vegetables - not to mention the massive intakes of carbohydrates required to power us through the physical work. SAYING GOODBYE TO SLEEP . During the row the women will enter a polyphasic sleep pattern by taking short frequent naps as opposed to the normal monophasic pattern, which is a seven or eight hour block. 'We've done a 48-hour row where we practiced the two-hour on and two-hour off sleep pattern we will be rowing out on the ocean,' says Natalia. 'As long as we can manage to get one full sleep cycle (on average between 45 to 90 minutes) into each shift, we believe the body will have enough time to rest, repair and allow hormonal release as necessary.' And are they testing their exhaustion limits by limiting sleep before the big adventure? 'There's no point,' Natalia said. 'We know we'll be sleep deprived for six months. There's no benefit of being sleep deprived for longer.' The coxless crew (left to right): Isabel Burnham, 30, Emma Mitchell, 29, Laura Penhaul, 31 and Natalia Cohen, 40 all have day jobs and describe themselves as 'ordinary' DEALING WITH STRESS . 'It’s all about recognising what stress feels like for each of us,' Natalia explained. 'What happens to our bodies on a physical and emotional level and how do we behave? 'We will each react differently and while some may be more open, for some of the team we have had to learn how to read each other’s body language to know how they are feeling if they are not vocal about it.' In order to be attuned to each other's behaviours, the women look out for what type of faces they might be pulling, whether they are fidgeting or if there's there something unusual about their behaviour. 'We have practiced coping strategies that draw on  breathing techniques, imagery, music or mantras and mental scripts to help us deal with the stressful situation the most efficiently,' Natalia said. BONDING AS A TEAM . The women didn’t know each other before and have united solely for the purpose of this expedition. 'Through exercises given to us by our sports psychologist Keith Goddard, we have learnt to understand each other’s personality types and why we work in a certain way,' she said. 'We have developed a great team dynamic where we play to each other’s strengths and support development with any weaknesses. 'We do reflections and feedback sessions regularly after an event, so that we can check that we are happy with how everyone is performing and working and that when we receive constructive feedback we don’t take it personally. 'It’s all about learning from situations, ensuring that we continually develop, being effective and having trust in each other and the strength of the team. Natalia Cohen, one of the Coxless Four team at GSK's Human Performance Lab, where the team simulated part of their expedition to assess how many litres is optimal for each of them to drink . The Coxless Four team rowers, Isabel Burnham (far left) and Emma Mitchell (second left) with team-mates Natalia Cohen and Laura Penhaul (top and bottom on rowing machines) STAYING POSITIVE . 'Our minds are the most powerful tool we have to tap into and again and we will need to draw upon our coping strategies and techniques to keep us upbeat and in the moment,' says Natalia. The key, she explains, is to break everything down into manageable sized chunks. 'When we start rowing, we will need to take it stroke by stroke,' she says of getting back on the oars after a two-hour sleep. 'We will undoubtedly have days that are harder than others and I think when one person is having a really bad day, some else may be having an OK one.' KEEPING FOCUSED . Staying focused is a major challenge for the team. 'The second we spot land when coming into Hawaii can be celebrated for a moment but that does not mean that we have arrived,' Natalia said. There could still  challenging days still ahead before they pull into the harbour and the danger of relaxing, is that the team loses focus. 'The way we can overcome this is by ensuring that mentally our end point of each leg is something way beyond just seeing land for the first time. 'We need to project much further than that and have something like the water hitting our face from a shower in our accommodation to signify the end point of each leg. 'That way our focus remains strong and constant through the last few days, the arriving into port, clearing and cleaning Doris and then finally heading to the accommodation for a shower! Only then can we relax and know that we have safely arrived.' The coxless crew ,  are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors . Left to right: Natalia, Isabel, Emma and Laura look forward to reaching labd - but won't allow themselves to get excited until they're in the shower . TAKING THE HEAT . The team had physiological testing with GSK Human Performance Lab to simulate part of their expedition. The women will be rowing across the equator in extreme temperatures  during the six-month odyssey. 'We had salt and lactate testing done while rowing in a temperature controlled chamber in 40 degree heat and 40 per cent humidity so that we know how many litres it is optimal for each of us to drink and how much salt we lose through sweating,'  Natalia said. The team will share the highs and lows of their arduous and epic expedition via a live tracker on their Coxless Crew website and on their Facebook and Twitter pages.

"A woman lost her happily ever after on Wheel of Fortune after she answered the names of Snow White's seven dwarfs incorrectly, although she appeared fully confident with her answer. The category was characters, and she only had six letters missing from a 41-letter, eight-word puzzle. When it came her turn to solve it, she - incorrectly - named the Snow White's seven dwarfs as Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneaky and Sleepy. The category for the round was 'Characters', and it appeared that the letters in the puzzle were forming the names of Snow White's seven dwarfs . She even already had more than half of 'Sneezy' filled in, only missing the z, which means she would have spelled 'Sneaky' incorrectly in her final answer. The audience gasped at her wrong answer, and host Pat Sajak turns to her to say, 'I'm sorry. Jordan it's your turn.' Jordan knew the answer and confidently says 'Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy'. He even paused dramatically before saying 'Sneezy'. When the contestant (center) says 'Sneaky' instead of 'Sneezy' she loses her chance and Jordan, the contestant to her right, takes the win by saying the names of all seven dwarfs . Contestant Jordan correctly named all seven dwarfs: Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy . This comes less than a month after a contestant made headlines for a remarkable correct guess at a two-word, 17-letter, puzzle using only one letter. With only the letter on the board - T - in the category of 'event', the contestant named Rufus managed to correctly solve the puzzle within seconds. His response was greeted with a huge round of applause, while even Sajak appeared shocked. His remarkable guess bumped his prize money up from $1,700 to $7,100 and earned him a handshake from a very impressed Sajak.","A woman on Wheel of Fortune had only six letters missing from a 41-letter, eight-word puzzle in the category of 'characters'

"An NC State player directed some pretty sour words at President Obama after the eighth-seeded Wolfpack advanced to the Sweet 16 with a win over the No. 1 Villanova Wildcats on Saturday night. NC State's Anthony 'Cat' Barber appeared to curse at the president while addressing his teammates in the locker room following the squad's unexpected 71-68 victory. President Obama had picked Villanova to defeat NC State and advance all the way to the NCAA title game before ultimately falling to undefeated Kentucky. Scroll down for video . After NC State's big win, Anthony 'Cat' Barber (pictured center, No. 12) directed a curse at President Obama . The 20-year-old guard (right) had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in the 71-68 victory on Saturday . NC State's win over No. 1 seed Villanova busted Obama's bracket as he had the Wildcats going to the final . While the team was huddled up in the locker room after the win, Barber questioned why President Obama picked against the Wolfpack. He appeared to say: 'What the f**k [is] wrong with Barack Obama?' Obama did have the NC State-Villanova matchup correct on his bracket. It doesn't really matter, because the Wolfpack are back in the Sweet 16. Forward BeeJay Anya said: 'We came out today with the feeling that everybody expected us to lose to a one seed. 'But we believe in ourselves and that we're good enough to beat anybody in the country and we went down and did it.' Villanova saw its 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009 . It was a huge win for the eighth-seeded Wolfpack and they will move on to the Sweet 16 in Syracuse, New York . President Obama has been releasing his bracket for seven straight years. He has only selected the correct tournament winner once. The POTUS predicted the North Carolina Tar Heels would win the NCAA title in 2009 and they delivered. If Kentucky wins it all this year, it will be the second time President Obama picked the big winner of the Big Dance correctly. President Obama has  only selected the correct tournament winner once in six previous public attempts . After Saturday's win, Barber and backcourt mate Desmond Lee shared a long embrace as their teammates danced around the court in celebration. He turned to Lee, pounded his chest and yelled: 'All heart!' The 20-year-old guard had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in the win. Barber got the nickname 'Cat' when he was a child after his sister Pam noticed his quick moves, according to MaxPreps. The Wolfpack (22-13) have designs on their own big March run and will move on to Syracuse, New York to play the winner of the Louisville-Northern Iowa game. Trevor Lacey led them with 17 points and Abdul-Malik Abu had 13 points, 12 rebounds and absolutely destroyed the Wildcats inside. Coach Mark Gottfried said 'We respect Villanova, but we've seen good teams. 'We've seen a lot of them in our conference. 'You see them about every night. So a league like that prepares you for games like tonight.' NC State has wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play. Villanova lost after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament . Villanova (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009. The Wildcats come up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener. Coach Jay Wright said: 'I know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again. 'We have to own that. 'But it's not going to define us within our program.

"San Francisco 49ers player Chris Borland, a leading rookie last season, is retiring from the NFL at age 24 over health concerns related to repeated head trauma, ESPN and the team said on Monday. ESPN reported he was retiring over health concerns related to head trauma, an issue that has rattled the league and prompted a massive lawsuit against the NFL. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told ESPN's Outside the Lines. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.' He continued: 'I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.' Scroll down for video . San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . Borland, who played college football at University of Wisconsin, played just one year in the NFL with the 49ers . The 49ers did not specify in its statement why Borland chose to leave after just one season. 'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision.' Borland, a linebacker, was a star in his only season with the team, registering 108 tackles, a quarterback sack and two interceptions, and earned several rookie of the week and rookie of the month honors. An ankle injury in December ended his season. He has had two prior concussions and said he notified the 49ers of his decision on Friday, which the team confirmed. Borland, who had two concussions prior to retirement, made his announcement on Friday. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' he told ESPN's Outside the Lines program . The third-round NFL Draft choice said he was being 'proactive' despite feeling 'as sharp as I've ever been.' 'I'm concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it's too late,' Borland said. 'There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen.' He becomes the most prominent NFL player to turn his back on a rich contract, a four-year deal worth just under $3million in Borland's case, over concerns about brain injuries. The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing . His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football . NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it means for football as a whole . San Jose Mercury News's Tim Kawakami and NFL.com's Michael Silver highlighted what Borland's retirement meant for the larger sport of football. 'I used to think that 99% of players wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from this-- the game, the fame, the lifestyle. But...' Kawakami wrote. 'But the perspective is changing. Chris Borland just put himself at the forefront of that, and he obviously did it with a lot of thought.' 'I understand the compulsion of 49ers fans to see this through team-centric eyes, but Borland's decision is bigger than that, obviously,' Silver wrote. Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt mentioned that this announcement might allow other players to be more open about concussions. Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt said that Borland's retirement could allow for other players to have more open discussions about concussions . Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision . 'Borland news may not lead to more players retiring early but may lead to less players inclined to hide and play through the head trauma,' Brandt wrote. Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision. 'Looking at the number of early retirees in the NFL this month, You'd better believe the Junior Seau story has a lot of people thinking,' Farrar wrote. A class-action lawsuit involving thousands of former players, filed in 2012, contended that the league hid the dangers of brain injury among players while profiting from the sport's violent physical contact. There have been suicides in recent years by former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson. In February, a U.S. judge refused to accept a proposed settlement between the NFL and the players, saying payment should be expanded for some players and families among other concerns.","Chris Borland, a leading rookie in 2014, turned down four-year, $3million contract .

"Miss McVey was answering a question on mental health, Mr Bercow interjected to ask her to hurry up . House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of sexism after likening a female minister to a kitchen appliance. Mr Bercow said the Conservative Employment Minister Esther McVey was like 'washing machine' that keeps going just when it appears to have stopped. He intervened as the former GMTV presenter was giving her fourteenth response to questions in the Commons. Miss McVey was answering a question on mental health, Mr Bercow interjected to ask her to hurry up. He said: 'I am reminded of the feeling when one thinks the washing machine will stop — but it does not!' MPs questioned whether the Speaker should be likening a female minister to a domestic appliance. Ealing North Labour MP Stephen Pound said: 'A washing machine metaphor for a woman minister is seldom a good idea. Let's see how he spins his way out of this one!' Angie Bray, Conservative MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said it was an 'unnecessarily rude' put-down. She said: 'I'm not sure it's for him to criticise the style in which she chooses to answer her questions.' Miss McVey also appeared put out by the Speaker's remarks. When SNP MP Dr Eilidh Whiteford asked the next question, on claims that the Tories are planning to cut 30,000 jobs from the Department for Work and Pensions if they win the next election, the minister simply replied: 'For the sake of brevity and clarity, those figures are not true at all.' The Speaker added: 'That was exemplary brevity and clarity, I must concede.' Mr Bercow regularly interrupts during Commons debates to ask for contributions to be as short as possible so more MPs can have their say. The Speaker is an increasingly divisive figure in Parliament after being appointed in 2009 after a secret vote with many Tories accusing him of being biased towards Labour. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow was accused of sexism after likening Miss McVey to a kitchen appliance . But The Speaker has defended his controversial record by arguing that his moves to modernise the Commons have got parliament 'off its knees'. Miss McVey, 47, has shot through the Tory ranks to attend Cabinet after being elected an MP in 2010. The glamorous former TV presenter, appearing on ITV's Loose Women last month, raised eyebrows after admitting she wanted to become Prime Minister. Miss McVey was asked by Janet Street Porter – who was the MP's boss when she started in television – if she had designs on Number 10. The Tory cabinet minister said: 'To be honest, it is not as simple as that. But if I had to do a yes or no I'll be honest and say yes.'","Speaker accused of sexism after likening Miss McVey to kitchen appliance .

"Taxpayers had to stump up the $600,000 legal bill for a workers' compensation claim by a public servant who was injured during a motel sex romp it was revealed on Wednesday. The infamous ‘sex-in-a-motel claim’ rumbled on for six years after the woman suffered cuts to her nose and mouth as well as ‘psychological injuries’. This all came about when a glass light fitting was pulled from the wall of the motel room as she had ‘vigorous’ sex with a local man in Nowra in November 2007. Public Service Minister Eric Abetz is making changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering' Public Service Minister Eric Abetz revealed the cost of the claim as he engineered changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering’, by Commonwealth bureaucrats. The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000, including the costs of the bureaucrat's own lawyers and barristers. ‘The flaws in the system were highlighted in lurid terms by the infamous ""hotel room sex case"", where a Commonwealth public servant successfully sought workers compensation for an injury sustained on a work trip, after hours, while engaging in sexual activity,’ the minister says in The Canberra Times. The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000 . ‘Thankfully the decision was ultimately overturned by the High Court, but at significant cost to the scheme, which had to pay more than $600,000 in legal costs to defend the spurious claim, including for the legal costs of the libidinous claimant.’ Legislation introduced to the Parliament on Wednesday can save federal government agencies up to $50 million in their insurance premiums each year by making sweeping reforms to the much-maligned public service compensation scheme. Senator Abetz said that, rather than paying them to stay at home, his reforms would help turn Comcare into an insurer that helped get injured public servants back to work.","The infamous ‘sex-in-a-motel claim’ rumbled on for six years .

"The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation released a wide-ranging report on Monday declaring that the world's 'pace of change' on the rights of women and girls 'has been far too slow. But the report, called 'No Ceilings,' comes at a time when the Foundation is under fire for accepting large cash infusions from countries that the State Department has accused of discriminating against women and committing other human rights abuses. Those nations include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hillary and Chelsea Clinton spoke at the 'Clinton Global Initiative University' at the University of Miami on Saturday . ENGAGEMENT: Secretary of State John Kerry (second left) met with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud on March 5; the Clinton Foundation report mirrors the Obama administration's willingness to engage with governments of countries where women have fewer rights than men . The foundation told The New York Times that no foreign governments contributed toward producing the reports, but in the nonprofit world funds are fungible and it's unclear how anyone could wall off the project from the questionable donations. Former president Bill Clinton defended the foundation's work Saturday in Miami, saying that millions of dollars from the UAE and the Saudis in particular had no impact on its work. 'Do we agree with everything they do?' Clinton asked, 'No.' 'You’ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.' The report, issued simultaneously in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, is a 46-page update on progress made globally since Hillary a 1995 United Nations conference held in Beijing declared: 'Women’s rights are human rights and human rights are women’s rights.' The foundation released its report a day after International Women's Day, an annual March 8 observance that was shortened this year in the U.S. with the beginning of Daylight Savings Time. The symbolism of a shortchanged 23-hour American observance seemed tailor-made for the report's wordy scolding. 'Security is tenuous for women and girls, even in their own homes,' the Clinton Foundation writes in 'No Ceilings.' 'Critical barriers – including legal restrictions and limited access to resources – undermine women’s economic opportunities.' 'And women’s voices are still underrepresented in leadership positions – from legislatures to boardrooms, from peace negotiations to the media,' the report reads. The report is long on one-two punches, acknowledging some progress on specific issues but insisting that it's unsatisfactory. 'Today, more than four out of five [national] constitutions have some mechanism to guarantee gender equality,' the foundation says, 'but rights on paper often go unenforced – and many legal barriers remain.' 'Globally, women and girls are living longer and healthier lives, and the rate of maternal mortality has nearly halved,' but 'women and girls in certain regions and communities confront high rates of HIV, poor care during pregnancy and childbirth, and limited access to family planning.' And while 'many significant gender gaps in education have closed,' the report reads, 'gaps remain and marginalized girls lag farthest behind.' 'Poor, rural, minority, and conflict-affected girls are significantly less likely to be educated,' the authors write. The 'No Ceilings' report, issued March 9, 2015, traces the global progress of women since a 1995 UN conference in Beijing . The foundation's partners on the 'No Ceilings' project include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Economist Intelligence Unit, UCLA WORLD Policy Analysis Center and Fathom Information Design. Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. Senator and first lady, is touting the report at a politicall vulnerable time. Last week the Times revealed that throughout her tenure as America's top diplomat she used only a self-hosted private email address. That has already brought talk of subpoenas from congressional Republicans and led some groups in Washington to reconsider whether the government's responses to past Freedom of Information Act requests could possibly have been complete since Clinton's emails were not turned over to State until last last year. Tom Fitton, presdient of Judicial Watch, told Daily Mail Online that his froup has already file nine new FOIA requests related to Clinton since the email news story broke. 'And there are a few others we may seek to reopen,' Fitton said, 'because they led us to believe they had searched her emails.' 'But obviously that hasn't been done.' Judicial Watch said as many as 160 of its past FOIA requests against the federal government could be affected, along with 20 past and present lawsuits.","Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei have donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation .

"A vicious fight between teenage girls that was caught on camera is under investigation by the Houston Police Department. Footage of the brawl was shared on Twitter on Sunday night. The police department learned of the scrap after a user tagged them in the video on the social networking site. One video shows a group of girls gathered in a parking lot before one of the teenagers, who is wearing blue jeans, forces another girl to the ground and repeatedly punches her in the face. The girl on the ground attempts to protect her face with her arms but her attacker gets several punches in before getting up and apparently stomping on the girl's face. Violent: Two girls can be seen fighting in a parking lot in Humble, Texas. The video of the incident was widely shared across Twitter on Sunday night and caught the attention of the Houston Police Department . Scrap: Other girls stand by and watch as the fight - just one caught on camera that day - unfold before them . After the attack, the girl remains sprawled on the floor, apparently unable to get up, and is helped to her feet by two friends, according to the video first shared byKPRC 2. During the fight, bystanders watch and shout words of encouragement rather than alerting authorities. Another video also shared online shows the same girl in blue jeans in a fight with another girl, apparently at the same parking lot. In that footage, the two girls drag each other across the parking lot by their hair as onlookers continue to shout at them. Two teenagers in the video told KPRC that they went to the parking lot after learning that the fight was going to be held near to an elementary school in Humble. But Humble Independent School District said the fight did not take place on a school's campus. Brutal: In an even more disturbing cell phone video, the girl in blue jeans pins a different girl down and repeatedly punches her before stomping on her head . 'It is unclear if those involved are students, but school district police and administrators will be viewing the video to assist investigators in identifying those involved,' it said in a statement. The Harris County Sheriff's Department and the Houston Police Department are investigating. They have not yet responded to comment on whether any arrests have been made or if any of the girls in the video have been identified. It is also unknown what injuries the girls sustained in the fight. After the video was shared online, one Twitter user sent a message to the Houston Police Department tagging one of the girls but her profile has since been removed.","Two unidentified teenagers can be seen brawling in a Houston parking lot in a video that was widely shared online on Sunday night .

"Three dogs were killed after a swarm of bees attacked and stung them to death in the backyard of a Santa Ana home where they lived. The animals' owner, Linnea Chapman, found her Australian Shepherds, Bartlett, Bailey, and Remy dead in the backyard and covered in bees on Tuesday night. The swarm of Africanized honey bees had made a large hive inside of an old cabinet in their neighbors' backyard, and the bees had become angry from the dogs barking and attacked, according to Santa Ana Animal Services. Scroll down for video . Australian Shepherds Bartlett, Bailey and Remy (pictured above) were found dead by their owner Linnea Chapman in the backyard of the Santa Ana home . The swarm of Africanized honey bees stung the bees and had made a hive inside of an old cabinet (pictured above) located in the backyard of a neighbor's home . On Tuesday night, Linnea (pictured above) came home from grocery shopping when she found it odd the dogs were not barking as usual . 'It's surreal. It is heartbreaking. It's devastating,' said Linnea. Animal Services said this was the first time there had been a fatal attack like this in Santa Ana, according to KTLA. On Tuesday night, Linnea had come home from grocery shopping when she suspected something was wrong when she did not hear the dogs barking. She went into her backyard with a flashlight which is when she first found the oldest dog, Bartlett, and was shocked. The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive inside the cabinet of the next door neighbors . She said: 'I went out and stumbled across the first one. I couldn't believe it. I said, 'Wake up. Wake up' and then I saw the second and then the third.' Linnea and her husband, who do not have children, grieved the loss of their beloved pets who were like family, and who they had owned since they were puppies, according to NBC Los Angeles. The dogs had been barking at the pool cleaner which agitated the bees. They eventually attacked and stung the animals, said Sondra Berg from Santa Ana Animal Services. Sondra Berg (above) from Santa Ana Animal Services said the bees became agitated after the dogs were barking at the pool cleaner . Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since removed the hive (pictured above dead bees from the hive) She also said there were thousands of bees found in the backyard. The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive in the backyard of the Chapmans' elderly neighbors, which was near to where the dogs' bodies were found, according to police. Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since been called to the neighbors' home to remove the hive. Linnea plans to have necropsies performed on the dogs so she can learn exactly how they passed away.","Owner, Linnea Chapman found her Australian Shepherds dead in the backyard on Tuesday .

"Patrick Strudwick had a tumour removed from his large intestine seven years ago, aged 30 . The question, at first glance, seems fairly simple: would you want to know your chances of getting cancer? In particular, whether you are carrying a faulty gene (or even several) that could make cancerous cells or a malignant tumour more likely. But when the opportunity arose to have genetic screening to find out if my DNA was flawed, this question merely triggered more: how would I cope if it turned out cancer was a near certainty? Though certain genetic tests are available on the NHS for people with a clear family history of a particular cancer — for example, if more than two members of your immediate family have had it — the private Spire Bushey Hospital, in Hertfordshire, has become the first to offer full screening for a range of cancers to people who may have had only one or two family members affected. Some genes they test for, in particular the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2, have received a lot of publicity in recent years. Angelina Jolie discovered she carried a faulty copy of BRCA1, and singer Michelle Heaton found she had a mutated version of BRCA2. They opted for double mastectomies and hysterectomies to avoid the 60 to 90 per cent chance of developing cancer. But this new service screens for dozens of different genes linked to prostate, bowel, breast and ovarian cancers, which are among the most common in Britain, using ‘next generation’ gene technology to provide a full range of results within 12 weeks. There were various reasons why I decided to give it a go. Seven years ago, aged 30, I was lying in a hospital bed, heavily sedated after a colonoscopy to find the cause of months of abdominal pain, when my gastroenterologist delivered the news: . ‘We found an adenoma — a type of tumour — in your large intestine. It was about an inch long, but we managed to remove it.’ ‘OK,’ I replied from the fog of sedation. Though the tumour was benign, the doctor added: ‘The type means that it would likely have become malignant. Had we not removed this, you could have been dead by 40.’ Because such growths are rare for someone so young, I was told I would need to have colonoscopies every three years to (hopefully) catch any further abnormalities. Three years later, a scan found another polyp — smaller, benign, but still, more reason to worry. Another year on and I was lying in another bed, my own, when the telephone rang. ‘They found some cancerous cells,’ my father began. It was his prostate, a common cancer in older men (he was 67) and one with pretty good prospects for survival. But his uncle — my grandfather’s brother — had died of it. And my father’s tumour was one of the most aggressive kinds. He made a full recovery, but the worries lingered. Could there be a faulty prostate cancer gene on my father’s side? My mother was adopted and knows nothing of her family, so might there be bowel cancer genes on her side? Could there be two loaded guns waiting for me? Patrick (pictured) decided to have genetic screening for cancer to find out whether or not he is predisposed to particular strains of bowel and prostate cancer . The final push to take the tests came down to the memory of a dear friend called Beth. Gorgeous, fiercely clever, with a wonderful family and a promising career ahead, she died from malignant melanoma — skin cancer — on her back in 1999. She was 26. So, if there was anything I could do to catch cancer before it caught me, I’d do it, I decided. I booked an appointment with the hospital’s genetic counsellor, Vicki Kiesel. Her hour-long assessment included umpteen questions: ages of siblings, who’d had children, ages of grand- parents at death, who’d had which cancers and when; my medical history, why I wanted screening. Vicki was most concerned about the adenoma. ‘If there is anything in your family to watch for, it would be something called Lynch syndrome,’ she told me. ‘It’s a genetic mistake that makes people more likely to get bowel cancer. With it comes an increased risk of prostate cancer.’ Lynch syndrome can also trigger endometrial, stomach, ovary, brain and skin cancers. If I did have this gene, how great would be the risk of bowel cancer? ‘Up to about 70 per cent,’ she said. Spotting my panicked expression, she told me there were several things they would do to reduce the risks: ‘Colonoscopies every 18 months or so to catch any polyps before they become malignant, and daily aspirin.’ (A recent review of studies on aspirin by Queen Mary University of London concluded that a daily low dose for ten years can reduce the risk of colon cancer by 35 per cent.) ‘After the age of 40 we would also suggest regular PSA tests for prostate cancer,’ she said. If I had Lynch syndrome, my siblings would have a 50 per cent chance of having it, too, so I’d need to tell them. However, Vicki also explained that only 5 to 10 per cent of cancer occurs because of genes — most cancers have an environmental cause. And Lynch syndrome accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent of bowel cancer. The problem, I feel, with all of these statistics is this: they mean nothing if you are one of the few per cent affected. I opted to have screening for every gene we so far know about that can trigger prostate or bowel cancer — 12 genes in total — and went to have the blood taken. For the next ten weeks I refused to think about it, pretended it wasn’t happening and told no one. When I received an email from the clinic saying my results were back and did I want them in person or over the phone, I froze, completely unable to decide. Angelina Jolie (left) discovered she carried a faulty copy of BRCA1, and singer Michelle Heaton (right) found she had a mutated version of BRCA2, they both opted for double mastectomies and hysterectomies . I chickened out and asked for a phone appointment. During the few days before the call, I spoke to Colin Elton, a consultant colorectal surgeon at the Spire Bushey Hospital, to find out his take on how useful these tests might be. ‘There’s not enough awareness among GPs and hospital doctors of the benefits of genetic testing,’ he said. ‘Even if someone does have a family history of one type of cancer, and if they are sent to a genetic counsellor by the NHS, they still might not have the actual testing if the counsellor doesn’t think the chances are high enough. ‘But this screening gives people who might have only one parent or sibling the chance to test — and it’s one of the most common questions family members of cancer patients have: “will I get it, too?” ’ In fact, the NHS might not offer testing because only a small percentage of cancers are caused by genetic problems, says Shane McKee, a consultant clinical geneticist at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. He also casts doubt on the screening you can pay for outside the NHS, as family history does not need to be as strong in order to get the tests, which makes analysing the results harder. Another problem is there are likely to be 200 genes responsible for a significant risk of cancer, but we know of only half of them. Patrick (pictured) was incredibly relieved to learn that his genetic screening came back normal although he says he will do everything he can to lower the risks of cancer . Cancer Research UK also advises caution around genetic screening. ‘Knowing that you have certain genetic faults doesn’t always mean there’s any action you can take,’ says a spokesman. But Dr McKee is clear about the benefits of specific genetic cancer tests, particularly for bowel and breast cancers. ‘The objective is to see if we can identify people at increased risk at an early stage, so we can put surveillance programmes in place. Most cancers are treatable if they are caught at an early stage.’ It was this risk reduction that made any lingering doubts about taking the test vanish. I braced myself. Vicki rang with the news. ‘We’ve looked at the 12 genes and they’re all normal.’ ‘Thank God,’ I replied. As I hung up, the relief was almost overwhelming. Later, though, I reminded myself that this only puts me back to similar levels of cancer risk to anyone else and that I might still have a cancer-causing gene we don’t yet know about. I must still do what we all should to lower the risks: keep my weight down, restrict alcohol, don’t smoke and take exercise. I must remain vigilant — for me, for my family and for Beth.","Patrick Strudwick had an intestinal tumour removed  seven years ago .

"The Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show has dismissed the outrage surrounding the way her handler picked up the Scottish terrier as 'pure trolling'. Marina Khenkina, 48, spoke out after finding herself at the centre of an animal cruelty storm, sparked by the way her American handler Rebecca Cross picked up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail at the world-famous dog show. So far, almost 190,000 people have signed online petitions calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title, while Crufts has also issued an apology. Scroll down for video. Anger: American handler Rebecca Cross picked up her Scottish terrier Knopa by the tail - sparking outrage and calls for her to be stripped of the Best in Show title . Legitimate: Marina Khenkina, the Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show is adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails . Marina Khenkina (right) has spoken out after finding herself at the centre of an animal cruelty storm, sparked by the way her American handler Rebecca Cross (left) picked up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail . Ms Cross, who was captured on camera picking Knopa up in the unconventional manner on Sunday, has apologised - but said it was usual to handle the terrier in this way in the States. 'It's just one of those things,' Ms Cross said afterwards. 'It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.' Mrs Khenkina, who was at Crufts watching over her prize-winning canines, has now waded into the scandal - nicknamed 'Tailgate' - backing Knopa's handler. The Moscow dog breeder is adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails. 'I saw those rumours about cruel behaviour of my handler and I would call it pure trolling,' she told MailOnline. 'Those who say such things have no idea about terriers. Terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes. 'And the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail.' Mrs Khenkina also praised the strong bond between Ms Cross and the black Scottish terrier. 'I know Rebecca, the handler, for a long time. She loves Knopa,' she said. 'Hurting her is the last thing in this world she would do. This is just trolling.' Tailgate: Marina Khenkina (pictured) said handler Rebecca Cross loves Knopa and 'hurting her is the last thing in this world she would do' Murdered: Knopa's owner said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at Crufts was 'terrible news' Marina Khenkinais adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails: 'Terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes. And the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail' But Tailgate was not the only scandal at this year's Crufts: as many as six of the competing dogs may have been poisoned, while three-year-old Irish Setter Jagger was 'murdered' after eating cubes of beef laced with poison, including slug pellets. Mrs Khenkina, speaking from Poland, said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at Crufts was 'terrible news'. 'I did not know about it when I was in England, I only read in the news on my way back to Moscow - I am driving from England to Russia now,' she said. 'It's not for me to say who might have done this.' However, others online joked Knopa may be a Russian spy, and President Vladimir Putin, desperate to win the sought-after title of Best in Show, could be behind the death - noting the Russians apparently have form with poisoning on British soil. In particular, the tweets cite the death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in 2006 after meeting with Russian associates in a top London hotel. 'The winning dog was from Russia, so it wouldn't be a surprise if the poison turned out to be polonium [the radioactive substance used to kill Litvinenko],' Carl Maxim (@carlmaxim) tweeted. Paddy Power has even offered odds of 12/1 on Putin being behind the dog's death. Trolling: Marina Khenkina, the Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show, has dismissed the outrage surrounding the way her handler picked up the Scottish terrier as 'pure trolling' Veteran: Facebook page shows Rebecca Cross, who has a baby daughter, previously served in the military . Nearly 100,000 people have now signed an online petition, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title . But Mrs Khenkina was contemptuous of any idle jokes - and quick to make clear she had nothing to do with Jagger's death. She said: 'If anyone is comparing this to the story with Alexander Litvinenko, this is rubbish. 'These two things have nothing in common. The dog world is a completely different place and people don't do things from a political motive here.' Mrs Khenkina said she was watching another ring show the day Jagger was allegedly poisoned, adding she did not care about setters because 'it is not my breed at all'. She insisted: 'Our victory was a fair and clear one. We are sure in ourselves and in our victory, although we did not expect it at all. It happened so suddenly.' Light-hearted: Some Twitter users have joked Russia, desperate to come out on top at Crufts, may be behind the killing of Jagger . Scandal: Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium from the world famous show . Disgrace: Mrs Khenkina said the poisoning was a 'disgrace' - and emphasised the world of canine competitions was completely separate from the political arena. Pictured: A Crufts competitor . In fact, Mrs Khenkina revealed she is always prepared to go and help, should another animals become sick. 'Real Russian dog owners are special people, they care for their dogs and puppies, they raise them with love,' she explained. 'We prefer to save somebody else's dog. I always carry a full vet kit with me, maybe breaking the laws of other countries, crossing the borders with it but I need to have it with me and I glad to say that I did save dogs in my life and I did not care what country they belonged to.' She added: 'I have been breeding and exhibiting dogs for many years and I know that dogs can be poisoned at shows. 'In the turbulent 1990s such a case took place in Russia. There was also an incident in Poland and in other countries, but I have not heard about such cases in England before. 'It is an ugly and nasty thing to do, and it must be so hard for the owners. It is a disgrace for the breeders.' Apology: Ms Cross (pictured in the arena) apologised, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit' Celebrations: Mrs Khenkina - whose moment of glory was almost ruined when an animal protester stepped out into the right - is determined to enjoy her victory, and not let anything overshadow it . But Mrs Khenkinka is determined not to let any of this get the way of celebrating her beloved dog's victory. '[My friends] are all so happy about out victory - that a Russian dog, bred in America but Russian-owned, won the first prize. And think how politically beautiful it is, both for Russia and for America,' she said. 'And the dog's full name is To Russia With Love, after all.' It is far from the first victory for the five-year-old Knopa, who was born in America. 'Knopa has won many titles before Crufts,' Mrs Khenkina said, proudly. 'She was the junior World Champion, Junior European Champion, Interchampion and many other titles, and I was handling her myself two years ago when we got a title at Crufts too.'","Owner Marina Khenkina has defended American handler Rebecca Cross .

"A 15-year-old girl has revealed how Islamic State fighters killed her brother and sold her as a sex slave to three men. Samiye is one of hundreds of women who were kidnapped by extremists from a Yazidi community on Iraq's Mount Sinjar last August.

Her story is not uncommon. Women and girls, some as young as five, are regularly raped and abused, survivors said. Bahar, 27, was captured by militants while she was trying to flee her home. She was raped twice - once in Mosul and the second time in Syria when she was caught escaping. Another survivor Hawain was held prisoner for a month and a half before she escaped from captivity. The 14-year-old cannot bear to recount what happened. Fahima, 33, and 13-year-old Dina were also taken. The victims said the militants deprived them of food, water and a place to sit.

ISIS consider the Yazidi sect to be devil worshippers and, unlike Christianity and Judaism, the religion is not acknowledged in the Koran. The majority of the Yazidi community have been made homeless by ISIS, with hundreds massacred and thousands in captivity. The Khanke refugee camp has become the home of more than 1,000 Yazidi and Iraqi families - close to 4,000 people. Families at the camp are still desperately searching for missing people in the hope they are still alive.

The drawing, which looks like it could have come out of the Dark Ages, illustrates ISIS militants holding men and women captive. Some men have their hands chained around their necks while others  are killed by militants with long knives. Semi-naked women are clutched by groups of men. Some are forced to the floor while others are pushed between large groups.

They were captured by ISIS militants while trying to flee Sinjar, she explains. She does not know where they are or if they are alive. Sabri, 45, is missing fourteen members of his family. His mother and father, three sister-in-laws, two nieces, four brothers and two cousins were all captured by  militants during a raid last year.

The human rights office published a horrifying report yesterday describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists, suggesting they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. ISIS, which controls a swathe of territory in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, launched a series of systematic and widespread attacks on the Yazidi minority's heartland in the northern Nineveh province last August. Kurdish peshmerga forces drove back Islamic State militants in north-western Iraq last month, breaking a long siege - but many Yazidi villages remain under ISIS control. The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report yesterday describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. The report, which was ordered by the UN Human Rights Council last September following a request from the Iraqi government, pointed out that some villages 'were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population'. Boys as young as eight were forced to convert to Islam and given religious and military training, including being forced to watch videos of beheadings, the report said. The UN has now made calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice at the International Criminal Court.","Samiye was captured and sold as a sex slave to three men by ISIS fighters .

"Seven months after he was forced to sell the L.A. Clippers amid a racism scandal, Donald Sterling is still in a highly contentious lawsuit with the NBA. The 80-year-old real estate mogul has added his wife Rochelle (called Shelly) and two doctors to the $600 million lawsuit, according to the most recent filing last week. In this latest filing, Sterling's lawyers claim that Shelly and  two doctors worked 'secretly' with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to strip him of his team. 'Conspiracy': Former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling (right, in black) has added his wife Shelly (left, in white fur) to a $600million lawsuit, claiming she conspired to force the sale of the team last year. The Sterlings pictured above attended a Clippers game in March 2005 . Claims: Sterling also mentioned his former girlfriend V Stiviano in the latest filings, claiming the recordings she taped of his racist rant was edited but provided no evidence. Stiviano pictured above walking around Los Angeles on August 5, 2014 . 'The NBA and Silver isolated Rochelle from her husband and scared her into undertaking certain conduct hereinafter alleged, including the signing of papers ... that she did not understand,' the  complaint reads. 'All of this conduct constituted elder abuse.' Silver, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, banned Sterling from the NBA for life last year and hit him with a $2.5 million fine after tapes were released of Sterling speaking racist slurs. The doctors mentioned in the suit, Dr Meril Platzer and Dr James Spar, evaluated Sterling last May and found him mentally unfit to continue controlling his family trust, which included the Clippers. But Sterling claims that his wife Shelly 'fraudulently induced' and 'fraudulently arranged' the mental evaluations, and that the two doctors violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by releasing his medical records. '[The defendants] colluded and worked toward a common goal in causing injury to Sterling's financial interests,' the complaint reads. Sterling also mentions V. Stiviano, his ex-girlfriend who recorded the tapes that exposed his racism. 'Several of the statements on the recording were not made by Sterling,' the complaint reads. 'The statements alleged to be those of Sterling were apparently altered by Stiviano or her agents.' It does not offer evidence as to how the tapes could have been edited. Furthermore, he claims that the release of these medical records, and the subsequent loss of his team caused him to suffer 'extreme mental distress...including worry, anxiety, anger, embarrassment, sleeplessness and fatigue.' Shelly's lawyer Stephen Smith told the Los Angeles Times that the recent filing was 'desperate and frivolous'. Sterling is asking for $600 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages. The NBA counter-sued Sterling last August, saying that Shelly's participation in the Clippers sale means that Sterling is effectively suing himself. Some $1billion from the record sale is currently being held in an escrow controlled by the NBA, in the event that Sterling is forced to pay out to the league, Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini explained.","The former L.A.

"A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been  introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price . A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

Officers found the little girl 10 hours later after being flagged down by citizens who saw her looking filthy and barefoot. When she was interviewed by police, Miss Carroll said she had been drinking at the spa and at around 10pm stepped out to 'clear her head,' leaving her daughter inside with an acquaintance, reported Dallas Morning News. However, a King Spa worker told NBC 5 that the mother and daughter left the establishment together after attending a party with friends. When police finally caught up with the 7-year-old girl at around 11.15am Sunday, she told them that when she and her mother left the spa, Carroll suddenly took off running. The child claimed that Carroll told her they were being pursued by police and had to go into hiding. According to investigators, Carroll then placed her daughter in a garbage container in a 'high-crime' area and fled. The little girl eventually fell asleep amid refuse and woke up only 10 hours later. She was able to scramble out of the dumpster and began walking down Royal Lane towards the spa. Passersby spotted her on the street walking without shoes and called police. Officers who responded to the scene described the child as thirsty, hungry, and covered in filth and cuts to her arms and legs.

"A friend of Jewish schoolgirl Anne Frank has told of the moment the two were reunited at a Nazi concentration camp - where she found her 15-year-old friend emaciated and wrapped only in blankets as she struggled to survive the camp's harsh conditions. Nanette Konig, 85, had known Anne from school and had attended the teenager's birthday party where she received the infamous diary in which she went on to detail her life hiding from the Nazis. After being captured, the classmates spent around two years apart before being reunited in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Recalling their chance encounter within the camp, Mrs Konig said: 'She was depleted, wrapped in blankets because her clothes were full of lice. Scroll down for video . Nanette Konig holds a photo of herself aged 12, when she was captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She has now recalled the moment her friend Anne Frank was given a diary which she later used to detail life hiding from the Nazis . Mrs Konig holds the yellow star she was forced to wear while living in Amsterdam under Nazi occupation . 'It was really awful because she had completely wasted away. There was nothing left of her. Even today I don't know how we two skeletons could have recognised each other.' Now Mrs Konig pays tribute to Anne, who died aged 15, just weeks before the camp was liberated 70 years ago. The pair were just two of the millions of Jews rounded up into concentration camps following persecution from the Nazis. More than six million Jews were killed worldwide in the genocide. Anne's parents Margot and Otto Frank were deported to a transit camp with Anne and her sister Margot and then on to Auschwitz. When Anne and her sister were taken to Bergen-Belsen in October that year, Mrs Konig spotted her friend through a barbed wire fence. Mrs Konig said: 'I saw Anne walking on the other side of some barbed wire. 'I couldn't go near it though, I would have been tortured or killed.' But when the wire was taken down and Mrs Konig next spotted her friend, she grabbed Anne's attention and the girls met up to talk several times. 'I am the only one in that class who met her again in Bergen-Belsen. I was in camp seven and she was in camp eight. 'I met her several times and it was from Anne that I learnt what was happening in Auschwitz. 'She told me about her diary and that she wanted to use it for a book after the war, she never wanted to publish a diary. 'We talked about her going in to hiding, how hard life was in the hiding place.' Mrs Konig recalled how the girls were aware of the terrifying circumstances they were in. Anne Frank died aged 15 at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Her diary detailing the time her family spent hiding from the Nazis has sold more than 30million copies . She said: 'We were dreaming and we had to hope we would make it through. It was part of our survival. 'We were mature - the circumstances made us like that. We had all lost family and didn't know if we'd see them again. Everyone wanted to survive, nobody wanted to die willingly.' Anne's diary was first published in 1947 and has been translated into 67 languages with more than 30 million copies sold. Recalling the moment Anne received her gift as a birthday present, Mrs Konig said: 'Anne wanted to use the pages of her diary to write a book. 'We were dreaming of the future, it was part of our survival. 'She always wanted to be seen and heard. Anne was a girl who was full of life, she loved to talk and liked the boys. 'If she was still alive, I am convinced that she would have become an excellent writer. In the end, she got her wish to be a published author.' Mrs Konig, who was one of 60,000 survivors liberated from Bergen-Belsen by British forces. 'I saw Anne shortly before she died,' Mrs Jonig said. 'Bergen-Belsen wasn't a death camp but the conditions eliminated people. It's very emotional. She didn't make it and I did. I still see her in front of me.' Mrs Konig, who now lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil, with her husband, John, went to school with Anne Frank in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. In 1941, they were classmates at the Jewish Lyceum, a school for Jewish children no longer allowed to attend normal schools. The Frank family had already fled Germany following persecution and moved to the Netherlands along with 300,000 other German Jews. The pupils in these schools were taught by Jewish teachers who had been removed from their posts at normal schools. Mrs Konig said: 'I sat behind Anne in class and we were friends. I remember she always wanted to be seen and heard. 'We were all friends in class. We were aware of the circumstances so we all supported each other. 'You knew leaving the house, you might not make it back.' By March 1942, thousands of Jews had been persecuted and the first trainload had reached Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Headstones mark the location of mass graves at the site of the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, where Anne Frank died . Pictured are the interior barracks at Birkenau, Auschwitz, where Anne and her mother were detained for part of the war . The curfew enforced between 8pm to 6am meant that the children were unable to see each other in the evenings. But on 12 June 1942, the children in Mrs Konig's class got the chance to spend time together when Anne turned 13 years old. At that birthday party Mrs Konig watched Anne open her parent's present - a diary. She said: 'All of our classmates were there. I remember some films were projected onto the walls – for us it was such a novelty.' In July that year, Anne Frank's family disappeared leaving a note claiming they were moving to Switzerland. Instead they went into hiding inside Anne's father Otto's jam business. Jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothes to identify them and were routinely rounded up to be shipped to concentration camps. The family stayed undetected for two years inside the secret complex, hidden on the top floor of the business. In February 1944, Mrs Konig was taken to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, unsure whether she would ever see her friend again. In August 1944, everyone hiding in the secret annex inside the business was arrested. The family had been betrayed but it has never been established by who. Auschwitz (pictured) was used as a death camp by the Nazis during the Second World War. Although Anne was transferred out of the prison, she later died at Bergen-Belsen . Pictured is the main entrance to Auschwitz, where trainloads of Jewish prisoners were carried into the facility . A pile of shoes offer a chilling insight into the wholesale slaughter which took place at the Nazi death camps . Pictured is a pile of the Auschwitz victims' luggage, inscribed with their initials and place and date of birth . She remembers the roll calls at the camp. 'They made us stand for 36 hours,' Mrs Konig said. 'They pulled me out and when they did I began to shake because I did not know what would happen. 'I was really lucky because the officer fired into the air and sent me back into the row without torturing or killing me. I survived by pure chance.' When she was able to, Anne talked to her friend about wanting to become a published author. But she would not live to turn her diary in to a book herself. In March 1945, Anne and Margot both contracted typhus - a bacteria carried by lice and ticks - just three weeks short of the British forces liberating the camp. After the war, Anne Frank's father Otto met with Mrs Konig and told her he was considering publishing his daughter's diary. Mrs Konig recalled: 'I said, 'do it.' Then in 1947 the first diary was published. I think Anne would be pleased with it.' Anne told Mrs Konig (pictured) that she always wanted to be a writer and hoped to publish her diary after the war had ended . In 1949, Mrs Konig moved to London, got a job as a bilingual secretary and shortly afterwards met her husband, John Konig, 88. Two years later, they married and moved to South America together, to start a family. The couple of 62 years have three children, Elizabeth, Judy and Martin. Now Mrs Konig spends her time travelling around the world, giving presentations in schools and universities, to educate people about the Holocaust. She said: 'If by chance you survived, you have a duty to speak for those who can't. 'So that the world knows the disaster to the Jewish community. But above all, so that a thing like the Holocaust never happens again. 'Two thirds of the community - nine million people - lost their lives.'","Anne Frank was given the now infamous diary at her 13th birthday party .

"Police, midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether s o-called designer vagina operations fall within female genital mutilation laws, a group of MPs have said. The Government has previously said the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 does not contain any exemptions for cosmetic surgery and it has no plans to amend the legislation specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery. But in a report on FGM, the Home Affairs Select Committee said despite Government reassurances  there is still confusion and the Act should be amended to make it clear female genital cosmetic surgery would be a criminal offence if conducted on girls under 18 without  physical or mental health justification. The Government says it has no plans to amend the FGM Act specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery . Committee chair Keith Vaz said: 'The law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified. We cannot tell communities in Sierra Leone and Somalia to stop a practice which is freely permitted on Harley Street.' The number of cosmetic genital surgeries - or labiaplasties - performed by the NHS has risen five-fold since 2001, with 2,000 operations being carried out in 2010. However, many operations are performed in private clinics, which do not have to submit statistics to the government. Labiaplasty is the most common form of cosmetic genital surgery and involves reducing the size of the labia so they do not protrude. It is feared that the rise in demand for cosmetic genital surgery is a result of what doctors have called 'unrealistic representations of vulval appearance in popular culture'. The Committee warned there is a 'chasm' between the number of reported cases of FGM and the lack of prosecutions. In Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham alone, 1,500 cases of FGM were recorded over the past five years with doctors seeing six patients who have undergone the procedure each week. Keith Vaz said 'the law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified' The first prosecution under the FGM Act resulted in a not-guilty verdict when Dr  Dhanuson Dharmasena was cleared of performing the illegal procedure on a woman in a London hospital. The Committee said different authorities, including the Director of Public Prosuections Alison Saunders, were passing the buck for failure to prosecute FGM cases. Mr Vaz said: 'The DPP informed the Committee that she could only prosecute on the basis of evidence, the police said that they could only investigate on the basis of referral, and the health professionals told us that they could not refer cases because their members were not fully trained and aware of the procedure. 'While agencies play pass the parcel of responsibility, young girls are being mutilated every hour of every day. This is deplorable. This barbaric crime which is  committed daily on such a huge scale across the UK cannot continue to go unpunished.' Mandatory reporting of FGM by healthcare professionals, teachers and social care workers to the police has been introduced to the Serious Crime Act, however, the Committee said what happens to those who fail to report a case remains unclear. The group of MPs recommended that the Government set out the sanctions that may apply when a professional has failed to meet their duty, which should range from compulsory training to a criminal offence for intentional or repeated failures. Some 170,000 women and girls are estimated to be living with FGM in the UK. More than 2,603 women and girls who went through FGM have been treated by the NHS since September 2014 with  499 women and girls with FGM seen in acute NHS trusts in England in January alone. More than 200 FGM-related cases were investigated by the police nationally in the past five years. Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said:  'Female genital mutilation is a crime and it is child abuse. 'The coalition government is bringing in new civil orders to protect girls before they can be subjected to FGM, through the Serious Crime Act, and measures to punish parents who fail to prevent their daughters being cut. 'We have also introduced legislation to grant victims of FGM lifelong anonymity, from the time an allegation is made, in order to encourage them to come forward. Our cross-government FGM unit is listening carefully to campaigners and those living with the effects of this harmful practice. 'In addition, we are introducing a mandatory duty on professionals to report FGM. We believe this will provide clarity for professionals on their responsibilities and give them the confidence to confront FGM. It will aid police investigations and support an increase of the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted. 'We are clear that failure to comply with the duty will be dealt with through disciplinary measures that can include referral to a professional regulator or the Disclosure and Barring Service. This will ensure that all breaches are dealt with in accordance with the specifics of the individual case.'","Government said FGM Act has no exemptions for cosmetic surgery .

"An investigation has revealed how factory workers in China risk contracting a potentially fatal disease to produce jeans for fashion labels Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters. Employees at a factory where the two companies source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look. The practice is known to be dangerous and has been banned in some countries after being linked to deaths from respiratory disease silicosis. Dangerous method: Secret footage taken during an undercover investigation shows workers in Chinese factory which supplies Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters continue to use sandblasting . The short programme, titled 'Denim Blues' and due to be aired on Al Jazeera on March 19, also exposed poor working conditions and environmental damage resulting from the industry in the Chinese city of Xintang, known as the jeans capital of the world. The video, shot by an undercover researcher, captured employees working at a frantic pace in a factory known as Dongguan Tiangxiang. Chemicals lie haphazardly around the room and workers use a potent chemical called potassium permanganate without wearing proper protective masks. The secret footage also shows sandblasting going on in the factory and the labels of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister, owned by A&F, are clearly visible. Secret footage: In the short film, an undercover researcher discovers an Abercrombie & Fitch label at a factory where jeans are being sandblasted . Part of initiative: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) jeans are also seen in the footage. The company joined an initiative in 2011 to help boycott the practice . In 2011, AEO joined an initiative spearheaded by Levi and H&M  to boycott the controversial production method known as sandblasting. In a company statement, the popular brand said: 'Until we believe that proper controls can be put in place to ensure sandblasting is done safely, we are no longer developing new styles with sandblasting.' Jeans with a distressed, already-worn appearance have been popular since the 1990s and method to create the effect is by blasting them with sand. Manual sandblasting of jeans requires only a hose, an air compressor and sand - workers literally blast the material with sand to give them a faded look and to soften the denim. Constant exposure to minute particles used in the process can lead to accidental inhalation, and later respiratory disease silicosis. Silicosis is caused when small particles of silica dust from the sand embed themselves within the lungs. The incurable disease causes shortness of breath, coughing, weakness and weight loss and in its acute form is fatal. When asked by investigators about their supplier's continued use of the practice, they claimed the sandblasting facilities had been removed but did not say when. A spokesman said: 'AEO has thoroughly investigated the factory Dongguan Tim Cheung (here referred to as Dongguan Tianxiang) and has verified that all sandblasting equipment has been removed from the factory.' Abercrombie & Fitch also appeared to dispute the evidence, claiming: 'Yes Dongguan Tiangxiang produces goods for us. We don't allow vendors to use sandblasting during the manufacturing process of our goods.' On their website the world-famous brand says: '[We are] proud of our commitment to international human and labor rights, and to ensuring that our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities. 'We partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilizing the best practices in human rights, labor rights and workplace safety. 'Abercrombie & Fitch believes that business should only be conducted with honesty and respect for the dignity and rights of all people. Health risk: A bucket of chemicals lies exposed in the Dongguan Tianxiang factory, where AEO and Abercrombie & Fitch source their jeans . Dirty environment: The footage shows how working conditions in the factory are a long way from what Abercrombie & Fitch customers might imagine . Employees at a factory where Abercrombie & Fitch and AEO source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look . Sandblasting is dangerous as constant exposure to minute particles in the process  can lead to silicosis. In 2009, Turkey banned the process after hundreds of former workers were diagnosed with the disease. Dozens of others have died. The method is still legal in China and some workers run mobile sandblasting services travelling between factories - and they  are paid around 4p for each pair of jeans. Factory managers refused to discuss the process, but workers speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed the controversial practice continues. One worker told Al Jazeera: 'The main problem with sandblasting is the dust. This means you risk getting silicosis if you are not properly protected.' Some workers say they suffer not only from lung problems but also from allergies caused by dyes and other chemicals used in the making of denim. Al Jazeera will be airing the show on Thursday March 19.

"Microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand. The move was rumoured in December but now the Redmond-based tech giant has said it will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan. It is believed the new browser will look more like Google's Chrome browser and be faster than Internet Explorer. Scroll down for video . Farewell familiar friend: Microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand (logo pictured) and instead will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan . Microsoft's marketing chief Chris Capossela said the company is working on a new name for the browser, which should be in Windows 10. ‘We’ll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we’ll also have a new browser which is code named Project Spartan. We have to name the thing,’ he said at Microsoft Convergence. The new browser will be the main way for Microsoft 10 users to access the internet, although Internet Explorer will continue to exist, The Verge reported. The re-branding move is unsurprising as Microsoft has tried and largely failed to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure and has regularly made ‘worst tech products of all time’ lists. The browser, which does not yet have a name, is likely to be rolled out with Windows 10. The new operating system marks the return of the Start Menu, which has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8 (pictured) The company is thought to be testing names using market research, but so far no final name has been announced. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. Capossela mentioned that putting ‘Microsoft’ in front of the secret name boosted the browser’s appeal to some Chrome users in the UK, suggesting the company’s name could appear in the final brand. Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet first shared the rumour of a new browser in December. 'Microsoft is building a new browser, codenamed Spartan, which is not IE 12 - at least according to a couple of sources of mine,' she wrote. Thomas Nigro, a Microsoft Student Partner lead and developer of the modern version of VLC - a media playing app - claimed on Twitter in December that he heard Microsoft was building a brand-new browser. 'However, if my sources are right, Spartan is not IE 12. 'Instead, Spartan is a new, light-weight browser Microsoft is building.' It is believed Windows 10 will ship with both Spartan and IE 11 to ensure compatibility with all web sites. Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995, but since then it has gained a lacklustre reputation. A stock image showing the software package in 1998 is pictured . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Last year, it was derided for 'missing one' when it announced  it has decided to jump straight to version 10 of its Windows software in a bid to convince consumers the software is different from current versions. The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco. It admitted the software was 'at a threshold' after the poorly received Windows 8. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief said: 'There's about one and a half billion people using Windows today. 'Devices outnumber people. 'Windows is at a threshold and now it's time for a new Windows. 'Our new Windows must be built from the ground up for a mobile first, cloud first world. 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9.' Microsoft said its new operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever' and will see various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Last year, Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, explained how Windows 10 will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm's XBox One games console . The new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes (pictured) The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8. Mr Belfiore demonstrated how the new tiles in the new menu can be personalised and re-sized. This will cover all of the company's smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. Myerson said Windows 10 will be 'a whole new generation' and, as expected, works across a variety of devices - from phones to gaming consoles. It also sees the return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8 to many users' annoyance. In addition to offering a list of a user's favourite applications, the menu brings up re-sizable tiles - similar to those featured in Windows 8's touch-centric interface - on PCs and tablets. The current version, Windows 8, has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioral changes. Microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that Windows 10 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of Windows they are now using. 'Windows 10 will deliver the right experience, at the right time. 'Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform, ever,' said Mr Myerson. 'We're delivering one application platform. One store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased, and updated across all of these devices.' The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco in December. It will run on tablets, phones , desktop computers and even the firm's Xbox games console - and come with a yet-to-be-named browser . Industry experts have been having their say on Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, which was announced at an event in California in December 2014. Many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company's previous desktop software, Windows 8, and that is reflected in industry reaction. Stuart Miles, founder of technology website Pocket Lint said: 'The initial reaction is that Microsoft had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of Windows 8. 'It looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of Windows 8, but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price, there is still much left to learn. 'That said it looks to be a good move from the Redmond based company and one that will benefit many.' Geoff Blaber of technology analysts CCS Insights also noted the need for Microsoft to regain support after Windows 8. 'Windows 10 is the product of a difficult Windows 8 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback. Microsoft will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers, enterprise and consumers of its One Windows strategy', he said. 'With Windows 10 Microsoft has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the Cloud first, mobile first vision under Satya Nadella. This open, collaborative approach is critical if Microsoft is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued Windows 8 since launch. 'The unveiling of Windows 10 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise. This dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving PC market growth. 'Developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that Microsoft's 'One Windows' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement.' Windows 10 is designed to bring together all of Microsoft's different hardware, such as a the surface tablet (left) and the Xbox One (right) under the same software . Across desktop PCs as a whole, only 13.4 per cent currently run Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, according to research firm NetMarketshare. By contrast, it says 51.2 per cent are powered by Windows 7 and 23.9 per cent by Windows XP, a version that is no longer supported by Microsoft. The start menu in Windows 10 will appear similar to what's found in Windows 7, but tiles opening to the side will resemble what's found in Windows 8. Joe Belfiore, a Microsoft executive who oversees Windows design and evolution, said Windows 10 will offer 'the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the benefits that exist in Windows 8' to help business users make the transition. Belfiore said that the company was going 'back to basics' with Windows 10, and confirmed that the famous Start menu, which was removed from Windows 8, would be returning. 'We're looking to find the balance, so that all the Windows 7 users get a familiar experience on the devices they already have,' he said. 'It gives the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the elements of Windows 8.' He said that going from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is like going from a Prius to a Tesla. 'They don't have to learn any new way to drive.' Mr Belfiore also confirmed that Windows 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch-based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices. Users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do. Although the new software won't be formally released until later this year, analysts have already said that its success is crucial for Microsoft and new CEO Satya Nadella.","Microsoft confirmed its web browser will have a new name - but it's secret .

"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz laid down a marker Tuesday on global warming, saying that denying human activity is heating the planet makes him a renegade truth-teller in the mold of the Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei. Climate activists, he said in a half-hour videotaped interview, 'brand you a heretic' if you disagree with them. 'Today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers,' he told the Texas Tribune. 'It used to be: ""It is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat."" And this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier,' Cruz said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Texas Tribune political reporter Jay Root's one-on-one interview in New York City with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas' junior senator and the nation's first declared 2016 presidential candidate, included a series of jabs about global warming . 'DENIERS': Ted Cruz says his dissent about climate change is like the 17th century astronomer Galileo's refusal to believe the Sun revolved around the Earth . The comments will likely stoke the U.S. environmental movement's opposition to a Cruz presidency – which was likely to be present anyway if he should become the GOP's 2016 nominee. 'It's not like Friends of the Earth was going to endorse him, and now suddenly they're not,' an Iowa Republican political consultant told Daily Mail Online, describing Cruz as 'a smart guy whose new pronouncements will cost him nothing.' Americans, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, ranked climate change at the bottom of a list of six environmental concerns, with those saying they care a 'great deal' falling by 2 percentage points since last year. 'Even as global warming has received greater attention as an environmental problem from politicians and the media in recent years,' pollsters wrote, 'Americans' worry about it is no higher now than when Gallup first asked about it in 1989.' And then there's Galileo: The story goes that he aroused the ire of Rome by contradicting Catholic Church teaching at the time, which held that the Sun revolved around the Earth. He was forced under pain of death in 1633 to recant his claim that the Earth revolved around the Sun, but calmly said after his release from a dungeon: 'Eppur si muove' – Italian for, 'And yet it still moves.' Cruz's 'flat-Earther' epithet is likely misplaced, since Galileo never staked his career on a claim that the Earth itself was round. That was well-known by the time he was an influential scientist. But the Texas senator's Galileo analogy is a direct slap at environmentalists, calculated to set him apart from more moderate Republicans expected to enter the presidential race soon. Cruz can fire up his base and raise money quickly, the Iowa consultant said, by 'casting himself as a swashbuckling crusader' against the economic impacts of limits on carbon emissions. 'You know, we shouldn't be causing millions of hard-working men and women to have their energy bills go through the roof,' Cruz said Tuesday, talking about what he sees as the result of government climate policy. 'It causes real harm and suffering when people all across this country lose jobs because the federal government wants to take control of aspects of our lives. ... That's not something we should do lightly,' he said. Cruz's wide-ranging interview touched on Obamacare, gay marriage, marijuana policy and his disdain for 'one-size-fits-all' legislative approaches often crafted in Washington, D.C. But it's his position on carbon emissions and the fate of the planet that will likely raise the temperature of his opponents on the left. 'I am the child of two mathematicians and scientists. I believe in following evidence and data,' Cruz said. 'And the global warming alarmists, anyone who actually points to the evidence that disproves their apocalyptical claims, they don't engage in reasoned debate. What do they do? They scream, ""You're a denier"".' CLIMATE TYCOON: 'Al Gore has made millions of dollars off of global warming,' Cruz said . GLOBAL COOLING? Bostonians would be hard pressed to fret about rising temperatures following one of the snowiest winters on record this year . As evidence, he pointed to data from heat-sensing weather satellites. 'The satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years,' he emphasized. 'Now that's a real problem for the global warming alarmists. Because all those computer models on which this whole issue is based predicted significant warming, and yet the satellite data show it ain't happening.' He also said the federal government itself is perpetuating a money-mill premised on a scientifically bankrupt ideology. 'There are an awful lot of people making a whole lot of money,' he said. 'Al Gore has made millions of dollars off of global warming. And a lot of these scientists who are most vocal about it are receiving massive grants on this theory that the data are not backing up.' A Washington Post blogger hammered Cruz on Wednesday, calling his comments 'just baffling.' 'Scientists that studied the satellite data to which Cruz refers,' Post writer Philip Bump wrote, 'reject the idea that it somehow disproves the idea that human activity is making the world warmer.' 'Cruz's comments, from start to finish, are simply not correct,' Bump claimed. Adding insult to insult, the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board wrote Wednesday that Cruz's campaign was 'off and bumbling,' castigating him for 'positioning himself against an overwhelming consensus among the world’s preeminent climate scientists.' That followed a Sunday interview on the NBC program 'Meet the Press' where California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said Cruz's position on global warming makes him 'absolutely unfit to be running for office.' But the senator isn't backing down. 'EPPUR SI MUOVE': Galileo was forced under pain of death to recant his claim that the Earth revolved around the Sun, but when he was let out of prison he still insisted: 'And yet it still moves' 'I read this morning a Newsweek article from the 1970s talking about ""global cooling"",' he told the Texas Tribune. 'And it said the science is clear, it is overwhelming, we are in a major cooling period, and it's going to cause enormous problems worldwide. ... Now, the data proved to be not backing up that theory.' Then, he recalled, 'advocates of global cooling suddenly shifted to global warming.' And later, he said, the terminology changed again to 'climate change.' At each stage, Cruz claimed, green activists promoted central authority over the nation's energy economy as a solution. 'When someone keeps proposing the same solution regardless of the problem, you start to think maybe they just like government control of the energy sector and every aspect of our lives,' he jabbed. Cruz's home state of Texas is famed for its oil and gas wells, and for its Gulf coast refineries. His position is most typically backed by politicians who represent Americans in other energy-rich states like coal-wealthy West Virginia and oil-heavy Alaska. A Cruz spokeswoman did not respond to a request for clarification about how he resembles Galileo.","In Texas interview, he says it was once 'accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier'

"The White House is reportedly considering a new power play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would paint Benjamin Netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come-from-behind victory in his country's hotly contested elections. In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue. Under a plan outlined by Foreign Policy magazine, the U.S. State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The White House cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on Thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic, saying only that it would 'evaluate what our path is forward' is in light of Netanyahu's comments. NOT SO FAST ... The White House is considering a Netanyahu smackdown in the form on United Nations leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with Palestinians . WATCHING AND WAITING: State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is evaluating its options – leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a UN two-state solution pushed on Israel . The U.S. and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship. A former top-level Obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with Netanyahu's political opposition – even as the president refused to meet with Netanyahu this month, saying he didn't want to influence the election's outcome. The Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday. Diplomats at the UN privately learned in the run-up to Election Day that the U.S. would not press the UN Security Council on peace talks if Herzog were to win, since he would likely have carried the ball on his own. But with Netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties opposed to a Palestinian state, all bets are off. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that 'we’re currently evaluating our approach. We’re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.' The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reiterated the administration's position on Thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the United States' part. He also refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's victory, stating that, obviously, the president was 'aware' of it when asked by a reporter if Obama was 'disappointed' with the election results. Complicating the situation, the Palestinian Authority says it might take grievances against Israel, stemming from last year's brief Gaza war, to the International Criminal Court. The Palestine Liberation Organization’s top diplomat in the United States explained to Foreign Policy that the PA could formally accuse Israel of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks. Israel has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians, but insists militants from the Hamas terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire. Turning to the ICC for redress would prove costly for Palestinians, however. The United States provides about $500 million in annual aid to the PA, and $400 million of that is drawn from an Economic Support Fund that members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off. The U.S. has paid out approximately $5 billion in aid money to the Palestinian Authority since the 1990s, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service – representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community. But at the end of January an astonishing 75 out of 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry warning that any Palestinian action against Israel in the ICC would be met by a budget axe. The 2015 budget appropriations bill, signed by Obama, explicitly prohibited funding for the PA if it were to initiate – or even actively support – an ICC probe related to war crimes accusations against Israel. BIG CHILL: President Barack Obama has had the frostiest relationship with Israel of any US leader since the 1970s . The senators warned Kerry that Abbas was illegally challenging 'Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory.' PA President Mahmoud Abbas officially joined the ICC late last year. In the days following the seating of the new Congress in January – long before Netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win – the State Department seemed to lean toward supporting the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters then that action in the ICC could have unspecified 'implications' for future U.S.-Palestinian aid. 'Congress has a great deal of power in that regard,' she said. But administration officials are now leaning toward using the United Nations to force Netanyahu into a tricky spot. 'We are signaling that if the Israeli government’s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward,' a U.S. official told Politico. And Jeremy Ben-Ami, who leads the pro-Israel but left-wing group J Street, told the paper that he expects the Obama administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining, or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the UN to restate the parameters for ending the [Arab-Israeli] conflict.' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough's remarks to the group on Monday at its national conference in Washington, D.C. could shed further light on the administration's position. The Israeli election, and the Obama administration's reactions, come against the backdrop of U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions and Netanyahu's forceful objections that a nuke in Tehran would be an existential threat to Israel. Kerry, America's top diplomat, phoned Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory, but did so from Switzerland where he was meeting with his Iranian counterpart. President Obama called the Israeli leader Thursday afternoon, the White House said.","Obama may end US opposition to a UN Security Council resolution designed to force Israel into a two-state solution with Palestinians .
White House is upset that Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected, especially on the U-turn promise that he wouldn't  agree to a Palestinian state .

"Two months after he was acquitted of a domestic assault charge, former Washington Redskins defensive back Fred Smoot revealed in a candid interview that it was his jilted girlfriend who left him bleeding during a fight over car keys. Smoot, 35, was arrested last November in Virginia after his ex-girlfriend, Valerie Jackson, accused him of attacking her when she asked to borrow his truck. Jackson later claimed that she believed Smoot wanted to keep her from seeing boxes of condoms and generic Viagra pills inside his vehicle. Speaking out: Former Washington Redskins player Fred Smoot (left) has come out accusing his ex-girlfriend of fabricating lies about domestic abuse that landed him in jail and left his career in tatters . Allegations: Valerie Jackson claimed in November that Smooth busted through the bathroom door and attacked her after she asked to use his truck to go to work . The 'he said, she said' case made national headlines after Jackson posted a series of photos on her Instagram documenting her injuries allegedly caused by her 5-foot-11, 192-pound football player boyfriend. In January, a judge in Virginia acquitted Smoot of misdemeanor domestic assault. In custody: Smooth, 35, was charged with domestic assault charge but was acquitted in January . During the bench trial, Smoot did admit to kicking down a bathroom door in an effort to retrieve a set of car keys from Jackson. On Wednesday, the former Redskins player sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox5 to address the domestic violence allegations and the fallout from the scandal. Looking sharp in a grey vest and matching tie, Fred Smoot told the station that by November 2014, his four-month relationship with Valerie Jackson had ended, but he let her stay in his Ashburn, Virginia, home until she could afford to get a place of her own. Jackson had previously claimed that on November 23, an enraged Fred Smoot busted through the bathroom door to grab his car keys out of her hands and attack her. While Smoot admitted that the dispute did start over the keys, he claimed he had no intention of harming Jackson. ‘So what I did was step back and I kicked the door and put a little hole in it, and opened the door and got my keys from it,’ Smoot said. ‘After I realized I had broken my door, I went and tore the stuff off so I could take the door down to put a new door up.’ Smoot also addressed his ex-girlfriends infamous Instagram photos showing blood on her gums and bruises on her arms, which she claimed were the handiwork of her boyfriend. Body of proof: Jackson posted photos on her Instagram allegedly showing her injuries at the hands of her boyfriend, but Smoot claims that the blood on her gums (left) came from biting him on the neck . Infidelity rumors: Jackson suggested Smoot did not want her to see the generic Viagra and condoms he had in his car. But Smoot claims they had broken up before the November fight, and Valerie was upset that he was seeing other women . In Smoot's retelling of the story, however, it was he who was left bloodied as a result of the confrontation. The 35-year-old athlete pointed out that in the photo Jackson's teeth are intact, suggesting that she was not struck in the face like she had claimed, but rather that the blood seen along her gum line came from biting him. ‘She bit me on the neck so bad that when I went to CBS and stuff, the makeup artist used to have to brush it out so it couldn't be seen,’ Smoot alleged. Smoot also denied ever choking and striking Jackson, or being verbally abusive towards her, but conceded that the couple did get into 'arguments.' According to Fred Smoot, Jackson was jealous that he had started dating other women and concocted the domestic abuse accusations to hurt him. ‘She wanted her ten seconds of fame and she got it,’ he stated. Smoot stressed that unlike other football players who have been caught in ugly domestic violence scandals over the past few years, he was the victim in this case. Not another football player: Smoot stressed that unlike other football players who have been caught in ugly domestic violence scandals over the past few years, he was the real victim in this case . ‘Everybody kind of looked at it [and went], “Ah, here goes another football player doing the same thing,""’ he said. ‘Well, I want to let them know: “No, this is not another football player. This is the flipside of this.’ Smoot was suspended from local TV and radio jobs as a football analyst following his arrest in November, but he is hopeful about the future. ‘I just want people to know I've never touched a woman. I never will touch a woman. I want to get back doing what I love,’ he said. ‘That is TV, that's radio, that's talking sports, that's talking football, that's making people laugh, that's what I like to do.’ The footballer, who retired from the NFL in 2009, was caught up in another scandal when he played for the Minnesota Vikings back in 2006. Smoot and some fellow players were alleged to have chartered a boat to party with prostitutes in what became known as the Love Boat Scandal. At one point someone claimed he used a double-headed dildo on two of the women in front of the boat's crew. He was ultimately fined by the Vikings for his alleged actions and for being the ringleader behind the outing.","Fred Smoot was arrested in November on domestic assault charge for allegedly attacking his ex-girlfriend Valerie Jackson .

"Elon Musk has revealed two key software updates for the Tesla model S sedan that he claims will end 'range anxiety'. The first is a 'range assurance' app that communicates with Tesla's Supercharger network, warning drivers if they are about to run out of power, and pointing them to the nearest Supercharger. The second is a trip planner, which will combine the Supercharger network with the network of Model S cars to improve long-distance journeys for drivers. Scroll down for video . Tesla's software will map out the best route to a driver's destination based on the location of charging stations. It will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge . Tesla's updated software will map out the best route to a driver's destination based on the location of charging stations. It will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge via a Trip Planner app. The update will also add several safety features, including automatic emergency braking and blind spot detection. In the future, the Tesla Model S fleet will also have auto-steering and the ability to summon a car to any location. 'This makes it effectively impossible for a driver to run out of range unintentionally', said Musk. 'You'll have to confirm you want to, actually. Twice.' The Model S is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery. It can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest Supercharger. Superchargers are free connectors that charge Model S in minutes. There are currently 403 Supercharger stations with 2,219 Superchargers around the world. The latest update combines these two features, to provide more accurate warnings. Its built-in trip planner, meanwhile, will be more advanced, using real-time data such as wind speed and elevation. The announcement follows Musk's cryptic tweet over the weekend, in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month. The separate Range Assurance feature should be available in the U.S., Europe, and most of China within the next 12 months. Other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the Model S, which should be available in the next three months. 'We can basically go between San Francisco and Seattle without the driver doing anything,' Musk said. Other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the Model S, which should be available in the next three months. The technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel, acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway. The car will be able to sense its surroundings . The technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel, acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway. In the future, the company will also give driver's the ability to summon their car to any location. The Model S will also get automatic emergency braking and side collision warnings with the new update. The updates today addresses one of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars; that their battery could run out at any moment, leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby. So-called 'range anxiety' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of Tesla's Model S vehicle. The Model S is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery. It can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger. The latest update combines these two features, to provide more accurate warnings . Elon Musk (left) said that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their Tesla Model S once every three or four months. On the right is a preview of what the Trip Planner will look like . In a survey for Consumer Reports in 2012, 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars. The official range of the Model S at the moment is up to 310 miles (500km), which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers. Running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past. Earlier this month Ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style. The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house. The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford's electric and hybrid cars. CNN noted that, last year, Tesla upgraded its Tesla Roadster electric car, increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles (395 to 645km) on a single charge. This was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and, at the time, Musk tellingly tweeted: 'Should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the Model S, but it obviously *will* happen long-term.' Musk has since deleted that tweet - perhaps in anticipation of today's announcement. Tesla regularly updates drivers' software for free over the air. In January, for instance, an update increased the speed of the top-of-the-line P85D via use of 'insane mode' - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph (97km/h) in 3.2 seconds, compared to the usual 5.9 seconds. 'We've designed the Model S to be basically a computer on a wheels,' Musk said. 'We view in the same way you view updating your phone and your laptop.' Musk added that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their Tesla Model S once every three or four months. The announcement follows Musk's cryptic tweet over the weekend, in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month .","Two updates will make Model S fleet 'impossible to run out of range'

"Labour and the Scottish Nationalists could form a ‘permanent alliance’ at Westminster, it is claimed today. Despite mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant SNP, one Labour strategist has floated the idea of an enduring ‘German-style’ agreement with the party, according to the New Statesman magazine. It was described as a ‘CDU-CSU scenario’, mirroring a deal between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats with the Christian Social Union in the German state of Bavaria. Despite mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant SNP (spurred by a Conservative poster, above), one Labour strategist has reportedly floated the idea of a partnership . The CDU does not stand candidates in Bavaria in exchange for support in Germany’s Bundestag from the CSU. Labour peer Lord Foulkes, a former MP in Scotland, broke ranks last night to insist Mr Miliband should rule out any post-election deal. ‘Every Labour MP and peer to whom I’ve spoken thinks we should rule out any kind of deal with the SNP. What are we waiting for?’ he demanded. A national poll last night found 61 per cent of voters would be unhappy with a power-sharing deal involving the SNP. Labour voters were marginally more sympathetic to the idea, with 44 per cent in favour of some sort of deal, the survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft found. While the SNP has indicated it would not enter a formal coalition, it has suggested it would prop up a minority Labour government in key Commons votes in exchange for concessions. A Labour source insisted the idea of a permanent deal that would mean the party withdrawing from Scotland was ‘b*******’. The strategist reportedly claimed a deal could mirror the one held in Germany by the CDU and CSU . Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats merge with the Christian Social Union in the German state of Bavaria . Tony Blair’s £1,000 donations for each of Labour’s 106 key battleground seats have sparked a furious row in the party, after two candidates turned down the cash. The former prime minister’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell branded them ‘attention seeking’ in a furious rant on Twitter. Sally Keeble, a junior minister under Mr Blair, announced yesterday that she would be turning down the money. She was MP for Northampton North and is now trying to resurrect her political career after losing her seat in 2010 in the wake of the expenses scandal. It followed the decision by Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan to also reject the cash. Mr Campbell wrote on Twitter: ‘To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?’ Labour activists responded angrily and praised the two women refusing the cash. Labour said the money was being accepted on behalf of the whole party and indicated it was not for individual candidates to refuse.","There is mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out deal with SNP .

"Islamist rebels in Syria have captured four crew members after a government helicopter crashed today. A fifth serviceman was killed after the aircraft went down in a rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province. It experienced a technical malfunction and made an emergency crash-landing, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Scroll down for video . 'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed today in Jabal al-Zawiya . Syria's state news agency confirmed that a helicopter had crashed after a mechanical problem and said the authorities were looking for the crew. The SOHR stated that opposition fighters, including from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, had taken four crew members prisoner. Another airman survived the crash but was reportedly killed by his captors, and the fate of a suspected sixth airman is unknown, the Observatory said. SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman said: ‘A regime helicopter was forced to land in the region of Jabal al-Zawiya in the north-west, which is a bastion of (Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate) Al-Nusra Front/ . ‘Four of the crew were captured and a fifth man was killed by armed men in a neighbouring village.’ Pictures provided by the Observatory showed groups of men gathering around a damaged helicopter lying on its side on a rocky hilltop. Mr Rahman said two of the servicemen were being held by Nusra Front, while the other two were captured by an unknown Islamist group. Gathered around: Islamist rebels captured four crew members when the helicopter crashed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . An amateur video posted online showed rebels inspecting the wreckage of the helicopter, which had rolled on to its side on a rocky hill. The aircraft's blue undercarriage was partially torn and the nose badly damaged. Photographs posted by activists online showed the same crash site and at least two airmen in rebel custody. The United Nations claims the Syrian air force uses helicopters extensively to drop barrel bombs in indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. The improvised munitions are giant canisters packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and scrap metal. However, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied in a BBC interview last February that his forces used barrel bombs.","Fifth serviceman killed after aircraft went down in rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya .

"Designers are always looking for ways to make clothes as functional as possible, but one company may have taken it a step too far with a bizarre new idea.

"A first-time mother who was sent home  by doctors for an entire week because they didn't believe her waters had broken suffered infections and had to be placed on life support for three days following the horror birth. Brittany Spriggs was put in a coma at Gold Coast University Hospital after being rushed into four different surgeries due to complications during her daughter's birth on January 31. Details of her horrific story came as the hospital's chief executive Ron Calvert ordered an independent review into the high mortality rate and other issues after several complaints were made about the birthing unit. Brittany Spriggs had four surgeries and was placed on life support after she started haemorrhaging due to complications during the birth at Gold Coast University Hospital on January 31 . While a recent draft review into maternity services at the hospital confirmed the unit was safe based on a range of patient measures, Ms Spriggs said her experience left her heartbroken and wanting answers. Ms Spriggs, who was in intensive care for the first few days of her daughter Jasmine's life, says she was initially sent home from the Gold Coast hospital despite fearing her waters had broken. 'I woke up at 39 weeks to a pool of water in the bed. I went back to sleep thinking it was my waters breaking. I went to the hospital that morning but they told me to go home because it was just a watery discharge,' she said. 'I really should have trusted my instincts because I went to my midwife appointment at 40 weeks and she told me I was a centimetre dilated.' Ms Spriggs was in intensive care at Gold Coast University Hospital for three days and wasn't awake for the first few days of her daughter Jasmine's life . While Ms Spriggs had to be induced, everything was going smoothly until her baby's heart rate  dropped. 'They went in to break my waters but they’d already broken at 39 weeks... So there was infection there and issues around that.

'I was put under when we got to theatre because the epidural was only working on one side and they didn't have time to fix it.' Doctors performed an emergency caesarean and Ms Spriggs had just started to come around when she started haemorrhaging and had to go back to theatre. 'I said to the surgeon: 'Please don't let me die'. I don't remember anything until I woke up in intensive care three days later.' Ms Spriggs had to have four surgeries to stop her haemorrhaging and doctors still haven't been able to tell her how it happened. She believes an artery may have been cut during her caesarean but doctors haven't confirmed that. 'My husband was gowned up but I had to be put under so he couldn't come in. He had no idea what was happening. He was pacing up and down the hallway for hours,' she said. 'The surgeon came out seven or eight hours later saying I was on life support and our daughter was in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit).' Her family took heartbreaking pictures of Jasmine lying on her mother's chest while she was still in a coma with tubes coming out of her body. 'It's actually quite a big blur... I don't remember the first moment I saw or held Jasmine,' she said. 'For the whole nine months I was imagining her being born, but both my husband (Jacob) and I didn't get to experience that.' Ms Spriggs says holding her daughter Jasmine for the first time was a blur because she was slowly being released out of a coma . The first-time mother was brought out of her coma after three days and spent several more in the maternity ward before she discharged herself . Ms Spriggs says doctors told her the birthing horror was an isolated case and it had never happened in the years they had been practising. 'I didn't search for answers at first because I thought it had just happened to us. Now I'm hearing more stories about (complications) there and now I'm thinking why is this happening so much,' she said. A Gold Coast Health spokesperson said it was well within expectation that difficult and complicated births take place. 'Over a hundred difficult cases occur annually and this is one such example,' the spokesperson said. 'Our dedicated maternity team delivered over 4,300 babies in the last year and the number of families choosing Gold Coast University Hospital is increasing at a rate of over 15 per cent annually. 'When a woman experiences difficulties due to childbirth it can cause concern and distress to staff involved as well as those people directly affected. 'All complicated births are reviewed and discussed as part of an ongoing commitment to service. Where necessary such cases are followed up with further investigation in order to determine if there are lessons to be learned in future cases.' Janie Lerch says she was left traumatised after giving birth at the hospital when a chunk of skin was taken from daughter Layla's head (above) as the midwife tried to break her waters . Her now nine-month-old daughter Layla still has a scar from where the wound healed . Janie Lerch says she was left traumatised after giving birth at the hospital when of chunk a skin was taken from her newborn's head as the midwife tried to break her waters. Her now nine-month-old daughter Layla still has a scar from where the wound healed. 'I didn't expect everything to be picture perfect, but I didn't think it was going to be like that,' Ms Lerch said. 'I'd already been in labour for 24 hours when the nurse told me to lay down so she could break my waters. She tried to do it but it was causing me excruciating pain. I was screaming and crying it was that bad.' Ms Lerch went in for an emergency caesarean hours later and woke to find her newborn daughter had a cut on her scalp. 'Her dad showed me the cut on her head. I was quite bewildered. It's not like an incision from the caesarian - it was like a wound,' she said. Ms Lerch claims nurses did little to help her or her daughter. 'They’re meant to be there to care for you, but I don’t believe they cared for us,' she said.

"Beers and ales have been brewed for centuries but it appears the taste hasn't changed all that much during this time. Chemical analysis from two bottled drinks found on a shipwreck in Finland has revealed their similarities to modern-day lagers. This includes high levels of ‘green leaf’ flavours, sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent. Chemical analysis from two bottled drinks - known as A56 (pictured) and C49 - found on a shipwreck in Finland has revealed their similarities to modern-day lagers. This includes high levels of ‘green leaf’ flavours, sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent. The bottles date back to the 1840s . The bottles were found in the summer of 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the Baltic Sea. It was found at a depth of 165ft (50 metres) just off the coast of the Åland Islands, Finland. Archaeological evidence suggests the shipwreck occurred during the 1840s, but the schooner’s name, its destination, and its last port-of-call have not yet been identified. The cargo consisted of luxury items, including more than 150 bottles of champagne, and five bottles that look like typical early 19th century beer bottles were also brought to the surface. One of these cracked in the divers’ boat and the liquid that foamed from the cracked bottle looked and, according to the divers, tasted like beer.

One of these cracked in the divers’ boat and the liquid that foamed from the  bottle looked and, according to the divers, tasted like beer. Initial taste tests said beers were ‘vinegary, goaty and tasted of sour milk’ and this said to have been caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years. But when experts  chemically analysed the samples they discerned specific flavours such as 'green leaf, sweet apple and rose.' Initial taste tests said the beers were ‘vinegary, goaty and tasted of sour milk’ and this said to have been caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years. But when experts from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and  the Technical University of Munich tested the beers they pinpointed specific flavours. The experts took samples from two of these bottles – known as A56 and C49 – and analysed their physicochemical characteristics and flavour compounds. They also analysed six reference beers including Leffe Brune, Koff Porter, Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier, Paulaner Hefe Weissbier, Aldaris Porteris Alus, and Olvi Sandels. The results were normalised to make sure the ethanol concentrations in the ancient beers matched, or were within the range of, those found in the reference beers. ‘Bottles A56 and C49 were similar brown glass bottles,’ explained the researchers. ‘Bubbles of gas, presumably CO2, formed during sampling, producing a light foam. ‘Both beers were bright golden yellow, with little haze. ‘Both beers smelt of yeast, dimethyl sulfide, Bakelite, burnt rubber, over-ripe cheese, and goat. ‘As the samples warmed to room temperature, the smell of hydrogen sulfide disappeared and that of butyric acid - particularly strong in C49 - strengthened.’ This analysis found green leaf flavours were  high in C49. The level of Methylbutyl acetate, associated with banana flavour compounds, is markedly low in both shipwrecked beers. But 3- Ethyl hexanoate and Ethyl decanoate - which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both . The bottles were found in 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the Baltic Sea. It was found at a depth of 165ft (50 metres) just off the coast of the Åland Islands, Finland (marked). Archaeologists said the schooner’s name, its destination, and its last port-of-call have not yet been identified . Compared to modern beers, the shipwrecked beers contain similar levels of potassium but significantly more sodium, which is believed to have come from seawater on board the shipwreck. Ethanol contents are between 2.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent, comparable to typical weak modern lagers and ales. Both beers are acidic, with pH only one unit below modern levels, and the colour strengths are in the range of modern ales and lagers, but much lower than those of porters or stouts. Since the beers were found, a brewery in Finland has recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible. Called Stallhagen Historic Beer 1843, the beer is a ‘spontaneously fermented beer’ using malt and wheat. The brewery said: ‘Today’s pure cultured yeast stocks didn’t exist at that time. Beer was produced using local wild yeast strains, each of which became specific to the brewers in the area. The beer is golden yellow and has almost none of the typical bitterness or hops aroma.' It added that 1843 has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer. Stallhagen’s version is 4.5 per cent and pairs with white fish, roe, and mussels, as well as apple tarts. When looking at fermented sugars, the researchers found a small amount of maltose in A56. Levels of this sugar are much higher in C49, which contains more maltose than is typical in modern beers. Both beers, especially C49, contain unexpectedly large amounts of glucose, but fructose and sucrose were not found in either shipwreck beer. Yeasts produce compounds that contribute to the flavour of fermented drinks. From this analysis the experts found green leaf flavours are relatively high in C49, as is 1-propanol which gives it a stronger alcohol taste. The level of Methylbutyl acetate, associated with banana flavour compounds, is markedly low in both shipwreck beers. But 3- Ethyl hexanoate and Ethyl decanoate – which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both, with A56 having more sweet compounds than C49. A56 also has more rose flavour compounds than C49, in particular more 2-Phenylethanol and 2-Phenylethyl acetate. The findings have been published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Since the beers were found, a brewery in Finland has recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible called Stallhagen Historic Beer 1843. Chemists compared the samples to modern-day beers including Leffe Brune (left) and Paulaner Hefe Weissbier (right). They found the shipwreck beers contain similar levels of potassium.

A brewery in Finland recently recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible. Called Stallhagen Historic Beer 1843, (pictured) the drink has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and its makers claim the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer. But it was created before the recent analysis paper was published . The brewery said: ‘Today’s pure cultured yeast stocks didn’t exist at that time. Beer was produced using local wild yeast strains, each of which became specific to the brewers in the area. 'The beer is golden yellow and has almost none of the typical bitterness or hops aroma. The role of hops in breweries in the 1800s was not as important as it is in modern beer production.’ It added that 1843 has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer. Stallhagen’s version is 4.5 per cent ABV and pairs with white fish, roe, and mussels, as well as apple tarts. On board the schooner, divers also discovered unique bottles of champagne including one of world's oldest champagne from Veuve Clicquot, Juglar and Heidsieck. A total of 145 bottles of champagne were salvaged. The bottle of shipwrecked Veuve Clicquot recently sold for $43,630 (£28,750) at auction.","Two bottled beers were recovered from a shipwreck in 2010 .

"As same sex relationships become more acceptable, the more visible they are and the more we can learn about them. Or should I say learn from them, since most of the research that is emerging about gay relationships suggests they can teach us straights more than a thing or two! It’s not easy being gay and being different to the norm. But turns out there’s a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement. Gay relationships appear to work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways. Gay relationships work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways, says Tracey Cox . Here’s what we can learn from same sex couples: . 1. They’re not hung up on male or female stereotypes of who should do what in a relationship. Couples in same sex relationships don’t just slot into what’s expected. They divide up the chores and roles in their relationship on who is best at them, rather than ‘that’s the man’s job’ or ‘woman’s job’. The result is they work better as a team - and there’s less resentment over silly, sexist things like secretly thinking ‘He should be earning more than me’ or ‘She should be the one emptying the dishwasher’. 2. They fight fair . US relationships guru John Gottman, one of the world’s foremost experts on relationships, says same sex couples are far kinder and nicer to each other during arguments than straights are. They don’t personally attack each other, they’re more positive, less domineering and belligerent. Same sex couples also laugh more during a row - which is the best way to remind you both that you actually like each other, even if you don’t like what one of you did or didn’t do! Gottman found gay men and women were also more affectionate, listened more and were less defensive in arguments. The sexpert says it’s not easy being gay and being different to the norm, but that there’s a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement . Why are they so much better at it than heterosexuals? One reason is that power is equal. There’s less bullying and less blaming of problems on gender because you don’t have set expectations of each other’s roles. In society, women are expected to be the pacifiers and men the ‘fixers’. But sometimes it’s women who are good at coming up with practical solutions and men who are good at soothing. Same sex couples tend to let whoever is best at something take over. 3. They’re more experimental sexually . Male/female sex falls into a set pattern from a very early age. Usually, the guy initiates, there’s foreplay (generally more for her than him) and intercourse is very much the main event. Lesbians, on the other hand, are much less penetration orientated and orgasm orientated: they just do whatever they feel like in that particular sex session. Gay men are far more experimental with different types of sex rather than sticking rigidly to the ‘vanilla’, basic type of sex straight people in long-term relationships tend to have. 4. They’re happy to show and tell . Lots of straight women are often too embarrassed to let their partner watch them masturbate. Gay men love showing off - and watching other guys turn themselves on. They also watch carefully to see what technique they use, so they can copy it later. Lesbians often have mutual masturbation sessions and consequently know a lot more about what techniques their partner likes than the average straight couple. 5. They don’t have to deal with the in-laws . Meeting each other’s parents and seeing them regularly as a couple is pretty much standard for most straight couples. But not all gays are at the same point in the coming-out process and not all families are tolerant and open to gay relationships. This means less forced visits with relatives you might not necessarily get on with - which means less rows about the in-laws. 6. They don’t get hung up on porn . Partners watching porn is often frowned upon and seen as threatening by women in straight relationships. Gay men understand that men simply like looking at sexy things and same sex couples generally are more tolerant of each other’s differences.

"'Revenge of the Nerds' actor Robert Carradine has been cited with careless driving after crossing into oncoming traffic and slamming into a tractor-trailer. Carradine, 60, and his wife, Edie Mani, were both injured in the afternoon crash on March 5 near Dolores, in the state's southwestern corner, but the injuries are not life-threatening. According to the Colorado State Patrol, the actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder crossed into the oncoming lane on Colorado Highway 145 and collided with the tractor-trailer. The couple, who had been wearing seatbelts, were removed from the car and taken to Southwest Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Mercy Regional Medical Center in Durango. Scroll down for video . Cited: Actor Robert Carradine and his wife Edie, pictured in 2004, were injured after he drove across a highway into oncoming traffic but have been released from hospital. He has been cited with careless driving . It's unclear how long they were there. But neither was listed as being at the hospital Thursday, Mercy Regional spokesman David Bruzzese said. The truck driver, 59-year-old Richard Clayton of Wisconsin, wasn't injured, Trooper Josh Lewis said. James Saunders of the state patrol told The Durango Herald that neither alcohol nor speeding was a factor in the crash. Images of the scene also show that it was not snowing or raining at the time. 'The fact that they were wearing seat belts is why they are with us today,' he said. The area of the highway was shut for more than two hours following the crash. A publicist for Carradine has yet to respond to a request for comment on the actor's condition, but Carradine was back using his Twitter account earlier this week. Wreckage: The actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder, pictured, was destroyed after he crossed into the path of the truck last week. He and his wife were removed from the car and taken to hospital . Collision: The driver of the semi-truck, pictured, did not suffer any injuries in the crash. Authorities do not know what caused Carradine to veer towards the truck but said alcohol and speeding were not factors . The youngest of a prolific acting family, Robert Carradine worked steadily in film and television for more than 40 years. He and half-brother David Carradine often could be seen in the same projects, including the TV series 'Kung Fu,' Walter Hill's 'The Long Riders,' and Paul Bartel's 'Cannonball.' Robert Carradine's biggest hit came in 1984 with the off-color comedy 'Revenge of the Nerds,' in which he played head nerd Lewis Skolnick. He reprised the role in the big screen sequel and two small-screen follow-ups. More recently, Quentin Tarantino cast Robert Carradine as a tracker in the 2012 film 'Django Unchained.' Tarantino is filming his latest movie, 'The Hateful Eight,' in nearby Telluride, Colorado, but the Weinstein Co. said Carradine is not involved with that project. He has three children; a daughter from a previous relationship and a daughter and a son with Mani.

"The family of the six-year-old Oregon boy publicly shamed for being late to school thought they were simply getting their car repaired when they were surprised with a newly refurbished minivan. Hunter Cmelo's parents Nicole Garloff and Mark Cmelo were told their Dodge Durango had been repaired after local Medford businesses heard he was late because their car was old and unreliable. But when the family arrived at Kelly's Automotive, they was presented with a 2001 Chrysler minivan, complete with a new windshield, two new tires and free oil changes for a year. Scroll down for video . The family of the six-year-old Hunter Cmelo, who was forced into eating his lunch behind a screen because his parents dropped him off one minute late to school, have been gifted a refurbished minivan (pictured) The photograph of the boy forced into eating his lunch behind a screen attracted global attention and shamed the school to change its detention policy for tardiness. But it was a local radio host who came up with the idea to get the family a reliable car. Bill Meyer saw the photograph of Hunter after Garloff posted it on her Facebook and immediately wanted to help the family tackle the 'root of the problem'. 'I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble,' he told ABC News. Meyer initially enlisted the help of Kelly's Automotive owner Lisa McClease-Kelly to repair the family's Dodge, but she soon realized the repairs would cost more 'than what the car was actually worth'. That's when local company Rapid Repo and Collections stepped in and offered to donate the Chrysler. Fellow businesses in the Medford and Grants Pass neighborhood chipped in to outfit the car with updated parts. They also gave the family a $100 gas card and two $60 gift cards, according to OregonLive. McClease-Kelly, who contributed an additional $1,400 worth of repairs, said the family was completely taken by surprise with the gift. Local radio host Bill Meyer saw the photo of  Hunter eating alone behind this cardboard divider and said he saw 'the school policy as unjust' and wanted to get to the root of the problem - the family's frequent car trouble . The school district said that the system is supposed to give children the chance to catch up on work they have missed by being late - but staff have now agreed to stop using the screen . 'When I handed dad Mark the key to the minivan, he was speechless and extremely grateful,' she told OregonLive. Meyer said all it took was a little 'nudge' to help the deserving family. 'The family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change school policy' he told ABC News. 'Everyone else came in with their time and generosity.' As for Hunter's family, they said the outpouring of community support still 'doesn't seem real'. 'I'm trying to tell Hunter that this doesn't just happen to you,' Garloff said. Last month, Hunter's picture was shared around the Internet as Nicole and Mark shared their outrage at their son's treatment. In the photograph, Hunter can be seen sitting alone behind a cardboard divider at a cafeteria table. Close by is a cup with a large letter 'D' for 'detention'. His grandmother, Laura Hoover, shared the image to her Facebook page. As for Hunter's family, they said the outpouring of community support still 'doesn't seem real'. His mother Nicole Garloff said: 'I'm trying to tell Hunter that this doesn't just happen to you' 'This is my grandson, Hunter. He's a little first grader,' she wrote. 'His momma's car sometimes doesn't like to start right up. Sometimes he's a couple of minutes late to school. 'Yesterday, he was one minute late and this is what his momma discovered they do to punish him! They have done this to him six times for something that is out of his control! 'They make a mockery of him in front of the other students.' She said that his mother found Hunter crying and took him home. His parents said they were devastated when they found out what their son was going through. 'They are shaming him for something that's not in his control,' Cmelo told KOIN6. 'It is our fault that he is late.' Principal Missy Fitzsimmons immediately reached out to the parents after receiving complaints and agreed to stop using the partition as a punishment. 'As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,' the Grants Pass District said in a statement. 'Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.'

"Investigators used a GPS device that was in a New Jersey man's vehicle to find the body of his wife, who had been missing since New Year's Eve, along the side of a rural road in Maryland, a New Jersey prosecutor said Wednesday. The body of Erica Crippen, 26, was found under branches and brush in Sykesville, Maryland, on Tuesday; she was wrapped in a blanket; her arms, legs and neck were bound with an electrical cord and duct tape was on her face and nose, Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi said. Crippen's husband, Kyle Crosby, 28, was charged in January with murder in his wife's death. He remained in jail Wednesday. Court and jail records didn't list a lawyer for him. Bernardi said that after Crosby's arrest, investigators found a GPS device in his Ford Taurus that contained 8,500 points, or what the prosecutor characterized as 'bread crumbs' that showed where the vehicle had stopped. Scroll down for video . Charged: Kyle Crosby, 28 (left), stands accused in the murder of his 26-year-old wife, Erica Crippen. Crosby's 67-year-old mother, Jo Crosby (right), allegedly helped him.  She was charged with hindering and tampering with physical evidence . Finally found: The body of 26-year-old Erica Crippen (right) was found Tuesday underneath a pile of branches and limbs  in Carroll County, Maryland. Her husband, Kyle Crosby (left), had already been charged with murder . Scene: The body of Erica Crippen, 26, was found under branches and brush in Sykesville, Maryland, northeast of Balitomore on Tuesday afternoon wrapped in a blanket . Crippen's body was found less than 100 feet from one of the points, Bernardi said. It's unclear how or when Crippen died but authorities believe Crosby dumped her body either on the evening of January 10 or morning of January 11, Bernardi said. An autopsy was scheduled in Baltimore. Investigators searched three times in Maryland for her body, but their efforts were hampered by the brutal winter, the prosecutor said. The couple lived in Mount Laurel with their infant daughter and Crippen's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship. Crippen's body was found the same week Crosby's 67-year-old mother, Jo, was charged in the case with hindering and tampering with physical evidence. Authorities allege Jo Crosby deleted several text messages from her phone sent to her son the morning police believe he killed his wife. According to an affidavit, at least 15 text messages between her and her son on New Year's Eve were retrieved during a forensic examination of their cellphones. The two also had an 18-minute phone conversation, according to an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request. Murder: The Mount Laurel woman had an electrical cord around her neck and duct tape binding her hands and feet; the cold weather preserved the body, police said . Press conference: Mount Laurel Police Chief Dennis Cribben (left) announces the discovery of Erica Crippen's Tuesday, while Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi announced charges against Crosby . Jo Crosby eventually admitted deleting the messages when she learned authorities were coming to interview her, the affidavit said. She has been released on $12,500 bail. It wasn't clear Wednesday if she had an attorney who could comment on the charges. A phone number could not be found for her. Crosby told Crippen's family he didn't know where his wife was the day after she went missing, however he didn't report it to police. Authorities only found out a week later when they went to the couple's home to check on Crippen's seven-year-old daughter, who had not attended school for the week. After being questioned, Crosby went missing. One week later he was arrested and charged with murder. Investigators said they found several items that had 'evidential value in connection to (Crippen's) disappearance' in the trunk of the vehicle. Following the arrest, Crippen's family spoke out about Crosby, saying he had been on a drug binge with a prostitute following his wife's disappearance. They said he sold some of her clothes in order to pay for the drugs. Tracked down: Erica Crippen was last seen at a New Jersey restaurant on New Years Eve.

"Sierra Leone is being shut down for three days in a bid to stop a surge in cases of Ebola. The country's president Ernest Koroma has ordered everybody to stay at home between now and Sunday in an effort to halt the spread of the killer disease. Sierra Leone had a previous nationwide curfew in September at the height of the epidemic. Scroll down for video . Sierra Leone residents have been told to remain indoors until Monday in an effort to halt the spread of Ebola . Almost 25,000 people have been infected with the killer disease, pictured, which has claimed 10,000 lives . The Christian Examiner reported President Koroma's remarks, urging his people to work together. He said: 'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake, . 'I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together. The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone.' According to the World Health Organisation, there were 33 confirmed new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone in the week of March 22. The WHO said that that one-third of these cases were in the capital Freetown. As healthcare workers on the ground battle against the spread of the disease, two experimental vaccines against Ebola are now undergoing clinical trials in Liberia. A total of 600 people are being inoculated against the disease. Confirmed Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, pictured, seemed to be clustered near the country's west coast . An estimated 12,000 people have been infected by Ebola in Sierra Leone, pictured . The country's six million population have been told that the curfew could eliminate the disease from the country. Thousands of teams will fan out around the country, knocking on doors to remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it. In the hot spots — the regions around the capital and in the north — health workers will also search for Ebola cases. Alfred Palo Conteh, the head of Sierra Leone's Ebola response, says a major goal of the campaign is to fight complacency, more than a year after the outbreak was declared in West Africa. Ebola has infected nearly 12,000 people in Sierra Leone.

"The stepmother of a young boy who died and who lied about his whereabouts to police has been charged with his death. Analize Osceola of Hollywood, Florida, called police on Thursday to say that Ahizya Osceola, 3, was missing despite the fact that hours earlier she had found the boy dead and stuffed his heavily bruised body into a trash bag that she then hid inside a Baby Einstein toy box which she put under piles of clothing in her laundry room. She was charged on Wednesday with aggravated manslaughter, child neglect and providing false information to law enforcement. This after an autopsy revealed signs of horrifying abuse.

Analize  hid the body in the laundry room of their home (above), where police ultimately found it after growing suspicious . The Sun-Sentinel reports that the boy's father, Nelson Osceola, who had been married to Analize for 10 months, was also charged with child neglect. An autopsy revealed the boy died of blunt impact abdominal trauma. In addition to the bruising all over the boy's body, the boy's pancreas was split in three pieces and the enzymes had begun to break down his internal organs. There was also a spiral fracture on the boy's shin bone from an old break. 'In his first three years of life, he endured what we believe to be a significant amount of pain,' said Hollywood Police Chief Frank Fernandez. 'No child should ever, ever endure this life, the life of little Ahziya.' Earlier this week, Child Protective Services documents obtained by NBC 6 state that Analize woke up at around 4am last Thursday and, according to her claims, she heard the young boy moaning. She then went over and found he was very cold, but still warm, so she gave him CPR. With his pulse weak, she then claims she went to get him some Pedialyte, then decided it was best to try and make him vomit. The boy, she claims, died soon after, and she waited until the other adults were out of the house and then stuffed the boy's dead body in a trash bag and hid it in the laundry room. Throughout this all, Analize's mother had been in the house, who is a nurse. She never told her mother anything about what happened or asked her to help when the boy was in distress. Police, suspicious of the woman, went to the house and found the body. Soon after she changed her story with police she checked herself into a mental hospital.

"Nigel Farage was likened to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels last night as he was forced to backtrack over a call to scrap most of Britain’s race relations laws. The Ukip leader prompted a storm of controversy by suggesting he wanted to reverse legislation dating back to the 1960s which bars discrimination at work on the grounds of race or colour. His remarks were condemned by the leaders of the other three main parties. David Cameron said Mr Farage appeared ‘desperate for attention’, while Ed Miliband said the comments were ‘wrong, divisive and dangerous’. Nick Clegg said Mr Farage created fear by confusing ideas. Scroll down for video . 'Colour blind': Farage with Ukip election candidate Winston McKenzie at its conference last year . But a senior adviser to Downing Street went further, claiming Goebbels would have been ‘proud’ of Mr Farage’s remarks. Iraqi-born Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi, a member of the No 10 policy board, told LBC Radio: ‘The remark I found most difficult, and certainly hurt by, [is when] he talks about employers being able to discriminate in favour of British-born citizens. ‘I wasn’t born in Britain, but I feel equally British to Nigel Farage or anyone else. These remarks make me feel very frightened that a man like Nigel Farage, who aspires to lead the country, who says that he’s leading a serious party, actually takes the attitude that if you are not British-born, you’re not equal. It’s a dog whistle. 'It’s a remark Goebbels would be proud of. His remarks are deeply racist. He should withdraw and apologise.’ Last night the Ukip leader claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he did not want to scrap anti- discrimination legislation. Instead, he focused on less controversial suggestions that firms should be allowed to favour British job applicants. He said: ‘What I am saying is very simple: I’m saying that I think British companies should be allowed the presumption of favouring British applicants for jobs over those from southern and eastern Europe.’ Both Labour and Tory politicians, notably former prime minister Gordon Brown, have made similar proposals of a system of ‘British jobs for British workers’. The row erupted after Mr Farage, interviewed by Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for a Channel 4 documentary to be screened next week, said Britain faced an ‘especial problem’ with some Muslim immigrants. Iraqi-born Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi compared the Ukip leader to Goebbels while David Cameron said he was 'desperate for attention' ‘People do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us,’ he said. Mr Farage then suggested that race and other anti-discrimination laws could be abolished on the grounds that people were now ‘colour blind’. Pressed on which legislation he would get rid of, the Ukip leader said: ‘Much of it.’ Asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour if Ukip were ever in power, Mr Farage added: ‘No… because we take the view, we are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind. ‘I think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who she or he employs. I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. ‘I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word “discriminate” if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so.’ IN THE CHANNEL 4 INTERVIEW: . Trevor Phillips: ‘In Ukipland there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour?’ Nigel Farage: ‘No. We are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind.’ YESTERDAY: . Nigel Farage: ‘I didn’t mention race at all – it was no part of that interview with Trevor Phillips at all… I am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws in Britain.’ Challenged later about his remarks, the Ukip leader appeared to reverse his position, insisting: ‘I didn’t mention race at all. I am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws. I’m talking about lightening employment legislation so that small employers – and don’t forget, there are nearly five million in Britain – are less fearful of taking on young British workers.’ Mr Farage suggested his critics were racist, rather than him, since they assumed he meant ‘white’ when he talked about ‘British’ workers, while he insisted his proposed changes would help ‘young black and white British people’. Last night the Prime Minister said: ‘What Nigel Farage has said is completely wrong and, frankly, pretty appalling. The reason these laws are in place is to stop people being discriminated against on the basis of the colour of their skin.’ Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: ‘This is one of the most shocking things I have ever heard from a mainstream politician, and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance. ‘We have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country, but things are still far from perfect. ‘When my parents moved to London [from Pakistan] they frequently saw signs saying “no blacks, no dogs, no Irish”. What Ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days.’","Nigel Farage was compared to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels over .

"Greedy rail firms are charging customers up to £215 per day to park at city centre stations in what has been branded 'daylight robbery' by union bosses. The 'outrageous' parking charges amount to a 'stealth tax' on train travel adding up to 50 per cent of the total cost in some areas, according to the TSSA Rail union. The worst offenders were Birmingham New Street, Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Piccadilly and Leeds, all of which charge £215 for a 12-hour stay. Liverpool Lime Street station was named among the most expensive for parking in the country, forcing customers to pay £215 for a 12-hour stay . Union bosses accused train companies of using parking charges, such as the £215-per-day fare at Birmingham New Street, as a way to get around rail fare price caps issued by the Government . The most expensive annual parking tickets are Birmingham Snow Hill at £3003.30, Reading at £1805.50, Guildford at £1,800 and Cambridge at £1,596.30. These parking charges are on top of hefty annual season ticket prices such as from Reading to London at £4,796, Cambridge to London at £4,648 and from Guildford to London at £3,248. Figures released today also show that transport companies and Network Rail are making £800million a year from non-railway charges including parking and catering. Per 12-hour stay . Birmingham New Street - £215 . Liverpool Lime Street - £215 . Manchester Piccadilly - £215 . Leeds - £215 . Per year . Birmingham Snow Hill - £3,003 . Reading - £1,805 . Guilford - £1,800 . Cambridge - £1,596 . Union bosses claimed companies were using the extortionate charges as a way to get around the caps on rail fares which are imposed by the government each year. The report says: 'Rip off rail firms have been profiteering at passengers expense by hiking 'back door' car parking increases to by-pass inflation only curbs on fare rises. 'Network Rail and the private rail firms are charging as much as £215 for day long stays at city centre rail car parks while also charging as much as £3,000 for annual parking tickets.' Union general secretary Manuel Cortes said: 'Rail passengers are being caught in the cross fire by these greedy rail firms. 'They can charge what they like for parking because, unlike key rail fares, there is no Government cap, it is a free for all.' He added: 'Charging over £200 for all day parking in station car parks at Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds is little short of daylight robbery. 'And charging over £3,000 for an annual parking ticket at Snow Hill in Birmingham is simply outrageous, that's as much as many commuters pay for their annual season ticket.' Mr Cortes said: 'Parking charges as high as £1,800 at commuter hot spots like Guildford and Reading were effectively putting another 40 per cent to 50 per cent parking tax on top of annual season tickets which are already way too high. 'Ministers may have limited regulated fare rises this year to 2.2per cent this year but passengers have still got both barrels with big hikes in parking on top of these ceaseless rises in annual fares. A report by union chiefs accused rail companies of 'daylight robbery' after it was revealed they are making £800million per year from non-travel services, on top of £9billion made from ticket charges . 'These firms now simply regard stations as profit centres with passengers as captive cash cows.' Mr Cortes wants the Government to include parking in the price control curbs that is used to fix annual scheduled fare increases like season tickets and off peak travel. He said: 'When you consider that the rail firms are making £800million a year in parking fees from these passengers who already paying out £9billion in fares, I think commuters deserve some additional protection. They are effectively being squeezed dry at the moment.' Network Rail own and run the 18 largest stations in the country, including King's Cross, Waterloo, Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street and Leeds. The remaining 2,500 stations are run by private franchises like Virgin, Stagecoach, First Great Western, GTR and London Midland which operates Snow Hill. Figures from the Office of Rail Regulation show that train operators last year made £772million from non-railway charges which includes parking and catering - up more than 4 per cent on the previous year. Annual car parking fares at some train stations such as Guilford, which charges £1,800 for a pass, come on top of annual travel tickets which cost more than £3,000 . Edmund King, President of the AA, said: 'Station car parks face a difficult balancing act in not setting parking charges that are lower than those in neighbouring car parks, encouraging non-rail users to take spaces intended for train travellers. Unfortunately, this becomes an excuse for much higher parking charges, although longer-stay car parking does demand a higher and more costly level of security. 'The root of the problem is the high cost of train travel - high parking charges at stations rub more salt in the wound. If we want to encourage drivers to allow the train to take the strain then it is imperative that railway car park charges are kept down. 'Rail operators should look at some way of allowing rail customers to recoup the cost of parking from train fares. Parking operators are very keen to devise ways to catch drivers who make mistakes in failing to comply with parking rules, they should be equally enthusiastic in finding ways to make life fairer and easier for often stressed train travellers.' Rail industry officials denied companies were 'profiteering' from car park charges, adding that total train operator profits were £250million in 2012-13, down from £270million in 1997-98. They said many stations do not charge for car parking, and where they do, charges set by train companies are similar to those in town centre car parks. Officials Across the country millions of pounds are being invested in station car parks to add extra spaces and to make car parks safe and secure for passengers, they pointed out. Over the same period, money paid by operators to Government to reinvest in more services has increased 400per cent from £390 million to £1.96billion, they added.","Liverpool Lime Street and Leeds station also charge £215 for 12-hour stay .

"Hollywood's Scientology dissenters have commended the documentary makers of an unprecedented accounts of the church, which reveals John Travolta is blackmailed into sticking with the faith. Lisa Marie Presley and King Of Queens actress Leah Remini are two in a growing body of celebrity voices to criticize the secretive religion after the expose, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, screened on HBO on Sunday night. Remini, who left the church before her daughter reached the induction age, tweeted: 'Thank you to the brave who did something about it. And to those who didn't have a voice, you do now.' In a cryptic message posted soon after the screening, Presley said on Twitter: 'Sometimes...The S##t hitting the fan is a damn nice sound ;)' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Applause: Scientology dissenters Leah Remini (left) and Lisa Marie Presley (right) have commended the makers of scientology expose Going Clear, which makes shocking allegations about the religion . A documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, including that members hold a blackmail file on John Travolta and others have been subjected to hard labour in 'prison camps' The documentary features interviews from a number of high profile ex-followers including Remini, Presley and screenwriter Paul Haggis. Shocking allegations include the claim that members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. There is said to be a file of 'damaging material' about John Travolta's sessions with auditors at the church that will stop him from dissenting. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including film stars John Travolta and Tom Cruise. It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated. These included descriptions of a 'prison camp', revealed by former member Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor. People put into this camp are forced to do around  30 hours of hard labour, broken up by three hour rest breaks. Spanky was once the point of contact between the Church and Travolta and said she was sent to this 'prison camp', known as the Rehabilitation Project Force which, she claims, is where members are 'reindoctrinated.' The documentary also claimed Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions. During these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as 'What are you willing for me to talk to others about?' Travolta is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed, but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway. As well as the claims about Travolta, former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders. The show claimed there is a 'black file' on John Travolta, which includes records of his auditing sessions . Senior members of Scientology, that are part of the higher Sea Org order, apparently are forced to play musical chairs to Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen to vie for a place in the church, as a form of punishment . Another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the Scientology church, Sea Org, whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in 'The Hole'. As well as beatings in 'The Hole', they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force t them to confess their crimes against the Church. Others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church, with losers being expelled. Being expelled from the Church of Scientology comes at a high price, because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members. Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Tom Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org, according to reports at the time. In an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, Scientology spokesmen denied the claims. Tom Cruise allegedly worked with the Church of Scientology to wire tap former wife Nicole Kidman's phone . This strictest order of Scientology is run with rigid rules, with members being paid just $50 a week and being forced to leave if they have children. Members must pledge their allegiance to the faith for a billion years. It has also been claimed that the church helped Cruise find a new girlfriend when he opened a new site in Spain and was single. Officials are said to have found scientologist Nazanin Boniadi and had her braces removed, spent $20,000 on clothes and had her hair dyed to Cruise's liking, the Huffington Post reported.  The relationship soon ended. Former senior executive Mark 'Marty' Rathbun was also interviewed for the documentary and made claims about the church's tax requirements. Rathbun was a senior aide to the current leader of the Church of Scientology, and alleged the church's goal was to be recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) in order to be made a fully tax-exempt religion, which it achieved in 1993. Members are said to have filed dozens of lawsuits against IRS and employed private investigators to dig for information in a bid to get the church recognized. Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor - once a member of the Church and the point of contact with John Travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30-hour shifts, with around three hours of breaks . Another senior former member interviewed was Paul Haggis, a former director of the church. He said  once members reached a certain level they would see founder L. Ron Hubbard's handwritten account of the creation myth. This states that Zenu, a galactic dictator froze people and dropped their bodies into volcanoes, 75 million years ago. These spirits are said to have jumped into the bodies of newborns and are now used as the explanation for the source of all of our anxieties and fears.  Hubbard is also said to have created 'Ethics' - a series of punishments for auditors who made mistakes. Mr Haggis left the church citing problems with its stance on gay rights, after his two gay daughters told him how they were being treated by members. The Academy Award winning filmmaker wrote an infamous resignation to Tommy Miscavage, Scientology's chairman and Hubbard's successor, saying he was disappointed that he had failed to denounce actions of a San Diego church against gay people. The documentary, based on a book by journalist Lawrence Wright, also claims that when the church thought Cruise was ‘slipping away’ during his marriage to Nicole Kidman, it worked with him to wiretap her phone, a claim that is flatly denied. In an interview with Business Insider Gibney said he took great steps to ensure that those who spoke out were not put into a compromising position and he ensured he never filmed them at their homes or arrived at a meeting point at the same time. He added: 'I often used throw-away phones and encrypted e-mail. People were so frightened.' The Church of Scientology, which is believed to have around 50,000 members, denied the allegations featured in Going Clear and said the statements included were 'entirely false.' Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and Paul Haggis (right) The documentary was screened in America on Sunday evening and is based on Lawrence Wright's book . In a statement it said: 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney's film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. 'Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with first-hand information eager to speak. To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' Since Going Clear premiered at the Sundance Festival in January, the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version, called 'Get the truth.' Representatives also branded the documentary a 'bigoted propaganda piece.' Other famous members have also criticised the show. Danny Masterton, a second generation Scientologist and former star of 'That 70s show', said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies. He told eonline: 'I wonder if Sundance would allow a documentary of, like, eight people who hate Judaism. But you know, my religion's fair game, I guess, ""cause it's new"".' At the end of the documentary Gibney lists the people who refused to be interviewed, which included Miscavige, Travolta, Cruise and Kidman. MailOnline has contacted John Travolta for comment.","Leah Remini and Lisa Marie Presley were Scientologists, they have tweeted commending the documentary and its shocking claims .

"A husband whose pregnant wife was killed in a car crash on Monday was hit by a double blow after thieves broke into his home and stole medical marijuana as he was recovering in hospital. Robert Lausier, 53, of Madawaska was hospitalized with leg injuries after his wife Kimberly  38, crashed their SUV head-on into another car as she tried to pass an 18-wheeler. Mrs Lausier was killed instantly along with their unborn baby. Robert Lausier, 53, of Madawaska was hospitalized with leg injuries after his wife Kimberly 38, crashed their SUV head-on into another car as she tried to pass an 18-wheeler (both pictured) Three people also died in the car she crashed into Bobbi-Jo Johnston, 33, of Fort Fairfield and Johnston's daughter, two-year-old Alana, and her mother, Laurie Ann Johnston, 52, of Carlingford, New Brunswick. Today it was revealed that an unknown amount of medical marijuana was stolen from Mr Lausier's home. 'I am sad to say the home was broken into the day of the accident,' Madawaska police Chief Carroll Theriault said Wednesday morning. Two-year-old Alana also died in the smash alongside her mother and her grandmother . He said the break-in at the Lausier house occurred sometime Monday afternoon . 'We spoke to the Lausiers' son, but he is not sure if anything else is missing,' Theriault said. 'We won't know much until Robert gets back.' 'This is as low as you can get after the tragedy that happened to this family,' Theriault said. 'That accident was such a tragedy for both families in Madawaska and in Fort Fairfield [and] for someone to break in there during their time of hurt is something as low as I have ever heard.' State police said they had not been able to track down the driver of the tractor-trailer, who may not have realized the crash occurred. Bobbi-Jo Johnston, 33, of Fort Fairfield, was in the car that Mrs Lausier crashed into . The investigation into the crash continues. According to a fundraising page Mrs Lausier, a mother-of-two, was eight-months pregnant. She had a teenager daughter and son.

"The son of a 46-year-old man who was killed last year has been charged with his father's murder after a former private school girl turned drug addict was charged over a first attempt on Michael Martin Senior's life. Michael Martin Junior made a public appeal last Sunday to find Mr Martin Snr's killers. But in a bizarre twist, his son will now face court on Monday charged with his June murder. Scroll down for video . Michael Martin Junior made a public appeal to find Michael Martin Senior's killers last Sunday . Jessica Honey Fallon (pictured left in 2011 and right in a police mugshot from 2014), from Byron Bay in New South Wales, was charged with attempted murder over Mr Martin Snr's first attack in April . New South Wales police are alleging the 25-year-old killed Mr Martin Snr to cash in millions of dollars worth of life insurance, News Corp reported. Martin Jnr is thought to have bought the policy just weeks before his father died. It follows the arrest of Jessica Honey Fallon, 21, who was charged over the first attempt on Mr Martin Snr's life back in April. Police claim Fallon and two other people were paid to break into the 46-year-old's home, and then stabbed him and assaulted one of his friends who was staying the night in his South Murwillumbah unit on New South Wales' north coast. Michael 'Mullet Mick' Martin survived the alleged hit on his life but was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home in South Murwillumbah on the NSW's north coast . Mr Martin Snr - who was known to locals as 'Mullet Mick' - survived the attack but during the second he was not so lucky. It was the 46-year-old's first night home after his lengthy stay in hospital when he was killed. An axe was found at the scene. Details of Fallon's life have been revealed, with police claiming she had descended into a life of drugs and crime following her private school upbringing. Pictures of the 21-year-old, taken just three years apart, show the toll her alleged drug use had taken on her body. Fallon's case was heard at Parramatta Local Court in February. Police have ruled out her involvement in the fatal attack on Mr Martin Snr. Fallon was charged with attempted murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm for the attack on Mr Martin Snr in April, 9News reported. Mr Martin was killed on the night he arrived home after spending a lengthy stint in hospital recovering from April's attempt on his life . Now Martin Jnr will face Tweed Heads Local Court on Monday following a Sunday hearing in Lismore Local Court, just a week after he made an emotional plea to the public to find his father's killers. It was initially reported by media Martin Jnr was tied up and beaten before he witnessed Mr Martin Snr's death. During his public appeal, Martin Jnr said he was scared for his life. 'All I can remember is hearing the death of my father. It was just terrifying,' he told 9News. 'I never expected I'd see my wife or children again. 'When dad got assaulted the first time we spent countless hours in hospital thinking that was going to be our last night with him. 'We just got him out, we just got him better. I was just trying to help him make a new start.' Tweed-Byron crime manager Detective Inspector Brendon Cullen confirmed police were still investigating the first assault on Mr Martin and any relationship between Fallon and Mr Martin. The weekend's arrest was the culmination of a 'long and complex' investigation. 'It's taken many hours of tireless effort by our detectives to come up with this result,' Det Insp Cullen told reporters.

"Tall, tanned and often bare-chested, the six-foot-tall movie star from Texas, Matthew McConaughey, was just another beefcake actor starring in vacuous romantic and coming-of-age comedies that kept the money flowing in. With the help of a seductive smile and hard abs, he had a string of affairs with Hollywood leading ladies – Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Renee Zellweger, Patricia Arquette... and Penelope Cruz . 'There's a bit of a language barrier, but it's like poetry when it happens,' he said of Cruz. 'What I really love about her is that she sees everything for the first time, every time. And she's one of the best listeners I've ever met.' Scroll down for video . Hot and heavy: Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz  in Paris.

Hanging out in the Hyde Lounge club on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood in 2006 with his pal, now-disgraced cyclist, Lance Armstrong, he saw the woman of his dreams. And she changed his life forever writes Neil Daniels in Matthew McConaughey: The Biography,  published by John Blake. McConaughey's relationship with sexy Penelope Cruz was over as soon as he spotted the 5'9' tall Brazilian model Camila Alves enter the Hyde bar. 'The first time I saw her walk across the room, I didn't say, ""Who is that?"" I said, ""What is that?"" 'The way she moved, I could see a person who knows who they are. There's a person who spends time with herself, and is not advertising for this world, and is not asking permission. From that night I haven't been on a date with anyone else'. It was a year and a half before they dated exclusively. And it set McConaughey, 45, on the path towards achieving what he considered his greatest accomplishment -  being a father. 'When I was 20 years old, I didn't know what I wanted for a career. But I knew I wanted to be a father. It had been the thing that, since I was very young, I looked up to. The men I looked up to the most were fathers – men who raised good kids'. Love of his life: Caila Alves, 33, first landed in Los Angeles from Brazil when she was fifteen.

Proud dad: Matthew and Camila and their three children are always together, here as  the actor is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last year. Two years later, in July 2008, the couple had their first of three children and became engaged in 2011. McConaughey put a rose-cut diamond on Camila's finger and married her in June of 2012 in a Catholic ceremony presided over by a Benedictine Monk. Alves, 33, first landed in Los Angeles from Brazil when she was fifteen. She cleaned houses and worked as a waitress before hanging up her feather duster to become a successful model for Dior and Levi's. When the couple first lived together, it was in an Airstream trailer, a love of McConaughey's who now owns three of them. When he goes on location, they travel in an Airstream. 'We all go together,' Alves says. 'One thing that we decided very early in the relationship is that when he goes, we all go – the whole family. 'We're like a traveling circus. But we're never in one place for too long. We're always on the go. We've been on the road for four years'. Before Camilla, the tall Texas was viewed as a bongo-playing, bong-toking free spirit who loved to play those drums in the nude while stoned on weed. In 1999, the knock on his door was the police responding to the neighbor's noise complaint. They found him stoned and naked with a bong nearby. He resisted arrest and was hauled off to jail for resisting as well as on a marijuana possession. Sandy: McConaughey made the rounds with the leading ladies of Hollywood, including Sandra Bullock. Most of his women won Oscars, including Bullock for The Blind Side. They dated for over three years . Rene: Zellweger won for Best Supporting Actress for Cold Mountain and was nominated for Bridget Jones' Diary . Patricia: McConaughey won his Oscar last year for Dallas Buyers Club,  Patricia Arquette this year for Boy . The charges were dropped eventually but he had to pay a fifty dollar fine for disturbing the peace, a mere drop in the bucket for the actor who was then earning $4 million a film. He sang sing-alongs with his cellmates and even had T-shirts printed that read, 'What part of naked bongo playing don't you understand'? Naked was something he learned growing up when his mother never put bathing suits on him or his brothers while at the country club before they were nine years old. Three years earlier in 1996, Vanity Fair's annual Hollywood issue dubbed McConaughey the new Paul Newman. The New York Times compared him to Gregory Peck and the writer John Grisham viewed him as a cross between a young Marlon Brando and Paul Newman. McConaughey's career almost tanked when he lost out on the Titanic role to Leonardo DiCaprio. But it was all 'alright, alright, alright', with the actor whose phone didn't stop ringing after he verbalized the character's lines in the cult film Dazed and Confused in 1993 that kept Hollywood producers calling and scripts for rom-coms coming in. McConaughey was arrested by Austin, Texas police in October 1999 and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia . Bongo man: McConaughey played the bongos for the Total Request Live audience . Easy rider: McConaughey fixing and cleaning up his Airstream camper van in Malibu . The naked bongo player's arrest was the turning point for McConaughey. 'It was something that never left me. It kept on being mentioned. I needed to make changes in my life, the way I was living and the movies I was doing. But not before he discovered his hair was falling out and resorted to using a product 'Regenix', to stimulate re-growth – keeping up with that Hollywood image. 'Back in 1999, my hair was fallin' out, so I started this stuff. And son of a gun if I didn't bring my hair back so well that people think I went and got plugs'. 'While he wasn't one of the finest actors working in American cinema he had a certain humble charm, obvious good looks and an everyday Texan attitude about him that helped propel him into the lower ranks of the A-list of Hollywood stars', the author writes. The humble kid from Texas whose first job was raking 77 sand traps on a golf course before 8 a.m., got lucky on those rom-coms and was living a carefree lifestyle. He had to exit the business in 1999 and re-consider where he was going in his career. McConaughey headed back to Texas to rediscover what where he wanted to go as an actor. Back in Hollywood, the turning point was the film, The Lincoln Lawyer, in which he played a swaggering lawyer. He went on to star with his friend, Woody Harrelson in the HBO hit series, True Detective and then the box-office hit The Dallas Buyers' Club, based on the true story of an HIV positive man who resorted to underground pharmacies that earned McConaughey an Oscar. From vacuous scripts, McConaughey has soared to the top of the A-list actors with intelligent performances. This was the man who grew up in a small town, Uvalde, Texas, his father 'a pretty carny salesman' who had invested in a diamond mine in Ecuador that turned out to be phony, and his mother a kindergarten teacher. But the house was always filled with love. McConaughey first thought of becoming a lawyer but changed direction and studied acting because tuition was cheaper at the University of Texas. Now the 'man with the brilliant smile and the golden torso – an easygoing sport who, temperamentally, never seemed more than fifty yards from the beach – has become one of the most inventive actors in movies', writes David Denby in the New Yorker.

She was pursuing a modelling career. Her father added: 'She was a perfect daughter. 'She was very quiet, she loved animals and I don't think she ever even squished a fly.

"They're not the usual dishes one thinks of when considering the tastes and palate of young children. But in one restaurant in Cornwall, moules mariniere, wood fired pizzas, ratatouille, and crispy salt and pepper squid sit alongside more prosaic offerings such as burgers, and fish and chips. The dishes served at Amélies in Porthleven were designed and approved by the restaurant owner's six-year-old daughter, after whom the restaurant is named. Amélie Sheffield-Dunstan with her mother Sam in the kitchen of the eponymous restaurant in Cornwall . The new menu was given the thumbs up by the child testers aged between two and eight-years-old . The eaterie's new kids' menu was devised entirely by Amélie Sheffield-Dunstan, who was aged just six months when the restaurant in Breageside in Porthleven, was opened by her mum Sam. She loves nothing more than popping into the kitchen with head chef Paul James and often puts on her chef's whites and cooks at home. Ms Sheffield-Dunstan said: 'Amélie and I often cook together at home and dishes like our Mish Mash chicken with oodles of noodles were inspired by Amélie's home-cooked favourites.' Amelie prepares her pizza before it goes in the oven (left). The restaurant serves mini pots of moules mariniere (right) Starting them young: Chef Paul James watches over his kitchen protege Amélie as she prepares food . Each time Amélies launches a new menu the staff are invited to try the dishes so that they know what each tastes like and can ask any questions of the chef. The new menu was launched with a tasting by the people who matter – the children. Amélie said: 'It was really fun having my friends here to share the food. I liked dinging the bell to get service to the kitchen!' The dishes were a big hit with the kids, aged between two and eight who tucked into everything from pizzas and ratatouille to squid and locally landed fish. Grilled fish and chips is one of the more prosaic items on the restaurant's children's menu . Ruby Mitchell, aged 6, said, 'Amélies is brilliant. It's the best burger I've ever had and the pasta is yummy. Children's menu's are really great because they have chocolate and ice lollies after — I had a red flavoured one which was super delicious!' Liam Atkinson, 6, added: 'Amélies is the best restaurant because I can meet all my friends here and we love the food.' Ms Sheffield-Dunstan said: 'We're all about family at Amélies and we wanted to focus on the food we provide for kids being as special as what we plate up for the adults. 'That means attention to detail, great presentation and taste and, of course, providing dishes the kids want to eat.'","Kids' menu at Amélies in Cornwall devised by the owner's daughter .

"Pictures of this baby elephant learning to walk are testament to the old adage - the bigger they are, the harder they fall. The 200lb week-old newborn was captured collapsing under its own weight as it struggled to walk beside its mother at the Samburu National Park in Kenya. Photographed by Margot Raggett, the images show the elephant mother patiently wandering beside its baby as it repeatedly wobbles and collapses while learning to walk. Scroll down for video . The elephant calf, wandering close to its mother for support decides to raise a leg to its trunk . But in doing so, the overconfident youngster wobbles and attempts to correct his balance . Unable to correct itself, the calf then collapses into a heap on the ground . It then gives up completely, flopping onto its side in the dry riverbank while its mother looks on . She said: 'Young elephants are one of my favourite species to photograph, they are so adorable. 'If they are not playing and being mischievous they are acting like clowns while trying to find their feet. 'This youngster completely lost its footing in the dry riverbed and then when it finally struggled to its feet proceeded to examine one of its feet like it was to blame for it falling over.' She added: 'In the meantime the mother just carried on patiently grazing, though you could see she was keeping a watch on the youngster out of the corner of her eye'. Adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves, helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators. If a calf loses its mother for some reason other female in the group will take care of it. Elephants are under threat throughout Africa due to poaching, including in Kenya where these photos were taken. Eventually it picked itself up and continued walking with the support of its mother . But only a few minutes later, it took another tumble - this time trunk first - into the dry grass .","Touching photographs show baby elephant collapsing under own weight .

"A physician from Kansas recovering from a shark attack in Hawaii has described the terrifying moment the underwater beast seemed to appear in front of him out of nowhere. Ken Grasing, his wife and two sons had just finished snorkeling off Hapuna Beach State Park on the Big Island on the Big Island of Hawaii when a 'black cloud appeared' in the water on Wednesday. 'The shape moved toward me quickly and it materialized into a ten- to 12-foot tiger shark,' Grasing, 58, said as he recovered at Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. Ken Grasing, from Overland Park, Kansas, was on vacation in Hawaii when he was attacked by a ten- to 12ft tiger shark . In about five-foot-deep water, Grasing saw a tiger shark, like the one pictured above, swimming around him. It bit into his left arm before Grasing hit it on the side of its head (file photo) The attack happened in about five-foot-deep water and there were other people around the area, according to CNN. He said it 'happened very rapidly' and that the shark bit his left hand before moving past him. At that point he struck it on the side of the head with his right hand. 'The shark then swam around me, stayed in the area, and I stood there just yelling. It was quite the dramatic moment,' he told CNN. 'My two boys were with me in the water and I was very concerned that the shark would attack them.' The shark continued to cruise just outside the surf line at Hapuna an hour after the attack. A Hawaii County Fire Department helicopter tracked the animal and confirmed seeing stripes on the shark's body. Grasing was hospitalized but is expected to make a full recovery. He suffered severe cuts on his left forearm and had an injury on his left leg, likely from being scraped by a shark fin. He's unsure if he'll ever go snorkeling after the shark attack. Grasing, his wife and two sons had just finished snorkeling off Hapuna Beach State Park on the Big Island on the Big Island of Hawaii when the attack occured . He's expected to make a full recovery after suffering severe cuts to his left arm and an injury on his left leg, likely from being scraped by a shark fin . 'This is a magnificent animal swimming with great speed and power. I was really at its mercy, and if it had mind to do anything more, that would have been the end of me,' he said. He said he made the quick decision to hit the shark on the side of the head because there were 'a lot of teeth that are sharp' and it was 'moving very fast'. And fortunately for Grasing, 'it didn't like what it tasted' when it bit him, so it moved away. The tiger shark can reach up to 16ft long and is considered to be Hawaii's most dangerous shark. There are about 40 species of sharks in Hawaii. Tiger sharks are often considered to be 'the garbage can of the sea', according to CNN, because they eat a wide variety of prey. In 2014, there were six shark attacks in Hawaii, though none of them were fatal, according to the state's shark information website. This was Grasing's third trip to Hawaii - the family was celebrating his oldest son's high school graduation, according to West Hawaii Today. He said despite the attack, it was still 'a great day of snorkeling' where the family in which they saw an octopus and plenty of fish. Despite the trauma of the shark attack, Grasing said he and his family had 'a great day of snorkeling' and that they had seen an octopus .","Ken Grasing of Kansas was vacationing in Hawaii with his wife and sons .

"Robert Durst's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary, The Jinx, aired and is now living with his lawyer, it has been revealed. In the aftermath of the   documentary, which outlined the life of real estate scion Robert Durst and his possible involvement in multiple murders, many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years, Debrah Lee Charatan. Charatan, a self-made real estate executive, was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband's murder of Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, but other than that did not participate in the film. Now it has been revealed that Charatan not only advised Durst against participating in the documentary, but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer. This as the final episode featured audio of Durst possibly admitting to committing these murders, saying he 'killed them all' during a moment when the cameras were off but his microphone was still on. Scroll down for videos . Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan is reportedly no longer supporting the millionaire real estate scion and has been living with his lawyer, Steven I. Holm (above) Durst (above) is expected to be charged with first-degree murder in the death of his friend Susan Berman, who was killed on Christmas Eve 2000 . The New York Times writes that Charatan seems to have taken a step back from her husband recently, no longer travelling with him and living with Steven I. Holm, one of his lawyers. Charatan and Holm were even photographed together at a Central Park event in 2010, though the extent of their relationship is not known and Charatan refused requests for comment from the paper. Authorities are now looking to question Charatan as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend Susan Berman on Christmas Eve of 2000, just two weeks after he wed Charatan. The incident occurred shortly after Berman, a lifelong confidant of Durst, contacted the man to let him know that police wished to speak with her regarding the disappearance of his first wife Kathie in 1982, who to this day has never been found. Many believe Durst also knows about the disappearance of his first wife Kathie (above) who was last seen in 1982 . Both Durst and Charatan have previously revealed that they were only married so that she could receive his estate and inheritance should he die, and so the money would not go back into the family business. Durst remained upset that his father Seymour had selected his younger brother Douglas to run the Durst Organization in 1994, and thus did not want the $2million he received every year from a trust to go to the company should he die. 'It was our understanding that unless I was married to him, I couldn’t benefit from any of the trusts,' Charatan said in a deposition while being questioned about the Black incident, in which her husband was ultimately found by a jury to be acting in self defense when he shot the man and then dismembered his body. Because of their marriage however, Charatan cannot be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of Berman, and even if she did, Durst would likely have her testimony blocked. Charatan, who wed Durst (above in his booking photo following his arrest for the Morris Black murder) in 2000, is said to have advised Durst against doing the recent documentary The Jinx . Meanwhile, reports that Charatan could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from Durst's recent arrest in New Orleans as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for Cuba, seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from Los Angeles County who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of Berman. That money it seems came from another woman in New York, who sent it to Durst in luggage that was also filled with shoes after he called her upon his arrival in New Orleans. Charatan has never said much about her husband, frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988, and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him. In addition to the murder charge in California, he also faces charges in New Orleans as he had a gun and sizable amount of marijuana on him at the time of his arrest. When Durst was arrested for murdering Black however, Charatan was the first person he called; handling his money, helping him decide what lawyer to hire and frequently flying to Texas for the trial. And while much has been made of Durst's tragic childhood and his mother's death by suicide when he was just a young boy, Charatan had an equally troubling youth. Her parents both came from Poland having survived the Nazis, her father losing his foot in a landmine explosion and her mother, an orphan, having been taken in and hidden by a Christian family. Charatan worked hard to make herself a success, once noting; 'I knew if I couldn’t be a star, I wouldn’t be happy.' Along the way she made many friends, and more than a few foes, in the industry. Both Durst (above) and Charatan admit that they only wed so she could eventually receive Durst's inheritance, though she also now cannot testify against him in court . Durst was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry, and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from Charatan. She remains involved in real estate now, having recently taken her $20million share of Durst's $65million settlement from his claims against his family trust, to start a new company with her son, who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years. They have an investment office in the Union Square section of Manhattan, and Charatan also recently sold the Fifth Avenue apartment Durst helped her to buy in 1997 and the Bridgehampton home the two shared. Durst meanwhile is being held in a psychiatric correctional center outside New Orleans.","Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan is reportedly no longer supporting the millionaire real estate scion as he faces new murder charge .

"Trendsetter: Natalie Massenet made Net-a-Porter a global phenomenon . When Natalie Massenet set up a website selling luxury fashions 15 years ago, her critics said it would never work. But that company, Net-a-Porter.com, proved to be a huge hit – with women saving up more than £2,000 for dresses by top designers such as Valentino. Now the online firm she founded from a London flat in 2000 is about to go through a mega-merger with an Italian fashion group – netting the mother of two about £70million. The deal with Yoox, expected to be announced this week after both sides confirmed talks yesterday, will make the business worth £1billion. It is a remarkable success story for UK-based Miss Massenet, who is credited with changing the way women shop for high-end fashion. Her website has become a global phenomenon, reaching sales of more than £500million and spawning copycat sites across the world. The daughter of a British Chanel model, the 49-year-old former fashion magazine journalist set up her online business just as the dotcom crash hit in 2000. Aged just 33 and struggling to get any funding, she eventually managed to raise just over a million in start-up capital from her Chelsea flat. She launched the business with her then husband Arnaud while pregnant with her first child, despite warnings from sceptics who thought women would refuse to buy expensive clothes without trying them on. But the site has been a huge hit with the wealthy as well as those who simply live a long way from London’s designer shops and save for months for an item. Top-end products on the site include a JW Anderson leather panelled mini dress for £1,350 and a black silk satin jacket by Givenchy for £2,675. Miss Massenet, who split from her husband in 2011 after 15 years of marriage, has since expanded the company into menswear with a site called Mr Porter and a discount site called the Outnet.com. She is due to receive the fruits of the mega-merger, which analysts say will bring a range of benefits, once the deal is finalised. She is expected to receive more than £70million on top of the £50million she made from selling the business to current owner, Swiss luxury giant Richemont, in 2010. That deal valued the business at £280million. The merger with Yoox, which sells overstocked or unsold designer goods from previous seasons, values it at a staggering £1billion. Catwalk creations: The latest clothing designs on the website . California-born Miss Massenet, who is currently the chairman of the British Fashion Council, may stay on in her role as chairman of the business. She worked for US magazine Women's Wear Daily and later became an assistant to stylist and fashion muse Isabella Blow at Tatler. Net-a-Porter is famous for its plush back and cream ribbon-wrapped delivery boxes, with designer items lovingly wrapped in crisp tissue paper. During the financial crisis women who were unable to give up their Net-a-Porter habit asked for their purchases to be delivered in plain wrapping, to hide their extravagance from colleagues.","Critics told Natalie Massenet her Net-a-Porter website would never work .

"The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima were among the crowds that flocked outside to watch the partial solar eclipse this morning. Resplendent in a crimson ensemble, 43-year-old Maxima donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in Hamburg alongside her husband. Perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped, the Argentina-born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses. Scroll down for video . Watching the eclipse: The Netherlands' Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander watch the eclipse . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in a bright crimson ensemble, complete with matching gloves .

The Dutch royal couple are currently in the middle of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany with Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg on their itinerary. In Britain, millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away . On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany .

"When a baby is screaming for food in the middle of the night the two minutes it takes to boil water to heat the bottle can seem like a lifetime. A pair of entrepreneurs is hoping to make this easier by launching a kettle with a 'baby bottle preparation' function. It lets parents schedule when the kettle should start boiling, which also also gives it time to cool down, to coincide with the expected feeding times. Scroll down for video . AppKettle was created by Loughborough University engineering graduates Robert Hill and Richard Hill. It is expected to launch on Kickstarter on 31 March and connects the smart kettle to an app to schedule boils . Alternatively, a parent can set the kettle to boil as soon as the baby starts crying so by the time they have got the infant out of bed and into the kitchen, the water is ready. And AppKettle wasn't just designed for new parents, it can also be used to schedule the kettle to be boiled before a user gets home or first thing in the morning, for example. Elsewhere, a connected app will reveal how much water is in the kettle so people know how many cups they can make, and this can ultimately save energy because kettles aren't boiled too often unnecessarily. It lets parents schedule when the kettle should start boiling, which ultimately also gives it time to cool down, to coincide with the expected feeding times. Alternatively, a parent can set the kettle to boil as soon as the child starts crying so by the time they have got the child out of bed and into the kitchen, it's ready to go .

The first 250 backers of Appkettle will be able to pre-order it for £79.99 ($119), although the aim is to eventually set a retail price of around £120 ($179) This follows a MailOnline story which found that for standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F). Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water, and herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). And regardless of the temperature, tea should be steeped for six minutes for the perfect brew, according to the British Standards Institute. AppKettle was created by engineering graduates Robert Hill and Richard Hill. They showcased the technology at the recent Venturefest innovation exhibition in York and are now preparing to launch the Appkettle on Kickstater on 31 March. The first 250 backers of Appkettle will be able to pre-order it for £79.99 ($119), although the aim is to eventually set a retail price of around £120 ($179). Robert Hill from Coulby Newham, said: 'We see the Appkettle as a multi-functional piece of equipment that is unlike anything else on the market. It's early days but we've been in discussions with a number of worldwide brands, including an international domestic appliance brand. 'The crowdfunding launch will allow us to gauge interest but as every day goes by, I'm more and more confident that we have a product that will be successful. According to the British Standards Institute (BSI) guidelines for making the perfect cup of tea, the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served . According to the British Standards Institute (BSI) guidelines the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served. And these guidelines explained that black tea should be steeped for at six minutes. Steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it. For standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F). Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves, so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. When made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup.

"Labour and David Cameron's Tories remain neck and neck, despite the Conservatives being ahead in the polls . Tomorrow the Queen dissolves Parliament and the Election campaign begins. It will be the strangest Election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled. Most expected that, with economic recovery, and Cameron ahead of Miliband in the polls as favoured Prime Minister, the Tories would pull ahead. That has not happened. Labour and the Tories remain neck and neck. Only a fool, or a social scientist, would predict the outcome. The two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters – about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951. Voters have a wider choice than ever before. In England, they can opt for three other alternatives – not just the Lib Dems, but also Ukip and the Greens – all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls. In Scotland and Wales, there is a further alternative – the Nationalists. The weakening of the two party system makes a hung Parliament very likely. But, curiously, a small overall majority for the Tories or Labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament. The Tories would be at the mercy of their Eurosceptic Right wing, as John Major was in 1992. He had a majority of just 21, and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad. They made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty reforming the European Union. A Labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its Left wing which opposes austerity. Labour, contrary to Tory propaganda, is committed not to a splurge in public spending, but to public expenditure cuts, though less severe than Cameron and Osborne are proposing. But Labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters, many of whom look for rapid improvements in the NHS and social care. Speaking two weeks ago at the London School of Economics, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, advised English voters to support the Greens or what she called ‘progressive’ Labour candidates, that is candidates opposed to austerity. She hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next Parliament, composed of the SNP, Greens and Left-wing Labour. That would cause problems for Miliband even if he won a majority. But, obviously, a hung parliament is more likely. The key question is whether it will lead to stable government, as it did in 2010. Many then thought, including myself, that the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition could not last. But it has, and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the Commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in Parliament. The danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed. Under our electoral system, Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats. That is why both support proportional representation. The SNP, which may well win many seats, will not deal with the Tories and will not join Labour in a coalition. If, as is likely, the Lib Dems lose seats then, even if they were prepared to enter another coalition, that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority. This would mean that no two parties – other than the Tories and Labour – could command a majority. We would have a fragmented hung parliament. There would have to be a minority government. The last minority government following a General Election occurred in February 1974 after Ted Heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners’ strike asking the voters to decide ‘Who Governs?’ The voters, however, refused to give a clear answer and, in the fragmented hung parliament that followed, Labour governed as a minority for seven months. There was then a second General Election in October at which Labour won a small majority. Minority governments do not last long and, being dependent on bargaining with other parties, find it difficult to take long-term decisions. The longest-lasting was between 1929 and 1931, but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between Labour and the Liberals. Under our electoral system, Nigel Farage's Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats . In the past, the Prime Minister could try, as Labour did in 1974, to escape from the minority situation by dissolving Parliament. But the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, providing for five-year parliaments, makes that option more difficult. Besides, there is no reason to believe a second General Election would, as in 1974, deliver a majority government. It could easily reproduce the same result. Why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics, and will it prove more than a temporary condition? I believe it will, because it stems from a new social cleavage in British politics, a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation, from social and economic change, and those who have been left behind. The two major parties, together with the Lib Dems, represent the beneficiaries. Their leaders all believe Britain should stay in the EU. They all broadly welcome immigration. They all favour gay marriage. But many voters do not favour these things, and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties. Alex Salmond (pictured) and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England . The typical Ukip supporter is not, as we used to think, Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, a retired Army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole, but a working-class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system. Blair’s New Labour sought to win over graduates and middle-class professionals – those who aspired to leave the working class. Cameron’s Conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the ‘nasty party’ by rejecting Thatcherism and embracing modernisation; while Cameron and Osborne, liberal-minded men, seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind. Ukip, in consequence, is now the most working-class party in English politics. The SNP in Scotland is different from Ukip in many respects. But it, too, represents the left behind. The vote in the independence referendum last September was a class vote. Labour areas in the west central belt around Glasgow voted ‘Yes’ to independence, while middle-class SNP areas in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire voted ‘No’. West Dunbartonshire, with nearly the lowest life expectancy in Scotland, voted ‘Yes’, East Dunbartonshire, with nearly the highest, voted ‘No’. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England. The SNP could well be the third-largest party in the next Parliament, even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the Lib Dems, Ukip and the Greens. That will strain the Union to breaking point. In England, Cameron says if you vote for Farage you will get Miliband. In Scotland, Miliband says if you vote SNP, you will get Cameron. But, to the left behind, Cameron and Miliband are equivalent – members of an Oxbridge liberal elite who represent the exam-passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate. That is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability. Anyone seeking a quiet life should go abroad for the next six weeks.","Tomorrow the Queen dissolves Parliament and Election campaign begins .

"A group of British tourists taking part in a sunset cruise along the Zambezi River were left horrified after seeing crocodiles eat a man, it has been reported. The tour group and their guide were making their way down the river between Zimbabwe and Zambia when they saw crocodiles feeding. But as they approached, it became clear that the reptiles were tearing apart the bottom half of a human. Horrified British tourists saw crocodiles eating a man on the banks of the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe (file picture) The Daily Telegraph reports that the tourists alerted authorities - but by the time officials had arrived to investigate, the remains of the body had vanished. It quotes a local source as saying: 'All there was to see of him was his trousers. We have had no information about anyone missing from villages around us, so we don't think the man was a local.' Trevor Lane of Zimbabwean conservation group, the Bhejane Trust, said the body was believed to have been a Zambian man. He is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in Zimbabwe just days earlier. Mr Lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to Zambia. When the tourists approached the crocodiles they could see that the reptiles were eating the bottom half of a human (file picture) He reportedly told the South African Press Association: 'We strongly suspect it was a poacher. 'Maybe he was wounded and tried to swim across the river.' The Telegraph Mr Lane as saying there was a 'shoot out' involving the poachers and the rangers and that he suspected the man was 'already dead when the crocodile ate him.' It is the latest in a series of crocodile attacks in Zimbabwe and three children are reported to have been killed by them in the last three months. In one attack last month, a three-year-old girl was grabbed by a crocodile as she played on the banks of the river in the north of the country. A 16-year-old girl was attacked along the Runde River to the south on New Year's Day.","British tourists were taking part in a sunset cruise along the Zambezi River .

"Smartwatches and bands promise a range of features but the latest has the potential to save your life. Called AdvicyDrive, the wearable monitors your heart rate while driving to determine how awake you are. If it detects a drop in heart rate, which suggests you're dozing off, it sounds an alarm on a connected smartphone. Scroll down for video . The AdvicyDrive sensor monitors your heart rate while driving to determine how awake you are. If it detects a drop in heart rate, which suggests you're dozing off, it sounds an alarm on a smartphone (illustrated) When a person falls to sleep their heart rate drops by up around 10 to 30 beats per minute on average. To detect the most subtle of these changes, AdvicyDrive uses digital photoplethysmography (PPG) -  an imaging test used to detect changes in blood flow at the microvascular level on the skin. Last year, researchers from the Biomechanics Institute in Valencia, Spain unveiled the Harken system. It measures the driver’s heart rate and breathing via a sensor system knitted into the seatbelt and seat cover. If the rates drop too much, a warning alarm goes off. Designer Jose Solaz said: ‘The variation in heart and respiratory rate are good indicators of the state of the driver as they are related to fatigue. 'Harken can monitor those variables and warn the driver before the symptoms appear.’ The researchers said the system is innovative because it can cancel out the motion of the car and only pick up heart and respiratory rate thanks to the ‘smart textile materials’ embedded in the seat cover and seatbelt. It's typically used to monitor blood flow in people with Raynaud's disease, for example, from their fingers and toes. The technology shines a green LED onto the skin, and based on the variations in colour that are reflected back, the sensor can detect the heartbeat. It uses a traffic-light system to monitor the beats and will issue a cautionary warning if it begins to drop into the 'amber' section. The loud alarm rings when the rate reaches the 'red' zone'. Its Italian designers said: 'The pulsed light sensor technology  is the best on the market in terms of stability, reliability even in motion and in terms of energy consumption.' They added that the detection is on par with a chest band 'without the disadvantage of having to wear an uncomfortable strap'. The clip can be fitted to a wristband but will also attach to a person's underwear. It will work as long as its in contact with the skin. The sensor is currently under development, so these claims have not been put to the test, and the firm has launched a campaign on Kickstarter to fund the project. Kits are available to pre-order for £70 and will retail for £100 if the campaign is successful.

Young male drivers, lorry drivers, employees in company cars and shift workers have been found to be most at risk of falling asleep at the wheel. Research shows tiredness among drivers accounts for 20 to 35 per cent of serious accidents and suggests there are more than 6,000 fatalities a year in Europe because of driver fatigue.","AdvicyDrive monitors heart rate while driving to tell how awake you are .

"When Sandra Hilburn was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2006, she was told she only had up to three months to live. Nine years - and five grandchildren - later, the 68-year-old retiree from New Jersey is still going strong, and all thanks to an experimental treatment involving a common vaccine. Hillburn, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center. Researchers found that a dose of tetanus vaccine let patients like Hillburn live longer when added to an experimental treatment for the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor, . Beating the odds: In April 2006, when Sandy Hillburn was diagnosed with glioblastoma - the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor - she was given only two-three months to live . Matriarch: Thanks to an experimental treatment involving the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, Hillburn (top center) got to witness the birth of five more grandchildren . It 'put the immune system on high alert,' paving the way for the experimental treatment to work better in attacking the disease, said researcher Kristen Batich of the Duke University Medical Center. In a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature, she and others describe a study of 12 patients. Some who got the tetanus shot lived years longer than those who didn't. Dr. John Sampson of Duke, senior author of the report, called the results promising but noted the study was small, and said bigger studies are needed to confirm the results.  A follow-up study has already been planned but isn't recruiting patients yet, Batich said. Brain cancer experts unconnected with the work were impressed. The results are 'very exciting,' said Dr. Nader Sanai of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. While he agreed more work is required, 'what you have so far, it's a very positive story.' Tetanus is otherwise known as lockjaw.  Vaccines for it are routinely recommended for children and adults. The new study focused on glioblastoma, which killed Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2009. Even after surgery to remove the tumor, it usually grows back and kills. The few drugs to treat these tumors have little effect. Half of patients die within about 15 months. When diagnosed in New York in April 2006, 'I was told I had two to three months to live,' Sandra Hillburn recalled in a telephone interview. But her family flew her to Duke in North Carolina because of its reputation for glioblastoma care, and she was offered a slot in the experimental study. Cutting age treatment: Hillburn was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center . New approach: Doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor. Then they return the cells to the patient's body, where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them. 'I was very positive it would help,' Hillburn said. 'I said, ""Sure, thank you."" I'm still saying thank you.' In the years since then, she has attended her son's wedding and gained five more grandchildren. Now she plays soccer with six grandsons in Ohio and Boston. 'I look forward to seeing the wonderful people they're becoming,' she said. She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections. Last November, she celebrated her 100th treatment. Dr Sampson said it's not clear why she has lived so long. Hillburn credits the treatment and her medical care at Duke. She also cited the example of her father, who is a 97-year-old survivor of two kinds of cancer. 'He just went about his life, and so I did the same thing,' Hillburn said. At age 68, Hillburn, plans to continue beating the odds for years to come. 'I think I'm good for at least another 10 years,' she told CBS News. Living by example: Hillburn said her father is a 97-year-old survivor of two different types of cancer who continues to go about living his life, and she is doing the same . Looking ahead: She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections and hopes to celebrate her 80th birthday . Positive outlook: Hillburn said when she was offered to be in the study, she was sure the experimental treatment would help . The active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life: play golf, take long walks every day and meet friends for lunch. The new research work that has so dramatically prolonged Sandy Hillburn's life is an example of a long-standing effort to harness the immune system to fight cancer, an approach called immunotherapy. The specific strategy it used is called a dendritic-cell vaccine. Doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor called cytomegalovirus, or CMV.  Then they return the cells to the patient's body, where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them. Not sitting still: The active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life . The 12 patients in the new study were treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. All patients got an ordinary tetanus-diphtheria shot and then three injections of their own cells, spaced two weeks apart. Then they were randomly divided into two groups. One group got a second, tiny dose of the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine at the place in the skin where the cells would be injected the next day. The other group got a dummy dose. The idea behind the tetanus mini-shot was that the immune system ""gets revved up in this particular area"" so that ""the body will be more excited about what's to come,"" Sampson said. Cell injections continued monthly until brain scans showed tumor growing. For the six patients who got the dummy shot, only one was still alive two years after diagnosis, surviving for about 3½ years. Still, overall results for this group indicated a small benefit from the cell injections alone, Batich said. The results were far better for patients who got the mini-shot of tetanus. Four surpassed two years. One of them lived almost five years and another nearly six years. The study was funded in part by a government grant to a business venture that is licensing the technology. Some of the authors have filed patents related to the tetanus strategy.","Sandra Hillburn, 68, was diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma in April 2006 .

Jordan Robinson, the brother of Tony Robinsoin, stood up in front of hundreds of mourners in Madison, Wisconsin as he said; 'Terrell was the best brother you could ever have. Terrell will always live on in our hearts.' Jordan broke down at one point as he spoke of his brother and was comforted by their sobbing mother. Tony, whose mother is white and father black, died on Friday March 6 after what police say was a confrontation in which he assaulted Matt Kenny, who retaliated with gunfire. A preliminary autopsy showed Robinson was shot in his head, torso and right arm. The autopsy did not say whether he was facing or turned away from Kenny. Scroll down for video .

'Terrell was a passionate and compassionate young man and a wonderful friend,' the program read according to The Capital Times. 'He leaves with us all an unmatched sense of pride and a wealth of love and memories.' Sharon Irwin, Tony’s grandmother, also delivered an emotional and touching speech. 'We are family. We stand for what he stood for. We stand for peace, we stand for change. He was young, he was black and he is beautiful,' she said., . 'I know my grandson was on a spiritual path. The last thing he said to me was, ""I think I got it figured out and I’m going to take on my responsibility.""' She then asked that the Phil Collins' song In the Air be played as the entire congregation rose out of their seats. Prior to the service, the John Legend and Common song Glory played as photos of Tony from his birth up through high school flashed on screens. 'I was told many times this would be the hardest words of comfort I would ever have to offer anyone,' said Rev. David Hart III, who officiated the service. 'Too many of our children are dying before their time … we watched Trayvon die before his time, we watched Michael Brown die before his time. We desperately want to change that narrative.' Mourning: Memorial messages were left on building where Robinson was shot - blood can be seen above spattering the walls and floors from the killing . Protests: This image from Wednesday shows activists on the streets of Madison in the wake of Robinson's death . Marching: Around 1,500 attended the Wednesday march through Madison . Robinson's death was the latest in a string of shootings by police nationwide that have heightened racial tensions. Some protests turned violent in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed black man was fatally shot last August, and this week two policemen were injured from gunfire during a demonstration in front of the Ferguson Police Department. Killer: Matt Kenny was the police officer from Madison, Wisconsin, who shot Robinson . Protests have been peaceful in Madison, where blacks make up around 7 percent of the 240,000 population. The shooting has highlighted local concerns, prompting open letters from nearly 90 religious leaders and many local politicians calling for action to bridge racial inequality. Demonstrators on Wednesday marched to the home of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a likely Republican presidential candidate. On his gate they posted on the gate a list of demands including an end to what they called unequal policing of poor, black neighborhoods and an increase in funding for public schools. Walker was not there at the time. Madison police have been more conciliatory than their counterparts in Ferguson since the shooting. Police Chief Mike Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's family on the night of the killing and prayed with the man's grandmother in the driveway. He has emphasized the right of protesters to march peacefully.

"From rations to ready meals, Britain’s kitchen cupboards have held the secrets of how we eat over the decades. And in just two and a half months last summer one family of five munched their way from the post-war era to modern times to reveal how dramatically things have changed. The Robshaws found the 1950s wholegrain National Loaf particularly hard to stomach, and ten-year-old Fred was overjoyed when sweets came off the ration. The Robshaw family took on a culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in each decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pictured (from left) Rosalind, mother Rochelle, Fred, father Brandon and Miranda 'in the 1950s' Forty years later, the Robshaws found themselves eating in the Nineties, sampling such delights as homemade pasta. 'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed,' remarked Mr Robshaw . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Back In Time For Dinner, which starts on BBC2 next Tuesday, follows the Robshaws – Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred – from the 1950s to the end of the millennium, with the final episode casting an eye towards the future of food. In the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper. The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat. Vesta convenience meals were available and the more adventurous home cooks could buy exotic foreign ingredients such as garlic and olive oil – from the chemist. Baking supremo Mary Berry teaches the Robshaws how to make a cake as it would have been done in the 1950s (pictured) for the six-part TV programme 'Back In Time For Dinner', which airs on BBC next Tuesday . The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties . In the early 1950s, families ate bread - often the rationed 'National loaf' - and left-over roasted meat fat aka 'dripping' for breakfast (left), before Cornflakes (right) made their first appearance in the UK in the 1960s . In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle. In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades. By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. The programme also shows how fridges, freezers, microwaves and even televisions revolutionised the way the country ate, and how the rise of supermarkets changed shopping forever. The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before . Families began to get a taste for spicier food in the sixties and  Vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry. In the same era, cooks could buy  ingredients such as garlic and oil from the chemist . Spaghetti bolognese arrived in the UK from Italy in the sixties... and it hasn't left British dining tables since . Mr Robshaw, a freelance journalist and children’s writer, said 1950s-style rationing left them feeling hungry all the time and was particularly hard on Fred, who ‘literally danced with joy the day sweets came off the ration’. He went on: ‘None of us found the National Loaf easy to digest. As flour was scarce, it was padded out with potato starch.’ When the family entered the 1960s, Mr Robshaw said ‘food became fun’ thanks to the likes of fish fingers and ‘it all felt extraordinarily liberating after the austerity of the 1950s’. He added: ‘It [the show] brought home to us all how British food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time.’ Throughout the series, in which the family saw not only their menus given an overhaul but also their wardrobes, kitchen and daily routine, they were helped by famous faces including Mary Berry and Hairy Biker Dave Myers.

The countersuit also addresses the Johnson family allegedly asking Florida State University to take a football scholarship offer away from younger brother Brian. The Bells claim the Johnsons directed a Facebook post at FSU officials which stated Brian 'exhibited violent tendencies and a highly unusual appetite for fighting'. The post also reportedly said Brian's 'social media activities expose the likelihood of him being a psychopath'. FSU pulled its offer to the linebacker off the table. The suit claims similar slanderous statements were made to the University of Louisville and Clemson University. The Bell brother were notified by US Attorney Michael Moore a federal grand jury's investigation into Johnson's death is targeting them, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The Johnsons' suit, which was filed in DeKalb County Superior Court just after the second anniversary of their son's death, alleges the brothers were 'seeking revenge' after one of them had been in a fight with Kendrick. It also says the boys acted on a 'parental command' from their father to assault Johnson . The countersuit claims the Johnsons interfered with Brian's chances to play football at Florida State University . A state autopsy ruled Johnson's death was an accident but his parents have always insisted foul play was involved and there was a cover-up by law enforcement authorities and school officials. The lawsuit states: 'Defendants from the various law enforcement agencies deliberately and maliciously mishandled the subject investigation in such a way that anyone who might ever be charged with (Johnson's) death would never be convicted.' Requests for comments from representatives from both families on Sunday did not get a response. An attorney for the Bells, Brice Ladson, previously said the lawsuit against his clients was 'frivolous'. He said: 'The Johnsons know the allegations against my clients are completely baseless.'","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia, in January of 2013 .

"Barack Obama received a rapturous reception Tuesday from a huge crowd of students as he announced measures to make it easier to repay their enormous loans. The president addressed a crowd of 10,000 at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta after signing in new rules to shake up the student loans system. Obama changed rules governing how debt collecting companies treat early repayments - making it so high-interest debt is paid off first. Man with a plan: Obama spoke today about his aspirations for college to be more affordable for all . Happy to see him: 10,000 students cheered for the president as he spoke at the Georgia Institute of Technology on Tuesday . The measure, passed via a presidential memorandum - which does not require approval from Congress - also changed how loan providers keep students informed. They will now have to give fuller information about repayment options, and tell students when they fall behind. Total student debt stands at more than $1trillion nationally. His new rules are a response to the arcane loans system at the moment, which can be confusing to navigate and result in mounting charges. Obama also called for a website which would collate all the information on a student's federal loans in one place - and provide a simple way to forward complaints, in a so-called 'student aid bill of rights'. OMG: Students brandished smartphones, clapped and cheered when Obama entered the room . Touch me: Obama shook hands with some of the enthusiastic crowd as he spoke about reducing their enormous debts . Not only should every American be able to afford college, Obama said, they also should be able to afford the loan payments that kick in with a vengeance once they graduate. 'We're trying to tackle this problem from every angle,' Obama said. 'We want to make this experience more affordable, because you're not just investing in yourselves, you're investing in your nation.' In the Oval Office ahead of his brief visit Obama signed the memo, aimed at third parties like Navient - formerly Sallie Mae - that contract with the government to collect on loans. The presidential steps aim to crack down on a student loan system known for being complex and confusing to navigate. In recent years, lawsuits and critical government reports have cast a light on industry abuses and the difficulties facing borrowers. Sell-out: Some 10,000 cheered Obama on as he announced measures to tackle America's arcane student loans system . A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study last year found borrowers were getting little help when they ran into trouble and had few affordable repayment options. And in May, Sallie Mae reached a $60million settlement with the Justice Department to resolve allegations it charged military members excessive interest rates and improperly sought default judgments. When Vickie Kight of Houston couldn't afford to pay the interest accruing on her loans, she turned to her loan servicer for help - and says she didn't get it. Her wages being garnished, Kight dropped out of Louisiana's Southern University, returning to school only years later once her finances were under control. Drinking it in: The president received a standing ovation before he had even spoken at the event . Getting the memo: Obama enacted a bundle of rule changes via a presidential memorandum in the Oval Office . 'They were very aggressive with me,' Kight said in an interview. Her student loan servicer eventually passed her loan onto a collection agency. 'That's when it got really hectic. They weren't providing much information. They just said you owe this much to the bank.' Obama also floated the possibility of proposing legal changes to how student loans are affected by bankruptcy. Currently, student loans cannot typically be discharged even in bankruptcy. His memo also requires servicers to apply early payments to loans with the highest interest rates, helping students pay off debt faster. Shaking it off: Obama shook hands with some of the excited students at the speaking engagement . Although Obama has long lamented the high cost of college, he's run into obstacles that have limited his efforts to improve the situation. Using his executive authority, Obama expanded a federal repayment plan to allow more low-income Americans to cap their payments. But when Obama this year proposed to eliminate the '529' college savings plan to make way for education tax benefits, opposition was so strong that he had to jettison the idea. And the president's $60billion pitch this year for two years of free community college has gained little traction in the Republican-controlled Congress. The government estimates total U.S. student debt exceeds $1.1trillion, with around 7million Americans in default.","President spoke to 10,000 students at Georgia Institute of Technology .

"A whirlwind romance quickly turned into a nightmare for a British grandmother who married a man 20 years her junior in The Gambia. Anne-Marie, 52, from Warwickshire, met husband Omar on a night out when he was in the UK on a student visa. At the time, she was 41 with two children from a previous relationship and he was 21. 'He was handsome and charismatic, he said he'd treat me like a queen and I would never want for anything. He told me everything I wanted to hear,' she told Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad. Anne-Marie, now 52, from Warwickshire, met husband Omar when she was 41 and he was 21 . She said Omar persistently text and called her after they first met so, in the end, she thought 'why not' and started dating him. Not long after they had been together, he suggested he move into her family home as he couldn't afford the rent on the place where he had been living. Then as his student visa neared its expiration date, they decided to get married just months after they had first met. 'He had come to the country on a student visa, he hadn't been able to finish the course, he needed to send money back home, otherwise people wouldn't be able to eat. I admired him for staying and doing what he had been doing to keep his family going,' Anne-Marie said. 'I entered into the relationship besotted and in love, it was dream.' After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in the Gambia . Anne-Marie's son Joe, who was ten when they got together, said their relationship did seem to move quickly. He said: 'I was young so I didn't know about relationships but it felt quick. I went from seeing him a couple of times a week to him always there and staying.' Anne-Marie and Omar travelled to his native The Gambia to marry in 2006 - but she said she immediately regretted it. 'On my wedding day it was a wonderful day but I had doubts in the back of my mind, I was thinking ""am I doing the right thing?"" Anne-Marie said Omar had been charming and charismatic before they tied the knot . 'The day after we married we had argument, his eyes were bulging, he put his face in mine and said ""you are my wife now, you do as you're told"". I was frightened, I thought ""what have done? I think I've made a big mistake."".' Anne-marie said Omar was aggressive and violent when they returned to the UK and spoke of one harrowing incident - which he denies - when she said he whipped her with a belt. She said: 'He held me to the floor and he took his belt off whipped me over and over on the top of my thigh. I was crying screaming and begging for him to stop and he carried on. I asked ""is this how you control your girlfriends?"" and he shouted ""yes"" back to me.' Anne-Marie said Omar put her under pressure to take out loans so he could send money back to his family in the Gambia. As a result, she racked up debts of £15,000. She said life with Omar was 'awful' with 'spiralling debts' and constant arguments but the marriage lasted for five years before he left. Following the breakdown of her marriage, Anne-Marie is now £16,000 in debt . Now a grandmother of one, she said she hadn't seen him since and is desperate to track him down so he can help her pay off her debts and she can get a divorce. She said: 'I was with this man for a long time and I have debts I can't pay. I want to find him and see if I can get money from him as half of the debts are his. 'Before I met Omar my credit rating was good. Now at the rate I am playing it back,  it will take 17 years to clear the debt.' As the loans were taken out in Anne-Marie's name, she would have to prove she was coerced into taking them out for the debts to be written off. She said: 'Unless I can find out where he is, I can't recover it, I can't even divorce him as I can't serve him the papers.' Channel 5 was able to get a statement from Omar who admitted his marriage had been violent at times but he denied the allegation that he had whipped his wife with a belt. He said he never forced Anne-Marie to take out loans and as far as he is concerned, they are divorced - as he said he secured this in The Gambia in 2012.

"Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson wants to speak to Indonesian President Joko Widodo . Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson has written a heartfelt letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo pleading for him to save the lives of those facing the death penalty in the southeast Asian country. The British businessman, who's also a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said he was willing to go to Indonesia in an effort to save those facing execution. Sir Richard, along with other Global Drug Commissioners, wrote to President Joko urging clemency for all drug convicts currently on death row in Indonesia, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The letter, which described the death penalty as inhumane, said the drug trade remained unaffected by the threat of capital punishment. 'Countries that still carry out executions for drug offences have not seen any significant shifts in supply and demand,' he wrote. The Virgin boss pleaded: 'Mr. President, we hope you will consider our plea and spare those named above this ultimate and irreversible punishment. 'Granting clemency would be a humane and righteous act, and a first step towards sensible reform that could become a shining example for the entire Asian region.' Sir Richard told the ABC he was willing to get on a plane bound for Indonesia as early as Wednesday. 'What we would love to do is speak with the president of Indonesia and try to give them a way forward, a positive way forward for its country,' the entrepreneur told the ABC on Wednesday morning. Sir Richard, along with other Global Drug Commissioners, wrote to President Joko urging clemency for all drug convicts currently on death row in Indonesia . Sir Richard posted this photo of him writing the letter to President Widodo on his Virgin website . Australians Andrew Chan, left, and Muyran Sukumaran are seen here during  aChristmas celebration at Kerobokan prison in 2008. They have been locked up in the prison for 10 years and are now facing the firing squad any day . 'We have written to the president saying if he will have us we would love to come and talk ... we want to be as constructive as possible. 'All we're saying is there is a better approach.' 'I am willing to go and get on a plane today, tomorrow ... as are a number of the other commissioners,' he said. He said research showed it was better to 'treats drugs as a health issue not as a criminal issue'. 'It actually helps lower the number of drug deaths, it limits the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and AIDS or hepatitis C, and it reduces drug-related crime,' he said. Sir Richard wants the chance to show President Widodo 'there is a better approach' to handling drug convicts than killing them . Sir Richard posted his letter to President Widodo, which said 'the death penalty removes any chance of forgiveness for the remorseful', on Twitter . 'Bali Nine' enforcer Myuran Sukumaran (left) and ringleader Andrew Chan have been locked up in Bali for ten years and have now been moved to their place of execution by firing squad . Sukumaran (centre) and Chan are awaiting the outcomes of appeals made by other prisoners who are scheduled to be executed alongside them . Chan converted to Christianity and became a pastor while behind bars and carried a bible with him when he was transported to the Indonesian death island on Wednesday . Sir Richard's call comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott continues to plead for the lives of Chan and Sukumaran. The two Bali Nine ringleaders are in isolation on the Indonesian penal island of Nusakambangan, awaiting the outcome of legal appeals against their execution. Mr Abbott is waiting to hear whether his request to speak again to President Joko about the fate of the two Australians will be accepted.

"A bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night is claiming it was a drunken accident. Christina George-Harvan, 30 and Katelyn Francis, 21, were celebrating at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, after the ceremony on April 24, 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home. The row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car when the gun went off. Prosecutors say George-Harvan took the weapon from the center console and deliberately shot Francis, but her defense claims it fired by accident. She is facing third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges. Scroll down for video . Christina George-Harvan, 30 (pictured in court on Friday) has been accused of shooting her niece Katelyn Francis dead. She claims it was just a drunken accident . George-Harvan and Francis, 21, (pictured) were partying after a wedding 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on April 24, 2014 . George-Harvan, a former nurse, took to the stand on Thursday during her trial.  She told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece. According to CBS Pittsburgh, she said: 'I was happy…she was so cute. We were only nine years apart. The first thing she did was say, 'Aunt Tina, I'm so happy for you,' and gave me a big hug.' As the night went on they drank more, the court heard, and soon Mr Harvan was determined to drive home. However Francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him. George-Harvan said: 'When I turned around, the glove box is open and I see this gun. I think I gotta move this gun. I go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off. The defense attorney then asked: 'Did you squeeze the trigger?' And she replied: 'No.' Recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece, she said: 'Everything freezes, Jeremy says, 'You just shot your [expletive] cousin'. George-Harvan (pictured before her first court appearance the day after the shooting) said she would never hurt her niece and insists there was no tension between the pair earlier in the evening . The row had spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car (inside on night of shooting pictured) when the gun went off. George-Harvan claims it fired when she tried to move it . 'He steps over her dying body and he runs. I put pressure on [Katelyn's[ wound and I screamed and dialed 911. She added, 'I felt devastated. It was like a nightmare. Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead.' The prosecution rested on Thursday. The defense called former Pennsylvania State Trooper Frederick Wentling as a ballistic experts. He told the court the weapon could discharge with just the slightest pressure on the trigger. According to CBS Pittsburgh, he said: 'If you put your thumb in… if you pick it up sideways, and put your thumb in there and pull it back, it will discharge. 'It's supposed to. It doesn't know what's pulling it to the rear.' On Friday Prosecutor Brittany Smith told the jury, 'She shot somebody. She killed somebody. Do you think she used reasonable care?' The jury is now deliberating and is considering third-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. The defense argues the jury should acquit her of any homicide charge under the doctrine of 'excusable homicide by misadventure,'. The defendant has to have shown carelessness without criminal intent for that to be proven. George-Harvan, her new husband and Francis went out drinking to celebrate the marriage at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton and subsequently got into a fight over who would drive home .","Christina George-Harvan shot Katelyn Francis, 21 on April 24, 2014 .

The sportsman, from Cardiff, can still do 44 press-ups in two minutes and 50 sit-ups in the same amount of time - the requirements needed to qualify as a new reservist recruit for the Parachute Regiment. He said: 'How dare the Army tell me I'm too old to do my job - it's a kick in teeth. 'I have a lifetime working in fitness, I feel I have so much to give in an era where fitness and obesity is a growing problem.

"The search continues for a missing Texas mother-of-three, who disappeared from her home with her purse and cell phone. Danielle Sleeper, 32, was last seen by her husband on the morning of March 22. He told authorities his wife was asleep when he left their home in Magnolia. The search continues for missing mother-of-three Danielle Sleeper, 32, who was last seen by her husband sleeping in their home in Magnolia, Texas on the morning of March 22 . When he returned in the afternoon she was gone, although her vehicle was still parked outside. Sleeper's father, Charles Street, said it's not like his daughter to 'just start walking on foot and just leave'. 'I don't know. Maybe she got scared or something,' he told ABC 13. Sleeper, a stay-at-home mother of three boys, also does not have her medication, which she takes for seizures. Her mother, Dina Street, said she became concerned when Sleeper didn't text or call her back that Sunday. 'She lives on that phone,' Dina Street told KHOU. The phone has since been turned off. Dina Street said her daughter would never just leave her boys behind. 'She would not just walk away,' she said. 'She just loves people and she just loves communicating with them.' But she had a message for Sleeper, just in case her daughter did leave of her own free will. 'I'm tearing my heart out and your dad and your sister are just beside themselves,' Street said. Sleeper's purse and cell phone were also gone, but her car was still parked in the driveway. The mother's medication, which she takes for seizures, was also left behind . 'We've got everybody and their brother looking for you. Please let us know where you are.' Sleeper's sister, Tannah Cross, also had words for Danielle. 'I just want you to come home,' she said. 'If you're safe and you're out there, just come home.' But Cross believes something's 'not right'. 'This is not her, this is not normal,' she told Click2Houston. 'She is a loving mom who is always around her kids.' 'This is what she gets up in the morning for. That is why I know this is not right.'

"Mark Robson, 44, had half his foot amputated after he cut it while swimming on a holiday to Egypt . A father lost half his foot  and all his toes after cutting himself in a swimming pool while on holiday. Mark Robson suffered a serious bone infection in the years after the injury, forcing doctors  to operate. He  had to give up his job after the accident as  can no longer drive and struggles with basic household tasks. The 44-year-old had been swimming in a pool in the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh when he gashed his toe. Despite the injury healing quickly, when Mr Robson returned to the UK medics said he had a bone infection and prescribed antibiotics. But in the five years after the accident, the infection returned repeatedly and doctors were forced to carry out a series of operations. They eventually had to amputate half his foot and his toes, leaving him needing to be cared for by his family. As a result, he launched legal proceedings against Thomson's Tropicana Jasmine Hotel, where he was injured. He has now won a £25,000 payout to help with everyday life, and is now calling on Thomson to improve safety measures at its resorts. The father-of-one, of Shiremoor, North Tyneside, said: 'The impact this whole issue has had on me has been devastating. 'As well as having no choice but to leave work, I now need assistance with basic household tasks and I can't drive – so am almost entirely reliant on my wife, family and friends. 'I have completely lost my independence as I cannot bear weight on my leg. 'The holiday to the Tropicana Jasmine Hotel has become memorable for all of the wrong reasons. 'I just hope that no-one else faces what I have been through, which is why tour operators and resorts have to make sure that the safety of holidaymakers is a top priority.' Mr Robson and his wife Gillian's holiday in August 2010 was the first time the couple had been on away since their honeymoon 16 years earlier. Just one day into the holiday Mr Robson felt a pain in his right foot and noticed it was bleeding as he stepped out of the pool. He said: 'I realised I must have caught it on the lining of the pool, which was quite sharp and had what seemed to be a rough concrete surface. 'I got it bandaged up but thought it would heal fairly quickly like a standard wound. 'It stopped me from swimming for the rest of the holiday and also stopped us going on an excursion or two, but ultimately I didn't think there would be any lasting damage.' When he returned to the UK, medics at a walk-in centre told him his toe may be infected so he went to Sunderland Royal Hospital and was prescribed antibiotics. Mr Robson underwent an operation in 2012 to remove all of his toes and part of his bone from his right foot. He says this has left him unable to drive and struggling to carry out basic household tasks . But by the September, his GP referred him to the podiatry clinic at the local hospital and he was admitted for treatment. In February 2012 the bone infection returned and Mr Robson underwent an operation to remove his second toe and a large part of bone from his right foot. Initially, he returned to work as a vehicle quality assessment operator at Nissan. But in January 2013, he was forced to leave the job because of back pain caused by the injury, as well as the ongoing bone infection. In February this year he had another operation in which doctors removed his remaining toes. Mr Robson launched legal proceedings against tour operator TUI UK Limited, which trades as Thomson, which runs the hotel where he injured his foot. He has now been awarded £25,000 to help with his living and care costs. TUI UK has admitted liability for the accident but requires Mr Robson to prove that the problems he has since suffered are as a result of the accident. His lawyers are now compiling medical evidence they can use as proof, and the case is ongoing. Mr Robson cut his foot on some rough swimming pool lining while at a resort in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, in August 2010 (left). He developed a serious bone infection and underwent operations to remove his toes (right) Tonia Kingsley, the solicitor at Irwin Mitchell who is representing Mr Robson, said: 'It is hard to put into words how difficult the past four years have been for Mark, with him needing on-going medical treatment and ultimately seeing his life completely transformed as a result of what he has been through. 'What began as an injury on holiday has gone on to have serious, life-changing consequences for him and his family. 'A terrible case like this highlights the lasting effects that such accidents can have, highlighting the seriousness of such problems and why tour operators must continue to work to keep holidaymakers safe from potential risks.' A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear about the injury sustained by Mr Robson whilst he was staying at the Tropicana Jasmine Club in Egypt in 2010. 'Our legal team is in direct contact with Mr Robson's solicitors. As this is subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'We would like to reassure customers that health and safety is of paramount importance to Thomson and we operate the strictest quality standards across all of our hotels.'","Mark Robson, 44, went on a Thomson holiday to Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt .

"It takes a lot to steal the show from the notoriously flamboyant Eurovision entries, but this Swedish sign language interpreter's energetic moves and expressive gestures have managed to do just that. Tommy Krångh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after putting on the performance of his life, interpreting pop singer Magnus Carlsson's attempt to enter Eurovision. But while Carlsson's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the Scandinavian country, being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition, many are now calling for 48-year-old Krångh to take the stage for Sweden in Vienna this May. Star: Tommy Krångh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after he appeared on national television . Hit: Krångh interpreted pop singer Magnus Carlsson's bid for Eurovision glory . Clicks: But while Carlsson's song only came ninth out of 12 entries, it has been shared thousands of times . Shared: And it is all down to Krångh's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles . The video of Krångh's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in Sweden, and across the world. The delighted interpreter has told Swedish newspapers he was 'thrilled' with the reaction - and has been 'love-bombed' on Twitter by people who enjoyed his energetic performance, even getting the odd marriage proposal. 'It´s been absolutely amazing,' he told MailOnline. 'I´ve been love-bombed from a thousands of people. People are even proposing to marry me. This is something I could never imagine. 'It's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years. I love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment.' Hilarious: Krångh says he has been 'love-bombed' on social media since the show went out . Interpretation: He hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the 'feel' of the song . Water cooler: He wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages . Krångh told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet he 'just get funky and let go' when he got up on stage. Speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'The music is a part of your entire body. 'That is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself.' Meanwhile, he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey. 'We get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song,' he explained. 'What is the message, if there is a message for that matter, what does the artist want with the song. How do you get into the rhythm and so forth. 'The important thing is that people who can´t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can. 'They should be able to have an opinion about the song, just like everyone else.' Future: It is not clear whether Krångh is going to be the interpreter for this year's Swedish entry yet . Entry: Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw, who won the public vote . Top marks: However, it seems the Swedish public would give 'dix points' if Krångh is the interpreter . It is not yet clear whether Krångh will be heading to Vienna as the official sign language interpreter. Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw this year, and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy. But it seems the Swedes might be a little sad if Krångh doesn't make an appearance. 'I know that Måns will make us proud in Vienna, but I would not say no if I was asked,' he told MailOnline. 'Perhaps we could both be on stage,' added Krångh, who also revealed his 'dream artist' to work with would be Celine Dion. Krångh is not the first Swedish interpreter to capture the imagination of the nation. The last time Sweden won Eurovision three years ago with Euphoria, by Loreen, an interpreter managed to steal a bit of the limelight from the main act. Precedent: This sign language interpretation was also a hit three years ago . Trophy: That year's winner, Euphoria, by Loreen, came complete with an emotive interpretation .","Tommy Krångh, 48, has become a celebrity in his native Sweden .

"Opinion has swung to the Left since the last election – but Ed Miliband lacks the credentials to take advantage of it, a major report revealed yesterday. Five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the Right on issues such as public spending, Europe, welfare and business, it showed. Political attitudes have now returned to the same point as 2005 when Tony Blair secured the last of his three election wins for Labour. But the party still 'struggles to attract support' despite the shift in the public mood, according to detailed analysis of the latest British Social Attitudes Survey. The report shows Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate . It shows that Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate, said the report. The shift to the Left could also help explain the rise of the Greens and SNP in Scotland, it added. Veteran pollster Peter Kellner said: 'Ed Miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground.' The report's author, Dr John Bartle, said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the Conservatives if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts. He said: 'The general leftward shift that has taken place since the last general election suggests that arguments about the need to shrink the state, reduce waste and cut income taxes will have less traction than in 2010.' The report's author, Dr John Bartle, said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the Conservatives if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts . Veteran pollster Peter Kellner said: 'Ed Miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground' The study, carried out by NatCen Social Research and the University of Essex, is based on an analysis of hundreds of opinion polls on a range of issues since 2010. They feed into a wider study which has tracked political attitudes since the mid-1960s. Dr Bartle said the trend since 2010 was typical of that seen in the past – with public opinion moving in the opposite direction to the government of the day. He said: 'Beginning in 1964, the average left-right position generally tracked rightwards until 1980, the year after Margaret Thatcher came to power. 'The public then gradually moved left during the 1980s and remained there for the duration of the [John] Major premiership. 'The mood shifted rightwards from 1997 under New Labour and then left under the Coalition. Consequently, governing parties that achieve their party's preferred policies cut the electoral ground from beneath their own feet – a Conservative government that reduces spending and taxes reduces concerns about waste and regulation, while a Labour government that increases resources to the NHS and education reduces concerns about public services.' SIX weeks ago Labour vowed not to carry out a negative election campaign. Yesterday it unveiled its first poster accusing the Tories of stripping the NHS to the bone. A Tory spokesman described it as ‘fear and smear’ tactics .","Five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the Right .

"It was once a smoke-spewing industrial behemoth overlooking Sydney Harbour, providing power for the city's rail and tram network. But the now white elephant White Bay Power Station is set to be brought back to life thanks to a $1 billion makeover, with rumours Google has its sights set on it for its Australian headquarters. Built in 1912, the 38,000 square metre site has had a colourful past, and a tour through the ruins is like stepping back more than 100 years - if you can ignore the crumbling walls, eerie industrial equipment and 100 tonnes of bird droppings which covered the floor of the old dance hall. Asbestos-riddled and home to more pigeons than could be counted before Daily Mail Australia was taken through the cavernous building - not to mention the local bat colony - the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority spent nearly $5 million in 2014 to preserve what was still standing. Among the items still standing idle inside are the old lockers used by employees and storage rooms which dot the building, in this throwback to a bygone era. The bathrooms, fitted even before the advent of the First World War, are lined with graffiti now and the paint is peeling off the old ceramic tiles, which have been preserved in almost pristine condition hidden underneath. 'These buildings are so strong, there are no cracks, it will be great when it happens,' archaeologist Dr Wayne Johnson said. 'It is considered a very significant building and any work has to be done with a strict conservation plan but you can see there is a lot of room for everything else. 'The vastness of it, the great cavernous spaces, the machinery, there's nothing quite like this. 'All you see here represents the whole thing from 1912 until it closed in the 1980s. 'There's evidence of the whole history of its function and enough machinery has been kept so you understand what a power station does.' In the 1950s and 1960s, with the White Bay Power Station at its pomp, local swimmers happened across a novel and secret way to keep up their training in the cold winter months. The water, which would be used to bring the temperatures of the boilers down, would then run off through the underground canal and out into the nearby bay - where John Devitt, a 1960 Olympic gold medallist, was one of the first to recognise its benefits. Dr Johnson claims that 'it is like a piece of industrial archaeology, it reads like a book, you look and you know what it did'. Steve Tadic is the security guard and he keeps his precinct under a tight watch. He's spent more than 20 years in charge. 'Eh you, come here and sign the book' he calls out, with absolute authority, to two workmen who arrive and forget to report in. 'It was very dangerous before they did the work, the homeless people were here,' he said. 'It's a vast cavernous building and you just don't see space like this near a major city with so much artefact like machinery still intact,' said archaeologist Dr Wayne Johnson . The view from above. A watch-room, perched high above the work floor is badly amaged and decaying after decades of non-use . Asbestos sheets, broken glass and timber litters the no-go zone at the last remaining power station of its type in New South Wales .

The canal flushing out the water used to cool the systems down would flow into the bay immediately outside the factory, which became a training pool for gold medal winners like John Devitt in the 1960s . Room with a million dollar view. Authorities have boarded up the windows of the disused power station but any extensive redevelopment will reveal a spectacular panorama of Sydney's famous harbour . The train lines into the old power station are still in place where locomotives laden with coal would unload into an underground storage before it was pushed up the conveyor belt (centre) and then fall down into the boiler rooms, pictured at right . The White Bay Power Station supplied most of the energy needed for Sydney's rail and tram system plus pumping electricity back into the main grid when demand was at high levels during winter and holiday periods .

Sirocco machinery pictured inside the abandoned power station. The huge fans were developed for use in power stations in the late 1800s . The old boiler houses became a haven for ""cave clan"" urban explorers and graffiti gangs for more than 30 years before the restoration was undertaken and security beefed up .

The White Bay Power Station was built from 1912, finally came on line in 1917 and operated until it was decommissioned in late 1983. It was the longest serving power station of its type.

'There's evidence of whole history of its function and enough machinery has been kept so you understand what a power station does. It is like a piece of industrial archaeology, it reads like a book, you look and you know what it did' said Dr Johnson . And how it looked way back when. The factory floor with boilers in full flow and workers keeping a close eye . One upon a time this equipment was providing most of the power for Sydney's train and tram system . The lights of days gone by litter the floors of the remaining boiler rooms . The roof fixed on the main building and dance hall tidied, there is still no access granted to the public, unless you've been taken through the security check and donned the white contamination suit, for concern over lingering levels of asbestos inside. Several sections are still boarded up to keep away the unwanted intruders, still, the most spectacular view of the harbour panorama that once was, is visible through the slats. The communications board too has somehow stood the test of time, set on the wall almost as a kind of early 20th century ABN. Sadly the definitive foreman towers, perched metres above the work-floor, are not so sound, clearly falling apart .. vandalised and struggling with the sands of time. Elsewhere, shattered glass and broken bits of timber need to be negotiated, as do collapsing floors for fear of plunging many metres. A danger zone, which even the city's so-called ""cave-dwellers"" have declared a no-go zone because of its decaying state. 'In 1912, when it was built, there was a certain capacity, and then in the 1920s they had to enlarge it and then the next boiler hall was brought in during the 50s.' Not only was it source of power for the red rattlers, it would also supplement Sydney's electricity needs during periods of high demand, particularly over Christmas and New Year, in the decades past. Those were the halcyon days, before the power station was decommissioned on Christmas Day in 1983.","There are plans to turn a 100-year-old abandoned and decaying coal-fired power station into a billion dollar shopping and apartment complex .

"An emotional mother who lost her son serving in Afghanistan was today able to thank Prince Harry in person for the 'beautiful' letter he wrote her after he died. Cheryl Routledge's son, Corporal Liam Riley, was just 21 when he was killed by an IED whilst serving with the Coldstream Guards Battle Group in 2010. The characterful 3rd Battalion Yorkshire regiment soldier, known for his cheeky sense of humour and ever-present smile, had trained with Prince Harry in Canada in 2007 when he was in the Blues and Royals and preparing for the frontline. Corporal Liam Riley (pictured left, with Prince Harry) was just 21 when he was killed by an IED in Aghanistan. His mother was comforted as she grieved by a 'beautiful' letter from Harry, who she thanked today . Although they had not met since, the pair were said to have bonded during their three month posting. Liam, was killed in February 2010 after trying to rescue a colleague who had also stepped on an IED during a patrol near Gereshk. He was second in command of a base security foot patrol when the device was detonated, leaving him with catastrophic injuries. His funeral in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside. In the aftermath of his death, as Mrs Routledge struggled to cope with her grief, she was comforted by a letter written by Harry personally. She has chosen not to make the contents public out of respect for the prince but said today: 'Harry said that although they had not known each other for long, some three months or so, he knew instantly that Liam was 'a legend' and what a great bloke he was. They said some fantastic times together in Canada. 'He told me that he had an unforgettable smile, in fact he said he never stopped smiling the whole time he knew him. 'He talked to me about the pain he felt after his own mother died and how he came to terms with his grief. 'It was a beautiful letter, written from the heart, and something that touched me and brought me enormous comfort at the time. It is something I will always treasure.' Mrs Routledge was first introduced to Harry's father, Prince Charles, at a reception at London's Guildhall today following the service of commemoration for those who had served in Afghanistan at St Paul's Cathedral. Liam's funeral (pictured) in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside . Charles's eye was drawn not only to Liam's medals that she was wearing, but a badge showing the smiling soldier on his mother's lapel. When Mrs Routledge, 50, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, explained her son's link to Harry, Charles rubbed her affectionately on the arm. The mother-of-three said afterwards: ‘Liam was always very discreet about the time he served with Prince Harry but did tell me that when Harry celebrated his birthday out in Canada, Prince Charles sent him a cake and he shared it with them all. ‘Prince Charles was very sympathetic and asked me about Liam. He appeared very touched to hear about the time he had spent with his son.’ When royal officials became aware that Liam had been known to Harry personally, they arranged for his mother and grandmother, Grace Davison, 73, to meet with the prince in another room at the reception where he was greeting serving soldiers. ‘How did you find me down here?’ the prince said in shock as he hugged Mrs Routledge and her mother, before posing for pictures. ‘It is very good to meet you at last. When I said Liam was a legend, I meant it.’ Prince Harry, pictured at a service of commemoration at St. Paul's Cathedral today, marking 13 years of military operations in Afghanistan . Afterwards Mrs Routledge said the meeting had meant a great deal to her. ‘I just wanted to be able to thank him for what he said about Liam. His words were a huge comfort to us all at a very difficult time,’ she said. Ironically for his family, Liam hadn’t been due for a tour of duty in Afghanistan but had pestered his superiors for the chance to be sent there as he ‘didn’t feel worthy of his rank’ without having served in a warzone. ‘He took to the army like a duck to water and was flying up the ranks,’ his mother recalled. ‘There was nothing I could have done to stop him, he was doing what he loved. Like all of these parents here you just have to kiss them goodbye and keep your fingers’ crossed. Sadly for us we were one of those who received a knock on the door.’ In all there were close to a thousand family members and servicemen present at the reception, held by the City of London, at which the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent were also present along with Prime Minister David Cameron. The family of Royal Marine Steven Birdsall, who died at the age of just 20 after being shot by a sniper as he worked in a military compound in Sangin, were also introduced to Charles. Prince Harry, who served in two tours of Afghanistan, stands with sister-in-law Kate and brother Prince William during the commemoration . Marine Birsdall, of 40 Commando, was seriously injured in June 2010 and immediately flown back to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but died the following day from his wounds. The death of the ‘brave and selfless’ soldier from Warrington, left his family in deep shock. His mother, Jenny, described today’s event as a ‘very fitting memorial’. ‘We will never forget Steven and still have our good and bad days,’ she said. ‘He was only two and a half years out of his training but he loved what he was doing. He was very selfless, brave and fearless. ‘It has been a long and difficult road even getting to the point that we can talk about what has happened so publically. ‘But Prince Charles was wonderful. He was hugely sympathetic. He told me how much Prince Harry had loved his service in Afghanistan and would have gone out there in a heartbeat again if he had been able to. ‘It meant a great deal to us to be able to share Steven’s story with him.’ In a short speech before the reception, The Lord Mayor of London, Alan Yarrow, said it was impossible for anyone to imagine what the families of those who lost loved ones in Afghanistan had lived through in order to get to this day. ‘But we can remember and respect,’ he said.","Corporal Liam Riley was just 21 when he was killed by an IED in 2010 .
