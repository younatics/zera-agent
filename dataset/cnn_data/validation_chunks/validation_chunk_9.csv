The Liverpool striker cooked up a chicken dish specialty in preparation for Mother's Day as part of his role as a Sainsbury's ambassador.

"The new Formula One season gets underway in the early hours of Sunday morning when Melbourne plays host to the opening race of the campaign. Ahead of the curtain raiser, Phil Duncan assesses the sport's hot topics... So, it looks like Lewis Hamilton is going to waltz to back-to-back titles… . There’s no question that Mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year. Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter, and they were the quickest, too. Hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year, and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying, he’ll be tough to beat. Lewis Hamilton appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener . Hamilton’s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter… Is there any danger he’s taken his eye off the ball? The reigning champion has helped to raise F1’s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off-season. From the Paris catwalk to the red carpet at the BRITs, Hamilton's never been far from the limelight. His high-profile split from Nicole Scherzinger has hit the headlines, too. But the Briton, now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year, appears to have adopted a new-found maturity in recent times, and his desire to match Ayrton Senna’s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign. At least, he's telling us that anyway. Hamilton poses in his Mercedes overalls on Thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship . Rosberg, posing for pictures with fans on Thursday, will renew his title battle with team-mate Hamilton . So, what can Rosberg do to stop him? Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 12-7 last term, but his race displays left much to be desired; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014. If the German sorts out his race pace, he’ll give Hamilton a run for his money. At 3-1 with some bookmakers, he’s certainly worth a punt. And what about the rest of the grid? Williams, powered by Mercedes once more, are set to be Hamilton and Rosberg’s nearest challengers. Valtteri Bottas was one of the stand-out performers last term, and his team-mate Felipe Massa is among the most experienced out there. Ferrari, boosted by the arrival of Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums. Daniel Ricciardo, the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race last year, should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014, but his Renault-powered Red Bull still lacks what it takes to challenge Hamilton and Rosberg on a consistent basis. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas was among the stand-out performers in 2014, and he is set to take the challenge to Mercedes once more . Daniel Ricciardo poses with models at the Albert Park Circuit ahead of his home race in Melbourne . I noticed you haven’t mentioned McLaren… I thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with Honda? Well, that was the plan, but it looks as though it will be some time before either Fernando Alonso or Jenson Button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race. The Woking-based outfit, struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace, too. Button, retained by McLaren after a surprise U-turn from the team's hierarchy at the end of last year, has already called for patience, and reckons just getting to the finish on Sunday, should be considered a positive result. Jenson Button is set for his 16th season in Formula One, but McLaren are likely to struggle from the offset . And Alonso, their marque signing, won't be there? No. The Spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days. CCTV captured the 134mph smash, but the footage  has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident. The former Ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in Malaysia, but his participation is yet to be confirmed by McLaren. Kevin Magnussen, dropped by the British team at the end of last year, gets his chance in Melbourne this weekend. Fernando Alonso waves to the media after he is released from hospital following a crash in testing . With a combined age of 68, Alonso and Button form the eldest pairing on the grid, but what about this kid Verstappen? He isn’t old enough to drive a road car yet is he? Not in his native Holland, no. Son of Jos Verstappen, the former Benetton driver and team-mate of Michael Schumacher, Max is just 17. He has been partnered at Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso with rookie Carlos Sainz Jnr, who at the grand old age of 20 is somewhat of a veteran. Verstappen will become the youngest driver in F1 history on Sunday, and it’s a record which is unlikely to be broken after the FIA raised the minimum age limit to 18 in the wake of Verstappen’s controversial appointment. Max Verstappen (left) and Carlos Sainz Jnr will form the youngest driver pairing in grand prix history . So, what else do I need to look out for this season? Following one of the grandest overhauls of the sport ahead of the last campaign, the rules and regulations are relatively unchanged for 2015. Ugly nosecones are thankfully a thing of the past, the Mexican Grand Prix is back on the calendar for the first time in more than two decades, and drivers have been stopped from changing their helmet throughout the season. Caterham are gone, but Marussia, now in the guise of Manor, have survived and after hiring Will Stevens, three Brits will line up Down Under. We’ll also see the introduction of the ‘Virtual Safety Car’... Under new regulations, Hamilton will be forced to stick with the same helmet design (above) throughout 2015 . What’s that all about then? In the wake of Jules Bianchi's horror crash at last year's Japanese Grand Prix, a 'Virtual Safety Car; concept has been introduced. FIA race director Charlie Whiting will deploy the system immediately after any incident which requires double waved yellows, but is not deemed severe enough for the Safety Car itself. The aim is to neutralise the race track and slow drivers down after Bianchi, who remains unconscious in hospital, was adjudged to have been going too fast when he crashed into the back of a tractor sent to recover Adrian Sutil’s Sauber at the rain-lashed race in Japan. So, what time shall I set my alarm for on Sunday? Nice and early! Another recommendation following Bianchi’s crash was to bring forward the start-time of a number of races outside Europe. Sunday's Australian Grand Prix gets underway at 5am (4pm local time), one hour earlier than last year, to avoid any danger of the race ending in darkness. You can follow the coverage of every lap on MailOnline.

"For Burnley, a famous victory. For champions Manchester City, plenty of soul-searching required. After failing to stop George Boyd, not many will fancy their chances of coping with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at the Nou Camp on Wednesday. It was a famous night at Turf Moor, their first win over City since 1974 ranking alongside their 2009 victory against Manchester United in their first season in the Premier League when Robbie Blake scored the winner. City deserved what they got — absolutely nothing. Their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, looked pale and drawn by the final whistle as well he might. City dominated possession but not energy, commitment or even goal chances. George Boyd scored Burnley's winner with a sweetly struck shot into the bottom corner . Vincent Kompany's clearance fell straight to Boyd who caught it sweetly with his left foot . Boyd celebrates his 61st minute strike at Turf Moor on Saturday night . Burnley (4-4-2): Heaton 6.5, Trippier 6.5, Duff 6.5, Shackell 7, Mee 6, Boyd 8, Arfield 7, Jones 7, Barnes 6, Vokes 6.5 (Ward 87), Ings 7 (Reid 90). Subs Not Used: Wallace, Kightly, Jutkiewicz, Gilks, Keane. Booked: Mee, Duff. Goals: Boyd 61. Man City (4-4-2): Hart 6, Zabaleta 6.5, Kompany 6, Demichelis 5, Clichy, Jesus Navas 5, Toure 6 (Lampard 81), Fernandinho 5, Silva 5 (Jovetic 74), Dzeko 4.5 (Bony 63), Aguero 5.5. Subs Not Used: Sagna, Nasri, Caballero, Mangala. Booked: Demichelis. Att: 21,216 . Ref: Andre Marriner 5 (W Midlands). Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure spent most of the game in his own half. CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . They are still five points behind leaders Chelsea, having played two games more, and the immediate reaction from TV pundit Jamie Redknapp was that this was the type of performance by City players that gets managers the sack. It was City, not the underdogs of Burnley, who used illegitimate strongarm tactics. Sergio Aguero was lucky that referee Andre Marriner did not spot his studs-up challenge that caught Michael Duff on the ankle. Martin Demichelis crudely targeted Clarets dangerman Danny Ings and caught him in the leg, chin and back of the head on at least three occasions. The Argentine was very fortunate not to sent off on the totting-up procedure. Everywhere you looked there was a City horror story. David Silva gave one of his worst performances in a City shirt and was hooked after missing their best chance from Aguero’s pass. Skipper Vincent Kompany was partly culpable for Burnley’s winner after being recalled to the side. Pablo Zabaleta claimed a late penalty when he was challenged Mee. Nothing was given, correctly. Burnley are still third from bottom but only one point behind Sunderland in the Premier League safety zone. And their winning goal after 61 minutes was excellent. Kieran Tripper’s delivery from a free-kick was fantastic, Kompany rose to head away from goal but only to Boyd, lurking on the edge of the box. The celebrations were akin to another famous Burnley goal, Robbie Blake's winner against Manchester United . Manchester City prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at Turf Moor . New signing Wilfried Bony can't believe that City have slipped to another defeat . The Scot caught his half-volley sweetly with his left foot and it arrowed past Hart into the goalkeeper’s bottom left corner. Job done and Boyd described it as ‘the most important goal of my career’. Pellegrini was measured but his words rang hollow. ‘I don’t think we played very badly, it was a normal performance,’ he said. ‘We just needed to create more chances. Football is not about money. In the Premier League any team can beat another.’ On his side’s fading title prospects, he added: ‘We are second so we are not doing so badly. Every point we drop, it will be more difficult, but when you have mathematical chances, you have to keep fighting. We must trust what we are doing and see at the end of the season.’ Burnley boss Sean Dyche, who has seen his side earn draws at Chelsea and City this season, said: ‘We deserved to edge it. A lot has been made of this tough run of games but I said this is the challenge we want. ‘This is what the league is about and we will have a piece of it. We take challenges on. We are brave, and were again today.’ Burnley did not let City settle and the visitors took half-an-hour to test goalkeeper Tom Heaton through Edin Dzeko and Aguero. Surprisingly, the champions resorted to rough stuff as they got frustrated. City striker Sergio Aguero was frustrated by the stubborn Burnley defence . Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko has an effort blocked by Burnley defence . City boss Manuel Pellegrini saw his strongarm tactics backfire ahead of their big date in The Nou Camp . Burnley forward Ashley Barnes challenges Manchester City winger Jesus Navas . Burnley defender Kieran Trippier clears the ball from City midfielder David Silva . City defender Vincent Kompany clears the ball despite challenge from Burnley's Sam Vokes . Michael Duff was caught by that studs-up challenge from Aguero that Mr Marriner missed. Demichelis clumped Ings on the back of the head when they jumped for a high ball and was booked for a late challenge on the same player a few minutes later. Dyche looked unhappy at the time but was magnanimous after the game. ‘You should have seen me as a centre-half,’ he quipped. City’s big chance came when Aguero played in Silva. The Spaniard should have scored but his first touch was uncharacteristically poor and his final shot was comfortably gathered by Heaton. City paid for it when Scotland international Boyd struck after 61 minutes. The champions sent on Wilfried Bony, Stevan Jovetic and, finally, Frank Lampard to try to salvage a point. The cost of their substitutes, £50million, equals the sum Burnley have spent on transfer fees in their entire history. The visitors did have a late penalty appeal when Ben Mee challenged Zabaleta. It was 50-50 as to whether the Burnley player took the ball or player first, and Dyche said: ‘I haven’t seen it but we’ve been on the wrong end of margins this season. If it was a penalty, maybe that’s the balance you get over the season.’ City now need a miracle in Barcelona to overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit and keep alive Pellegrini’s hopes of landing a trophy this season. At the other end of the table, Sunderland will be nervously looking over their shoulder after this great and deserved Burnley victory.

"These are testing times for Scotland. The embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible Six Nations whitewash await on Saturday. Yet, still, some have faith. After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special. The 32-year-old, who has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career, is not one to take a backwards on the field of play. And he insists that, despite results, Vern Cotter's men are heading in the right direction. Scotland lock Jim Hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine-year international career . Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to Championship rivals England before they take on France in the evening kick-off. An onslaught awaits. But the man who Cotter calls his 'great, old warrior' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon-fodder. And Hamilton, who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012, said: 'I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future. 'Having had the experiences I have had playing for Scotland and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity, something good will come of the time we are going through just now I am sure. 'This squad is in a very good place, more so than in most Six Nations I have been involved in despite the results. On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game, but I think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up. Hamilton insists Scotland are heading in the right direction under Scotland coach Vern Cotter (above) 'We have some fantastic players coming through. Jonny Gray was just 21 on Saturday. Then you have Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Fraser Brown. We are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff. 'The biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could-have, should-have, would-have side. The nearly team. But that will change under Vern Cotter with this group of players, no question. 'I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team. 'Are we better than the wooden spoon this year? Yeah, we probably are. 'If we beat Ireland at the weekend, am I going to be happy with how we did in the Championship? No. I want to win games. I'm here to win Championships. I am here to be part of a Scotland successful team that will come good soon. 'Whether that is with me starting games, on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys, I am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward . 'I will stay here as long as I possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will. I genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very, very well.' Hamilton's optimism is not based in fantasy. Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do — and, at times, their play has been a joy to behold. All they have to do now is execute Cotter's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their Six Nations matches thus far. 'I genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off,' said the big second row. 'Having played for Leicester and for Saracens in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win, we got used to winning. It's a habit but losing is, as well. 'We can change that habit against Ireland and although we may go into it off some losses, we have positives to take from them. Young flanker Adam Ashe (right) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games . 'For example, look at the England game when we lost early points but went in at half-time winning 13-10 — which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad. 'Also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic, haven't they? 'It is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80-minute performance. Can we win the game against Ireland at the weekend with what we've got? Of course we can. 'We have shown enough signs that we are good enough and provided we stop making naive mistakes, we can finish the Six Nations with a win and show how well this group of players is progressing.","Scotland have lost their four Six Nations game in the tournament so far .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has apologised for any offence caused by his outburst following Paris St Germain's defeat to Bordeaux - but claims his words have been 'twisted'. Ibrahimovic is facing an investigation by the French football league (LFP) for comments made as he left the field on Sunday. The Sweden striker's two goals were not enough to prevent PSG suffering a 3-2 defeat and he was angry not to be awarded a free-kick by referee Lionel Jaffredo after Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a clear backpass from defender Ludovic Sane with five minutes remaining. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice but could not prevent PSG's 3-2 defeat by Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walks towards the changing room after PSG's defeat . THe Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . The PSG talisman reportedly referred to French referee Lionel Jaffredo (centre) as an 'a******' after the game . As he walked off the field Ibrahimovic - no stranger to making controversial remarks - was filmed venting his anger. Speaking in English but in partial sentences, he can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' An LFP statement on Monday read: 'Following the receipt of the officials' report, the disciplinary commission of the LFP will study in its meeting of Thursday March 19 the comments made by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the end of the game between Girondins de Bordeaux and Paris St Germain (29th round of Ligue 1).' French sports minister Patrick Kanner called on the Swede to apologise, which he later did in a post on his Instagram account. And talking to PSG's website on Monday evening, Ibrahimovic reiterated: 'First of all, I was not aiming for the people. 'When I said it, I was angry at that moment. Whoever felt offended, or took it in the wrong way, I apologise. Ibrahimovic looks generally unimpressed as his side fall to defeat that leaves them second in Ligue 1 . Ibrahimovic faces investigation over his comments, which included calling France a 's*** country' The Sweden legend scores a goal past Bordeaux keeper Cedric Carrasso during the away game . Ibrahimovic removes his shirt after the game to reveal his impressive collection of tattoos . 'I have no problem with that. I'm a man of honour, I stand by my things I do, and I apologise. 'I think that whoever saw it, or however the media is trying to twist it, I think the French people are intelligent enough to understand the situation. 'The welcome I have had here, I'm very happy. I respect people who respect me, every day I go through here I've had a fantastic time. 'I have no regrets and nobody will change my opinion. From the first day I came, I had a good time and I will continue to have a good time. 'So don't twist it, it's about football we talk, so let's focus on the football. The football here is the most important (thing) for me.' Ibrahimovic's comments towards Jaffredo come less than a week after he was sent off in his side's Champions League victory over Chelsea and accused the Blues' players of acting like 'babies' after they surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers. Ibrahimovic had previously accused Chelsea of acting like 'babies' during their Champions League defeat . Injured team-mate Serge Aurier faces UEFA disciplinary action after labelling Kuipers a 'dirty son of a bitch' in a video posted on Facebook, and the two incidents prompted a response from France's elite referees organisation SAFE (Syndicat des Arbitres du Football d'Elite). An open letter from SAFE president Stephane Lannoy on the organisation's website read: 'We thought we had seen a peak in media outcry after Chelsea-PSG. We thought we had heard everything. But no. 'Sunday night, for a back-pass, we had a new outburst of hatred and verbal abuse. The equation is simple: back-pass = worst referee in 15 years = s*** country. 'After Mr Kuipers on Wednesday (from what country...?), Mr Jaffredo on Sunday - and ultimately, as the cup was not yet full, the whole of France.' The letter concluded: 'It is time to realise we cannot say anything, do anything and accept anything. It is high time that finally, in football, everyone recognises the status of the referee and accepts and respects it.' Ibrahimovic has been told he should leave France by the nation's far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. The National Front Leader told France Info Radio: 'Those who consider that France is a s*** country can leave it. It's as simple as that.'","PSG talisman could be heard making a foul mouth rant following PSG's 3-2 defeat by Bordeaux on Sunday .

Mr Becker and his wife witnessed Chelsea's exit from this season's Champions League on away goals after a 3-3 draw on aggregate. The Chelsea Headhunters are one of the most notorious football hooligan firms of the 1970s and 1980s. The thugs have links with a wide range of racist organisations such as Combat 18 as well as northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisations. In April 2014, about 300 Chelsea hooligans, including members of the Headhunters went on the rampage in Paris. In 1999, undercover journalist Donal McIntyre posed as a drug-dealing Ulster loyalist in a bid to infiltrate the hooligan gang. His work led to the prosecution of Jason Mariner, a senior member of the hooligan gang. A decade after his expose, Mr McIntyre was attacked by supporters of the hooligan firm outside a Surrey wine bar and knocked unconscious. Boris Becker's representatives did not return a call at the time of publication. Also, Chelsea FC did not respond to questions relating to the scarf, which was quite visible in the VIP box.","Boris Becker attended Chelsea's Champions League game with his wife .

"Britain's FIFA vice-president is confident the Boxing Day club matches will be protected when the world governing body announces the final dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar on Friday. Jim Boyce, from Northern Ireland, sits on the FIFA executive committee that will make the decision on the dates of the tournament which is being played in the winter to avoid the fierce heat of June/July, and he believes that moves to stage the 2022 final on December 23 will be defeated. UEFA has been pushing for December 23 but FIFA president Sepp Blatter said in February the final would not be staged later than December 18, which also happens to be Qatar's national day. Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce insists clubs' Boxing Day fixtures will go ahead as planned in 2022 . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (left) in action in the Premier League game against Tottenham . The most likely outcome of the meeting is that FIFA will announce a shortened tournament starting on Sunday November 20 and finishing four weeks later on Sunday December 18. Boyce, who steps down as FIFA vice-president in May, told Press Association Sport: 'There is no way you can have a World Cup final on December 23 and then have a lot of people all trying to get home for Christmas. 'December 18 has to be the absolute deadline and in Britain that would allow the club programme to resume their fixtures on Boxing Day.' The FIFA executive committee is meeting in Zurich where it is to be updated with Qatar's plans for improving the conditions of migrant workers following revelations about appalling conditions for some in the construction industry. Boyce added: 'FIFA is now monitoring this and it has to make sure that progress has been made. FIFA is concerned about this and it is something FIFA is trying to rectify.'

A UEFA source said the European governing body would accept December 18 if that was the consensus as there was still enough time to plan to accommodate the necessary changes. UEFA president Michel Platini on Wednesday responded to Scudamore's remarks saying: 'It's not only the Premier League in the world. There are many leagues, many players, many clubs. 'I always said that it would be a winter World Cup. I always said I will vote for Qatar but that I will do my best for it to be in winter and I hope it will be in the Gulf.

"Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong will return to training on Thursday after recovering from a collapsed lung as he bids to play again this season. The 26-year-old Holland international has managed only three appearances for the club since his £6million summer arrival from Ajax, but could yet figure before the end of the campaign after being given the green light by medics to step up his comeback plans. De Jong revealed the news via his Twitter account on Wednesday afternoon, saying: 'The last X-ray was all good! So tomorrow I will start training for myself again. #NUFC #comebackstronger'. Siem de Jong is set to start training again as he steps up recovery from collapsed lung . The Dutchman suffered the major setback after being set to return from a serious thigh injury . De Jong has been a spectator at St James' Park for much of the season . The news will come as a boost to beleaguered head coach John Carver, whose squad has been decimated by injury and suspension in recent weeks. De Jong's last appearance came in the 3-3 Barclays Premier League draw with Crystal Palace at St James' Park on August 30 last year. He suffered a torn thigh muscle days later which sidelined him for more than four months, and he was on the verge of returning to the squad last month when he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career. The Dutchman underwent surgery which should prevent a recurrence of the problem and has now been given the all-clear to resume training, and he will hope to be able to make a belated impact with nine games of the season remaining.","Siem de Jong joined Newcastle from Ajax last summer for £6million .

"Dennis Irwin has hailed Daley Blind's versatility and backed him to retain a place in the Manchester United starting XI, even when injured players return. The former United left-back, who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002, was impressed by Blind when he played in that position during Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham. It was United's best performance of the season, keeping them anchored in the Premier League top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend's crunch trip to Anfield to play Liverpool. Daley Blind (right) was impressive for Manchester United in Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham . Irwin, seen here celebrating a goal with David Beckham in 1997, believes Blind deserves his place in the team . Sunday's clash between Manchester United and Liverpool will be pivotal in the top four race . 'Daley's a good, honest pro,' Irwin told ManUtd.com. 'He can play at centre-half if you need him, left-back if you need him, and obviously he's played mostly in midfield for us this season. I think he's been a really good signing. 'He's a player who reads situations very, very well, I thought he played extremely well on Sunday. It'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against Liverpool, but it wouldn't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players, because they played so well. 'That's the manager's decision and he's got one or two back from suspension and injury, but I thought the team played very well on Sunday.' Blind sets off in pursuit of Arsenal's Francis Coquelin during last week's FA Cup sixth round tie . Blind celebrates scoring a late equaliser for United at West Ham last month . The Dutch international also scored a crucial late goal at West Brom earlier in the campaign . Dutch international Blind, who arrived at Old Trafford from Ajax for £13.8m last summer, has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the English game. Irwin added: 'I know Blind can fill in places and he's done tremendously well for us in midfield. 'He hasn't played at left-back that many times, he's not played centre-half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there. 'I thought Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were aggressive, didn't give Harry Kane much room, and Antonio Valencia played really well at right-back, so it was good to see and we'll need plenty of that at Anfield.'","Man United travel to Liverpool on Sunday in crunch top four clash .

"Kevin Pietersen is confident he can score more Test hundreds for England, if he is given the opportunity. The controversial, record-breaking batsman trails only captain Alastair Cook in the all-time list of England's most prolific Test centurions - having made 23, before he was sacked 13 months ago. The 34-year-old is hoping to resurrect his career with his adopted country after new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted that a return to county cricket - and first-class form - may put him back in the reckoning after all. Kevin Pietersen believes he is capable of adding to his 23 Test centuries if he receives an England recall . England captain Alastair Cook (right) has scored two more centuries than Pietersen (centre) Alastair Cook - 25 . Kevin Pietersen - 23 . Wally Hammond - 22 . MC Cowdrey - 22 . Geoffrey Boycott - 22 . Pietersen is therefore pursuing the possibility of securing a new contract in this country. Surrey, who de-registered him six months ago after a summer in which he played only Twenty20 cricket, appear to be strong favourites to re-sign him - as long as he can secure a release from his arrangement to play in the Indian Premier League, which clashes with the start of the English domestic season. Pietersen was axed after England's 2013-14 Ashes whitewash defeat, and ECB managing director Paul Downton subsequently described his 'disengagement' with his team-mates. He struggled for form, and fitness, in the summer that followed but rediscovered both for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash this winter. On his return to Australia, to commentate on the knockout stages of the World Cup, he made it clear in an interview on Fox Sports on Tuesday that he believes he can excel again for England. 'I don't think my best days are behind me. 'I thought I batted as well as I've ever batted in my career in Australia a few months ago. 'I think that's nonsense - I reckon I've still got quite a few Test hundreds in me.' Former England cricketer Pietersen has rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him . England appeared to have severed all ties with the South Africa-born batsman, until Graves recently indicated otherwise. Pietersen's autobiography, in which he depicted a culture of bullying in the England dressing-room and was highly critical of former team-mates and management staff, seemed to merely confirm a permanent split. Former England batting coach Graham Gooch, for one, is still warning against his return. 'I wouldn't bring Pietersen back,' he told the Evening Standard. 'I would question whether he would have made that much of a difference in the World Cup. 'His record for England over his career has been box office. But his performances in ODI cricket before this tournament weren't special. Former England batting coach Graham Gooch insists Pietersen does not deserve an international recall . 'Kevin Pietersen did some great things for England, make no mistake. But now it's time to move on.' Gooch, on staff during England's Ashes defeat down under, takes particular issue with some of the content of Pietersen's autobiography - published last October. 'I vehemently disagree with all the things Kevin Pietersen said. 'That's not the dressing-room I remember. 'In November 2013, he was given a memento by the players for his 100th Test in the dressing-room before the first Test at Brisbane. 'Then he stated 'This is the best England environment I have ever played in'. 'Those words came out of his mouth. He's changed his tune just a bit.'","Kevin Pietersen believes he still has a lot more to give to England .

"A 53-year-old woman has been banned from owning an animal for 20 years after neglecting her two dogs so badly they needed to be put down. Peta Brien was convicted of animal cruelty offences in the Perth Magistrates Court on Friday after failing to provide sufficient food and water for the dogs and failing to take steps to alleviate harm to them. She was also sentenced to a one-year, community-based order and ordered to pay costs of $1083. A supplied image of Big Girl, one of two dogs severely neglected by Perth woman Peta Brien . Both had been abandoned at a Maylands property and were emaciated, but one of the dogs, a two-year-old Maltese shitzu cross named Little Man, was found lying lifeless and whining, suffering dehydration, conjunctivitis and ulcerated eyes. Little Man also had severely matted fur and grass seeds embedded in his skin, which had caused severe infection and maggots in and around his hind region.

"Lizzie Velasquez, pictured with documentary director Sara Hirsh Bordo arrive, at the premiere of 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' today . Lizzie Velasquez has known the torment of being mocked by bullies from around the world. As a 17-year-old surfing the web, she came across a video of herself on YouTube that described her as the 'world's ugliest woman'. The devastated teenager spent days shutting herself from the world behind a wall of tears, thinking her life was over. But now 26, the inspirational woman has hit back at the trolls with an anti-bullying documentary about her life, describing her battle with a rare condition which stops her putting on weight. 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' premiers at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, today. The 78-minute film charts Lizzie's inspiring path from cyber-bullying victim to anti-bullying activist. Featuring details of Lizzie's emotional and physical journey through the years, it follows her progress as she attempts to lobby the US government for the first federal anti-bullying Bill. She was born with Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophy, which is a problem with the way fat is distributed in the body. At only 5ft 2ins tall, Lizzie only weighs 58lbs - just over four stone. 'All we had known all my life was that I had a syndrome which meant that I couldn't gain weight. 'At the time, I thought everyone looked like me. I didn't recognise or tell that they didn't look like me.' Lizzie, born with a rare condition which prevents her from gaining weight, was tormented by bullies at school but was shocked to discover thousands of cruel comments on a YouTube video of her at the age of 17 . First bullied as a child in school for looking different, she was horrified to stumble across a YouTube video labeling her 'The World's Ugliest Woman' as a teenager. The video, viewed four million times, was accompanied by a cascade of cruel comments about her appearance - and suggestions that she should have killed at birth. 'It was afternoon. I decided to go look for music on YouTube - and that's when I found it,' she said. 'I don't even know why I clicked on it but I did and that's when I lost it. Speaking ahead of her documentary's showing today, Lizzie said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you' 'Calling me a monster or asking why my parents didn't abort me... how in the world can I forgive the people who told me to kill myself?' She fought back by giving a TED Talk in 2013 which she says 'changed everything'. 'This is my purpose. This is what I'm meant to do for the rest of my life. 'I like to think that I'm not only telling my story, I'm telling everyone's story.' Now, Lizzie's own YouTube channel, which boasts more than 300,000 subscribers. Speaking in a video posted to her channel ahead of her documentary's showing today, she said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you. 'I finally was able to sleep and I'm feeling rested and ready to go.' But the inspiring 26-year-old fought back by becoming a motivational speaker and anti-bullying activist . Director Sara Hirsh Bordo said: 'Bullying is a subject that historically yields heartbreaking stories of hopelessness and in many times, loss. 'Rarely is there a story of survival and inspiration that continues to crossover ages, genders, and ethnicities… enter the brave story of Lizzie Velasquez.' The pair met when Ms Bordo asked her to give the TED Talk, which attracted more than 10million viewers. 'She was a local hero whose time, we found out shortly after, had arrived,' she added. 'We live in a culture of tremendous meanness. And few people have experienced it more than Lizzie. 'Lizzie chose to not give up, but to forgive and to thrive; as an author, as a speaker, and now as an activist.' She added: 'What I wanted to show is that this is Lizzie’s film, but it is everyone’s story.' Marfan Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue, which hold the body’s cells and organs together. Connective tissue also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Marfan affects about one in 5,000 people - and can affect men and women of all races and ethnic groups. Three-quarters of those who have it inherit it - and there is a 50% chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child. But some are the first in their family to have it, which is called spontaneous mutation when it happens. People with Marfan syndrome are born with it, but features of the disorder are not always present immediately. Some features of Marfan syndrome, including those affecting the heart and blood vessels, bones or joints, can get worse over time. This means it is important for early diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the risk for potentially life-threatening complications.

"Leonardo Ghiraldini has urged Italy to 'keep believing' when they tackle RBS 6 Nations title contenders Wales on Saturday without their captain and world-class number eight Sergio Parisse. A foot injury suffered during last weekend's 29-0 home defeat against France has sidelined Parisse from Italy's final game of the Six Nations campaign. Leicester hooker Ghiraldini will take the armband at Stadio Olimpico in his absence, with Italy looking for a victory that would shred this season's Six Nations form-book. Italy hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini insists Italy have to keep faith in their abilities when they face Wales . The Italians will be without their talismanic captain Sergio Parisse for their final game of the tournament . 'Sergio is one of the best number eights in the world,' Ghiraldini said at a press conference in Rome on Friday. 'Of course he's a big loss for us, but at the same time, it's an opportunity for others to take responsibility. 'Sergio could play in every national team in the world, but we have to keep believing. 'There will be moments of pressure, but we must keep our mentality for every second of the game. We can still play a good game without Sergio.' Italy have scored just three points in their two Six Nations home games this season, while they were thumped 52-11 by England at the Stadio Olimpico in their final match of the tournament last term. Parisse limps off against France and has been ruled out of the game against Wales in Rome . With Parisse missing, Ghiraldini will captain Italy, and has called on his team to show their true ability . And while they can reflect on beating Scotland at Murrayfield this time around, the campaign has proved to be another mixed bag of results. 'We have to show we are a better team than the one that turned up against France,' Ghiraldini added. 'Our win in Scotland came after two bad defeats, and we have shown that we are capable of overcoming negative moments. 'I don't know what Wales expect, but we want to show our pride. We are not thinking about denying them the title; we are focused on our own match. 'Everything starts from our first phase, and our scrum has to be at its best. We want to be accurate in every aspect of the game. 'Our discipline in kicking wasn't good last week. We made it too easy for France.

"As if he didn’t already know, Joe Schmidt found out the hard way last Saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby. Ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into Cardiff. Ten successive wins and the Grand Slam there for the taking. Eighty minutes later, their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015. A year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship. They led the table with a huge points difference and, after England fell short of eclipsing that target in Rome, there were no outside complications weighing on Ireland’s mind in that evening’s tournament closer: beat France and the title was theirs. Jared Payne (left), Iain Henderson (centre) and Jordi Murphy warm-up during Ireland training on Thursday . Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien fires out a backhand pass during Ireland's session at their base in Carton House . Jonathan Sexton (centre) and his fellow Irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against Scotland . Twelve months later they are in an awkward bind — second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that England will be last into action tomorrow. Adding to Ireland’s anxiety is their inability to get over the try line. Whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run, there have been just four in 320 minutes this term. Schmidt, though, claims not to be worried about the drought, adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that Brian O’Driscoll has retired and Gordon D’Arcy has been omitted for the Six Nations. ‘The game is very fickle,’ he claimed after announcing a team to play Scotland showing two changes from Wales with Luke Fitzgerald and Cian Healy getting in ahead of Simon Zebo and Jack McGrath. ‘One week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just didn’t convert the opportunities. Ireland coach Joe Schmit will put his friendship with Scotland boss Vern Cotter to one side on Saturday . ‘One of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try-scoring opportunities that we didn’t convert. Last year, we converted a lot of our try-scoring opportunities. They are the very fine margins. ‘Trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we’re working really hard on,’ claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as Ireland’s meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament, level with France and seven tries fewer than top scorers England. The lack of finishing power has cast a spotlight on the rookie centre pairing of Jared Payne and Robbie Henshaw. ‘Jared doesn’t have a lot of Test match experience but has played a lot of Super and European rugby. That breadth of experience and his maturity helps Robbie work away. ‘Brian O’Driscoll doesn’t leave a team and suddenly there’s no deficit. The guys who have come in in his place have done a super job, but they can’t do the same job. ‘They’re doing the job with a different experience and a different knowledge of the game at that level. I’m not a patient man, I’m not going to say that we’re being patient about it but we have to be a little bit tolerant of the development that needs to take place. Schmidt and Cotter (above) worked together with Clermont in France and in New Zealand with Bay of Plenty . ‘We do have a little inexperience at 12 but I don’t think you could fault Robbie’s form right through the championship and he will grow into that first-receiver role when it’s demanded of him a little bit more as he gains experience. ‘One of the things I do feel we will get a benefit from is working our way through this championship. Having a loss, the first one in over a year, we need to stay balanced in how we’re preparing and don’t necessarily have to go too far away from what we’ve been doing.’ Schmidt, who revealed training on Tuesday was as flat as it had ever been but was fresh on Thursday, insists that guaranteeing victory in Scotland — not focusing on the margin of a potential win — has been his approach, so much so that he admits he isn’t much inclined to pass much heed of how Wales fare in Rome prior to Saturday’s 2.30pm start (Wales need a +22 win to have bettered Ireland’s points difference). ‘It’s tricky. It may well depend on what that margin is but I don’t think you try to do anything different. You’re just looking to try to get the win… and there’s no point trying to anticipate what the French-England result will be. ‘What will be really difficult is a really good Scottish side. They have narrow losses right through and have a better balance to their side this week. It’s going to be a real challenge. I’ve read comments about how desperate they are to give an account of themselves that is sufficient to get them over the line.’","Joe Schmidt and Vern Cotter worked together at Clermont in the Top 14 .

"ISIS has executed another nine men for allegedly being spies in an unknown location in the Middle East. Each man is forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament. All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads. They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground. The masked ISIS commander who introduces the latest senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'. Scroll down for videos . Senseless: ISIS has released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists . Murder: The blindfolded and shackled men were led onto a bridge in an unknown location in the Middle East before being shot by masked extremists . Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress . Doomed: The men are eventually escorted out of the building - clad with Islamic State insignia - to their deaths . Graphic footage ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood. But the scenes in which the senseless murders take place come six minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the seven minute video. It begins with a bizarre setup of a masked ISIS commander sitting in a corporate office, flanked by two other soldiers. He say that Islamic State succeeded in arresting an entire 'cell' of spies who were tasked with monitoring their locations back to their commanding officer. The unnamed militant then claims three of the men who squealed on the others, adding: 'We took the investigation to a judge and after collecting evidence, they were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah.' Each of the nine kidnapped men are then forced to give interviews before their impending doom - presumably under duress - in which they confess to being spies. Their nationalities and professions are as yet a mystery, but some of the men look visibly terrified as they speak in trembling Arabic. This is the second video of an Islamic State execution to surface this week following the equally brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. Mastermind: The second gruesome execution video to surface this week begins with a masked fighter who says the men were 'sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah' Captured: The unnamed ISIS commander also claims that three of the alleged spies squealed on their comrades . Execution: After being escorted onto what appears to be a bridge by armed fighters, the blindfolded men are instructed to kneal . Terror: The gruesome video is the second to surface this week following the footage of eight other alleged spies being killed in a similar way on Thursday . In the video which emerged on Thursday, the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq. The gruesome propaganda video cut from scenes of the men being killed to footage of people who ISIS claims were killed during Coalition attacks on its locations. Cutaways include footage of dead children underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and body bags. As with the latest video which features interviews with the doomed captives, it featured graphics which 'profiled' each of the men about to be murdered. The videos emerge amid claims that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters in Iraq. Kurdish authorties made the allegation following a suicide bomb attack involving a truck on January 23. Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS . Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold . In a statement, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border. It was there Peshmerga forces who were trying to seize a ISIS supply line - and discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded onto the back of the truck involved. Video provided by the council showed the truck racing down a road with white smoke pouring out of it as it came under heavy fire from peshmerga fighters. It later showed a white, billowing cloud after the truck exploded and the remnants of it scattered across a road.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The Australian businessman charged with horrific acts of child abuse acted as the ring leader of an international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to investigators. Peter Gerard Scully's latest alleged victim, a 13 year-old girl, has told police she was supposed to meet one of the disgraced businessman's Australian clients and carry out lewd sex acts on camera. However, the girl told investigators plans were changed at late notice and Scully tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924 instead, The Age reports. Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. Scully's alleged crimes are so heinous they have led to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show the 13-year-old girl being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. His alleged victim was also forced to call him 'Uncle Peter' and started working for him, after he had promised to cover her schooling costs. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' the girl said. It is claimed Scully abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers in a lucrative 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . Reportedly, Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme. The 52-year-old was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' his alleged victim told police investigators. The allegations emerged after the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. He was formally charged on Friday. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . Scully avoided arrest until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

"Tommy Seymour insists the cracks in Scotland's creaking defence have not been caused by mental weakness. The Glasgow wing angrily shot down the suggestion that psychological frailties had been the reason for the Scots' wretched RBS 6 Nations campaign. Vern Cotter's team strode purposefully into this year's championships on the back of three encouraging displays against Argentina, New Zealand and Tonga in November. Some pundits even tipped the the Dark Blues as dark horses for the title. But the same old self-inflicted gaffes that have cost them dear, with Ireland now preparing to complete a miserable run by handing the Celtic neighbours their fifth straight defeat in Edinburgh this Saturday. Seymour knows his side have let themselves down - but he insist their problems do not start in the mind. Tommy Seymour has dismissed talk of mental weakness in the Scotland camp . He said: 'No - 100 per cent not. I would almost take offence to the notion of that. 'Listen, I can understand the questions that are asked because people obviously look at the performances and think there is a button here that needs to be pressed. 'But there is definitely not a mental fragility.' The Scots kicked-off their campaign in Paris but despite notching the only try, they allowed France to kick their way to a 15-8 win following a string of penalties. Wales then took control of their second match at Murrayfield after stand-off Finn Russell was sin-binned when his 'reckless' tackle left jumping Dragons fly-half Dan Biggar in a heap. There was more misery in store as Italy's rolling maul steamrollered the Azzurri to a last-gasp win in the capital, while Scotland sparkled briefly at Twickenham on Saturday before the Auld Enemy fired back into a three-way shoot-out for the title by adding 15 unanswered points in the second half. 'We need to stop being the creators of our own downfall at times,' added Seymour. 'But there is certainly no fragility on a mental aspect with any of the players I go out and play with. 'We know exactly what we can do. We are fully confident in that. There needs to be an ability within all of us that we can do these things for 80 minutes. 'But we are definitely not in a position where we are doubting our abilities.' VIDEO England v Scotland - extended highlights . Scotland have lost all four of their Six Nations matches in this year's competition . Ireland will now go in search of the win which will see them pip England and Wales to the Six Nations title this weekend. That leaves the Scots facing the ominous prospect that if they cannot repel Joe Schmidt's side, they will end this year's Northern Hemisphere joust with a five-game whitewash for the third time since 2004. In that case, it would leave Cotter open to the charge his first campaign had been a failure - but Seymour insists that assessment is too simplistic. He said: 'It's probably too easy (to describe this campaign as a failure) I think. 'Let's not beat about the bush, we have not won a game yet. A tournament is going to be defined for the mass part for a lot of people based on the back of wins or losses. Scotland end their dismal campaign against Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday . 'Now in that case, you can say 'Well we can write this one off - it's not been what we want. It's been a failure'. 'However, with this squad it has to be a learning process. It has to be the idea that we are building something that goes beyond five or six weeks. 'It started in the autumn and is building up to the World Cup - that has to be the mindset. 'There has been a lot of disappointment in the results from this tournament. However, the elements that have shown improvement can only mean that we have to progress from this. 'We have shown the flaws that we need to fix in order to go on. 'So in terms of fixtures, it's been disappointing but it's not been a failure in terms of the growth of the squad. If we learn from the mistakes and swallow the big pills we have had to take, then we can come off the back of it stronger.'","Scotland have lost all four matches so far in RBS 6 Nations .

"France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent – and the death of French flair.

Racing Metro flanker Bernard le Roux (centre) is another South African-born player in France's ranks . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) was born in Fiji but now represents Les Bleus .

There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like George Ford – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop Uini Atonio (right) is another foreign player that is part of the France squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!' France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said – ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'","England face France in the final round of the Six Nations on Saturday .

Jelavic is set to miss the games against Chelsea, Swansea, Southampton, Liverpool and Crystal Palace . The club initially wanted to manage Jelavic's knee through until the end of the season but after last weekend's goalless draw with Leicester it was decided the surgery should take place 'as soon as possible to prevent further damage and complications in the future'. Elsewhere, the Hull City Supporters' Trust has once again called upon the club's owners to abandon plans to change the club name to Hull Tigers.

"There was no happy homecoming for Stuart McCall as he was forced to settle for a 1-1 draw against bottom side Livingston in his first game in charge of Rangers. The former Light Blues player was named as the club's 14th manager earlier in the week and his tenure looked set to get off to the best possible start when Haris Vuckic fired Rangers into an early lead. But Livi hit back through Ibra Sekajja on the stroke of half-time to claim a point. Stuart McCall (right) gestures on the touchline during his first match in charge of Rangers . Rangers players look dejected after Livingston equalised in the Scottish Championship clash . Rangers had been hoping the arrival of McCall would add a much-needed spark to their Scottish Championship promotion push. And the new manager was welcomed into the dug-out by wild applause from an Ibrox crowd of 35,066. McCall made three changes from the side who were held to a home draw by Queen of the South in midweek. Youngster Tom Walsh was handed his first start and Kenny Miller and Sebastien Faure were added to the side. The supporters were cheering again after just nine minutes when Rangers surged into an early lead. Miller's short pass found Nicky Law and he burst forward before setting up Vuckic for a left-foot strike that nestled in the bottom corner.

It had been a bright start from the Light Blues but Livi were gradually allowed to impose themselves on the game. Danny Mullen's 20-yard drive fell just over the crossbar as the division's bottom side tried to haul themselves back into the game. Keaghan Jacobs then teed up Scott Pittman for a shot that deflected narrowly past the post. Rangers could have doubled their lead when the ball broke for Walsh but he hooked just over, before Darren McGregor nodded wide from Law's corner. Gers were left ruing those missed opportunities when Livi levelled on the stroke of half-time.

Rangers did have the ball in the net after 63 minutes when Nicky Clark's header beat goalkeeper Darren Jamieson but the offside flag was quickly raised. Skipper Lee McCulloch then nodded over from Law's corner as the home side desperately tried to regain the advantage. And Miller was denied only by a great one-handed save as his point-blank header was swatted away by Jamieson.

"For Rangers captain Lee McCulloch, the SPFL Championship table has become a torment. A headache the arrival of a new board of directors simply can’t cure. Lying 22 points behind relentless leaders Hearts, there is now no hiding place for the Ibrox players. The off-field problems have eased, Stuart McCall is in place as manager and, simply put, there are no excuses left. ‘It is time for everybody to stand up and be men,’ said McCulloch. ‘Take the ball, demand the ball in front of a crowd, don’t hide and go and show that you’ re good enough to be here.’ Rangers captain Lee McCulloch has urged his team-mates to stand up and be counted . Under Kenny McDowall, Rangers played as if a grey, leaden cloud hung over Ibrox. In comparison, a home game with doomed Livingston offers McCall the chance to be a breath of fresh air around the place. Rangers need something to rescue a flailing season and advance from the play-offs to the Premiership by hook or by crook. ‘It’s been a frustrating season for everyone, fans, players, off-the-field,’ added McCulloch. ‘I think it would be a wasted season if we don’t go up. It would be a season that would go down as a massive failure. ‘For everyone, it has been frustrating, but it’s still in our own hands as players. Everything else seems to have been sorted out, so it’s basically up to us now to try and get a play-off place and see what happens.’ Currently third in the league, the gap on second place Hibernian is a manageable five points. Rangers have two games in hand and winning them would ease concerns they might slip out of the play-offs altogether — a state of affairs which would be completely unacceptable to their captain. ‘It’s not as if I’ve been going home and made a cup of tea and thinking everything’s all right,’ McCulloch insisted. ‘It’s killing me inside, to be honest with you. To see Hearts so far clear in the league and we’re nowhere near them. It’s not nice and it’s not what we want or are used to.’ The weeks ahead will reveal much about this Rangers team. Off-field turmoil drew attention from their failings. The managerial situation, where McDowall was a reluctant frontman, provided a further shield. McCulloch says Rangers must finish in the play-off positions this season . McCulloch and McCall referred to a crisis of confidence repeatedly yesterday. For many of these players, the suspicion is that Rangers may simply be too big for them. ‘The players have probably felt it even more since Ally (McCoist) left,’ added the captain. ‘It is amazing what he took on his shoulders. He shielded the players away from it. Since he left, the players as a squad have been getting it from all angles. ‘I think confidence has probably dipped because of that. ‘Everybody knows we haven’t been playing as well as we can or as well as we should have been. I think there are loads of small things that you can make excuses for. But even though there has been a lot of off-field stuff going on, you can’t really make an excuse for how we have been playing. ‘This season, whoever has been on the board, we’ve not lived up to the standard that we should have for many different reasons. But it is nothing to do with who was in charge or on the board. ‘Since the new owners have come in, everyone around the place, the players and the staff, has had a wee bit of a spring in their step. It is probably a good thing.’ For a dozen of the players, out of contract in the summer, these are crucial days. McCulloch is one of them and, while some of the players won’t be sorry to leave, the 36-year-old wants to complete the journey back to the top division as a Rangers player. ‘The new manager has come in and said: “Well, it’s up to yourselves to go out there and earn it. If you want to be here next season then go and earn your contract and show that you are worthy of one”. I think that is the best thing for it. ‘It is a big motivation for me. I’m not getting any younger. Stuart McCall begins his reign at Rangers with home game against Livingston . ‘It would be amazing, it would be brilliant to go back to the top and it would be nice. But at times football isn’t nice. ‘So I would love to be here, but I need to go and earn that myself. I know that as does every other player here.’ Some have a head start. Nicky Law was a stand-out under McCall at Motherwell and for the new manager bringing the best out of him and others is the key to earning the job on a permanent basis. ‘I want everyone to go out and express themselves,’ said McCall after his second training session. ‘Not just Nicky but I know there’s more in his locker. I know he can do more and like a lot of the players when you lack a bit of that confidence you can go into your shell. ‘We want the players to go and express themselves, there are some good footballers in there. ‘A lot of players have shown good stuff in training.’ In a supreme irony, the most impressive of all has been one of Mike Ashley’s January imports on loan from Newcastle. ‘Haris Vuckic has been absolutely outstanding in training, bright and bubbly and a fantastic lad,’ reported McCall. ‘He hadn’t had much football but is certainly a talented individual and has been really bright in training. ‘He has been terrific but I was coming in thinking there might be three or four of these lads up and running.’ In reality, Remie Streete is ill and injured, Kevin Mbabu played an under-20 game on Thursday but is well short, Shane Ferguson has yet to cross the border and Gael Bigirimana has a medical condition. ‘One out of five isn’t bad,’ grinned McCall after waking at 5am in anticipation of his return to Ibrox as a Rangers employee. ‘It’s been a whirlwind. I haven’t even had the chance to think about it. ‘Hopefully tomorrow at 5pm – or when I get home tomorrow – I will look back on it. ‘But right now I’ve not had the chance to go, “This will be great”. I’ve not given it a thought.’","Lee McCulloch says Rangers must finish in the play-off positions .

"The rumbling discontent among Everton fans towards manager Roberto Martinez is gathering momentum after Wednesday night's dismal 2-0 defeat at Stoke City left last season's Champions League challengers just six points above the relegation zone. After one win in 12 games and only one clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September, it is becoming common to hear fans complain that the Spaniard is 'turning us into Wigan'. The statistics actually bear out their worst fears. In Martinez's last season at Wigan, he had 30 points from 30 games – and went down. Everton currently have 28 points from 28 matches. Everton manager Roberto Martinez and his team look lost in the Barclays Premier League of late . Everton's underperforming stars now just sit six points above the relegation zone in the Premier League . Victor Moses (left) scored in Stoke City's 2-0 win over Everton at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night . The Europa League, the source of so much pride earlier in the season, is now looking like an unwanted distraction. Everton face Dynamo Kyiv at Goodison on Thursday before their now-crucial next league match against Newcastle United on Sunday. The following week they have to contend with a 3,000-mile round trip to Ukraine for the second leg. The players may not get into their beds until 4am on the Friday morning, just 60 hours before they take to the pitch at Loftus Road for what, inconceivably, could be billed a relegation six-pointer against QPR. So what has gone wrong at Everton – a club who finished fifth last season and were tipped to be fighting it out with Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool at the top. Here are eight reasons why Everton are fighting to stay in the top flight, where they've been since 1954. THE £28MILLION NON-TALISMAN . In retrospect, Romelu Lukaku was foolish to declare he wanted to become the world's best player when he hit a purple patch on loan last season. Everton smashed their transfer record to make a £28million move from Chelsea permanent in the summer, a deal that now makes Jose Mourinho look a genius. Lukaku has scored just seven Premier League goals, fewer than West Ham's Diafra Sakho who cost less than a quarter that amount. Lukaku's notorious first touch looks as if it is getting worse, not better, and he has complained Everton's style is not direct enough to get the best out of him. Romelu Lukaku declared he wanted to be the world's best player last season but he has been far from it . Martinez must be desperate to find a way to help re-find his £28million centre forward's best form . Lukaku's first touch has always had a bad reputation but it has proved even more of a problem this season . MARTINEZ TOO SOFT . Martinez believes in filling his players with confidence and it makes him look a great man-manager when things are going well. But salty old professionals like Sylvain Distin, with whom he has fallen out, Phil Jagielka and Tony Hibbert have been around long enough to realise that a good old-fashioned rollocking is needed at times. David Moyes wasn't always popular with the Everton players but Martinez could do with handing out a few home truths like the Scot did. Phil Jagielka (left) and Tony Hibbert (right) have been at Everton for years and understand the way things work . Martinez has fallen out with Sylvain Distin but the defender knows that on occasion players need a rollocking . THE DISAPPEARING ROSS BARKLEY . Valued at £60million not so long ago and feted by Martinez as potentially the best English player of all time, 21-year-old Barkley has started just over half of the club's Premier League games this season, 15 of 28. At Stoke when Martinez had one last substitution to use to try and salvage a result, he turned to Kevin Mirallas, rather than the supposed heir to Paul Gascogine. Barkley has played in so many different positions this season – holding midfield, out wide, No10 – he looks confused. Ross Barkley was left on the bench on Wednesday night, even when Everton were searching for a goal . Barkley was lauded by Martinez as potentially the best English player of all-time but he hasn't progressed . INJURIES . One of the reasons Everton are ultimately likely to get out of trouble is that important members of the old guard are heading back. Leon Osman tasted his first Premier League action since early December on Wednesday night after a serious foot injury and his knowhow will be vital. Even more importantly, Leighton Baines – the best left back in the Premier League – is pencilled in to face Newcastle having missed six games with a knee injury. Aiden McGeady and Steven Pienaar are also out while Darron Gibson's midweek appearance was his first PL start for nearly two years. Leighton Baines - the best left back in the Premier League - will be a huge boost on return from injury . Leon Osman is also returning to the first-team fold and could be a key man in Everton's run-in . LOAN PROBLEMS . Traditionally, Roberto Martinez has one of the best records in the loan market. Tom Cleverley enjoyed the best spell of his career at Wigan and last season Gareth Barry and Lukaku were big hits at Goodison. But the Midas touch seems to have deserted him. Christian Atsu has hardly had a kick since he joined from Chelsea and Aaron Lennon was woeful and substituted after an hour at Stoke. Tom Cleverley (left) was well managed by Martinez during his loan spell at Wigan which saw him hit top form . By contrast, Christian Atsu has hardly had a kick since signing a season-long loan deal from Chelsea . Aaron Lennon came in on loan from Tottenham but he was woeful at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday . IT'S ALL ATTACK, AND NO DEFENCE . Martinez earned a reputation for concentrating too much on his attacking play at Wigan and history is in danger of repeating itself at Everton. Despite inheriting a strong back-five from Moyes, Everton have looked less and less certain at the back, and the collywobbles have effected goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has gone from World Cup superstar to dodgy keeper this season. The repetitive defensive drills under Moyes were boring but they did serve a purpose. Tim Howard was brilliant at the World Cup but he has had troubles in the Everton goal this season . David Moyes employed repetitive defensive drills at Everton - but they did the trick for his side . EURO DISTRACTION . Getting the balance right between Europe and the Premier League has foxed a lot of managers over the years. Martinez seemed to be on a winner earlier in the season with his fondness for team rotation helping the club qualify for the knock-out stages in Europe while holding head above water in the league. But the regular changes have affected rhythm in recent weeks and the league form has dropped alarmingly. Everton were flying high when they won away in Wolfsburg but the rotation for Europe has had an effect . BARRY GAMBLE HAS BACKFIRED . Gareth Barry has been one of the Premier League's most consistent midfield players over the last 15 years but at the age of 34, he is becoming to look a liability. Everton decided to sign him on a permanent basis last summer but his most notable contribution this season is to have broken the all-time Premier League record for yellow cards. His caution at Stoke on Wednesday – number 106 – has earned him a two-match ban and that might prove a blessing in disguise. Gareth Barry has been a consistent performer for 15 years but now looks like a liability in midfield . Barry's caution on Wednesday night was his 106th in the Premier League - an all-time record for any player .","Everton are just six points above relegation in the Barclays Premier League .

"Mauricio Pochettino rates Danny Rose as England's best left back and believes he has overtaken Luke Shaw with his performances this season. Pochettino gave Shaw his chance at Southampton, enabling him to gatecrash last year's World Cup squad but admits the teenager's progress has stalled since moving to Manchester United last summer.

'I look at the stats and other players in his position. I also look at his performances, which have been great. But that's my opinion. The final decision will be Roy Hodgson's. 'The experience with Luke Shaw last season was fantastic. But now he's in another context and at another club. You have to realise that player change every year. Every year is different as thing happen in our lives. Pochettino (centre) adds that Rose's displays deserve a call-up internationally by England boss Roy Hodgson . 'I am not his manager and it is difficult to speak about players at other clubs. I can only explain my experience with him. It is important to give young opportunities to young players if they have talent. We provide them with training and push them. After that it's up to the player. 'All players all need to feel confidence from the staff, players and supporters.' Hodgson names his England squad on Thursday for games against Lithuania and Italy.

Gabriel and Laurent Koscielny's place in Arsene Wenger's plans for next season look secure. But the arrival of a new centre back in the summer is likely to have repercussions for Mertesacker. The German's performances have been criticised this season, though he was excellent in Monday's euphoric FA Cup win over Manchester United. Wenger has been repeatedly linked with Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) Chelsea keeper Petr Cech is also said to be of interest to Arsenal but Chelsea may not want to sell to a rival . He was recently dropped by Wenger, but Gabriel's hamstring injury has seen the defender handed an instant route back into the first-team. And the arrival of a new centre-half could marginalise Mertesacker's role in Wenger's plans. The capture of a new central defender could also have consequences for Calum Chambers. The England international has been used as cover at centre-back this season, but the club's transfer plans could mean Wenger sees his long-term future at right-back or holding midfield.","Arsene Wenger wants to improve his defensive options at Arsenal .

He has since made 96 appearances for The Reds and scored two goals. However, the Spaniard has found regular first-team football hard to come by in the last two seasons due a mix of injuries and squad rotation.

"Heather Watson edged into the third round of the BNP Paribas Open with a nervy 7-5, 7-5 victory over Italy's Camila Giorgi. Giorgi, who is ranked 10 places above Watson, had won the duo's only previous tour meeting - at Beijing in 2012 - but Watson exacted her revenge despite facing a superb fightback from her opponent. Watson lost five straight games in the second set as 29th seed Giorgi levelled at 5-5, before the British No 1 finally clinched victory in an hour and 45 minutes. 'It was a very tough match as I knew it would be,' Watson said in an on-court interview. 'Camila's a great player; she's just shot up rankings in the last year. Heather Watson  celebrates defeating Camila Giorgi to move into the third round in Indian Wells . Watson survived a fightback to edge out her Italian opponent . 'I shot up to 5-0 but she also made quite a few errors. She started to came back. 'I didn't feel like I did too much wrong; she played too good, hitting winners and aces. I just had to stay tough and keep fighting.' Watson had scraped her way past Julia Goerges in the last round, and looked set for another tough encounter under the California sun. Both players exchanged two breaks each in the first set - much like Watson's match against Goerges - but things settled down soon after as they made it 4-4, with the Briton then holding serve with relative ease. Giorgi saved a set point at 40-15 on her serve but pulled a forehand wide to hand Watson the opening set. Giorgi was clearly off her serving rhythm - she hit 10 double faults in the first set - as she conceded an early break in the second, and Watson made it seven straight games to race into a 5-0 lead. The Italian, who is yet to win a singles title on the WTA tour, kick-started the recovery with a smooth service game, and had Watson running to all corners as a deciding set looked on the cards at 5-5. However, it was all in vain as Watson held serve to make it 6-5, and then needed just one of her three match points on the Giorgi serve to seal victory with the Italian firing a backhand long.","Watson held off a fightback from the Italian to win 7-5, 7-5 .

"It is a measure of Arsenal’s progress that fixtures like these no longer end in boos and angry recrimination. As the final whistle approached, the crowd at the Emirates were unusually vocal, anticipating trips to Wembley and singing praise of their team. Earlier it had the feel of one of the afternoons with which we have become so familiar in recent years, one of those days when Arsenal break world records for possessions stats but come up against an inspired goalkeeper and end the day with fans furious at their manager, the board of directors and life in general. But with Olivier Giroud in exceptional form, Aaron Ramsey also outstanding and Mesut Ozil thriving against the kind of opposition he relishes, Arsenal eventually cantered to victory in some style.

Better measures of their real progress remain, of course. On Tuesday night they visit Monaco where you might anticipate another glorious comeback which ultimately ends in failure. Then there will be the league table at the end of the season which will likely tell the tale of an opportunity missed to challenge for the title. Arsene Wenger conceded that, even with Chelsea still to come to the Emirates, Arsenal are not yet in the title race. ‘Not at the moment,’ he said. ‘But we can just keep going. We won eight of the last nine. We are stronger today than we were at the start of the season. ‘We suffered a lot from the World Cup, where the players came back. What is for sure is that they understand each other much better than six or seven months ago and that makes everyone more dangerous.’ At least Arsenal are not going backwards these days; the problem may be that they aren’t moving forwards fast enough but they are at least pointing in the right direction.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce looked as though he understood as much and had settled for one of those afternoons when he aims to ‘out-tactic’ the opposition. You could hardly blame him given the resources at his disposal, with Enner Valencia and James Tomkins the latest additions to his injury list and Carl Jenkinson ineligible. Kevin Nolan almost shocked Arsenal with a clean strike on 23 minutes but at half-time, Arsenal had 74 per cent of the possession. At times it looked as if West Ham goalkeeper Adrian was has having one of those inspired afternoon. It was later revealed he was playing with a dislocated finger sustained in the warm up, a fact which made his performance truly heroic. ‘He’s been a brave lad,’ said assistant manager Neil McDonald. Theo Walcott was having a less satisfactory time. Thrust back in for his first start in more than a month, he did little to help his ongoing contract talks. Three times he was presented with the opportunity to open the scoring; three times he spurned the chances.

A delightful back heel from Giroud set him up with just Adrian to beat, but James Collins came through the man and the ball to prevent him scoring. It might have been a penalty but it was Walcott’s own hesitation in front of goal which had presented Collins with the chance to launch his saving tackle. Adrian would then make excellent saves from Alexis Sanchez’s header on 16 minutes and from an improvised touch of the knee from Ramsey on 32 minutes, before Walcott received his next chance. Played in by a delightful Ramsey pass, he took a touch, looked up and struck his shot directly at the goalkeeper.Adrian denied Sanchez from a half volley and on 44 minutes he pushed away a strike from Ozil, which landed at Walcott’s feet, yards from goal but he skewed the ball high and wide, appearing to lose his balance.

Ramsey and Ozil exchanged a delicate one-two, but such is the Frenchman’s confidence these days, he nicked it off Ramsey’s foot, took a touch and drove a fine finish into the far corner of the net. ‘It was fantastic because of the combination and the finishing. It was the kind of goal we loved to score,’ said Wenger. It was his 14th goal of the season in 24 games. That Monaco game aside, he is having an excellent season and since that dismal night, he has responded incredibly well. After being criticised for missing chances against Monaco, Giroud holds his hands to his ears to soak up the applause . Giroud strikes a pose midway through his celebration as Arsenal take the lead at the Emirates . Walcott, who had several chances to open the first half scoring himself, leaps on Giroud's back in celebration . ‘It’s one of his strengths,’ said Wenger, who called his performance ‘outstanding’. Having set out to defend in numbers, a change of strategy was necessary for West Ham and they were equal to the challenge. They came out in the second-half with an entirely different mindset, pushing Arsenal back into their half and searching for an equaliser. In terms of clear-cut chances there was still little — Matt Jarvis’ curling cross which Ospina spilled and almost let in Sakho was one unsettling moment. But Arsenal were no longer able to play as they wished. Still, their time would come. On 80 minutes, Giroud dummied a throw-in to let in Ramsey, who played in the Frenchman. He returned the ball to Ramsey, who drove it past Adrian to cap a fine a performance of growing authority. Three minutes later Santi Cazorla, on as a substitute, exchanged passes with Giroud and planted a cross almost on the foot of Mathieu Flamini, who had the simplest task of converting from close range for the third goal.

BOB ARUM (CEO of Top Rank): 'It is great to be part of an event which so elevates the sport of boxing. When we compare it to other events - major events like the Superbowl, even the Olympics - we get worldwide attention to those events, and it's been rare that worldwide attention focuses on a boxing match. 'Thanks to the work of everyone, the whole world will be watching this great event unfold. It's a credit to the sport of boxing that we have been able to put on such an event.' STEPHEN ESPINOZA (Executive VP of Showtime Sports): 'We are not at all surprised that this fight is happening. As soon as we closed our deal with Floyd back in 2013, the Pacquiao fight was a top priority both for Floyd and for us.

And again that is no surprise to us, we've known for at least five years now that Floyd has wanted the Pacquiao fight pretty badly.' FREDDIE ROACH (Manny Pacquiao's trainer): 'I'd like to thank all the people that made this fight happen. I love challenges and this is the biggest challenge of my life - and it is finally here. 'I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm going to get my fighter as ready as possible.

"Nemanaja Matic has endured a difficult fortnight. He is, of course, pleased that Chelsea won their first trophy in his time at the club, though his joy is tempered by missing the Capital One Cup final through suspension. And though he is now back from that two-match ban, he was part of the Chelsea team which went out against 10-man Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday. He earned his two-match ban for pushing over Ashley Barnes in fury after the Burnley player executed an excessive shin-high challenge on him. Matic received a red card and didn’t even get the free-kick, Barnes went unpunished. Ashley Barnes commits a foul on Nemanja Matic but referee Martin Atkinson fails to blow for the foul . Matic was handed a two-match suspension for pushing Burnley's Barnes at Stamford Bridge . The 28-year-old has missed Chelsea's last two games against Tottenham and West Ham due to suspension . But Matic maintains a degree of perspective. He is aware he is fortunate not to be have been injured far more seriously. ‘I was happy, to be honest, when I saw the video after the game as it was bad. And I am happy that I played against Paris Saint-Germain. My reaction was not good but this reaction was because I thought I broke a leg. I am a happy man because I can walk,’ he said. ‘I don’t like to say that I was right in my reaction. I was not right. But this was a moment when you cannot control your emotions. I saw it one time only (on TV). That was enough. But these things happen in football. I hope that is the last time.’ Matic has been a revelation since returning to Chelsea from Portuguese side Benfica last January . Matic will not discuss the fact that referee Martin Atkinson did not award a foul, let alone punish Barnes for the tackle. ‘I think that the referee saw because he was close but I think it’s not my job to comment on that,’ he said. ‘People have been speaking about that, writing in newspapers. That’s it.’ Asked whether Barnes had apologised, he said: ‘No.’ Before the visit of Southampton on Sunday, Matic reflected on his ban and keeping focused. ‘It has been very hard, it is very difficult when you are not on the pitch,’ he said. Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic  with the trophy after the Capital One Cup Final at Wembley Stadium . ‘When you are on the pitch you can do something. When you are out, you are just watching and it is very difficult for me, I am not used to it. I hope this is the last time I am out. ‘It has been difficult. But I was happy. I was out but I was happy because we won two games.’ Matic is a candidate for player of the year, so impressive have his performances been since he came back to Chelsea last January in a £22million deal, having initially been allowed to leave and join Benfica in 2011. Chelsea re-signed Nemanja Matic last January for £22million having previously been sold by the club in 2011 . Matic admitted it was hard to miss the Capital One Cup Final win against Tottenham Hotspur . Matic does not attempt to gild the failure against PSG, and is aware of what is now required. ‘To be honest we didn’t play well against Paris Saint-Germain,’ he admitted. ‘We played against one very good team with very good individuals but after the Ibrahimovic red card maybe we thought it would be more — not easy — but easier for us as we had one player more. If you watched the whole game they deserved to go through. ‘Now, we must win the Premier League. We have to if we want to finish this as a good season. If we win the league we will have that and the Capital One Cup and it will be a good season. Otherwise it is going to be bad. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is sent off for his part in a tackle with Chelsea's Brazilian ace Oscar . Chelsea's players surround the referee as he sends off  Ibrahimovic (second right) in the first half . ‘I know it is going to be difficult until the end. But Manchester City also play difficult games. ‘If we win the Premier League it’s going to be like a dream for us, because we know what we speak about every day and we know the Premier League is something we have to win. We are not tired and we will be ready for the next 12 games.’ None more so than Matic.

"John Carver says he cannot defend Papiss Cisse after admitting the Newcastle striker spitting in the face of Jonny Evans was worse than breaking the leg of an opponent. Newcastle will be without their 11-goal top scorer for the first time at Everton on Sunday since he was hit with a seven-game ban following the altercation with Evans. The Manchester United defender was suspended for six matches for his part in the incident, in which he first spat at Cisse to provoke the reaction from the Magpies striker. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared up to each other at St James' Park . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension for the altercation . There has been a lot of debate in the 10 days since the disgusting clash as to whether or not spitting merited a ban double the length of one for a tackle which could cause serious injury. Carver, though, was clear on his thoughts when that question was put to him. ‘When you have played the game it (spitting) is worse, yes,’ he said. ‘It's one of the lowest forms of anything you can do on the pitch. A lot of players would have acted differently. He retaliated in the same manner, which is just as bad. ‘I sat with him and I said, “Listen, I can't defend you on this. You've done wrong and have to accept whatever punishment you get”. There's no place in the game for it. He got what he deserved.’ Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . Cisse’s future on Tyneside is now uncertain. Despite boasting the best goals-per-minute ratio in the Premier League this season, Newcastle remain concerned about a lingering knee issue for which he underwent more treatment this week. When asked if the 29-year-old would be at the club next year, Carver said: ‘It's a difficult question to answer because I'm only thinking about the now, and I haven't got him for seven games. ‘But he scores goals and I don't think his knee is a big issue. We have always used this word “maintenance” about his knee and it is just making sure that everything is right. But he’s a big loss.’ Meanwhile, Carver admits he has sympathy with under-fire Everton boss Roberto Martinez. Newcastle finished fifth in 2012 but were nearly relegated the following season and cited the rigours of a Europa League campaign as reason for their struggle. ‘Ask any of these managers who qualified for Europe how it affects your league form - you all start fighting for your lives down the bottom of that league table - it's not easy,’ he said. ‘They've got to do something about it. I would go back to a straight knockout format. ‘When you work so hard to get your team into a position to qualify for it and then you've got to play so many games it's detrimental to your bread and butter, which is Premier League football. ‘Spurs have a massive squad and were almost playing two different sides. That's how they coped with it – but Everton can't and we couldn’t either.’ Paul Carver admits he has sympathy with under-fire Everton manager Roberto Martinez ahead of he game .","Newcastle will be without Papiss Cisse for seven games following a ban .

"Newcastle head coach John Carver says the pressure is all on Everton and their under-fire boss Roberto Martinez ahead of Sunday’s meeting at Goodison Park. Carver was on Merseyside to witness the Toffees come from behind to win 2-1 against Dynamo Kiev in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday night. But he was taken aback by the level of unrest on the terraces after they fell behind early on. John Carver sympathised with his opposite number Roberto Martinez, but insists Everton are under pressure . Carver's Newcastle side are relatively safe in 11th place, but Everton are still too close to the relegation zone . Martinez has come under fire from fans as he tries to balance Premier League survival with European football . ‘I've got to be honest, it was pretty daunting. I was there with Steve Stone and Dave Watson, an Everton legend, and he'd never seen that before - he found it quite strange,’ said Carver. ‘So I’ve said to my players that all the pressure is going to be on Everton at Goodison Park. ‘They coped with it well in the end and got a good goal and dominated the second half. They deserved credit for coming back to win. ‘But there’s no pressure on us, the players can go and express themselves.’ Everton are 16th in the Premier League after a campaign disrupted by their participation in Europe. Carver was shocked by the levels of unrest when Oleg Gusev put Dynamo Kiev ahead on Thursday night . Newcastle travel to Everton on Sunday looking for only their second win in the last six league games . And Carver has sympathy with Martinez given his own experience of a relegation battle in 2013 as Newcastle juggled the demands of a Europa League schedule. ‘It’s difficult to balance the demands of the Europa League and we can vouch for that when you’ve got a squad like we had then and they have now, it’s very difficult,’ he said. ‘They’ve played 14 games more than us. Only the sides with huge squads will cope. It needs to go back to a knockout competition.’","John Carver sympathised with Everton boss Roberto Martinez .

"Roberto Martinez wants Everton’s latest European success to be a turning point in their ambition to save their faltering domestic campaign. Goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku transformed Everton’s Europa League last 16 tie with Dynamo Kiev, giving Martinez’s side a lead to protect in Ukraine next week when it appeared they were set for another night of misery. Everton have fallen way below expectations in recent months and have only won one Barclays Premier League fixture in 2015 but Martinez is hoping they will carry the momentum from this victory into Sunday’s crucial Goodison Park fixture against Newcastle. Everton boss Roberto Martinez hopes his side can kick on in the Premier League after beating Dynamo Kiev . Oleg Gusev (right) volleyed Kiev ahead on Thursday night with a neat near post finish from a corner . Steven Naismith equalised in the first half for Everton with a curled right-footed finish . Romelu Lukaku scored the winner with a penalty on 82 minutes to give Everton a first leg 2-1 to take to Kiev . ‘It has to be a turning point,’ said Martinez. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team. ‘We need to focus on the league now and get the flow we had in our second half performance. You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know that we have got a good side.’ Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign. He echoed Martinez’s sentiments in hoping for a domestic spin-off. ‘I'm very happy with the team performance,’ said Lukaku. ‘The team reacted well after first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top class players. It's up there with my best performances. Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well. ‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved. Now if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this. We are favourites, but it will be difficult over there.’ Lukaku points to the heavens after converting his 82nd minute penalty to put Everton 2-1 ahead .","Everton beat Dynamo Kiev 2-1 in their Europa League last 16 first leg tie .

"Barcelona kicked off the biggest week of their season in style by beating Eibar 2-0 thanks to a Lionel Messi double that took him past Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga’s top scorer this season. Barca play Manchestser City on Wednesday, just four days before the decisive Clasico against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou next Sunday, and Messi led them to victory with his 31st and 32nd goals of the season. He even scored a goal he had never scored before in La Liga – a header direct from a corner. Lionel Messi wheels away in celebration of his first half penalty, which put Barcelona into a 1-0 lead . The Barca star scored his 16th and 17th La Liga goals of 2015 as his side strolled to victory . At the start of the year Ronaldo collected the Balon d’Or and sent an ‘I’m coming for you’ message to Messi who has one more World Player award than the Portuguese. But instead it has been Messi pursuing, catching and over-taking Ronaldo in scoring stakes in Spain. The Real Madrid striker was 12 goals clear of Messi but the Barça number 10 has scored 17 goals in 10 games since the turn of the year and is now in top spot like his team. This was the first time Eibar had played Barcelona in Spain’s top flight – it is with the Catalan club that the contrasts are most stark. They have 5,250 supporters crammed into the league’s smallest ground while Barça’s 99,000 capacity Camp Nou is La Liga’s largest. Barcelona’s budget runs to €540m euros, Eibar’s is €16m; Barça make €140m from their television deal, Eibar make €14m; Barça’s sponsor Qatar Airways pays them €35m a year while the minnows are paid €130,000 by a local steel company. On the pitch there are massive differences too. And the home team came into the game having scored 34 goals – six fewer than Messi. Although it was the Argentine who got the opening goal Barça had to suffer for the breakthrough. Neymar (left) and Ivan Rakitic (right) join Messi in celebration of his 31st minute spot-kick . They almost scored with their first attack when first Messi and then Ivan Rakitic went close after Luis Suarez and Adriano had combined down the left. But with a relatively inexperienced midfield trio of Sergi Roberto between, Rafinha and Rakitic, and faced with a five-man Eibar defence, the first half hour was heavy going. Luis Enrique had decided not to risk Javier Mascherano who was a booking away from missing next week’s Clasico but his presence in a midfield already missing the injured Sergi Busquets was keenly felt at times as the leaders failed to control the game. Messi left five Eibar players behind with one dribble that started inside his own half but the move broke down as soon as he played in a team-mate and Eibar remained on level terms. Resistance was finally broken on the half hour when Suarez went on a driving run into the area and released Messi. Neymar skips past the challenge of Eibar's  Borja Ekiza during the La Liga clash . His shot cannoned off a defender and hit the arm of Eibar defender Borja Ekiza. The referee pointed to the spot and although keeper Jaime Jiminez dived the right way Messi’s penalty beat him. The goal sent him one goal past Cristiano Ronaldo in the top scorer list in Spain. It’s been an incredible turnaround since the Real Madrid striker raced to a 12 goal advantage over his nemesis earlier in the campaign. Neymar might have doubled Barça’s lead but Messi’s cross from the byline was cleared before it reached the Brazilian and Eibar made it to the break just the one goal down. Messi was at his very best at times and made a sensational 70-yard run during the first half . Messi set up Barcelona’s first chance of the second period when he slipped Neymar through in the six-yard box only for team-mate to try and fail to nutmeg the goalkeeper. Having failed to create the second he scored it, and with the most unusual of Messi goals. Rakitic took a corner from the right and Messi found space 10 yards out. His header down skidded off the turf and past a defender on the line to make it 2-0. There was time for 35-year-old Xavi to come and make his 750th appearance for Barcelona as the visitors saw out the remaining minutes. Federico Piovaccari hit the bar but Barcelona took the points to mean they stay top a week ahead of the Clasico and four days ahead of the visit of Manchester City.","Lionel Messi scored twice to help Barcelona earn 2-0 victory against Eibar .

"Ashley Young says Manchester United will go for the kill when they head to Liverpool on Sunday. After beating Tottenham last weekend, United have a chance to further strengthen their grip on fourth when they face their old rivals at Anfield. A draw would be enough to keep United two points ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool, but Young knows victory would put further daylight between the two teams, who both have nine matches left. Ashley Young says Manchester United will go for the kill when they head to Liverpool on Sunday . 'We will go there looking for the three points,' the United winger said. 'We are going there to win, you don't go to a place to try and draw. The performance against Tottenham was brilliant but we have a tough game coming up at Liverpool. We have got to dust ourselves down in the right way and go for the three points again.' Questions had been raised about Louis van Gaal's team selection and tactics in the wake of United's FA Cup exit to Arsenal, but everything fell into place last weekend as United put on by far their best performance of the season. United have a chance to further strengthen their grip on fourth when they face their old rivals at Anfield . Young thinks United will therefore go into Sunday's game in high spirits, but he insists confidence in the camp has never been a problem this season despite a number of uninspiring team displays. He said: 'Morale has always been high. Confidence has always been there too. 'We were obviously disappointed after the Arsenal game. I said afterwards that it will show how our team spirit and character is with how we bounce back. The Manchester United players celebrate as they beat Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford . 'I think if you look at the first 45 minutes (against Spurs) then that was exactly the right way to bounce back.' Young praised Van Gaal's methods, insisting some players had improved under the Dutchman's stewardship. He is undoubtedly one of them. The 29-year-old was expected to leave Old Trafford last summer, but he has been one of the best outfield players in the squad this season. Young praised Louis van Gaal's methods, insisting players had improved under the Dutchman's stewardship . Fellaini was heavily criticised during David Moyes' reign but had improved under Van Gaal . Marouane Fellaini is another player who seems to be improving under Van Gaal. Fellaini was heavily criticised during David Moyes' reign, but the big Belgian has earned plaudits for his performances in the no.10 role of late. 'He has been very important for us.

"Ten reasons to give Manuel Pellegrini a sliver of hope that Manchester City can catch Chelsea. Ten reasons to disturb Jose Mourinho as he turns his full focus on the Barclays Premier League. Mourinho has a five-point lead to preserve at the top of the Barclays Premier League and a game in hand if he is to bring the title to Stamford Bridge for the first time in five years. What had seemed set to break into a procession at times could yet become a contest if Chelsea cannot kick the habit of throwing away the lead. It has happened 10 times this season and the unwanted trend has accelerated since the turn of the year. Thiago Silva headed home to knock Chelsea out of the Champions League in another poor result after leading . Chelsea players surround the referee before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot-tempered affair . Jose Mourinho's side have let leads slip in no less than 10 games in all compeitions this season . Problems seemed to kick in after the draw against Sunday's opponents Southampton, at St Mary's, on 28 December. It was a day when Mourinho fumed about penalties not awarded and a 'campaign' against his team. Maybe the Chelsea manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead. 2014-15: P43 W29 D11 L3 . Before Jan: P28 W21 D6 L1 . Since Jan: P15 W8 D5 L2 . Games are more difficult after the New Year, with Capital One Cup semi-finals and a final and the first knock-out round of the Champions League. Fatigue starts to bite with a manager with a small core of players he seems happy to use, which don't include Filipe Luis or Lois Remy. Yet it is Chelsea's inability to close out many games which will trouble Mourinho. His teams have consistently boasted this quality, and it remains. They closed out the Capital One Cup final against Spurs expertly, but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip. Zlatan Ibrahimovic blasts past Gary Cahill as Chelsea let a 1-0 lead slip in Paris . Cesc Fabregas against Burnley (left), while Frank Lampard and John Terry catch up as City grab a point .

Terry offers Hazard consoling words against Spurs (left), with Robin van Persie equalising at Old Trafford . Diego Costa fronts up to Pablo Zabaleta at the Etihad, with Schalke celebrating in front of Fabregas . It might be more likely to develop into a battle if Manchester City were not misfiring, too. Arsenal and Liverpool are in more fluent form but a little further adrift. Too far adrift. Chelsea are not about to implode spectacularly. PSG h (CL) led twice 2-2 AET . Burnley h (PL) led 1-1. PSG a (CL) led 1-1. Man City h (PL) led 1-1. Bradford h (FAC) led 2-0 lost 2-4. Liverpool a (C1C) led 1-1. Spurs a (PL) led 1-0 lost 3-5. Man United a (PL) led drew 1-1. Man City a (PL) led drew 1-1. Schalke h (CL) led drew 1-1 . Over the campaign, they have been easily the best in the Premier League. They will probably win the title. Rather, tiny problems have cropped up where there were none. If nothing else, it will keep Mourinho busy in the summer, in his restless quest for perfection. He will prioritise another central defender, with Raphael Varane top of the list, and will work to tighten up a defence which has shown tiny uncharacteristic flaws. Opposing teams will have noted how Thibaut Courtois, amid a brilliant season, has had issues with crosses whipped in, six yards from goal. Both PSG goals were headed in from this region. So was Burnley's equaliser. And Manchester City's equaliser came after he was beaten in such a duel by James Milner. Thibaut Courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box, leading to goals conceded . Cesc Fabregas, battling Marco Verratti, has not been firing on all cylinders since Christmas . Mourinho will also like to add another defensive option in midfield, for the really big games at the business end of the Champions League. Missing only John Obi Mikel from his squad, his midfield was dominated by PSG and Nemanja Matic, outstanding all season, played at full stretch, his passing not at its best, under pressure against Blaise Matiudi, Thiago Motta and the excellent Marco Verratti. The form of Cesc Fabregas has been flat since his return from a hamstring injury and when he doesn't dazzle he does not have the defensive strengths to satisfy his manager. There are games against teams like PSG, when Mourinho would like another strong athletic presence alongside Matic. Diego Costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability . Without the creative flair of Fabregas, the goals have dried up for Diego Costa, who may be off the pace because of his ban, as Mourinho claimed, but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who don't like it. Eden Hazard shows no sign of losing his mojo but Drogba's influence has faded through the season and Remy does not appear to be trusted. So Chelsea expect be in the market for options up front, too. Mourinho always says a manager can never be happy and even if, as expected, he goes on to claim the title, he will be busy this summer. Some people thought he had already built one of the great teams of the modern era, but there is work to do and no-one knows it more than him.","Chelsea have let leads slip 11 times this season .

"Harry Kane will this week be named in the England senior squad by Roy Hodgson with Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason also poised for a call — but Charlie Austin may have to wait his turn given the amount of attacking talent at the England boss’s disposal. Kane is leading the charge of new young strikers and the Spurs player has been assured of a promotion from the Under-21s this week. However, that does not mean England don’t want him to play in the European Under-21 Championships in June, which they have a strong chance of winning. Harry Kane, pictured, will hope to be involved in Roy Hodgson's England squad when it is announced this week . Kane will come into the senior squad for this month’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy so Hodgson can view him at close hand. But he will be available for Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate in the summer, rather than the senior squad, who have a friendly against Republic of Ireland and a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia in June. Tottenham team-mate Mason may also be considered for his first call-up with Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain unavailable. Michael Carrick is back but has had limited game time at Manchester United. Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason may also be considered for first call-up by Roy Hodgson .

"Forget Groundhog Day. For suffering Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw, it is beginning to feel more like Groundhog Year. There has been an increasingly familiar pattern to his addresses in the aftermath of every one of his team’s four defeats in this Six Nations campaign so far. He has talked of the positives to take from each loss while trying his best to put the bravest of faces on matters. As he sat at BT Murrayfield on Tuesday following a tough training session with his international colleagues, his mask didn’t slip one bit as he went through the same old routine. Greig Laidlaw  in action during the Six Nations rugby match between France and Scotland at Stade de France . But behind the forced smile it was clear there is a new fear engulfing him which makes the final Six Nations match against Ireland on Saturday an increasingly nervous prospect. The scrum-half with 38 caps to his name doesn’t want to join Chris Paterson and Ross Ford in the record books as a captain who led Scotland to a Six Nations wooden spoon. Paterson did it twice, in 2004 and 2007, with Ford suffering a similar fate in 2012. Since Five Nations became Six, Italy have been bottom of the pile 10 times with Wales and France finishing last once each. England and Ireland have never picked up the wooden spoon. Laidlaw, who played stand-off rather than scrum-half in the side that was whitewashed under Ford, doesn’t want to experience that feeling again. He is hoping his team-mates feel as embarrassed as he is about the current plight and use the fear of failure as motivation to put things right against the Irish. ‘I don’t know if it hurts me as captain more than the other players, but losing all our games so far certainly hurts me a lot, that’s for sure,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘I like to think avoiding the wooden spoon is a big driving factor whether you are captain or not, as nobody wants to be in the team that’s failed to pick up any wins. ‘Remember, though, we haven’t finished bottom yet and we’ve got an opportunity this weekend to finish on a high. If we can win this one, it allows us to give a big sigh of relief going into the pre-World Cup games over the summer and then build towards the World Cup. Laidlaw leaves the field after the second half of the the RBS Six Nations match between against Italy . ‘The other side of the coin is that if we lose this one, it’s a long time before we play for Scotland again and that’s the worst situation to be in. At least we have a week to try to rectify some of the problems that were there against England and give everybody the boost they want by turning things around against Ireland.’ Laidlaw admitted he has been left totally frustrated at how his side had come up short in all their matches and fallen away badly in the second half of key games. Although he believes all is not lost, he is clearly growing tired of constantly being the one trying to explain away in public what is going wrong. ‘I’ve almost been saying the same things most weeks, unfortunately,’ he continued. ‘I still believe there are huge positives in there and I think everybody, including ourselves, can see some of the play is brilliant and the players get confidence from that. ‘I know the English boys and the Welsh boys, in particular, think that we’re now a threat and a much better team than we were in the past despite the defeats. We are getting close to winning but need to do that little bit extra to get over the line. ‘Of course there are things to look at and, for instance, we’re getting to half-time in good positions but maybe dropping off slightly, which is something we need to sort. VIDEO 02 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . Ben Youngs hands off the tackle of Laidlaw  during the match between England and Scotland at Twickenham . ‘Looking back at the England game, that is what happened as there wasn’t enough urgency in the early part of the second half and we just let England come at us. There’s only so much you can soak up before cracking and we can’t let that happen again.’ Murrayfield will have a capacity attendance for the match against Ireland, with many visiting fans making up the 67,000 crowd. Irish supporters had bought their tickets within hours of them going on sale on the assumption their team would be challenging for the Grand Slam. A clean sweep is no longer a possibility after their defeat to Wales last weekend but, even with tens of thousands inside the stadium cheering on Joe Schmidt’s title contenders, Laidlaw still believes the Scotland players can be inspired by the atmosphere within Murrayfield. ‘We want to win for the jersey, win for ourselves, win for the fans, because they’ve been brilliant throughout a tough campaign,’ he said. ‘We can feed off them hugely and want to go out there and give them something back for their continued support. We really want to send them off on a good note, because it’s been a tough championship for the players and fans alike.’ Laidlaw stands dejected after the final whistle during the RBS 6 Nations match at Twickenham . A win over Ireland would indeed have the fans singing a happier tune. For that to happen, Ford insists there is nothing to be gained from dwelling too much on the results which have brought Scotland to this precarious position. ‘We need to be realistic, look at where we aren’t good enough and try to improve,’ said the Edinburgh hooker, capped 84 times. ‘We need to stay positive going into the games and it is a huge positive to know we have pushed good teams close and scored tries against them. ‘There is no point getting down as it doesn’t get you anywhere on the pitch. It’s about staying positive and getting right back out and going after Ireland. ‘It would be great to finish the campaign on a high, especially at home. It is a World Cup year, so it would be a very positive note to end the Six Nations on.’","Greig Laidlaw doesn’t want to join Chris Paterson and Ross Ford .

"Warren Gatland has told Adam Jones that he will not ‘get on his knees’ and beg the curly haired Welsh prop to come out of retirement following a World Cup threatening injury to Samson Lee. Lee, 22, was on Tuesday given a ’50-50’ chance of being ready for the ‘pool of death’ later this year because of a ruptured Achilles tendon, with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in London decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation. It has left Wales painfully low on experience in the front-row – the four props in the matchday squad to face Italy have just 11 Test starts between them – but Gatland maintains the onus is on Jones, capped 100 times, to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots. Warren Gatland has told Adam Jones that he will not ‘get on his knees’ and beg the prop to play . Samson Lee injured his achilles during Wales' 23-16 win against Ireland in the Six Nations . ‘I was surprised at the timing of his announcement,’ said Gatland. ‘He wasn’t out of our thoughts: we had played a little bit of phone tag, leaving messages and going backwards and forwards. If he has changed his mind and wants to get on the phone and say “I made a rash decision, retired too early and want to be part of the World Cup squad,” that is a different conversation. Jones passes the ball during the British and Irish Lions training session held at Scotch College in 2013 . Wales captain Sam Warburton reacts with Jones during the Six Nations in 2013 . ‘At the moment I will not be going on bended knees ringing him saying “please come back, we really desperately need you”. For us, it’s about dealing with the other players. If Adam Jones wasn’t retired from international rugby, then he may very well be in the squad now.’ Making his Test debut in 2003, Jones became a household feature in the Welsh pack alongside fellow front-row Gethin Jenkins. While Jones will not feature on Saturday because of his retirement, Jenkins will play no part because of a hamstring injury. Asides from the changes up front, Gatland has stuck with the same starting XV that beat Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, with his side needing to overturn the points advantage of England and Ireland if they are going to snatch the championship. Prop Lee had to leave the field on a stretcher at the Millennium Stadium during Wales' win over Ireland . Lee was pictured on crutches with his foot in a protective boot after the match . If Wales do enjoy a landslide result at the Stadio Olimpico and pip their rivals to the title, they will find themselves in a position where there is no silverware to celebrate with. The two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - Gatland accepts that it is a logical decision. ‘We can understand from the points difference that they are taking one to Twickenham and one to Edinburgh,’ he said. ‘If we do get enough points and win, we will celebrate in our own way. Maybe we will get some medals to hang around our necks or maybe we will have to wait 24 hours; we’ll wait and see.‘ . Sergio Parisse limped off during Italy's defeat by France in Rome at the weekend . If Parisse plays he will be a major factor in Wales' attempts to win the Six Nations . After their early kick-off at the Stadio Olimpico, the tourists will move on to a black tie function at the Palazzo Venezia in central Rome. They will have to wait on tenterhooks, but any hopes of a thumping victory could hinge on the fitness of Italian skipper Sergio Parisse, who is struggling with a foot injury and is the heartbeat of the Azzurri team. ‘He’s a catalyst for them,’ said Gatland. ‘If they defend heavily in the front line with 14 or 15 men and we try to play too much rugby too early, they might get a chance of turnovers and penalties or intercepts. We have to negate two or three of their obvious strengths and put ourselves in a position to score some points.’ Warren Gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul England and Ireland . Wales beat Ireland 23-16 at the Millennium Stadium to force themselves into title contention . Wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and Gatland has named a bench loaded with attacking intent. Gareth Davies has usurped Mike Phillips to provide scrum-half cover for Rhys Webb, who on Tuesday signed a dual contract, while Justin Tipuric and Scott Williams will also be expected to make a late impact. ‘If the championship comes down to points difference, that says to me there is not a lot of difference between the three of the four teams at the top,’ said Gatland. ‘We improve as a squad through campaigns and we have demonstrated that again in this competition. The exciting thing about the World Cup is the time we will have together to do in-depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the Six Nations. The time we have together will make a massive difference.’ Gatland's Wales side have a plus-12 points difference, 25 behind England and 21 adrift of Ireland .","Samson Lee suffered a World Cup threatening injury in Cardiff .

The victory still sees the Clarets in the relegation zone - but by only one point with Sunderland looking over their shoulders ever-more. Meanwhile the defeat for City is damaging for their title hopes. A win for Chelsea on Sunday would see Manuel Pellegrini's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining. City now have to pick themselves up with a daunting trip to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Until next time, have a good evening! And the referee brings a close to the match. Relegation candidates Burnley have stunned the champions Manchester City! George Boyd's goal separates the two sides. Cue pandemonium among the Turf Moor faithful. 92 mins: Burnley make their second defensive change of the match as Danny Ings is taken off for Steven Reid. The hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers. 91 mins: Oh wow, what a huge moment in the match. Pablo Zabaleta charges into the Burnley box and falls under the challenge of Mee. On first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too. However the referee decides otherwise and awards a free-kick to Burnley as Jason Shackell is fouled by Zabaleta during his tumble. The City players are incensed. Will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge? There will be four minutes of injury time to be added on... 86 mins: Burnley make their first change of the match and it's a defensive one as striker Sam Vokes is replaced by Stephen Ward. Lampard's appearance is his 600th in the Premier League. Only Ryan Giggs has made more. 82 mins: And that cross is Toure's last piece of action as he is replaced by Frank Lampard. 81 mins: What a chance that was for City to equalise. Navas cuts the ball back on the right flank to Yaya Toure. The latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of Aguero at the back post. The Argentina international can only head over from just outside the six-yard box though. The frustration grows for the visitors. City are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the Burnley defence. As they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which Burnley are beginning to exploit. The visitors have simply not been at it tonight, a huge credit must go to the Clarets though. They've been brilliant. 74 mins: Pellegrini makes his second change of the match as Silva is replaced by Stevan Jovetic. 71 mins: Two of Burnley's back four are now cautioned as Michael Duff sees yellow for a foul. 66 mins: City have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline. Victory for City would see them close the gap on Chelsea to two-points ahead of their match against Southampton on Sunday. A defeat means the Blues could go eight points clear if they beat the Saints. Do the City players want it enough? 63 mins: City react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual Dzeko and replacing him with Wilfried Bony. Demichelis' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by Burnley. From the resulting free-kick Trippier's set piece is headed away by City captain Vincent Kompany. Unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to Boyd who hits a sweet left-footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner. A fantastic strike. 60 mins: Martin Demichelis swiftly follows Mee into the referees book for a cynical challenge on Ings. 58 mins: We have our first booking of the match and it's a harsh one as Ben Mee is cautioned for a challenge on Jesus Navas. Replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the City players have dealt. 55 mins: What a hit by George Boyd - he's so unlucky. The Scotland international hits a hook volley, with his weaker right foot, over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post. That's got the crowd engaged. 51 mins: David Silva has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch. And at precisely the wrong time too. Aguero does brilliantly to spin around a Burnley defender on the halfway line and race clear. With Silva in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with Heaton bearing down on him. That could, and probably should have been, 1-0 to the visitors. Will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate? A Manchester City fan has just proposed to his Burnley-supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time. Thankfully she said yes because it’s a long walk back to the touchline. That’s the best entertainment we’ve had here so far. Disappointing first half from the champions. Surely they haven’t got one eye on Barcelona when there’s still something to play for in the title race. City showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but Tom Heaton has only had two saves to make, and fairly routine saves at that. And the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at Turf Moor. In truth it's been a rather drab affair with no clear-cut chances yet created for either side. The hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation, but City know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the Premier League title. 42 mins: City are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour. However, the key statistic is that it is still 0-0. Can they make their dominance count? 34 mins: The visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more. Again Dzeko wriggles free inside in the Burnley box but is tackled before he can shoot. The ball falls into the path of Aguero who chooses to shoot rather the cross. The end product? An effort well wide of goal. Nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts. 29 mins: It's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save. Heaton comes off his line well to deny Dzeko from squeezing in a near post effort. From the resulting build-up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an Aguero strike.  As the old saying goes, you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once. 26 mins: And that trend continues as Edin Dzeko drags an ambitious left-footed shot well wide of Tom Heaton's goal. 23 mins: The fans have little to cheer about so far and it's hardly surprising. We're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet. 15 mins: Still no clear-cut chances created by either side. Both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat. 10 mins: Burnley right back Kieran Trippier crosses a ball that hits Gael Clichy. The home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest. 6 mins: As you would expect Burnley came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges. City have weathered that 'mini-storm' and are starting to express themselves. The match has started in Lancashire. Can Burnley stun City? Kick-off is imminent... Look away Burnley fans... City are unbeaten in their last six visits to Turf Moor in all competitions, winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four. To make matters the visitors are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the Clarets (W8 D5 L0). Records are there to be broken though... In a close battle for the Premier League title, December 28 2014 could be a date that haunts City. Leading 2-0 at half-time against Burnley, Manuel Pellegrini's side squander a two-goal lead to draw with Sean Dyche's men. George Boyd scored straight after the break, turning home Danny Ings' shot while in an offside position. Then Ashley Barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw. Pellegrini knows his side can't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders Chelsea. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany returns to the starting line-up after being an unused substitute against Leicester on 4 March. Quartet Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy, Fernandinho and Edin Dzeko also start as Manuel Pellegrini rings the changes. Right so the Burnley team news is and Mike Duff and Sam Vokes come in for Michael Keane and Michael Kightly in the only two changes for the Clarets from the side that lost 2-0 at Anfield against Liverpool. Manchester City XI: Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Navas, Fernandinho, Yaya Toure, Silva, Dzeko, Aguero . Subs: Caballero, Mangala, Sagna, Nasri, Lampard, Bony, Jovetic . Burnley XI: Heaton, Trippier, Shackell, Duff, Mee; Barnes, Arfield, Jones, Boyd; Ings, Vokes . Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid, Ward, Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly.

"Italy's top football teams voted to give Parma a 5million euro (£3.7m) emergency fund to help the club finish the season. Sixteen of the 20 clubs in Serie A voted in favour of the measure on Friday. Roma, Napoli and Sassuolo abstained, and only Cesena voted against the move. The measure means last-place Parma should be able to play Atalanta on Sunday, after their previous two matches - at home with Udinese and at Genoa - were postponed indefinitely because the club couldn't pay for basic services such as security and electricity. Parma have an illustrious history, however the club are in dire straits financially and could go out of business . The gates at the stadium were locked as Parma's second match in a row was postponed last weekend . A banner on the locked gates said the Ennio Tardini stadium was  ‘Closed for robbery’ Parma have been sold twice this season, players have not been paid in months and a bankruptcy hearing has been set for March 19. The club's debts are estimated at nearly 100 million euros (£72m). The emergency fund will come from money that clubs pay to the league for fines from crowd trouble and other violations. After the league decision in Milan, Italian football federation president Carlo Tavecchio was traveling to Parma to formally present the plan to the squad's players. The plan requires Parma to play its next two matches before the bankruptcy hearing. Parma captain Alessandro Lucarelli and his club team-mates have not been paid since July . Earlier, Italy's tax police confiscated records related to Parma from club headquarters and the league and federation offices. Also, former Parma president Tommaso Ghirardi and former general director Pietro Leonardi were placed under investigation by judicial authorities for suspected bankruptcy fraud. Last month, Giampietro Manenti took over as Parma's new owner and president from the Russian-Cypriot conglomerate which had taken control in December from Ghirardi. Agreeing to pay off the club's debts, Manenti paid a symbolic price of 1 euro (0.72p) for the club.

"Chelsea's hopes of a historic treble came to grinding halt as the Premier League leaders were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 on away goals by Paris Saint-Germain. PSG twice came from behind at Stamford Bridge, demonstrating great character to play for the last hour of normal time and the added 30 minutes without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after he had been sent off for a foul on Oscar. He later described the Chelsea players as 'babies' for their attempts to influence the referee. In a highly physical match, replete with fouls and contentious decisions, Gary Cahill's second-half strike looked to be sending Chelsea through to the next round, before their former player David Luiz equalised to bring about extra time. Blues forward Eden Hazard then scored a penalty for the home side after Thiago Silva's handball in the box in the first half of extra time, but the PSG captain soon atoned for his error with a goal of his own six minutes from time to secure the Ligue 1 side's progression to the quarter-finals, much to the delight of goading rival fans online.

"The Grand Slam door was slammed in Ireland’s face at the Millennium Stadium as Wales defended their patch like 15 Cardiff bouncers to secure a famous RBS 6 Nations victory. As the Welsh tackle count moved past the 250 mark, it was clear that Ireland had finally met their match. There have been questions about the entertainment value of northern hemisphere rugby but, if ever an advert was needed, this was it. Shaun Edwards punched the air in delight and the championship race lives on. Wales killed off Ireland’s 10-match winning run and – describing himself as ‘a simple Kiwi boy’ in the post-match press conference – Warren Gatland proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of Flora. Scott Williams touches down after 62 minutes to score Wales' only try of the game to keep their Six Nations hopes alive . WIlliams makes a break for the line past Tommy Bowe before putting Wales into a commanding second-half lead . Williams goes over while Ireland players look on with dejection as they see their grip at the top the Six Nations weakened by defeat in Wales . Bowe puts his hand to his face in anguish after Williams' try as Wales held on to dash Ireland's hopes of winning the Grand Slam . Wales XV: Halfpenny, North, Davies, Roberts, Williams, Biggar,Webb; Jenkins, Baldwin, Lee, Charteris, Wyn Jones, Lydiate, Warburton (captain), Faletau . Tries: Williams . Penalties: Halfpenny (5) Drop goal: Biggar . Ireland XV: Kearney, Bowe, Payne, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray; McGrath, Best, Ross, Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, O'Brien, Heaslip. Replacements: Cronin, Healy, Moore, Henderson, Murphy, Reddan, Madigan, Jones . Tries: Penalty . Conversions: Sexton . Penalties: Sexton (3) ‘A lot of our players ran themselves into the ground,’ said Gatland. ‘In terms of atmosphere and intensity, it had everything as a Test match. Sometimes you suffer a loss and the next three or four days are a struggle to get out of bed; we were definitely on it emotionally.’ That emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full-back Leigh Halfpenny. Ireland’s Jonathan Sexton was dubbed as the player with gold-plated feet, but the celebrated No 10 did not quite live up to his billing. The visitors were shot down in ‘the battle of the skies’ and were forced to dessert their aerial game that was so effective against England. In the early exchanges, Rob Kearney fumbled a short kick-off and Gethin Jenkins won a fine turnover. Sexton kicked a restart straight into touch and Wales were able to build up phases. All the momentum was with the hosts and, after 13 minutes, they were 12-0 up. Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde has told supporters not to expect a feast of flowing rugby but - despite tickets exchanging hands for £300-a-pair on the blackmarket before kick-off – they were more than happy with what they were seeing. ‘There are a few “what ifs” and “maybes”,’ said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. ‘You look at the small margins that might potentially have changed the result. Our strategy was the same as the last few weeks but it’s not a case of back to the drawing board. We won’t throw the baby out of the bath water because it’s pretty hard to start all over again.’ Wales were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to Samson Lee in the front-row. Gatland breathed a sigh of relief as Sexton pushed his first penalty wide of the left post, but the No 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by Scott Baldwin. The tables were there to be turned and Ireland identified Lee’s replacement, Aaron Jarvis, as a weakness at the set-piece. They immediately used their choke tackle to set up a scrum, but Sam Warburton stole a dangerous attacking line-out from Devin Toner’s 6ft 11 grasp shortly after. Wales captain Sam Warburton celebrates with the rest of the squad as they do a lap of honour around the Millennium Stadium . It takes two Ireland players to put a stop to Goerge North's burst forward . Jamie Roberts makes a tackle on Rory Best during a spirited defensive performance by the hosts during famous win . Leigh Halfpenny scores the opening points of the match with a Wales penalty at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . It was a carbon-copy of Toner’s pivotal steal against England two weeks ago, however the hard work was undone when the Welsh skipper was sent to the sin-bin after half an hour. Sexton continued to edge his side back with two more penalties – sandwiching a fine drop goal by Dan Biggar – but Wales survived the yellow card with their half-time lead still intact. Gatland was forced into more front-row changes at half-time when he lost Jenkins to a hamstring injury. Ireland needed to change their approach after the break and they enjoyed more possession and territory. Schmidt’s players were consistently penalised for not rolling away in the first half and their discipline improved in the second. They enjoyed more improved territory and possession, but lack the execution in the final third. They camped themselves deep in Welsh territory in the 50th minute but were repelled by a cacophony of noise and fierce tackles. Inspired by the roars, Warburton rallied his players, locked the gates and forced Ireland backwards. In a breath-taking seven minutes, the Welsh defence saw off two full-blooded attacks – combining almost 50 phases – and eventually won the penalty when Sexton went off his feet at the breakdown.

Samson Lee  is treated by medics during the first half of the Six Nations clash between Wales and Ireland . Prop forward Lee leaves the field on a stretcher with what looks like a serious leg injury . It was a masterclass at snuffing out attacks - Luke Charteris made a remarkable 37 tackles throughout the game - and proved to be a flashpoint in the Welsh charge. Play moved downfield and Wales built up phases of their own. The forwards carried powerfully - providing the backs with quick, front-foot ball - and two quick passes found replacement centre Scott Williams. The 24-year-old, who had replaced Jamie Roberts because of a dead arm, short-changed Tommy Bowe after 62 minutes and cut through the defence to slide over for the first try of the game. ‘The attitude in defence was second to none,’ said Warburton. ‘Shaun’s gone into a lot of detail all week about certain policies to cover their trick plays in attack. The boys took on all that information and the detail paid off. Certain matches you can tell the boys are extremely focussed, and at breakfast I could see that everyone was so desperate to win.’ Wales were on the brink of their third home victory over Ireland in 33 years, although Ireland were not finished. On the afternoon of his 100th Test, Paul O’Connell turned down a near-certain three points and ordered his fly-half to kick for the corner. Peter O’Mahony claimed the line-out and Wales conceded a penalty try by collapsing the maul. It set up a tense finale – with Jonathan Davies being shown a late yellow card – but Wales held on to set up another weekend of drama.","Wales raced into an early lead as Leigh Halfpenny kicked the first points of the match from a penalty .

"Paris Saint-Germain sealed a spot in the quarter-finals of the Champions League despite being reduced to 10 men after just 31 minutes on Wednesday night. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's harsh dismissal did not prove to be costly as his team-mates beat the odds to score two crucial away goals at Stamford Bridge. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to heap praise on the Ligue 1 outfit who, including extra time, played for 89 minutes with a numerical disadvantage. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for a lunging tackle on Chelsea's Oscar . 'That is one of the best performances I've ever seen with 10 men from PSG,' said Rooney. Former Premier League stars Luis Garcia and John Heitinga also lauded the 10 men of PSG for giving their all until the final whistle despite losing a key player during the first half. Here, Sportsmail recalls other examples of when teams have impressed despite at least one of their players heading into the dressing room for an early bath. 10 - St Mirren 0-1 Rangers (March 2010) Cup finals are always tense affairs due to the pressure that surrounds both sets of players in the quest to land a piece of silverware.

James Collins opened the lead in the 10th minute before Maniche's 17th-minute dismissal for a lunge on Lionel Scaloni. However Jose Mourinho's 2005-06 side had a never-say-die attitude.

"Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb has become the latest player to sign a national dual contract. The Welsh Rugby Union announced 26-year-old Webb is the eighth player to agree a deal that is funded by the WRU and Wales' regional teams - in Webb's case, the Ospreys - following Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Jake Ball, Samson Lee, Rhodri Jones, Tyler Morgan and Hallam Amos. Webb has been one of Wales' form players this season, scoring four tries in his last seven Tests. Rhys Webb (centre) has signed a national dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union and the Ospreys . 'Rhys has established himself as a proven international scrum-half and fully deserves a national dual contract,' Wales head coach Warren Gatland said. 'He has impressed at regional level for the Ospreys, and this ensures his future here, which will prove an enormous benefit to professional rugby in Wales.' And Webb added: 'I am enjoying my rugby at the Ospreys and with Wales, and this allows me to build on that. Scrum-half Webb has four tries in his last seven Tests and has impressed during the RBS 6 Nations . 'Now my future is confirmed, I can focus all my attention of becoming a better rugby player.'

"Cesar Azpilicueta may be Chelsea's Mr Reliable but it's doubtful Blues boss Jose Mourinho will be seeking his advice on team selection if his five-a-side line-up is anything to go by. The defender nicknamed 'Dave' was asked to select from his favourite team-mates and the 25-year-old Spaniard went out of left field by picking two goalkeepers, Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois, and Arsenal's Nacho Monreal as his only defender. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is unlikely to be talking tactics with Cesar Azpilicueta . But Azpilicueta made up for his unorthodox defence by selecting Eden Hazard in midfield and Diego Costa as his striker. ‘Firstly, I apologise to any of my old team-mates if I missed you out, but it was so hard just picking five,’ Azpilicueta told the Chelsea website. Azpilicueta picked an unorthodox five-a-side team with two goalkeepers including Petr Cech . Azpilicueta's side would be hard to score against with Cech and Thibaut Courtois between the sticks . ‘I've played with some great goalkeepers. I don't know, there are too many to choose from! ‘Can I pick two goalkeepers? Well, it is my team! I'm going for Petr and Thibaut.’ Arsenal's Nacho Monreal would have his hands full as the only defender in the five-a-side team . At least the attacking options looked good with Chelsea's Eden Hazard as the midfielder . Chelsea striker Diego Costa would link up in attack with Hazard in Azpilicueta's side . ‘I'm not going to pick myself, so the defender in my side is going to be Nacho Monreal from Arsenal. He is my good friend, we know each other from Osasuna and he is a good competitor. ‘My first attacking player is Eden Hazard. It's for obvious reasons.’ ‘My striker will be Diego Costa. I know he's going to compete, be strong. I think we are going to have a good team with these players.’","Cesar Azpilicueta was asked to pick side from his favourite team-mates .

"If there was a textbook on Jose Mourinho’s management style, the antics of Chelsea’s players against Paris Saint-Germain would be page one. Surrounding the referee, complaining about decisions, elbows, and intimidation. Save for the poor result, it had all the hallmarks of a Mourinho classic. However, if the histrionics start to outweigh performances the Portuguese has a habit of losing favour fast. It’s what killed his reign at Real Madrid. Jose Mourinho shows his frustrations during Chelsea's match against PSG on Wednesday night . Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers and demand a red card is shown to Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Ibrahimovic (right) gets up as nine Chelsea players surround him and the referee after the incident . One of the battles Mourinho fought at Real was with the club’s own match delegate Miguel Porlan. ‘Chendo’, as he is known to everyone, played for over a decade at right-back for Madrid before continuing to serve the club after hanging up his boots. As part of the staff allowed to sit on the bench during games alongside goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, fitness coach Rui Faria, and Mourinho’s No 2 and current Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka, Chendo soon became part of the systematic applying of pressure on the fourth official. It was understood that Mourinho liked his assistants to rotate the badgering of match officials so to limit the likelihood any one individual would be sent off. Chendo, who respected – and was respected by – Mourinho, thought the tactic was below a club like Real Madrid. Spanish daily El Pais claimed he told his manager as much saying: ‘We don’t do that kind of thing here’, and also suggested it was common knowledge among the players that Chendo hated the role so much he would often approach the fourth official and appear to remonstrate with him when really he was just asking him if he had the time, or if knew what time Madrid’s big department store El Corte Inglés opened in the morning. Mourinho (centre) talks with Real Madrid delegate Miguel 'Chendo' Porlan during a La Liga match in 2010 . Nemanja Matic (centre) appeals to the referee following Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar during the first half . Chelsea players later look dejected as they are knocked out of the Champions League round of 16 . Mourinho has always believed matches are won not just by the eleven on the pitch but by everyone at the club. And neither are they just won with football. If the opposition can be intimidated and bullied – and if that affects their ability to play – then that serves the end-game goal of victory. Mourinho’s ‘us against them’ battle plan at Madrid lasted three years. It left many at the club burned-out and almost relieved when it was replaced by the calm bought by Carlo Ancelotti, but it cannot be said that it did not bring trophies. It’s true that he never reached the Champions League final at the club but he did win the Spanish Cup in his first season and La Liga in his second. That might have been small fare in any other era but against the best Barcelona team in history it can’t be seen that way. The third season at the Bernabeu that produced no trophies came when there were perhaps more dissenting voices inside the dressing room than there were players prepared to do it Jose’s way. The key to Mourinho’s success is that everybody rows to the same rhythm – once a couple of galley members have downed oars there are problems. Mourinho (right) argues with the referee as Cristiano Ronaldo (left) looks on during a match in April 2013 . Real Madrid players look on as Mourinho (left) is involved in an argument with the referee during the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona . On the pitch players often had to curtail their instincts to try to just out-play the opposition by surrendering to an overall plan to out-strategize them too. The beginnings of the fall-outs with Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos came because they believed, having won the World Cup with Spain, they could match Barcelona for football. Others, such as Xabi Alonso, sided with Mourinho believing that they would never out-play Pep Guardiola’s team and they had to be cleverer. Part of Mourinho’s belief that it would take more than just football to beat Barca came from his experience at Inter. They beat Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League on their way to beating Bayern Munich in the final but they did it with their centre-forward at full-back as an early sending off for Thiago Motta left them with most of the game having to play with 10 men. His victory jig on the pitch that night interrupted only by the Nou Camp sprinklers and Victor Valdes trying to usher him off the pitch is one of the images of his career and it set the tone for his time at Madrid but it didn’t always work. In Mourinho’s first season, and just after one of his greatest triumphs with Real beating Barca in the Copa del Rey final 1-0 courtesy of a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, Barcelona and Madrid were drawn together again in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Ronaldo (back) leaps high to score the winning goal in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . Real Madrid players celebrate with the trophy after winning La Liga in the season of 2011-12 . The players were flying believing that after their cup final success they now had the measure of Barcelona. But Mourinho thought otherwise and set his team up in the first leg at the Bernabeu to not lose. They would defend stubbornly and in numbers and frustrate Barcelona before going for them in the latter stages of the match. If they scored a late goal to put them ahead in the tie then perfect; if not then a 0-0 would be a good result to take back to the Nou Camp where without an away goal and bound to go on the attack, Barca would leave themselves open on the break. Ronaldo was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing Barcelona’s defenders. The rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position. Ronaldo looks dejected as he leaves the field after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League in 2011 . The plan may well have worked to perfection but Pepe was sent off in the second half after clashing with Dani Alves and against 10 men Messi scored twice to leave Real with no chance in the second leg. Mourinho recovered his players’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in Spain. Opinion is still divided over his legacy. One television station in Spain suggested this week that Mourinho was among three candidates to replace Ancelotti along with Zinedine Zidane and Jurgen Klopp. Others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return. The purists tut-tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of Barcelona’s 20-pass moves to goal. But it worked because Madrid and Mourinho won. It’s when it no longer works - as it didn’t for Chelsea on Wednesday - is it really called into question.","Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last-16 by PSG .

"Manuel Pellegrini has claimed that Manchester City’s players would never surround the referee in the way Chelsea harangued Dutch official Bjorn Kuipers during their Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain. Jose Mourinho’s side were fiercely criticised for urging Kuipers to send off PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Wednesday, and Pellegrini warned there must be a limit to what teams will do to achieve victory. ‘You will never see the City players surround the referee,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe you can discuss with the referee about a decision but just one moment in the game.

"Cristiano Ronaldo is the ultimate professional but Lionel Messi is more naturally gifted, according to former team-mate of both superstars Deco.

While Deco respects both players who have shared the last seven Ballon d'Ors between then, he concedes that Messi hold the edge in terms of pure 'talent' - although he suggested that another former Barca team-mate Ronaldinho could be better than both.

During the Q&A session, Deco also singled out former Porto manager Jose Mourinho as the best manager he has ever worked with after changing the mentality of Portuguese football. 'I think he's the best, though I've had many great coaches: Fernando Santos, Carlo Ancelotti, Felipe Scolari,' Deco said. 'However, Mourinho brought something different.

"Sean Dyche's Burnley earned a shock win against Manchester City to boost their survival hopes and all but end the Manuel Pellegrini's side's hopes of catching Chelsea at the top of the table. The only goal of the game came from midfielder George Boyd who expertly fired home a volley past Joe Hart in the City goal. Burnley's win sends them above relegation threatened QPR and leaves Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea having played two more games than their west London rivals. Find out how each player fared at Turf Moor with Sportmail's Craig Hope. BURNLEY (4-4-2) Tom Heaton 6.5 – Made a smart save from Dzeko in the first half but will have expected to be tested far more by the champions. Kieran Trippier 6.5 – Wasn’t able to get forward as much as usual but stuck to his defensive duties and made a great interception header early on. Michael Duff 6.5 – Recalled to the line-up in place of Keane and hardly put a foot wrong. Booked for a foul on Aguero. Manchester City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompanyis closed down by Burnley striker Danny Ings . Jason Shackell 7 – A real captain’s display alongside Duff in central defence to keep City’s threat to a bare minimum. Ben Mee 6 – Former City trainee had his hands full with Zabaleta and was very fortunate not to concede a penalty when he brought him down late on. George Boyd 8 – Had already gone close with a spectacular volley from the edge of the box before firing the winner with the sweetest of strikes. Scott Arfield 7 – Tested Hart with decent effort in the first half but excelled in a central, working tirelessly to hold City at bay. Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta and Burnley's Ashley Barnes battle for the ball  at Turf Moor . David Jones 7 – Another solid performance from the former Manchester United man, holding things together for Burnley in the heart of midfield. Ashley Barnes 6 – Showed his versatility by moving wide out on the left to accommodate Vokes and never stopped running. Danny Ings 7 – Posed a constant problem for Demichelis, and got the Argentine’s forearm in the face for his troubles. Edin Dzeko  holds off Barnes  during the Premier League match between Burnley and Manchester City . Sam Vokes 6.5 – His first Premier League start for Burnley after a knee injury and kept Kompany on his toes throughout. Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid (for Ings 90+3), Ward (for Vokes 87), Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly. Scorer: Boyd 61 . Booked: Mee, Duff . MAN CITY (4-4-2) Joe Hart 6 – The England keeper had little to do besides pick the ball out of the net and couldn’t be faulted for conceding Boyd’s winner. Pablo Zabaleta 6.5 – Got forward well as usual but his hard work came to nothing as City wasted what few opportunities came their way. Sergio Aguero  evades the challenge of Michael Duff  during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City . Vincent Kompany 6 – City skipper was recalled after being dropped for one game, and his clearance header went straight to Boyd for Burnley’s goal. Martin Demichelis 5 – Struggled to contain Ings. Booked for taking down the Burnley striker and could have seen red for a foul on Trippier shortly afterwards. Gael Clichy 5 – Failed to get forward enough and offer City a threat down the left. Will now sit out the Barcelona game through suspension. Jesus Navas 5 – Another lack-lustre showing from the Spain winger who incurred the wrath of Burnley fans who thought he overreacted to get Mee booked. Manchester City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho looks on during the  match against Burnley  at Turf Moor . Yaya Toure 6 – Tried to prompt City into life from midfield but there were none of the driving runs that can make him almost unplayable at times. Fernandinho 5 – Spent the last week in the headlines for his alleged bust-up with Kompany but did very little of note here apart from one volley high over the bar. David Silva 5.5 – Strangely subdued display from the Spaniard who is so often City’s creative spark. Subbed by Jovetic having contributed very little. English striker Danny Ings stretches for the ball during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City . Sergio Aguero 5.5 – City’s top scorer was off target with a series of attempts on goal and was lucky to escape punishment for a naughty challenge on Duff. Edin Dzeko 4.5 – A first-time shot that almost hit the corner flag summed up his display and no surprise to see him replaced by Bony with half an hour left. Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Mangala, Nasri, Lampard (for Toure 81), Jovetic (for Silva 74), Bony (for Dzeko 63). Booked: Demichelis . Referee: Andre Marriner 5 . Star man: George Boyd .

This picture of the dress sparked debate, with viewers disagreeing over the colour . The dress, made by the company Roman Originals, is in fact blue and black striped . Even celebrities weighed in on the fashion debate, with Kim Kardashian asking her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West.

Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous. While Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. McNeill said she never expected the picture to spark a star-studded debate, explaining that she just thought her followers on Tumblr would have a 'good reaction'.

"After a career working with some of European football’s top clubs, Jose Mourinho has experienced the highs and lows of management. On Friday, as he raised his right arm high into the air to emphasise his point, Mourinho wanted it made clear to Graeme Souness and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher that he remains at the top of his game. It was a low blow, calling the Sky Sports analysts out because they dared to criticise Chelsea’s players for surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers during the Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. Jose Mourinho opened up about the criticism aimed at his Chelsea by  Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness . Mourinho was in a spiky mood during a lively press conference on Friday and was full of gestures . Mourinho came up with another famous quip: ‘Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man' Mourinho claimed they were envious of his success as a coach, claiming the former Liverpool players have short memories after their careers at the top of the sport. The Chelsea manager said: ‘Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. It’s about life. ‘The difference between me and Souness is this: Souness as a player, up there (raises arm). Jose as a player, down here. Jose as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there.’ With that the Chelsea manager pulled one of those faces that suggested the pair do not even belong on the same planet, let alone Souness having the right to pass comment on his team. It did not end there. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful' Carragher, Thierry Henry (centre) and Graeme Souness dissect Chelsea's exit from the Champions League . Mourinho added: ‘I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. He was a fantastic player. I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players. ‘You know the world is a bit strange — maybe with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, memories are getting shorter. ‘When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it’s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. ‘I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa keeps the ball up while sitting on the floor at the Cobham training ground . Chelsea players in training ahead of the Premier League game against Southampton on Sunday . Souness managed Benfica for two years, between 1997 and 1999; Mourinho was the Portuguese club’s coach for a short spell between September 2000 and December 2000. Chelsea’s manager was spiky on Friday, confrontational at times as he attempted to put a positive spin on a negative result in the last 16 of the Champions League. The guard dropped again when he claimed Chelsea would definitely win the Barclays Premier League and he went on to make a case that they should be ‘eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 points’ clear of Manchester City. In public he is supporting his squad, although he was less than keen to divulge details of the 30-minute team meeting held at the training ground the day after their elimination. Souness was manager of Benfica in Portugal for two years, between 1997 and 1999, before Mourinho . The Special One spent a brief fractious spell with the Lisbon club before moving on to better things . ‘Nobody was shy,’ was about the most he was prepared to say after he called his players together for a cathartic exercise that you can imagine ended with the squad accepting the blame. They certainly take responsibility for ill-discipline, with Mourinho revealing that his players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee. Chelsea were fined £30,000 by the Premier League after they were charged following the behaviour of their players towards Jonathan Moss on February 11. Mourinho, preparing for Saturday's clash with Southampton at Stamford Bridge, added: ‘If they surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine. Mourinho revealed his players pay fines if they are charged for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee . ‘We have, in this moment, I think eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once. We paid for that. It’s simple. Go to the Premier League and see how many teams were charged and how many times. Chelsea were charged once. ‘Everybody would love to be in our position. We closed the chapter on the Champions League, but we still have the book to write. ‘If you want to talk about the Champions League, speak with Wenger or Pellegrini.

"Manchester City are offering free coach travel to fans travelling to Crystal Palace for their Bank Holiday Monday clash. The match kicks off at 8pm in the capital, meaning supporters would have no chance of getting back to Manchester on the train following the game. As a result, the Premier League champions have stepped in and are putting on transport themselves, free of charge. Manchester City fans have been offered free coach travel for their match to Crystal Palace in April . Manuel Pellegrini's side travel to Selhurst Park for an 8pm kick-off on Bank Holiday Monday . City have been given 2,500 tickets for the televised clash at Selhurst Park on Easter Monday. However, sections of the club's support had threatened to boycott the match in protest at what they believe to be inconsiderate scheduling. A statement on the club's website reads: 'To thank fans for their unwavering support throughout the season, we are pleased to announce we will be offering free round-trip coach travel for our Easter Monday fixture against Crystal Palace on 6 April, which kicks-off at 8pm. City fans would be unable to watch the entire match and then catch a train home to Manchester . Last time Manchester City went to Selhurst Park, Yaya Toure scored in a 2-0 victory over the Eagles .

"In the wake of Manchester City’s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. ‘I wanted to say ‘‘well done’’ to him after his winning goal,’ revealed Fernando. ‘To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.’ Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City’s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' ‘It’s really hard,’ Fernando admitted on Thursday. ‘I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. ‘This season has gone OK, I think, but I’m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. ‘We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won’t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. ‘The criticism will always come if things aren’t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn’t do but that is just what happens.’ City’s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho’s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. ‘It’s not something that would happen in our team,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. ‘We play according to whatever happens and we don’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . ‘Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. ‘At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. ‘But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. ‘It was two great teams wanting to go through. ‘The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. ‘The players were tense and that’s why these things happen. It’s adrenaline and tension.’ On Thursday at City’s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club’s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. ‘In every team and every player there is a need to talk,’ he said. ‘It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It’s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn’t even a tiny bit upset about. It’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.’ Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . ‘It is really hard for Brazil now,’ he said. ‘We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. ‘The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. ‘Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. ‘Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.’ Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): . Isaias Marques Soares, aka Isaias, signed for Coventry from Benfica in the summer of 1995.

"Playing with Thierry Henry turned Bradley Wright-Phillips into the MLS's top goal scorer last season. The duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat, with the Englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league's golden boot. Doing it again might be a lot tougher. Henry, the French international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league, has retired and Wright-Phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period. Bradley Wright-Phillips (left) didn't have a shot in the Red Bulls' season opener against Sporting Kansas City . Thierry Henry retired at the end of the season meaning Wright-Phillips has a new strike partner . The Red Bulls have revamped their roster and Henry isn't the only one gone. Australian international Tim Cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder Eric Alexander. In the season opening tie against Sporting Kansas City, Wright-Phillips didn't have a shot. 'I don't have to readjust my game,' the 30-year-old Englishman said after the Red Bulls practiced for their home opener against D.C. United on Sunday. 'I am always going to play the same way I always have. The players that have come in, I'm trying to learn like I did with Thierry. I learned how he played and I learned to play off him. I'll try to do the same with the new guys.' The additions this season are midfielders Sacha Kljestan and Felipe Martins and striker Mike Grella. But in the 1-1 season-opening draw, the chemistry was lacking up front. 'On the day of the game I put a lot of it down to me,' Wright-Phillips said. 'I was a bit too eager to get behind. I could have done a little bit better with my runs. It's the first game, I don't really lose my mind after a first game of the season.' If there is a difference this season it's the style of the Red Bulls' play under new coach Jesse Marsch. There is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing. A lot went through Henry in past seasons. The New York Red Bulls drew 1-1 with Sporting Kansas City in their first MLS game of the season . 'For us, it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like Thierry on the team,' Red Bulls captain and midfielder Dax McCarty said. 'He was a little of a wild card, a joker. If you are losing or in a bad situation, you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened, which more often than not did. That's gone. I think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that's going to be a big shift this season. McCarty said the team could have helped Wright-Phillips more in the opening game. 'We didn't create enough chances for Bradley,' McCarty said. 'I think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs. That is the thing that is going to make us successful this season. Wright-Phillips isn't heading into the season thinking: how does he top last year? He has set a goal target that he is not disclosing. If he meets it, he'll set another one. Whatever he does, Wright-Phillips isn't interested in heading back to England, where he played for Manchester City, Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford before coming to the Red Bulls in July 2013. 'I don't want to go back to Europe. I've said that several times,' Wright-Phillips said. 'There were one or two whispers that I heard about but it doesn't interest me. I'm playing for the New York Red Bulls and I love living in New Jersey.' Wright-Phillips says he has no desire of coming back to England and is enjoying life in the USA .","Thierry Henry retired from football at the end of the season .

"After feasting on too many fermented crabapples, a drunk squirrel has been filmed struggling to escape a snowy American backyard.

Misery: The squirrel's problems begin when it falls from a tall tree into a snowy back garden in America . Fall: At first, the cameraman thinks the animal is hut but soon realises the small rodent is simply drunk . Daunting: The drunk squirrel eyes up the challenge ahead - a small mound of snow between him and an open fence . His next great challenge is the small mound of snow between him and the open fence in an American backyard - a simple task made very difficult by his inebriated state. Several attempts to charge up the hill end in failure - leaving the resilient rodent lying flat on his back gazing up at the branches he fell from earlier. He seems to have found a solution to his never-ending escape attempt when he targets a different region of the snow to the left - but several more attempts also end in failure. In a sober state, the squirrel may simply have strolled around the fence which ended just a few feet to the right. The shaky footage has gone viral since being uploaded to Live Leak and YouTube where it has already gained tens of thousands of hits. After a few minutes of persistent climbing, the squirrel finally reaches the top of the tiny expanse of snow and rushes home - presumably to get some rest. Persistent: The little animal continuously charges at the small mound of snow but always ends up flat on his back .

"Thiago Silva leapt high, and powered a fantastic header looping over the head of Thibaut Courtois into the far corner of Chelsea's net, dumping Jose Mourinho's team out of the Champions League. It was, undoubtedly, a brilliant piece of play from the Brazilian, but immediately the inquest began as to how Chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space. The answer, it seems, is that captain John Terry, rather than marking his opponent, was tussling with his central defensive partner as the corner came in. As the corner comes into the box, John Terry grabs hold of Gary Cahill, who is running towards his own goal . Terry is clearly grappling with his team-mate as he attempts to move towards Thiago Silva . Terry did eventually reach Silva, but by then the Brazilian had jumped high to head the ball home . With the ball in the air, Terry can be seen grappling with Gary Cahill, as both Chelsea men get caught under the ball. Terry did eventually find a way past his colleague, but arrived too late and couldn't get off the ground, leaving Silva free to head home.

"An African-American Brooklyn state senator has been forced to apologize for saying white people eat differently to black people. Velmanette Montgomery was slamming the imminent closure of Key Food supermarket as a sign that the New York City borough is becoming gentrified. Speaking to The Brooklyn Paper on Tuesday, Montgomery (D-Clinton Hill) said: 'Supermarkets are an important part of the community. It’s an important amenity, especially for black and brown communities. Apology: Velmanette Montgomery said white people can shop at expensive boutiques but black people can't . 'When you’re talking about a white community, it can be a little boutique, because white people don’t eat the way we do.' The observation prompted a wave of criticism, forcing Montgomery to issue a statement of apology. 'It was an unfortunate statement and I didn’t mean to offend anyone,' she told New York’s WCBS-TV. Montgomery claims she was trying to explain that the neighborhood's low-income families would not be able to afford produce sold in an upmarket supermarket or boutique store. The landlord of the eight-story building which houses Key Foods said he hopes to lease the space to another supermarket after the closure in May.

"Full-back Scott Grix made history with the quickest hat-trick from the start of a Super League match as Huddersfield made it three successive wins to climb up to fourth in the table. The Giants, who began the season with three straight defeats, never looked back after former Wakefield player Grix's three tries inside the first nine minutes helped put them 18-0 up and on their way to a fourth successive win at Belle Vue. Wakefield hit back to close the gap to four points early in the second half but further tries from two other Wakefield old boys, Danny Brough and Brett Ferres, plus others from Leroy Cudjoe and Ukuma Ta'ai, helped the visitors to a comfortable 44-14 victory. Scott Grix scored the quickest hat-trick from the start of a Super League match in Huddersfield's victory . It was a fourth straight defeat for the Wildcats, who had started the season with so much hope after gaining back-to-back wins, and drops them to the foot of the table. The match was memorable for Grix's early heroics but little else as both sides produced a string of errors to leave both coaches frustrated. The record for the fastest hat-trick of tries scored from the start of any match remains with Huddersfield's former player and current assistant coach Chris Thorman, who scored his within six minutes and 54 seconds of the Giants' National League Cup semi-final against Doncaster in 2002. Grix got his first after just 63 seconds after Brough had put second rower Ferres into a gap and finished off a flowing move for his second four minutes later. The 44-14 thrashing of Wakefield was Huddersfield's third win on the spin and moved them up to fourth . The former Wakefield full-back then gathered possession from Craig Hall's kick 20 metres from his own line and sprinted 80 metres for a glorious solo try to complete his treble. Brough kicked all three conversions to make it 18-0 but Wakefield, who gave debuts to centre Joe Arundel and forward George Griffin, gradually weathered the storm and scored two tries of their own in a nine-minute spell midway through the first half. Centre Dean Collis got the first after Huddersfield winger Aaron Murphy had made a hash of Tim Smith's high kick while veteran second rower Ali Lauititii proved impossible to tackle as he got skipper Danny Kirmond over. Hall was wide with both conversion attempts to leave the Wildcats trailing by 10 points, which is how it stayed until half-time despite both teams creating a host of chances. Wakefield's Dean Collis is tacked by Huddersfield Giants' Danny Brough (left) and Joe Wardle (right) Jack Hughes, drafted in at short notice when Chris Bailey pulled out of the Giants team for personal reasons and switched from second row to centre when winger Jermaine McGillvary went off with a shoulder injury on 17 minutes, was the biggest culprit, twice dropping the ball with the tryline beckoning. Brough regathered his own chip over the Wakefield defence but saw the final pass intercepted and prop Eorl Crabtree was held up over the line on his back while Wakefield forward Daniel Smith had a try chalked off for a forward pass. Wakefield winger Chris Riley was the next man to have a try disallowed early in the second half but there was no denying substitute Jordan Crowther when he was the first to reach the ball from Paul McShane's grubber kick. Hall's first goal cut the gap to just four points but Huddersfield were soon back in the ascendancy, with Ferres marking the 250th appearance of his career with their fourth try after taking Brough's short pass near the line. Brough kicked his sixth conversion before handing over the goalkicking duties to his half-back partner Jamie Ellis, who wrapped up the scoring with a penalty and conversion of Ta'ai's injury-time touchdown.","Scott Grix scored quickest hat-trick from start of Super League match .

"Carol Robertson, a golf coach at Virginia Tech University sunk two holes-in-one within the span of three holes on March 9 in Orlando, Florida . A Virginia Tech University golf coach accomplished a golf feat that is so rare, she was just as likely to win the lottery. Carol Robertson, 30, sank two holes-in-one in the space of three holes on March 9. Her successful game of golf came during a practice round at Celebration Golf Club near Orlando, Florida, while the university was on spring break. The odds of sinking two holes-in-one in the same round are 67million-to-one, according to PGA.com. But US Hole in One, estimated the odds of sinking aces on consecutive par-three holes at nearly 156,250,000 to one, according to the Washington Post. That's roughly the same odds as winning the Powerball lottery. The first hole in one came on the third hole, a 159-yard par-three. The second was on hole five, a 161-yard par-three. Before the fifth hole, she joked that she plays 'par threes pretty fast' and she she'd 'just go ahead and make a one on this one, too', according to the Washington Post. And then she did. 'I just kind of dropped my club and hit the ground,' Robertson said. 'Everybody's just high-fiving, getting their cameras out, taking pictures.' Robertson, who had five previous aces, sunk holes-in-one on the third and fifth holes of Celebration Golf Club during a practice round of golf . The odds of sinking aces on consecutive par-three holes is nearly 156,250,000 to one. Winning the lottery has about the same odds . The ball landed to the left when it hit the putting green, but it began to roll and headed right for the hole. And then it sunk. 'It was like slow  motion, watching that one go in,' Robertson told Washington Post. 'We couldn't believe it. I fell over. I was sitting there thinking, ""is this really happening?""' Robertson, who had five previous aces, was reportedly playing the round with assistant coach Russell Abbott and Virginia Tech redshirt players Amanda Hollandsworth and Allison Woodward. 'The girls on my team were so excited and everyone I know in golf has been sending congratulations,' she said. 'We went out for a nice dinner but I dodged the tradition of buying everyone a drink because my team isn't allowed to drink per college sports rules and they aren't 21.

"A rural snake catcher could not believe his eyes when he saw an image of an eastern brown snake stealing a sausage right off a barbeque. But after being assured by his best friend, who took the image, Newcastle reptile controller Geoff Delooze now believes the image is authentic, and it is no fake snake . Mr Delooze told Daily Mail Australia he had never seen anything like the image, which was taken at a picnic on the Blue Mountains, on all his years on the job. The bizarre image shows an eastern brown snake eating a sausage whole straight off a barbeque . ‘I couldn’t believe it. My best mate took the images from a picnic he was having. Otherwise I would have had trouble believing it was real,’ he said. The ravenous reptile reportedly appeared in front of a large picnic, snatched the snag then disappeared back into the bush. ‘Snakes usually avoid people at all costs. I think what’s happened is that this one had grown so big-it looks over two metres long from the width of the head-that it had developed somewhat of an attitude.’ Mr Delooze said he contacted some American Snake research teams, who confirmed it was not unheard of for snakes eat outside of their natural diet. Snake catcher Geoff Delooze said he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the picture, which was taken by his best friend . The image was taken at a picnic in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney . ‘They said they had heard of some python eaters feeding their snakes chicken and things like that.

"Roy Hodgson has revealed that Arsene Wenger rang him for advice before signing Danny Welbeck for £16m on transfer deadline day - and that he is delighted that his strong recommendation paid off for both Arsenal and Welbeck. Wenger has since said that he only appreciated quite how good a player Welbeck was after seeing him close up every day in training - and Hodgson says he gave similar feedback to the Arsenal manager when Wenger was weighing up whether to buy Welbeck or not last August. Hodgson said: 'Arsene and I speak more often than most managers as he always comes up to the directors' box at Arsenal and I speak to him very often. And we spoke of course before he signed Danny. I was singing Danny's praise so I'm delighted that Arsene has seen that my judgement wasn't wrong and that he shares that judgement. Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United for £16m on transfer deadline day . Welbeck scores the winning goal for Arsenal against his former club in the FA Cup quarter-final . 'We like Danny very much. We've always shown faith in Danny. Many times he's been selected by me and my staff when he was not actually playing for Manchester United. Sometimes he's not even been on the bench and yet still we' ve selected him because we think he has the qualities required. 'And what Danny really needs is the faith of his manager, which he obviously has from Arsene, to get more games. And then I think we'll see more and more performances from him that we've been lucky enough to see with England and Arsenal were lucky enough to see the other night when he played at Monaco. I thought he was really, really good.' Welbeck is likely to start for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next Friday. He made 24 starts for Manchester United last season and since moving to Arsenal on transfer deadline day has already started 25 times with at least eleven games remaining, which Hodgson believes is benefitting the England player. Arsene Wenger and Roy Hodgson in the director's box at the Emirates Stadium . 'Arsene has used him and he's played quite a lot of games if you compare it to the games he played for Man United. With us he's always done what I think is a very, very good job for the team. There aren't many times when he's played for England where I've been disappointed in him or in his work rate or desire. But of course it would be great if he gets himself as one of the first names on the Arsenal team sheet and play for them every week, that would be a bonus certainly for him and it won't do us any harm. 'I'm pretty sure he must have benefitted (from Wenger's confidence in him). But it's not something that has struck me like a bolt of lightning, that's for sure. When he's come with us he's not lacked confidence ever. He knows what we want from him. And he knows that he can deliver what we want from him. He knows that we believe in him. I've never felt he's ever come to us with a massive lack of confidence.'","Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United in the summer .

Fiorentina can make Salah a permanent signing this summer and Montella admitted his surprise at the Egyptian's instant impact. 'Maybe right now we have got the better deal,' he told Mediaset Premium, when referring to the money-plus Salah deal for Cuadrado. 'For now, we have benefited. We knew the superb characteristics of the player, but we did not expect him to have such an impact on Italian football. Perhaps only Messi is faster than him with the ball at one's feet.'

We endured a terrible run of form earlier this season, but we got through it; there might be another like that, though we will fight to achieve our goals.

"A woman who hit and injured three freshman high school students  in a crosswalk was recording a video of her son at the time of the crash, court documents revealed. Elizabeth Rachel Dove, 23, of Oregon struck the three girls in January from Centennial High School with her white Kia, and at the time was recording a 19-second video of her son who was sat in the backseat, according to police. The young mother has been indicted on several charges including five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving, according to KATU. Elizabeth Rachel Dove (above), 23, of Oregon struck the three girls in January from Centennial High School with her white Kia, and at the time was recording a 19-second video of her son who was sat in the backseat, according to police . Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program (above scenes from the January crash as the girls lie in the street after being struck as students rush to help them) Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program. They were hit just outside of the high school in Gresham. Following the crash, the three girls were taken to hospital where they were treated for injuries, and were later released, according to KPTV. A status report from January revealed one teen girl suffered from a concussion and torn ACL, and the bone on her left knee was torn out; the second teen was left with a broken nose, a major concussion, bruises to her legs, feet and face, unable to walk due to pain in her ankle and lost a tooth; and Hollenbeck suffered from a fractured skull, pelvis and knee. In the events leading up to the crash, Dove sent five text messages and received one, as well as had a phone call lasting seven minutes before recording the video, according to phone records included in a court affidavit from the Multnomah County court. In the events leading up to the crash, Dove sent five text messages and received one, as well as had a phone call lasting seven minutes before recording a video (above the girls are tended to by emergency responders) A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat (above scenes from the crash) During the 19-second video she recorded of her son, she is holding the phone with her left hand and making gestures with her right hand. A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat. The report notes this is clearly when the crash occurred, as Dove is panicked and her child is heard crying in the background. Police determined that Dove hit the teen girls 1.42 seconds after the video ended, and that they entered the roadway at the time when Dove 'appears to have no hands on the steering wheel'. Lowvy Ma, who witnessed the crash, said he honked his horn when he realized that Dove was going to hit the girls. He said he saw her car slow down for a few seconds before the teens were hit and he saw them 'go flying'. Hollenbeck recalled how she woke up after being struck by the car and saw her two friends lying on the ground next to her, according to an earlier report by KGW. 'It was really scary because I saw both my friends being covered in a blanket and I thought they were dead,' she said. Hollenbeck added: 'We were so lucky. I think the next time it could be fatal for someone.' Dove got out of the car and waited at the scene until police arrived, and told responding officers she did not see the teens before the crash. She also admitted to phone use. Police determined that Dove hit the teen girls 1.42 seconds after the video ended, and that they entered the roadway at the time when Dove 'appears to have no hands on the steering wheel' (above Dove's damaged white Kia) The young mother has been indicted on several charges including five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving (above the crosswalk where the incident took place) Dove, who has been convicted previously for theft and ID theft, was arrested on March 4 but was released from jail, and now faces the several charges. There was no alcohol or drugs involved in the incident, according to police. In Oregon, using cellphones while driving is against the law except for in cases when the driver is using a hands-free device and is over the age of 18.

"A 'deals on wheels' cannabis gang which used a parked Mazda near a university as its mobile drug den has been jailed. The group made £600 a day pushing the drug onto students in Cardiff after parking the black vehicle near its campus in Cathays. Four of its Kurdish members were jailed after being watched by police as they opened the car's door to one customer. Haram Kalaf (left) and Saman Ahmed (right) were among members of the gang which sold drugs from a black Mazda parked near Cardiff University . South Wales Police Officers found £3,650 of cannabis and £2,399 in cash inside. Haram Kalaf, 25, a failed asylum seeker and Saman Ahmed, 28, Nasir Karimi, 26, and Bakhutar Shakir, 28, were all handed sentences of between 13 and 21 months each. Cardiff Crown Court heard how the gang also used rental cars to shuttle drugs from the Mazda to customers. When police seized the vehicle they found 295 small bags of the drug hidden alongside thousands of pounds in cash stashed beneath the carpet. Nair Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' for eight years before being jailed, the court heard . The gang was stopped when officers monitoring another of their cars watched them invite a young woman into the vehicle to buy £20 of the drug. 'The car door opened as if to draw her attention, she got in and left seconds later', prosecutor Jason Howells said. 'When she was stopped, she said ""I’m sorry, I don’t want to get into trouble. I’ve just bought some weed for £20""'. After searching that vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra, they were taken to the Mazda where the majority of the haul was kept. Sentencing Judge Huw Rees said all of the men had come to the UK to sell drugs. 'You came here with a single purpose, to supply cannabis, making a lucrative profit. 'It was a well organised venture and the location you chose is significant - you came to an area of the city where students live, that intention is clear. 'And you used an extra vehicle with the sole purpose of storing your hoard so that if you were caught, you would only have small amounts on you.' Kalaf, a failed asylum seeker from Bristol, told police he was selling £600 of drugs every day. Ahmed, a father-of-two, was recruited as his driver while Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' since arriving in the UK eight years earlier. Shakir, a gambling addict, had previously been arrested for drug offences. The drug dealers parked the Mazda on Rhymney Street in Cardiff and used other vehicles to shuttle drugs around the city .","The gang of men dealt drugs from the car not far from Cardiff University .

"David Denton insists Scotland will look to bounce back from their Wooden Spoon shame by winning this year's World Cup. The Dark Blues had a nightmare RBS 6 Nations as they lost all five games, suffering their third whitewash in 11 years. But Edinburgh number eight Denton believes the Scots can brush off their embarrassment by lifting the Webb Ellis Cup at Twickenham on October 31. David Denton believes Scotland can bounce back from a nightmare Six Nations by winning the World Cup . Scotland have been drawn in Pool B alongside South Africa, Samoa, Japan and the US. They kick-off their World Cup bid on September 23 against the Japanese in Gloucester. Asked if he still believed the side would look to challenge the best nations in the world for the trophy, he replied: 'Yes'. Pushed further on that statement, he added: 'I understand it's hard to see. Our first goal is to get out of the pool and then give ourselves every chance of winning the World Cup. 'We never change [our views on what we can achieve]. We are in this sport to win. There is no doubt about that. There is a process to getting there - we need to get out of our pool first. Scotland were thrashed 40-10 by Ireland on their own patch at Murrayfield on Saturday . 'We're in a tough pool - it could have been worse. We have tough games particularly against South Africa and Samoa that we need to make sure we perform well in. 'It's a pool I think we can do well in and then [if] we get a favourable quarter-final we move on from there. You just need to take it one game at time and that's what we are going to do.' Scotland ended their campaign with another hard-luck story as Ireland steamrollered their way to a thrilling title triumph with a 40-10 win. And Denton admits it was not the way he saw the championships going. Scotland lost all five of their Six Nations matches in 2015 to finish at the bottom of the table . 'Today was a disappointing end to a disappointing campaign,' he said. 'We came in to this competition with a lot of ambition and the prospect of winning the trophy. We came in thinking we were a good enough team to do that. 'But a few of the results didn't go our way and today we weren't good enough. 'There are a lot of things we can improve on and we will do. 'Was it realistic to think we can win the title? One hundred per cent. There was no ambiguity about. (Coach) Vern (Cotter) said it at the start and we all believed it. 'We went into the France game thinking if we win in Paris things could start turning our way.'","Scotland beaten 40-10 by Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday .

It’s becoming an unfortunate habit and a not very nice one. But I can’t fault the guys for the total commitment and effort. ‘We played some cracking rugby and scored some great tries.

"The day before George Osborne delivers his budget to the nation the Lawn Tennis Association came up with its rough equivalent – the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in Great Britain. Chief Executive Michael Downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body, and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it. Over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing, so that by 2018 around £26 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the United Kingdom. While Andy Murrayis established as one of the world's best players, problems still exist at grass roots level . Other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although, given the current rankings of most GB juniors, many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come. Downey reaffirmed the LTA's laudable, broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this. However, there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public, no 'Parks tennis revolution' or some such thing. Anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the British game would be left disappointed. Not that Downey, the former head of Tennis Canada who was appointed 18months ago, pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long-term plans for the British game. LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game . 'Our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that,' he said at the start. What he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis, like most other ball sports, has with declining participation numbers. They all face a challenge from what he termed 'doorstep' sports, highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running, cycling, swimming and going to the gym, which can be done solo and whenever time permits. Despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from Wimbledon profits and that event's ever growing popularity, there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years. The particular problem is among the 16-44 age group with numbers steady above that. Curiously he omitted to mention, until asked, that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children, an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports. Among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things, there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis. 'I think the old LTA would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools,' he said. The LTA receives millions annually from funds generated by the Wimbledon Championships . There were other sensible ideas. With tennis participation peaking in July, there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year. Clubs, volunteers and coaches will get more support (attempts at this are nothing new). In junior tennis there will, wisely, be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much-needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments. The emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board. Downey asserted that he was looking at the 'meat and potatoes' issues, rather than eyecatching initiatives. He also pledged that the LTA would spend money 'like it's your own' (no reference here to his own £434,000 pay package). It is, clearly, expecting too much for any results to be instant, as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis. He was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players, pointing out that the average entry age into the world's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women. Murray's victory at SW19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation . 'If you are 27 years old and still playing Futures I don't think you are going to be a top 50 player. It's a ruthless business,' he said, reiterating the 'no compromise' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport. While there has to be a degree of patience with his plans, they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector. There are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about. Andy Murray, for instance, is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game. (Downey presented his ideas to him in Glasgow two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest.). Downey has spoken to Murray after Britain's 3-2 Davis Cup win over USA in Glasgow . TV advertising during the summer is not on the agenda. If there is an embracing of the excellent Tennis For Free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited. The whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker, nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate. No participation targets have been set. The simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic 'Lawn Tennis Association' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason. What was presented, though, was steady and sensible enough, while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope. Like most budget speeches, the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious.","LTA have unveiled their long term plan to get more people playing tennis .

We'll keep going in this way and we'll see at the end of the season. 'It's always frustrating when you're on the bench, but I think we make the difference with the guy on the bench and whoever is playing, no matter who is on the pitch, as soon as the manager needs us we have to be ready for a fight and to win games.

"Romelu Lukaku can score the goals to keep Everton in the Premier League, according to manager Roberto Martinez. The Belgium international impressed while on loan from Chelsea last season, but struggled initially after making the move permanent last July. A total of seven goals before Christmas was fewer than Everton might have expected from a striker they had just spent a club-record £28m on. Romelu Lukaku has been 'phenomenal' in 2015, according to Everton manager Roberto Martinez . Lukaku has struggled at times this season after his £28million move from Chelsea in the summer . But the 21-year-old has scored 11 times since the turn of the year, finding the net in each of Everton's last three matches. Martinez puts that recovery down to the fact that Lukaku is no longer suffering the after-effects of helping Belgium reach the quarter-finals of last summer's World Cup. Everton are far from safe in the Premier League as they prepare for  Sunday's trip to relegation-threatened QPR. But Martinez feels that the goals of Lukaku will see them out of trouble. He said: He said: 'We made a big investment in him because we always felt that he's a one-off. 'It's always tough for players after a World Cup, and Rom found it extremely difficult. 'But I've been so impressed by the manner in which he's put everything together. 'I think he's been phenomenal. His performances from January have been impressive. 'Now the target is to see that in the next 10 weeks, and make sure he finishes the season really strongly. 'Rom's becoming the type of player who needs one chance to make the difference. 'He likes to carry that responsibility, which is something that goes with your character. He's the full package.' The Belgian striker competes with Moussa Sissoko during Everton's win against Newcastle last week . Martinez has no doubt that Everton are in a relegation fight. Last Sunday's 3-0 home victory over Newcastle was only the second time his side had won in 12 Premier League matches. He said: 'Any team who haven't got 40 points in the final third of the season are fighting for every point. Make no mistake about it. 'It's a massive period of the season for us. Every point is going to be extra significant for the team.' Robert Martinez insists Everton are in a relegation dog fight this season .","Romelu Lukaku signed for £28million from Chelsea last summer .

"Germany has been gripped by claims and counter-claims that footage allegedly showing the new Greek finance minister giving the country a one-fingered salute was faked. A video appeared online earlier this week which appeared to show Yanis Varoufakis holding up his middle finger when giving a speech about Greece's finances and Germany in 2013. Jan Bohermann, host of satirical TV programme 'Neo Magazin Royale' on public broadcast channel ZDF, then admitted that his production team had doctored the footage. But now it has been claimed that his confession itself was faked - sparking confusion as to whether the video really is genuine. Scroll down for video . Faked: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was accused of making an offensive gesture with his middle finger during a speech he gave in 2013 about the country's finances, and mentioning Germany . Funny: Mr Varoufakis laughed off the incident on Twitter and said: 'We politicians need you badly' Mr Bohermann said he had been waiting to be asked if he had faked the controversial video, but that no-one had queried their work. He added: 'Sorry Mr Varoufakis, we won't do it again.' But ZDF has now issued a knowing reminder to its audience that 'Neo Magazin Royale' is a satirical programme and ironically tweeted that it would place a 'careful, satire' warning on all future broadcasts. That has sparked a new wave of speculation over whether the video is in fact the real deal and the hashtag #varoufake has been Germany's top trending topic on Twitter throughout today. The footage appears to show Mr Varoufakis raises his finger and saying: 'My proposal was that Greece should simply announce that it is defaulting, just like Argentina did, within the euro, in January 2010, and stick the finger to Germany and say well, you can now solve this problem by yourself.' Mr Varoufakis has repeatedly denied the footage was authentic and  laughed off the incident on Twitter. He sent a message to Mr Bohermann that read: 'Humour, satire & self deprecation are great solvents of blind nationalism. We politicians need you badly.' Mr Varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in Greece's debt from the EU and has been doing a whistlestop tour of Europe in a bid to get support for his proposals. Pressure: Yanis Varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for Greece . He has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for the country to pay back its debt to the EU since the election of the radical left-wing party Syriza in January. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing party heading the new coalition, immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece' £179 billion international bailout deal. The party has continued to describe itself as 'anti-austerity.' Mr Varoufakis last month visited Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in London to garner support for the move and has been touring several European countries. Greece was likely to run out of money by March if a deal was not reached before the end of February, and a four month extension to the bailout programme for Greece was agreed on a conditional basis. February 9 2010 – Greek Parliament approved first austerity package measures -  included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, and cuts in overtime workers. March 3 2010 – Parliament passed a new major austerity package. Measures included: Pensions freezes, an increase in sales tax from 19% to 21%, rises in taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, rises in taxes on luxury goods, cuts in public sector pay. April 23 2010 – George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister formally requested an international bailout. The financing will come from an emergency aid package with the participation of European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. May 2 2010 – Papandreou, the IMF, and euro-zone leaders agree to a €110 billion bailout package that would take effect over the next three years. The government announced the new austerity package measures. June 29 2011 – Parliament passed the new austerity package. October 20 2011 – Government passed the multi-austerity bill, amid protests and violent riots outside the parliament building. February 12 2012 – Parliament passed new austerity package measures amid violent protests. Many buildings in the centre of Athens burnt during riots. November 5 2012 – Parliament adopted new round of austerity cuts required for Greece to receive the next installment of the international economic bailout. April 28 013 – Parliament approved bill that included cutting 15,000 state jobs . July 17 2013 – Parliament approves new austerity measures . March 30 2014 – Parliament passed new multi-bill needed for Greece to receive its next bailout. April 10 2014 – Greece returned to financial markets, with the issue of 3 billion Eurobonds. December 8 2014 – Greek government announced snap presidential vote. Next day the Greek stock market fell 12.78%, a fall record since 1989. December 29 2014 –Government collapses after failing to elect new president of Greece. January 2015 - Alexis Tsipras of Syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade European Union and IMF to ease terms of bail-outs. But there are still concerns the country could run out of money, as Greek officials complain the repayment measures are starving them of money. Earlier this week, Greece had handed over 580m euros to the International Monetary Fund, clearing its debt for this month. But it will face another 350m euros bill tomorrow - generating further tensions between Greece and the eurozone and fears that the country could drop out of the single currency altogether. The allegations come as Varoufakis, an outspoken Marxist economist and blogger, has faced a number of criticisms. He came under fire after taking part in a photo shoot for Paris Match - him and his wife posing with glasses of wine on their roof terrace.","Video appeared to show Yanis Varoufakis making offensive gesture .

"There were call-ups for three uncapped players and an unexpected recall for Ben Stokes but they were all overshadowed in England's Test squad to tour the Caribbean by the return of Jonathan Trott. Nothing seemed less likely than this when Trott left England's Ashes tour 16 months ago after his public ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson. The road back since he returned home after the first Test in Brisbane with a 'stress-related condition' later diagnosed as situational anxiety has been a long and tortuous one. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott has been recalled to the England Test squad for their upcoming tour . Trott has completed his recovery from a stress-related condition that stretches back to the Ashes in 2013 . Trott will compete with Adam Lyth for an opening batting slot alongside Alastair Cook . Yet against all the odds and after the key development of working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters, Trott is back and will compete with Adam Lyth to become Alastair Cook's opening partner in the three-Test series. There will be those who worry about Trott's fragility but mental injuries should be treated no differently from physical ones and now he has been given a clean bill of health it is right that the 33-year-old should be picked. Lyth gets the nod ahead of Sam Robson and his emerging county colleague Alex Lees, and becomes one of an incredible six Yorkshiremen in the squad after scoring 1,489 championship runs at 67.68 last season. Adil Rashid, another Yorkshireman, and Durham fast bowler Mark Wood are the other newcomers. Rashid made the last of his 10 limited-overs appearances for England six years ago but is a more mature leg-spinning all-rounder and person now at 27. Stokes, who missed out on the World Cup after a miserable year of form, returns in place of the injured Chris Woakes, but England see him more as a No 6 batsman and fourth seamer in Test cricket. England hope Moeen Ali will overcome a side injury to join the tour in time for the second Test in Grenada. In his absence Rashid will compete for the No 1 slow-bowling spot with Kent's reliable off-spinner James Tredwell, who edged out Surrey's Zafar Ansari for the final place in the squad.

"Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was able to leave Melbourne with a smile, happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career. The first five and a half days from last Monday were overshadowed by a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde and his claim on a full-time race-seat for this season. That was eventually resolved on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, although further talks are planned this week - in a private arena away from the courtroom - between both sides in a bid to finally close the matter. Monisha Kaltenborn was happy to end a tough week with a smile on her face at the Australian Grand Prix . Sauber have been embroiled in a legal battle with their former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde (centre) Once Sauber and Kaltenborn were again able to concentrate on the racing, drivers Marcus Ericsson and rookie Felipe Nasr acquitted themselves well. Nasr was a superb fifth - the highest position by a Brazilian driver on debut - while Ericsson's eighth-place finish was the best result by a Swede since Stefan Johansson in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. When you consider Sauber endured the worst season in their history last year when they failed to score a point , their feats around Melbourne's Albert Park were all the more remarkable. 'It was a very nice ending to the weekend,' Kaltenborn said. 'The events of last week were not easy for the entire team. You can try to keep things away from them, but they are exposed to it. You just don't know how to shield it from them. On the track, Felipe Nasr finished fifth - the highest a Brazilian driver has ever finished on his debut . Kaltenborn (left) looks dejected as she attends a press conference of team principals in Melbourne last week . 'But it was impressive how the team continued to do their work, to remain focused and to bring home the kind of result we saw. 'For me personally, last week was probably one of my toughest in my time at Sauber, and I don't want to experience it again. 'I'm very glad it's over - all the more glad with the outcome (of the race) - and we focus now on the future.' Kaltenborn conceded on Friday the events of last week had resulted in 'a negative impact' on the team, but she felt confident that, given the tremendous result, it had now been restored. 'With what happened, the morale was affected, but you could feel they got themselves together,' Kaltenborn added. 'With these kind of results, you can have an extra push of motivation and you can feel good about it. 'This result tells people we're back, to forget about what happened last year, that it was a one-off and won't happen again.'","Sauber's opening week to the Formula One season was overshadowed by a legal battle with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde .

"Chris Coleman will name Sam Vokes in a Wales squad for the first time in a year on Wednesday - and believes that allows Gareth Bale to spell more danger for his country. Vokes has not featured for Wales since scoring in a 3-1 victory over Iceland last March as he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament three weeks after that Cardiff friendly. But striker Vokes has been a regular off the Burnley bench since Christmas and started his first Barclays Premier League game on Saturday when the Clarets shocked Manchester City to win 1-0 at Turf Moor. Burnley striker Sam Vokes has earned a call up to the Wales squad after impressing for the Clarets . Vokes (right) scored on his second appearance back from injury during his side's 1-1 draw with Tottenham . That has convinced Coleman he is ready to play some part in the crunch European Championship qualifier against Israel on March 28 and free Bale again to cause maximum damage in Haifa. 'He obviously missed the start of the season after his injury but he's had some games and minutes under his belt now,' said Coleman. 'It's good for us because Sam gives us something different. 'He's not just a big target man, he's got a bit more to him than that and it will be good to have the big man back . 'Maybe he can come on for half an hour or play for an hour if he starts because defenders don't like playing against that very strong and brave forward who can get a goal.' Vokes' return also spells good news for Coleman as far as the deployment of Bale is concerned, especially as his main man ended his nine-game scoring drought on Sunday by scoring both goals in Real Madrid's 2-0 league victory over Levante. Bale has often had to plough a lone furrow in Vokes' absence rather than causing mayhem when cutting in from either flank. Gareth Bale, pictured after scoring against Andorra, has led Wales' forward line in the absence of Vokes . The Real superstar scored twice in Wales' opening 2-1 Euro 2016 win in Andorra in September to make it 11 goals in his last 16 international appearances but he has not found the net in the three qualifiers since. 'Maybe we can now release Gareth somewhere else,' Coleman said. 'Gareth's been up there by himself because in the last camp Simon Church was also injured and he's had a job to do for us. 'But we can look at it with another angle with big Sam coming back.' Coleman's side head to Haifa with themselves and Israel the surprise early front-runners in Group B and fancied pair Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina having ground to make up in the section. Group leaders Israel have won their opening three games while unbeaten Wales lie in second place after beating Andorra and Cyprus and picking up points against Belgium and Bosnia. Wales boss Chris Coleman is hoping Vokes' return will allow Bale to return to his natural role . Coleman has hit on a settled side and he hopes he will be able to call on Hull defender James Chester, who has been out of action since dislocating a shoulder in January. Chester has been a revelation since joining the set-up last year and has developed a formidable centre-back pairing alongside captain Ashley Williams, with Wales conceding only twice in four qualification games so far. 'It will be touch-and-go for James and he's done brilliant for us,' Coleman said. 'But we're lucky we've got someone of James Collins' experience to come in. 'He's got the type of mentality to go to a place like Israel where it will be heated and front it up and lead. 'It's going to be tough because they're top on merit but if we're serious about qualifying we've got to go there and get something.'","Burnley's Sam Vokes will be named in Wales squad for first time in year .

"Alan Pardew has backed Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann to carry on improving and challenge for a place in the England squad in the near future. England boss Roy Hodgson opted for Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four centre back for the upcoming internationals with Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month. But Dann has been in impressive form for Palace in recent months as they moved away from relegation danger. Scott Dann has been in brilliant form for Crystal Palace recently and could be in line for an England call . Alan Pardew has back his centre back to keep improving and draw Roy Hodgson's attention to him . But Pardew says that Dann, 28, has his best years ahead of him and can carry on improving. He said: ‘He is a good age and is coming into his prime age as a centre half and he has a lot of experience under his belt at this level. ‘He has not surprised me in terms of his character because he plays with an honesty in every game. He has been very impressive since I have been here and his confidence is high. He hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that Glenn Hoddle would have been proud of. ‘He has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does. ‘I don’t think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad. He is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see. What will be, will be, but his best years are still in front of him.’ For Pardew personally, he would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad. Wilfried Zaha was the last Palace player to be called up to the England squad back in 2012 and Pardew says his players must find their place in the Premier League first.

Pardew would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad during his time as manager . Harry Kane’s rapid assent into Hodgson’s squad is something that Pardew admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality. He added: ‘There have not been too many Palace players in the England squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad. Sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year, you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level. Harry Kane has won a place in the England squad and Pardew has been impressed with his quick progress . ‘Our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that. ‘To be fair to Harry Kane he has done that in a very quick time at a top club, and that is difficult to do, so hats off to him. ‘Lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country.’","Alan Pardew says he would love to have players in the England squad .

"Chris Ramsey is relishing his role as semi-permanent Queens Park Rangers manager, regardless of the four-point margin between the west London club and 17th place. Ramsey joined QPR as academy manager after 10 years with Tottenham, and picked up the managerial reins until at least the end of the season after the departure of Harry Redknapp in February. The former Brighton right back, whose side host Everton on Sunday, found himself out of work for more than half a year after being relieved of his duties in north London at the end of last season, and admits he was desperate to return to the game – irrespective of the circumstances. Chris Ramsey insists he is relishing his role as semi-permanent Queens Park Rangers manager . ‘I had seven months at home watching Frasier, Jeremy Kyle and Homes Under The Hammer!’ said Ramsey. ‘Of course I would rather be here in this situation than be out of work and worrying where the next job or paycheque is going to come from. ‘I'm in a fantastic situation - I'm one of 20 managers in the best league in the world.’ Ramsey has a fight on his hands if QPR are to remain in ‘the best league in the world’, and while no physical confrontation took place, the 52-year-old admitted to a ‘heated exchange’ with his players when 3-0 down at half-time against Crystal Palace a week ago. The QPR boss instructs his players during a training session ahead of their  clash against Everton . However, Ramsey knows simply rollicking his players each week won’t be enough to save QPR’s season. ‘We’ve had some strong words before each game to be honest, and sometimes you have to take a different tact because the effect of that speech goes,’ Ramsey continued. ‘Sometimes you have to look at the game and the situation, and use different strategies to get the players ready to perform. ‘The players didn’t throw the towel in against Palace. We talked about making sure the fans weren’t embarrassed any more in the second half of the game. ‘So Matty (Phillips) scores a goal like he’ll probably never score again. If he shoots from there again I don’t think I’ll be too happy, unless it goes in.’ QPR suffered a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace last weekend .","Queens Park Rangers are 19th in the Premier League after 29 games .

"When Steven Davis arrives back at Hampden for the first time in four years it is sure to be a bittersweet occasion for the former Rangers captain. The memories will come flooding back of his five cup finals as an Ibrox midfielder that ended with the Ibrox players being showered in champagne and drenched in adulation. There was a time when Davis dreamed life would always be like this; that his next trip to Mount Florida would be to add to those two Scottish Cups and three League Cup wins secured under Walter Smith. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis shoots at goal during a  match against West Ham last month . Yet those aspirations ended abruptly when the economics of the madhouse behind the scenes at Ibrox intersected with cold hard reality and Rangers plunged into the financial abyss in 2012. When Davis returns to the city to skipper Northern Ireland in a friendly with Scotland next Wednesday night, he knows he could face a hostile reception from the Rangers fans in the crowd who remain raw about the way their on-field leader walked out when the going got tough. Yet with no clarity on what the future held for the club under Charles Green, Davis was one of several leading players who opted to move on rather than remain to usher in the new era under Charles Green. While Davis takes no personal pleasure from vindication, time has shown his switch to high-flying Southampton to be a shrewd move, as Rangers have, by contrast, stumbled between alternating humiliations and crises over the last three years. And while the 30-year-old would understands any animosity, he hopes the fans realise he was left with no other realistic choice. Davis (centre) lifts the Scottish Cup trophy after Rangers beat Falkirk 1-0 in the 2009 final at Hampden . ‘I’m really looking forward to the match against Scotland,’ said Davis, who won three SPL titles and was a UEFA Cup Finalist between 2008 and 2012. ‘I’ve always wanted to get back up the road to catch a game but with the number of fixtures we have nowadays I haven’t managed. ‘I’ve fond memories from the majority of my appearances at Hampden and without doubt, I always hoped I’d play there a few more times with Rangers. When you enjoy as much success as we did in finals, you clearly want to continue in the same vein. ‘We always seemed to do well in the cup competitions but none of us – whether you were a fan or a player – could have foreseen what would happen at the club. ‘When you play football, you don’t really have your mind on anything else but with the publicity Rangers get, we started to get away from that. ‘When the new people came in, we didn’t know who we were dealing with and there was no dialogue in terms of telling us which direction the club was going in. ‘We never heard from the new owners about how they wanted to take the club forward or what their ambitions were for the next four or five years. Davis (centre) goes flying after being fouled during Northern Ireland's match against the Faroes last year . ‘We didn’t even hear how the next six months might pan out. There were no conversations had with us at all and it was an impossible situation for everybody. I didn’t ever get a phone call to say what the plans were or what the aims of the club were to try to progress. ‘I was the captain at the time so if I wasn’t getting a call, it’s fair to say I don’t think anyone else would have been either. ‘It was difficult because nobody really knew what sanctions were going to be applied and if we were going to be relegated or not. We were put in a position where we had to make a decision on our futures without knowing what the future might hold in store. ‘We had to make choices without knowing anything and the biggest thing from the club was there was a lack of communication so we didn’t know which way it was going. ‘I’m sure there will still be a few people who are unhappy with the way players left but we’ve seen a lot of things unravel in the last couple of years. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and everybody can now see the effect the new people had after they came in. ‘Maybe the fans can start to see where we were coming from and how we looked at it a bit better because of that.’ Davis (right) celebrates with his Rangers team-mates after the Ibrox club won the 2011 League Cup final . As Rangers struggle, Davis has been a key player in Southampton’s challenge for a European place this season. He has tended to keep his own counsel on the thorny issue of Rangers but when he joined Southampton, technically as a free agent, he pushed succeeded for the St Mary’s club to pay Rangers a fee. These days he just hopes the damage of three years of mismanagement at Ibrox can by repaired. ‘It is difficult to say anything in the media about it because you’re never going to come across the right way in everybody’s eyes,’ the 71-capped Ulsterman said. ‘It was obviously a difficult situation at the time but whenever I played, I always gave 100 per cent and I loved my time at Rangers. ‘I’ve got nothing but good memories of the fans, who were excellent with me and any supporters I’ve met since have only been positive. ‘At the time, a lot of things were said in the heat of the moment but over time, I think people have been able to see we had to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families. Davis (right) poses with Rangers manager Ally McCoist after winning the Scottish Premier League Player of the Month award for September 2011 . ‘For me, as an international player at 27 as I was then, I wanted to play at the highest level and I had to take everything into consideration. ‘As we didn’t have any real direction at Rangers we were being made aware of, we wanted to know what was happening but got nothing. ‘When I joined the club at first, there was no need to have that conversation because we simply went into every competition looking to win it. ‘That was clear. The fans demanded that, as did the players, but things changed and I hope Rangers can get back to that soon. ‘I’ve always wanted to get back to Ibrox to see a game and if it wasn’t for what happened, we could potentially all still be there just now. ‘It’s not like we were all angling for moves. At the time, we had a great dressing room and had had a lot of success over a number of years. There was no real need for any of us to look elsewhere and it was really unfortunate things went the way they did.’","Steven Davis returns to Hampden next week for the first time in four years .

"Paul Ince says son Tom would love to play for England in the future and insists the decision to make himself unavailable for the Under 21s was taken for the good of his career. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail, the former England captain – who has 53 caps – has hit back at claims Tom ‘snubbed’ his country and that his international career is in ruins. Gareth Southgate revealed on Thursday that the Hull winger – currently on loan at Derby – had told him he did not want to be considered for this summer’s European Championships. Tom Ince has been left out of the latest England Under 21 squad by Gareth Southgate at his own request . Ince (right) is currently on loan from Hull City at Championship side Derby County . The Three Lions boss said he was ‘surprised and disappointed’ following conversations with the 23-year-old and his father, his former England team-mate. But Ince Snr says his son needs a period of rest if he is to get his career in the Premier League back on track – and that is their prime focus heading into next season. ‘Tom has played 18 times for the Under 21s and really enjoyed it and found it beneficial – so this is not a snub, that’s rubbish,’ said Ince, who was England’ s first black skipper. ‘He is 23 years of age and has already played in the Euros in Israel. He has experienced that, which was great. ‘If he was 20 years old we would not be having this conversation, he would be going to the Euros, no doubt about it. ‘But the last year or so from a club point of view has been difficult for him. He’s been all over the place. He went to Hull last summer and has then been on loan at Forest and Derby, where he’s doing well now. ‘We forget that he had three years at Blackpool pretty much playing by himself at a young age, and that had an effect. ‘He needs to get a good rest and make sure he is ready to go next season. He needs to start finding some stability. He needs to get himself in a position to play regular football in the Premier League.’ England captain Paul Ince has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a World Cup qualifier against Italy in Rome in 1997 . Ince (right) played under his father Paul while at Blackpool in the Championship . The aim, then, is to make an impact at the KC Stadium next season before bidding for a senior call-up with England. ‘Listen, Tom has not snubbed his country. It is the pinnacle of a player’s career to represent your country,’ Ince added. ‘I was captain and am immensely proud of my 53 caps. ‘Gareth Southgate said we should be aware of the repercussions. I don’t agree. If Tom is playing regularly next year for Hull and scoring goals like he is for Derby, then he would love to get an England call-up. ‘And if he is doing that I see no reason why Roy Hodgson shouldn’t call him up. He’s got a good young squad and Tom would love to be part of it in the future. ‘But first of all he needs to get his club career in order. We have looked at the bigger picture. He needs a steady period and he needs to hit the ground running next season. Ince (second right) celebrates with goalscorer Harry Kane (right) during the U21 clash with France last year . Gareth Southgate said Ince should be aware of the repercussions following his decision . ‘If he makes his mark at Hull next year then hopefully we’ll see the benefit of this decision. ‘So there is no way I’m saying to Tom, “Don’t play for England”. As a father I would love my son to do what I did and play for his country. ‘There are other kids coming through who are 20 and 21 and they will be at the tournament - Tom is 23. ‘And don’t forget he could also be in the play-offs with Derby, as he was with Blackpool. There would be no time for rest. ‘We have to be careful and think about the future.’","Tom Ince made himself available for England Under 21 side .

"Hull defender Michael Dawson will lead his side into Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Chelsea insisting confidence levels have not been hit by a fortnight of frustration which has plunged them deeper into the relegation dogfight. Missed opportunities against Sunderland and Leicester have left the Tigers hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker Nikica Jelavic faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery. On the face of it a clash with Jose Mourinho's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former Tottenham star Dawson is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend. Michael Dawson (centre) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit . Dawson said: 'We have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks. It's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season. 'It is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to Anfield and Manchester City and Arsenal and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against City.' The Tigers' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers Burnley upset Manuel Pellegrini's men at Turf Moor but Dawson says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on Sunday. The Hull captain remonstrates with referee Jonathan Moss following Tom Huddlestone's sending off . 'You do look at other results, there's no hiding that, and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief,' added Dawson. 'On paper it wasn't one you would look at but credit to Burnley who showed what the Premier League is about.' Jelavic's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing Abel Hernandez or Sone Aluko in attack, but the game is likely to come too early for long-term injured trio Mohamed Diame, Robbie Brady and Liam Rosenior. However despite Jelavic's grim immediate prognosis, boss Steve Bruce is determined not to completely write the Croatian striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end-of-season run-in. Bruce said: 'Being realistic we think it's going to be at least six weeks. It could force him out for the rest of the season, but knowing Jela the way I do I am sure he is going to give it a good shot.' Nikica Jelavic faces up to six weeks out and is all but ruled out of their Premier League survival bid .","Michael Dawson has praised his team-mates for their fighting spirit .

"Real Madrid players appeared to be in high spirits as they put the finishing touches to their preparations for the potential La Liga title decider against Barcelona this weekend. The two clubs, who occupy the top two spots in Spain's top flight, are set to face each other at the Nou Camp on Sunday.

"Jordan Henderson can become one of the great international players if he starts to add more goals to his game, according to England manager Roy Hodgson. Hodgson believes that the Liverpool midfielder, who takes on Manchester United on Sunday and is tipped to take over the captaincy from Steven Gerrard next season, is only a step away from becoming an exceptional player, with the England manager delighted at Henderson's progress after he was lambasted for picking Henderson for Euro 2012. Hodgson said: 'His rise has been fairly meteoric as well. It wasn't so long ago that I picked him for Euro 2012 and that decision was vilified. People were saying he wasn't getting into the Liverpool team and he was being described as a waste of money. Roy Hodgson believes Jordan Henderson could become one of the great international players . The England manager wants Henderson to start adding more goals to his game . 'Then he went to the Under-21 tournament a year later and got an awful lot of criticism captaining the England Under-21 team. No-one had a good word to say about him. So his rise has been quite meteoric, even though he's been round a long time. 'It's only the last year that people are starting to say: ""Actually, this boy's a good player"". This lad has a lot of qualities. And of course I think, as time goes on, the responsibility he's been given at Liverpool now by Brendan will help him. Liverpool's success will rub off on him as well as he's been an important part of it. 'I think we'll see him get better and better and that's what we hope. He ceratinly has enough qualities that I don't think he needs to be hung up on goal-scoring. He'll always be around the national team for the many other qualities he has. If he starts to add goals as well, then you're talking about someone who is exceptional.' Henderson has scored some crucial goals for Liverpool, including the winner at Swansea . Henderson (right) in training as Liverpool prepare to take on rivals Manchester United on Sunday . And though Hodgson hopes that Henderson does succeed Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain, he says it won't make any difference to his role in the England team, where he is already considered one of the senior players. 'If Brendan does make him captain, great and we'll all be happy. If he doesn't it won't affect his leadership qualities as far as I'm concerned. He's in our leadership group. He'll still be someone who needs to take on leadership responsibilities when he comes to England. If he does that, coming as Wayne Rooney does, as captain of his club team, that's great. If he doesn't because Brendan chooses someone else that doesn't affect me.'","Roy Hodgson believes Jordan Henderson can become an England great .

Doyle – who is currently at Championship Wolves – has signed a two-and-a-half year deal with the Rapids starting on July 1.

I will always be grateful to the fans for their support; it is they who make Molineux such a special place. ‘To be involved in the current squad that is on an exciting run is now my only focus, as it would mean so much to me to see us get back to the Premier League.’ Doyle becomes the latest player to swap the Premier League for MLS with Gerrard and Lampard moving to LA Galaxy and New York City FC and Shaun Maloney who joined Chicago Fire in January.","Doyle, who made his name at Reading and is now at his second spell at Wolves, will head across the pond on July 1 .

"Teenager Ash Handley scored on his home debut as Leeds moved to within two points of Super League leaders St Helens with a hard-fought 26-14 win over Wigan in front of a bumper 18,350 crowd at Headingley. Handley, drafted in for only his second senior appearance as a replacement for shoulder injury victim Tom Briscoe, was among five different try scorers as the Rhinos overcame the absence of skipper Kevin Sinfield to condemn Wigan to a third defeat in six matches. Liam Sutcliffe proved an able deputy for the injured Sinfield, scoring a try and kicking three goals, but Leeds' hero was Australian prop Adam Cuthbertson, who also scored a try and proved a real handful for the visitors with his powerful running and skilful ball handling. Teenager Ash Handley scored the second try for Leeds Rhinos on Friday night . Leeds, who handed a recall to full-back Zak Hardaker pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation, were good value for their fifth win of the campaign but could never relax against their injury-hit opponents. The home side made the brighter start without finding the finishing touches and Wigan, captained by Leeds-born hooker Michael McIlorum, opened the scoring from their first real attack, with centre Anthony Gelling breaking clear to get the supporting Matty Smith over after 10 minutes. Smith kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after Cuthbertson was pulled up for a high tackle on George Williams to make it 8-0 . However, the Warriors made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as Leeds struck a purple patch with three tries. Substitute Brad Singleton went over for the third try for Leeds Rhinos . Cuthbertson, who qualifies for England, got the first, following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker Paul Aiton and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by Handley. The former Newcastle Knights forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute Brad Singleton over and Sutcliffe kicked his second goal to make it 18-6. Wigan finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger Joe Burgess caught Williams' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try, which was goaled by Smith to cut the gap to just two points. Defences got on top in the second half, with Wigan having to do most of the work as the Rhinos gained the momentum. Referee Richard Silverwood gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when Sutcliffe stretched out of a two-man tackle to score his side's third try. Sutcliffe was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by Wigan's Liam Farrell from an offside position. Farrell was sin-binned for the offence and the Rhinos made the most of their man advantage when substitute Rob Burrow forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go.","Teenager Ash Handley scored on his home debut on Friday night .

"Arsene Wenger refused to be drawn into a discussion of Arsenal's Barclays Premier League title chances after seeing them hold out to claim a hard-fought victory at Newcastle. The Gunners' sixth successive league win left them just four points behind leaders Chelsea, who have two games in hand, but Wenger is adopting a one-game-at-a-time approach to the closing stages of the campaign. He said: 'Look, Chelsea have a good security and at the moment, I feel they have enough cushion to be quite serene. Arsene Wenger has played down his side's chances of winning the Premier League title this season . The Arsenal boss believes Chelsea have too much security at the top and are quite serene . 'We have Manchester City in front of us and behind us, it is tight as well - the only thing we can do is to win our games. 'I think Chelsea have too much security. I just think at the moment we are not concluding, we are in a fight. You have seen the game today - in every game, we need to turn up and fight until the last minute to get the points. 'That's what we have to do, just go for the next game and win it. Look, the players want to do as well as they can. We know we have a fight first to be in the top four. We will go step by step, game by game.' Chelsea are four points clear of the Gunners but have two games in hand on the rest of the chasing pack . Arsenal looked to be heading for a comfortable victory at St James' Park when Olivier Giroud struck twice inside four first-half minutes to give them a commanding 2-0 lead at the break. But the Magpies, who were booed off at half-time, returned in determined mood and Moussa Sissoko reduced the deficit within three minutes of the restart. They then laid siege to the Gunners' goal and but for fine reaction saves by David Ospina from Mike Williamson and Ayoze Perez, they might have emerged with something to show for their efforts. Oliver Giroud (centre right) pokes home the opener in an entertaining affair at St James' Park . Wenger said: 'We have played four games in two weeks and three away games at Manchester, in Monaco and here today and we have won all the three. 'The last 40 minutes were difficult because our legs had gone a little bit and Newcastle played very well in the second half. 'But we had an outstanding first half going forward and a very fluent game by creating chance after chance, and in the second half, we had just to show different qualities and hang on.' The in-form striker bagged a second from a corner to put Arsenal into a commanding half-time lead . But Newcastle head coach John Carver, who had only one fit central defender for the game, was also able to take positives from a spirited fightback which he felt demonstrated the fact that his players have not started their summer holiday just yet. Carver said: 'There certainly wasn't anyone on the beach with their flip-flops on, that's for sure. 'After the comments last week, which were ridiculous, from ex-players - I'm surprised at that - every single one of them, and I include the lads who came on the pitch as second-half substitutes, gave everything for this football club. 'It showed that they are not on their holidays yet.' That barb was aimed in the direction of Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville after his comments last Sunday night, although the former Manchester United and Everton man tweeted during the second half: 'Newcastle been brilliant 2nd half so far!'. Moussa Sissoko (right) halved the deficit but despite late pressure Newcastle's poor start punished them . When informed, Carver said: 'That's nice, I didn't realise that had happened.' Defeat, coupled with Crystal Palace's 2-1 victory at Stoke, saw Alan Pardew's Eagles leapfrog the Magpies into 11th place, although the former Magpies manager's progress was of little concern to Carver. He said: 'I've got to be honest, it is because of the situation we are in. Congratulations to Alan, but I am not worried about Crystal Palace. 'The only thing that's on my mind and the only thing I'm worried about is this football club and making sure everything I do is 100 per cent, everything the players do and give is 100 per cent, and that's all I can ask for.'","Arsene Wenger played down Arsenal's hopes of a title challenge .

"Dundee United star Paul Paton has launched an astonishing attack on Celtic as he accused the Parkhead club of having a long history of ‘manipulating’ people and situations for their own benefit. The frustrated Tannadice star claimed there have been ‘continual injustices’ across the three games between United and Celtic this month that have yielded six red cards - four for Jackie McNamara’s team. In the wake of the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila and his captain Scott Brown both accused United kid Aidan Connolly of ‘diving’ to win his side a penalty. Paul Paton (right) believes Celtic 'manipulate people' and have been doing so for the past few years . Despite Deila calling on the SFA to take action, none was forthcoming but United were subsequently denied a penalty when Brown barged Ryan Dow in the League Cup Final, won 2-0 by Celtic at Hampden last Sunday. And after the 4-0 Scottish Cup replay win at Parkhead on Wednesday, Deila accused Ryan McGowan of endangering the career of Liam Henderson with a wild lunge. But the United camp felt the reaction of Celtic’s players may have influenced Calum Murray’s decision to send the Australian off. The Dundee United star and Ronny Deila have previous when they clashed at Tannadice in the quarter-final . And ahead of the fourth and final match between United and Celtic at Parkhead in the Premiership on Saturday, Paton appeared to accuse Celtic of heaping pressure on match officials. ‘Ronny Deila has an opinion on everything but I don’t really read too much into what he has to say or who he puts pressure on,’ said Paton. ‘But I think Celtic as a club can manipulate people more than Dundee United can. That kind of thing has been happening for years. The tough tackling midfielder goes up for a header with Celtic star Nir Biton in the cup final on Sunday . ‘We have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration. It feels that we do not get any decisions and that it is continual. ‘I saw things differently (to Deila). I don’t think Ryan McGowan deserved to get sent off as he clearly won the ball. I don’t know if I am being biased but it is a hard tackle but he clearly won the ball. ‘I don’t think there was much in it (but) they have made a lot of it. It looked like a good tackle to me but that is only my opinion.’ Ryan McGowan (right) was sent off for a tackle on Conor Henderson and angered Celtic's players . Paton’s sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee Murray to hand a second yellow to Efe Ambrose for a foul on Nadir Ciftci at 1-0. He continued: ‘I thought he was lucky to stay on the park but we have seen it in the last few meetings that we don’t seem to get things like that going for us against Celtic. ‘How he stayed on the park I will never know. It was a clear yellow card. But when you come to places like (Parkhead) you never seem to get these decisions. ‘I don’t know if it is just coincidence but you saw last weekend in the League Cup Final we should have had a clear penalty. Paton believes Efe Ambrose (centre) should also have been sent off for a second bookable offence . ‘Then Efe Ambrose should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen. Small things like that change games.’ Paton also defended himself after Celtic’s Anthony Stokes yesterday accused the United midfielder of catching him with a ‘sly elbow’. Stokes was sent off for retaliation but later said on Twitter: ‘I get a sly elbow in the face by someone that has nothing about them and get sent off, typical!’ But Paton pleaded his innocence, saying: ‘I have ran across him and I don’t know if he thinks I have meant to hit him but he has lashed out and caught me on the side of the face. ‘I stepped across him and I don’t know if I have caught him with my leg or my arm. I honestly don’t know but it was certainly not intentional. ‘But there’s no edge between the two teams. It’s been taken out of context as there were not really any bad challenges in the game. We come back to Parkhead on Saturday in the league with a clean slate.’","Paul Pato launched scathing attack on Celtic after their cup final defeat .

"After fighting to stay cool, Steve McClaren now has a battle of greater significance. His Derby County team must arrest their alarming slump if this season is not to finish in even deeper disappointment than the last. Wolves inflicted another defeat with a determined display and have the play-offs firmly in sight. Derby were top after 33 games, 11 points ahead of Kenny Jackett’s side. After a sixth match without a win the gap is just two. Derby do not look safe in fifth. Wolves are in the prowl in seventh. McClaren was furious with referee Keith Stroud’s call that denied his team an opening goal. He will be angry with his defenders for the Wolves goals. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant punches a sliced clearance into his own net to make it 2-0 to Wolves . Nouha Dicko celebrates with Scott Golbourne and Bakary Sakho after giving Wolves the lead at Molineux . Dicko fires past Lee Grant in the Derby goal just minutes after half-time to set Wolves on their way to victory . Wolves (4-4-2): Kuszczak 7; Doherty 6.5, Batth 6, Stearman 6.5, Golbourne 6.5; Henry 6.5 (Van La Parra 68’ 6.5), Price 6.5, McDonald 7.5, Sako 7; Afobe 7 (Doyle 90’), Dicko 7 (Edwards 65’ 6) Subs not used: McCarey, Ebanks-Landell, Hause, Iorfa . Scorer(s): Dicko 48, Grant (og) 69 . Manager: Kenny Jackett 7 . Derby (4-2-3-1): Grant 4; Christie 6, Keogh 5.5, Albentosa 6, Forsyth 5; Hughes 7, Bryson 7; Russell 6 (Dawkins 70’ 5), Ince 7, Lingard 6.5; Bent 6 . Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas, Shotton, Warnock . Booked: Christie . Manager: Steve McLaren 6.5 . Referee: Keith Stroud 3 . Attendance: 27,480 . In the 69th minute goalkeeper Lee Grant elected to punch rather than catch the ball after Craig Forsyth had slashed a clearance skywards. Grant succeeded only in diverting it horribly into his own net. Forsyth was at fault earlier. Three minutes after the interval he erred in sending a clearance to Kevin McDonald, who fed the Nouha Dicko. The Mali striker dispatched his finish through the legs of two Derby defenders. The match was utterly absorbing. Derby hit the woodwork twice, Wolves once. There were shots, saves, and in the 39th minute a real shocker. Amid the end-to-end chances, Stroud intervened in entirely unnecessary fashion. Jesse Lingard slipped a pass to Darren Bent, who was tugged down by Wolves captain Danny Batth as he ran clear. In an instant Tom Ince arrived to pop the ball into the unguarded net. But Stroud had blown to award the visitors a free-kick. He compounded the error by failing to administer a card of any colour despite the foul warranting red for denying a goalscoring opportunity. The Wolves players celebrate after Grant punched the ball into his own net to make it 2-0 . Derby manager Steve McLaren shows his frustration during the Championship defeat on Friday . McClaren, sitting in the stands, ripped the headset from his ear and made his way to the touchline to remonstrate. Growing animated, he was mocked by Wolves fans. ‘Where’s your brolly gone?’ they sang. Craig Bryson fired the free-kick at goal and Tomasz Kuszczak, not for the first or last time, dived to save. The Polish goalkeeper had earlier made fine stops from a Lingard piledriver and a long-ranger by Ince. Ince was targeted by Wolves fans for his England Under-21 withdrawal. ‘Eng-ur-land,’ they chanted. He nearly silenced them in the 25th minute with a curling shot that hit the bar. Wolves were more than competing. In the 27th minute a cross by Dicko was deflected to Benik Afobe whose volley was kept out by Lee Grant. Dicko sent another effort just wide. Bakary Sakho holds off the challenge of Derby County midfielder WIll Hughes . He made no mistake with his goal to send Molineux wild. Derby pressed hard in the second period and Kuszczak produced his finest save by getting his fingertips to Bryson’s sweet drive, diverting the ball onto the post. Wolves hit the woodwork too, when McDonald sent Afobe clear with a long pass. The Wolves striker smacked the crossbar. Grant then gifted the hosts the clincher and Derby’s race was run. Afterwards, McClaren had one thing on his mind. ‘It’s cost us the game,’ he said of Stroud’s decision. ‘He will watch it again and know he is wrong.’ McClaren implements a no-swear policy but admitted he breached it when trying to make sense of the officiating. He spoke to the referees assessor to air his grievance. Tomasz Kuszczak of Wolves celebrates his team's second goal against Derby on Friday night . ‘We try not to complain too much about referees like we see in the game,’ he said. ‘But it is very difficult to keep our humility.’ McClaren believes his side can ‘absolutely’ win all their remaining seven games to reassert a push for automatic promotion. A play-off place is the minimum requirement. He hopes his injured players including Chris Martin, Jeff Hendrick, and George Thorne will all be back after the international break. Jackett wants two points per match in the run-in to reach the play-offs just a season after winning League One. ‘We’re in with a really good shout of being able to take one of those three promotion places,’ he said. ‘We have potency up front and pace that disturbs defenders. ‘When Derby beat us by five (in November), at that junction it looked like a chasm between the two clubs. Derby have been setting the benchmark for quality in the Championship. So for us to be two points behind we’re delighted.’","Wolves beat Derby 2-0 at Molineux in the Championship on Friday .

"Former England captain Jamie Peacock is pushing his Leeds front-row colleague Adam Cuthbertson for an England call-up. The 30-year-old Australian prop, who produced a man-of-the-match performance in the Rhinos' 26-14 Super League win over Wigan on Friday night, has a Warrington-born father and has put his hand up to represent England. Signed in the winter on a four-year deal from Newcastle Knights, Cuthbertson has proved to be an instant hit with Leeds and Peacock believes he could make an impact with Steve McNamara's men in the Test series against New Zealand in the autumn. Adam Cuthbertson has been backed for an England jersey by former national team skipper Jamie Peacock . Australian Cuthbertson, who signed with Leeds in the winter, has a Warrington-born father . 'He's been really good for us this year,' Peacock said. 'He's slotted straight into Super League. The prop was man-of-the-match in Leeds win over Wigan on Friday night . 'He's got a great style of football, he can play a bit.' Peacock says he would not have a problem with the Sydney-born Cuthbertson representing England, pointing to McNamara's selection of New Zealand-born Rangi Chase for the 2013 World Cup while predecessor Tony Smith picked Samoa-born forward Maurie Fa'asavalu for Great Britain in 2007. 'The bigger pool you can get for England the better,' he added. 'We are seeing that within all sports now with eligibility rules, so why not? 'I can't speak for other players, you would have to ask them if it puts their noses out of joint but it never bothered me. 'Roger (Chase) was in there, wasn't he?' The biggest hurdle for Cuthbertson will be the plethora of world-class front-row forwards at McNamara's disposal. James Graham, Tom and George Burgess and Chris Hill are expected to be automatic picks after playing in the 2014 Four Nations Series while St Helens duo Alex Walmsley and Kyle Amor are pushing themselves into the reckoning. Sydney-based Mike Cooper will also fancy his chances of breaking through after being a non-playing member of McNamara's squad last year. Cuthbertson, who also played in the NRL for Manly, Cronulla and St George Illawarra, was selected for the New South Wales City Origin team in 2011. Peacock says Cuthbertson could make an immediate impact for England against New Zealand . Meanwhile, teenager Ash Handley could be set for an extended run in the Leeds team after marking his home debut with a try against Wigan. The 19-year-old had been on stand-by for England winger Tom Briscoe and got his chance when the former Hull favourite was ruled out with a serious shoulder injury. 'Tom will have to have an operation so he is going to be a number of weeks out, which is a shame for him,' Rhinos coach Brian McDermott said. 'He's been one of our best players and certainly one of the best wingers in the competition. 'If there's a positive it's that it's early in the season and he will have his rehab and come back to us at an important part of the year.'","Adam Cuthbertson was man-of-the-match in Leeds' win over Wigan .

"It may not be James Bond’s iconic amphibious Lotus, but suave millionaires can dive the depths of the ocean in their own two-seater submarine, which resembles a Ferrari. The diminutive sub can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 metres) so passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small enough to be stowed on a yacht.

"Lib Dem Care Minister Norman Lamb has been through the ordeal of his son being 'blackmailed' A minister last night told how he became drawn into a 'nightmare' blackmail plot over a video of his son taking cocaine. Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem Care Minister, had to call the police after his son Archie's flatmate demanded cash from him and sent threatening messages. He paid the lodger £7,500 to move out but says the man then tried to ruin Archie's career in the music business. Mr Lamb, 57, said: 'This man has a violent past. We were worried for our safety.' As his party unveiled the £1 billion boost to mental health services that Mr Lamb has campaigned for, the senior MP admitted his son has been through 'very dark periods'. Archie, now 27, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder at the age of 15 and has been on medication ever since. He went into the music industry, founding a record label called Takeover Entertainment and becoming an early champion of rapper Tinchy Stryder, who went on to top the charts. But his father said that Archie had also fallen in with a bad crowd, leading to the blackmail attempt. 'He's had amazing success and he's also had some very dark periods, and that led to him drinking too much and, as we understand it, getting into bad company and drugs,' said the North Norfolk MP. Mr Lamb added he was 'immensely proud' that his son had escaped from his problems and rebuilt his career, and bought him a London flat where he could find 'peace and tranquillity'. But then the alleged blackmailer, who is also thought to be 'the source' of the drugs that Archie took, moved in. Mr Lamb took legal advice on how to evict his son's flatmate and was told he should offer him £7,500 – money his son owed plus compensation for having to move out. Archie Lamb (left) with rapper Tinchy Strider. Mr Lamb said he is 'immensely proud' his son had escaped from his problems and rebuilt his career before the recent alleged blackmail attempt . Despite handing over the cash, the tenant refused to leave – 'and at that point I concluded we were being blackmailed and we had to go to the police,' Mr Lamb told the Sunday Mirror. He found out just last week that the man said he had a video appearing to show Archie snorting the Class A drug. 'This guy sought to blackmail my son,' the Minister said. 'We were confronted with threatening emails, text messages saying things like 'underestimate me at your peril'. We have been confronted by a criminal who has sought to blackmail us.' The Sunday Mirror said the former flatmate insists he was simply trying to recover money he was owed. Police are reportedly looking into the case. The senior Lib Dem referred to the issue when he took to the stage at the party's spring conference in Liverpool. He said: 'Before I begin my speech I just wanted to say a few words about . The senior Lib Dem referred to the issue when he took to the stage at the party's spring conference in Liverpool . a personal matter, something you may have read about or heard about this morning. 'My family has had our own experience of mental health problems, as our oldest son was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 15. 'It's something he has made a decision himself to be open about. 'This has been a very painful time for our family. As a parent you just want to keep your children safe, to look out for them and to know that they are going to be OK. 'But my family is not unique. Our experience has made me even more determined to bring mental health out of the shadows and to fight for better care for all of the families affected.' Mr Lamb, whose words were met with applause by the audience, added: 'Can I thank so many of you who have been so kind and supportive this morning. It is enormously appreciated, not just by me but by Mary my wife, and our whole family.'","Lib Dem Care Minister Norman Lamb had to call police after his son Archie's flatmate demanded cash from him and sent threatening messages .

"A new statue of Mahatma Gandhi in London’s Parliament Square was described as ‘a magnificent tribute’ by David Cameron after he unveiled it yesterday. The 9ft bronze figure marks 100 years since Gandhi began his peaceful struggle for India’s independence from the British. At the ceremony, a band played Indian classical music on sitars, the country’s flags festooned the square and schoolchildren stood in the crowd to watch. Prime Minister David Cameron meets with Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna, right, at Westminster . The statue of the Indian leader was unveiled in Westminster today by the nation's finance minister . Mr Cameron described Gandhi as 'one of the most towering figures in the history of world politics' Mr Cameron said: ‘This statue is a magnificent tribute to one of the most towering figures in the history of world politics – and by putting Mahatma Gandhi in this famous square, we are giving him an eternal home in our country. ‘Many of his teachings remain as potent today as when he first made them. ‘This statue celebrates the incredibly special friendship between the world’s oldest democracy and its largest, as well as the universal power of Gandhi’s message.’ The privately funded work, created by Philip Jackson, shows Gandhi dressed in a shawl and traditional dhoti skirt, with his hands clasped. Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, who helped unveil the statue, said: ‘How many countries celebrate the life work of a man who opposed it with vehemence for more than three decades? Not many.’ Gandhi stands opposite a statue of Sir Winston Churchill, who described him as a 'half-naked …seditious fakir'. The statue by Philip Jackson is located on Parliament Square, directly across from Winston Churchill .","David Cameron described Gandhi as 'a towering figure in world politics' The 9ft statue was unveiled on the 100th anniversary of Gandhi's campaign .

"Still the sweetheart: Dame Vera will be central to the festivities . Dame Vera Lynn is to play a central role in a long weekend of spectacular celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. The wartime singer – who will be 98 on Friday – is to be included in events to commemorate seven decades since the end of the Second World War in Europe on May 8. Ministers will today announce a three-day spectacular, including wartime-themed parties, the lighting of a chain of beacons, a veterans’ parade, an RAF fly-past and a 1940s-themed celebrity pop concert. Government sources said they were ‘pulling out all the stops’ for the commemorations – which start the day after the Election – because it is likely to be the last major anniversary to fall during the lifetime of Second World War participants. Although now too frail to travel to the events, Dame Vera – the Forces’ Sweetheart – will be consulted over the arrangements and is likely to provide either a written tribute statement or video message. Under the plans, a service of remembrance will be held at The Cenotaph on VE Day itself, including a two-minute silence at 3pm marking the moment Winston Churchill announced the end of the war. Schools will hold VE Day-themed assemblies or tea parties, and during the evening a chain of over 100 flaming beacons will be lit across the UK. On Saturday May 9, cathedrals will ring their bells in celebration and a 1940s-themed concert will be held at London’s Horse Guards Parade. The concert, to be broadcast live on BBC1, is expected to feature many of the stars who appeared in a similar 60th anniversary VE Day concert, such as the singers Katie Melua and Katherine Jenkins. May 10 will be marked by a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey, followed by a veterans’ parade which will pass along Whitehall and under the HM Treasury balcony where Churchill appeared before VE Day crowds. Couples celebrate VE Day - which marked the formal conclusion of Hitler's war  - in Trafalgar Square in 1945 . A reception for 2,000 veterans will be hosted by the Royal British Legion in St James’s Park, coinciding with a fly-past by a Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster. Dame Vera boosted the troops’ morale by performing songs including We’ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover at concerts in Egypt, India and Burma. Last night, she said: ‘I am sorry I will not be able to celebrate the 70th anniversary of VE Day in London in person, but my thoughts are with all who take part. We must always remember those who fought and all those who gave their lives on our behalf.’ A Downing Street source said: ‘Everyone wants Dame Vera to be involved if possible.’","Wartime sweetheart will join events to mark 70th anniversary of VE Day .

"Sunderland slumped to an embarrassing 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa in front of their biggest crowd of the season as disgruntled supporters tried to storm the home dugout. Head coach Gus Poyet insists he will not walk away after the result which leaves the Black Cats one place above the relegation zone. But it was an alarming performance which has raised serious questions over his future and that of Sunderland’s top-flight status. Sportsmail was at the Stadium of Light to witness their sorry display and brings you the merit marks which lay bare their shortcomings… . Gus Poyet can't bear to watch as his Sunderland side are dismantled by Aston Villa at the Stadium of Light . Costel Pantilimon 4 – Left exposed for three of the goals but was outwitted by Agbonlahor for crucial second which changed mood inside stadium.

Costel Pantilimon was at fault for the crucial second goal, which changed the mood in the ground . Anthony Reveillere, who looked off the pace throughout, is dominated in the air by Christian Benteke . John O’Shea 3 – The usually-dependable skipper was shambolic and will be wishing Republic of Ireland No.2 Roy Keane had not been in the stands.

John O'Shea (left) looks defeated as Benteke celebrates Villa's fourth goal before the interval . Wes Brown is shrugged off the ball all too easily by Gabriel Agbonlahor as he began to look his age . Patrick Van Aanholt 3 – Afforded little help by those around him but Villa soon realised the weakness in Sunderland’s side and attacked at will down the left, where Van Aanholt had no answer. Liam Bridcutt 4 – N’Zogbia ran all over him and the holding midfielder offered little resistance to wave after wave of Villa offensives. Ricky Alvarez 3 – No surprise to see him hooked at the break after a typically ineffective first half. Reports that an £8m deal is already agreed for the Inter loanee must be a worry for Sunderland supporters. Seb Larsson 4.5 – He ran about and gave his all but was involved in the bizarre incident at start of the second half where he failed to appear until the 49th minute. It was in keeping with the home side’s disastrous afternoon. The Sunderland defence can only stop and stare as Agbonlahor scores his second goal to make it 3-0 . Ricky Alvarez is set to join the club for £8.5million from Inter - he was ineffective again in the first half . Jack Rodwell 5 – It was arguably his best display in red and white, but there hasn’t been much to choose from. He at least got on the ball, although did little with it. Steven Fletcher 3 – Asked to man the left-hand side of midfield, it was a tactic which backfired spectacularly as Villa right-back Bacuna had a hand in three of the goals. Jermain Defoe 3 – Was anonymous and failed to pounce on the one decent cross flashed through the goalmouth by Fletcher. Jermaine Defoe was anonymous up front and missed the few opportunities that did come his way . Subs . Connor Wickham (on 46) 5 – The second half was nothing more than a training-ground exercise and, like the rest of them, Wickham went through the motions. Manager . Gus Poyet 2 – Started with just one up front against lowly Villa and stationed striker Steven Fletcher on the left-wing. It was a negative set-up and produced a negative performance. He insists the players are still on board with his message, but the evidence on the pitch suggests otherwise. Sunderland fans show their anger at the club's manager after Poyet's side were thrashed at home .

"Gus Poyet has vowed to fight on as Sunderland boss but says he understands supporters storming the dugout during their shambolic 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Disgruntled fans were prevented from getting to the head coach by stewards after the visitors raced into a four-goal lead before the break and a policeman remained close to Poyet until half-time. The result leaves the Black Cats one place above the relegation zone and with just one win in 12 matches. Sunderland fans attempt to storm Gus Poyet's dugout as the home side fell behind to Aston Villa . Stewards and members of Sunderland's backroom staff attempt to stop irate fans getting to the dugout . Poyet – who is now the bookmakers’ odds-on favourite to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job – concedes his position is under scrutiny and does not know if owner Ellis Short will demand to see him before the weekend is out. He does, though, insist he will not walk way. ‘That (quitting) is not in question. It would be too easy to blame everyone else,’ he said. ‘I am responsible. I am one of the few in football who is honest – I am responsible when we do well and I am responsible when we do not. ‘I hate people who pick and choose and have too many faces.’ Poyet has vowed to fight on as Sunderland boss but says he understands the supporters' frustration .

At least three supporters tried to break through stewards guarding the dugout and thousands more streamed for the exits after two-goal Gabriel Agbonlahor scored Villa’s third on 37 minutes. Christian Benteke headed his second and Villa’s fourth before the interval. And Poyet said: ‘I would do the same. It was quite alright. They did what they had to do, it was not acceptable. ‘It was probably the worst 45 minutes of my time here. I have no explanation for what happened in the first half. ‘I’m extremely disappointed and shocked.

Another fans is removed from the stands for his angry reaction to a woeful performance from Sunderland . Seb Larsson was in the dressing-room having treatment on a leg injury when the action got back underway and home fans soon sang, ‘We’ve only got 10 men’. Poyet, though, was angry when the comments of BBC pundit Chris Sutton were relayed to him after the game. ‘I saw something which accused us of being a pub team and Seb Larsson having a fag in the car park,’ fumed the South American. An angry Sunderland fan has to be held back as he vents his frustration at the Sunderland bench .

"Lewis McGugan would be open to signing a permanent deal at Sheffield Wednesday after manager Stuart Gray helped ‘put a smile’ back on his face. The attacking midfielder is on loan from Watford and has a decision to make in the summer, with one year left on his Vicarage Road contract. McGugan has scored three times and made four assists in his last eight games, setting up two goals in the dramatic late win at Rotherham on Saturday. Lewis McGugan has impressed during his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday in recent weeks . McGugan in action for Watford last season . ‘If Sheffield Wednesday and Watford can do a deal, then brilliant, but it’s up to the clubs. I can only concentrate on playing well on the pitch,’ McGugan told Sportsmail. ‘At this point in time I’m playing week in week out, I have a smile back on my face, and that’s the most important thing. ‘The manager has been fantastic for me, really straight. You know exactly what he wants from you. He gives you the platform to go out and perform and it’s up to you to repay the faith.’ McGugan says his spell at Hillsbrough has refreshed his enjoyment for the game after a difficult period at Watford under five different head coaches since joining in July 2013. He joined on a free from boyhood club Nottingham Forest and scored 11 goals in 37 games in his first season – but Gianfranco Zola’s departure in December of that campaign altered the scene. Giuseppe Sannino came in before resigning last August sparking three changes in quick succession. Oscar Garcia was forced to vacate the role on grounds of ill health after four games, Billy McKinlay was sacked after two, and Slavisa Jokanovic has since steered Watford into automatic promotion contention. ‘It was a chance to go and play under Gianfranco Zola which was a massive pull for me,’ said McGugan. McGugan says he went to Watford to play under Gianfranco Zola but was 'shocked' after the Italian left . Playing time limited, he made his first loan move to Wednesday last November and signed again in the winter window. ‘I could have easily sat there and seen what happens but you know when you’re not really in someone’s plans and I want to play football,’ he said. ‘Knowing this manager has 100 per cent faith in me to go out and perform can only build confidence. Hopefully I can have a strong end to the season and see what happens.' A number of clubs may be interested in McGugan come summer, and he did not rule out a switch back to Forest – even if sanctions limit his former club to loan deals. ‘You never say never,’ he said. ‘Nottingham Forest was a massive part of my life and career. I made my debut at 17 and I left at the age of 24. It’s where I’m from. But the most important thing I can do is concentrate on performing.’ McGugan has refused to rule out a return to former club Nottingham Forest in the summer .","Lewis McGugan has scored three and made four assists in eight games .

"Sunderland's Steven Fletcher has been blasted by fans after posing with his new £260,000 Lamborghini Aventador supercar while struggling for goals during the club's relegation battle. The £40,000-a-week striker, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral. The 27-year-old player, who cost his club £12million, was criticised by fans who said the car was ‘undeserved’ and the timing of the photo was ‘really appalling’, after it began circulating three days before his team lost 4-0. Aventador: Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral . Partner: Fletcher is pictured with his beauty queen girlfriend Rachel Monaghan, 22 . However, his agent Scott Fisher told the Daily Record that Fletcher had not put the image on Twitter - adding that it was the company who sold the supercar who posted the picture online. Mr Fisher said: ‘It wasn’t Steven that put the picture up. The company who were doing advertising on it done it. I don’t know what the problem is and what people are getting excited about.’ But Janet Rowan, from the Sunderland Supporters’ Association, said that ‘it was probably the straw that broke the camel’s back’ for low-income fans to see someone taking possession of such a car. She told the Daily Mirror: ‘We know footballers have these big flash cars. I just think the timing was really appalling and I can really understand the way that people have felt about this.’ The four-wheel drive Aventador, which sells for between £242,000 and £295,000, has a top speed of 217mph, will return 17.6mpg and can perform 0 to 62mph in 2.9 seconds. Seven goals in two seasons: Fletcher (left) vies for the ball with Aston Villa's Jores Okore (right) during his Sunderland side's 4-0 Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light on March 14 . Comparisons: Birmingham fan Michael Jabbari quoted a message from parody account BBC Sporf in a tweet, which said: 'Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador' In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter: 'Steven Fletcher has a Lamborghini, the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever.' Jack Liddell added: 'Tell me how Steven Fletcher (a striker) can score seven goals in two seasons yet have earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental.' Fletcher began his career at Hibernian in 2004, before moving to Burnley for £3million in 2009, Wolverhampton Wanderers for £6.5million in 2010, and Sunderland for £12million in 2012. But while he scored 52 goals in five years for Hibernian, 12 in one year for Burnley and 24 in two years for Wolves, he has struggled for form at Sunderland since signing. Fletcher scored 11 goals in his first season for the Black Cats, but only netted three last term - and has managed four this campaign. He has also played 18 times for Scotland, scoring once. Unimpressed: In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter that it was 'the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever' Disbelief: One football fan, John Tough, said he 'can't get over the fact' that Fletcher is driving a Lamborghini . Mystified: Jack Liddell posted a similar comment, wondering how Fletcher has 'earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental' Sunderland sacked boss Gus Poyet last week after the 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa, before his replacement Dick Advocaat led the team to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham United on Saturday. The club are now in 17th, one place and one point above the relegation zone, with their next fixture against Newcastle United in the 152nd Tyne-Wear derby this Sunday. Fletcher, who was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, spent his younger years at military bases as the son of soldier Kenny, before he died aged 38 after a battle with cancer. This occurred when Fletcher was just ten, which saw his mother Mary move them to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, to be closer to her family. After he had left home, she moved to County Durham and has lived there with his stepfather Martin, a Sunderland fan, for more than a decade. Fletcher moved to a £670,000 five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty queen partner Rachel Monaghan, 22, in October 2013, and they live there with their daughter Darcy-Mae, one.","Steven Fletcher has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland .

"A beautiful snowy owl has been captured scouring a snow-covered field  in the hunt for food. Her piercing yellow eyes were the only thing that stood out against the white landscape in Ottawa, Canada. Once locked on to a vole she swooped just inches above the surface waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson. A beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow-covered field in Ottawa, Canada, in the hunt for food, with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing . The 57-year-old said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill. 'Snowy owls are diurnal so they hunt and are active both during the day and night. 'When they are resting they often sit in a snow-covered field motionless, making themselves very hard to spot. 'When they are hunting they will perch on a lump in a field, a fence post, or a hydro-pole where they have a lookout from which to spot their prey.' As the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field . The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson who said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill' The owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow-covered floor, keeping her bright eyes on the prey . To get close enough to the owls, Mr Dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds. He said: 'Every winter I go out with my binoculars and scan the farmers' fields to see if I can locate wintering snowy owls. 'When I locate an owl I have to spend time slowly approaching it to get within a good distance to take photographs. When the owl got close enough she used her sharp talons to catch her prey. Snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat . Snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away . 'Some owls are much more approachable than others. 'Upon repeated visits the owls come to realise that I am not a threat and will ignore me, providing I move slowly, and carry on with its business.' Mr Dobson described the owls as 'one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. 'I think of them as snow ghosts or snow angels,' he said. 'They are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats. Happy with its work: Mr Dobson added: 'Snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. The beautiful bird is pictured after the hunt . 'They are powerful and regal and, to me, symbolise the Arctic.' Snowy owls fly silently when they hunt and often approach their prey from a low angle. They use their sharp talons to catch animals and will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat. Snowy owls tend to swallow their food whole and will return to hunt after eating.","Snowy owl captured finding food near Ottawa, Canada, by Rick Dobson .

"Minnie Minoso, who hit a two-run home run in his first at-bat when he became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died, the Cook County medical examiner said Sunday. The medical examiner's office did not immediately offer further details. There is some question about Minoso's age but the White Sox say he was 90. Minoso played 12 of his 17 seasons in Chicago, hitting .304 with 135 homers and 808 RBIs for the White Sox. The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 1983 and there is a statue of Minoso at U.S. Cellular Field. Remembered: Minnie Minoso (seen here in August 2013), who became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died . History: In a March 9, 1957 file photo, Chicago White Sox outfielder Orestes 'Minnie' Minoso poses in batting position at Al Lopez Field in Tampa, Florida . Starting out: Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. Minoso is seen with Lou Boudreau, right, and Larry Doby (on the left) in May 1949 . 'We have lost our dear friend and a great man,' White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said in a release. 'Many tears are falling.' Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. He made his White Sox debut on May 1, 1951, and homered in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Vic Raschi. It was the start of a beautiful relationship between the Cuban slugger and the White Sox. Minoso, regarded as baseball's first black Latino star, was a Havana native who spent most of his career in left field. He is one of only two players to appear in a major league game in five different decades. He got his final hit in 1976 at age 53 and went 0 for 2 in two games in 1980 for the White Sox, who tried unsuccessfully over the years to get the 'Cuban Comet' into baseball's Hall of Fame. 'When I watched Minnie Minoso play, I always thought I was looking at a Hall of Fame player,' Reinsdorf said in an informational package produced by the team for a 2011 Cooperstown push. 'I never understood why Minnie wasn't elected. 'He did everything. He could run, he could field, he could hit with power, he could bunt and steal bases. He was one of the most exciting players I have ever seen.' Saturnino Orestes Armas Minoso Arrieta was selected for nine All-Star games and won three Gold Gloves in left. He was hit by a pitch 192 times, ninth on baseball's career list, and finished in the top four in AL MVP voting four times. Despite the push by the White Sox and other prominent Latin players, Minoso has never made it to Cooperstown. His highest percentage during his 15 years on the writers' ballot was 21.1 in 1988. He was considered by the Veterans Committee in 2014 and fell short of the required percentage for induction. 'My last dream is to be in Cooperstown, to be with those guys,' Minoso said in that 2011 package distributed by the White Sox. 'I want to be there. This is my life's dream.' Minoso, who made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949, hit .298 for his career with 186 homers and 1,023 RBIs. The speedy Minoso also led the AL in triples and steals three times in each category. Playing in an era dominated by the Yankees, Minoso never played in the postseason. 'Every young player in Cuba wanted to be like Minnie Minoso, and I was one of them,' Hall of Fame slugger Tony Perez said. 'The way he played the game, hard all the time, hard. He was very consistent playing the game. He tried to win every game. And if you want to be like somebody, and I picked Minnie, you have to be consistent.' Minoso appeared in just nine games in his first stint with the Indians, but he took off when he was dealt to Chicago as part of a three-team trade in 1951 that also involved the Philadelphia Athletics. He went deep in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Raschi, and hit .375 in his first 45 games with the White Sox. Tribute: The White Sox shared an image of Minoso on Twitter Sunday (left). Flowers have also been left at his statue at U.S. Cellular Field (right) Minoso finished that first season in Chicago with a .326 batting average, 10 homers and 76 RBIs in 146 games for the Indians and White Sox. He also had a major league-best 14 triples and an AL-best 31 steals. It was Minoso's first of eight seasons with at least a .300 batting average. He also had four seasons with at least 100 RBIs. 'I have baseball in my blood,' Minoso said. 'Baseball is all I've ever wanted to do.' The White Sox uploaded a photograph of Minoso smiling and holding his jersey to the team'sTwitter on Sunday.

"Many people turn to sport when times get tough and pretty Amy Brown is no exception. When the 21-year-old suffered cruel taunts at school for gaining good grades and wearing boy's clothes, she took her frustrations out on the rugby field. From the age of 12, Amy, who lives in the Forest of Dean, played at least twice a week for her local club. Scroll down for video . Scrummy: Rugby-loving Amy Brown, 21, from the Forest of Dean is a finalist in the Miss England competition . Beauty and brains: Amy turned to the rugby pitch after her schoolmates teased her for being clever...she says that 'she's now having the last laugh' Nearly ten years on, Amy has blossomed into a young beauty, so much so that her friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant. Last month she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean, just in time for the Six Nations. Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June. Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, said: 'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses. 'For me, it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards. The closest I ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie. 'I never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam. Before I got into rugby I was bullied at school. Try! Amy turned out twice a week for her local side from the age of 12 . The 'boffin' has grown up: Amy now has a boyfriend, 22-year-old gym instructor Ben Jones . More comfortable in boots: Amy says that she had to practice 'loads' to walk properly wearing heels . 'I wasn't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me 'boffin' and 'ugly'. Even in my teens I didn't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling. 'It was a way I could get my frustration out but I really enjoy it. I'm in the second row so I'm in the thick of the action. 'I always get stuck in and I've got knocked out twice. I haven't got any cauliflower ears thankfully.' Amy, who has a long term boyfriend, gym instructor Ben Jones, 22, has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of Miss England. She added: 'I never thought I'd make it to the semi-finals of Miss England. It's been an amazing journey. 'Before the competition I'd never been on a cat walk. The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads. 'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.'","Amy Brown, 21, was teased at school for being a 'boffin'

"Ofcom is to canvas the views of thousands of football fans as it probes a complaint by Virgin Media about the way £1.7 billion-a-year Premier League football rights are sold to broadcasters. Armchair supporters and regular match-goers are to be asked for their views as part of the regulator's inquiry. Ofcom also said it would be looking at changes in the prices charged by broadcasters for sports channels. BT Sport share the rights with Sky to broadcast Premier League football throughout the season . The regulator is in the midst of an investigation after Virgin argued that the English top flight screened fewer live matches than other top European leagues, contributing to higher prices for pay-TV packages. In an update published on Monday, it said that its probe continued to progress with no decisions reached at this stage and that it was reviewing consumer research it had recently received from Virgin Media. It added: 'Ofcom will also carry out new consumer research, which will canvas views of fans who attend matches and those who watch them on TV. Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Carragher are part of the star-studded team Sky Sports employ as pundits . 'It will look at the value viewers place on watching the Premier League. We will also be monitoring changes in retail prices of sports channels as the investigation progresses.' The fans' research will build on views already sought from football bodies, clubs, fans' groups, broadcasters and policing organisations. Virgin had argued that the latest Premier League rights auction should be suspended as Ofcom probed the process, but the regulator declined and allowed the sale to go ahead last month. Virgin Media are unhappy with the way the Premier League sell their rights for such a huge price . It resulted in Sky and BT paying a combined £5.14 billion to screen top-flight games for the 2016-2019 seasons, a 70 per cent increase on the current deal. Ofcom said prior to the auction that there was no 'urgent need' to delay it and that it was carrying out its probe 'expeditiously' given that the auctioned matches will start to be broadcast from August 2016. It said it had the power necessary to alter broadcasting arrangements before this time, should its probe find there had been an infringement of competition rules.","Premier League fans to have the chance to give their views on the way football rights are sold to TV companies like Sky Sports and BT .

"A misfiring Rafael Nadal had trouble hitting the mark but the third seeded Spaniard still had enough to beat American Donald Young 6-4, 6-2 on Tuesday and advance to the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open. Nadal, a three-time champion at Indian Wells, looked out of sorts in a sloppy opening set slamming an easy overhead into the net to give Young an early break and then later double-faulting to hand over another. But the 47th ranked Young was no better at finding the target saving just two of eight break points as a fist-pumping Nadal walked off Stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden with the victory.

"Stuart Lancaster insists the Six Nations campaign proves England now possess the strength in depth to win the World Cup after they turned Twickenham back into a fortress. Lancaster’s squad won four matches out of five despite missing Lions stars Manu Tuilagi, Brad Barritt and Owen Farrell plus No 8 Ben Morgan for the entire campaign. With the likes of George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, George Kruis and Anthony Watson now blooded on the international stage, Lancaster believes England will enter the World Cup in six months’ time in rude health. Stuart Lancaster believes England's Six Nations exploits proved they have the squad to win the World Cup . England fell six points short of winning the Six Nations title despite a 55-35 win over France . ‘There has always been a huge sense of belief that we are going in the right direction,’ he said. ‘The challenges we faced with the injury situation leading into the Wales game didn’t dent that belief. From what I see in training we have a tight, connected group who are improving all the time. ‘Clearly we are still a bit young, light on experience, particularly in the back line. ‘That will improve with the likes of Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell and Manu being available, all of whom will be playing in the next few weeks we hope.’ England have beaten World Cup pool rivals Australia and Wales convincingly and with 82,000 fans producing another pulsating atmosphere at Twickenham on Saturday, Lancaster says belief will be sky-high when the tournament kicks off on September 18. Asked if England can win the World Cup, Lancaster was unequivocal. George Ford has impressed for England throughout their Six Nations campaign at fly half . England's Jonathan Joseph is challenged by France's Remi Tales during the match at Twickenham . ‘Yes, definitely,’ he said. ‘We’ve beaten Australia, we’ve beaten Wales, we’ve put 55 points on France. ‘New Zealand we’ve beaten before and pushed them close in the summer series. So, absolutely. ‘You saw the influence the crowd had on the players today. Playing at home is a huge factor as well.’ Lancaster now has four runners-up finishes in four Six Nations campaigns but has no fear his players will be psychologically damaged by another near miss. ‘The players’ mindset is to use it more as a motivation to make sure you don’t feel that pain again. The pain is deep. It does not create a scar.’ England were without the injured Manu Tuilagi for the entire of the Six Nations Championship . England captain Chris Robshaw echoed Lancaster's thoughts that they can be contenders for the World Cup . Barring injury, Chris Robshaw will captain England into the World Cup and he backed his coach’s assessment of their development. ‘We can be contenders,’ he said. ‘We are playing very well at home and have built a lot of momentum. And if you look at where all the games are, they are back here. ‘Look at the crowd, I think it was the loudest I have ever heard, including the two Six Nations games and when we beat New Zealand here — the place was rocking. ‘And that is what we want.

"This is the incredible moment an eagle soared from the top of the world's tallest tower to its owner on the ground in a record-breaking bird flight. The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa. It captured phenomenal views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates before landing on the arm of its trainer, falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers. Freedom Conservation, the group which organised the attempt, claim it is the highest-ever recorded bird flight from a man-made structure. The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa (pictured) towards the ground where it landed on the arm of its trainer . Darshan, a white-tailed eagle, captured incredible views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates during its flight, which has been hailed the highest-ever bird flight from a man-made structure, according to experts . The bird of prey captured phenomenal views on the Sony Action Cam Mini which was weighs about 300g and was attached to its back, before landing on the arm of its trainer, French falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers . The bird was released from the top of the world's tallest tower before making its journey to its trainer below . The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for more than 50 years, has previously flown from the top of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Eiffel Tower in France. Ronald Menzel, director of Freedom Conservation, said the organisation filmed yesterday's bird flight in an attempt to draw more attention to eagle conservation. He told the BBC: '[This] represents a historic opportunity for conservation – through these incredible images we are bringing this important cause to the attention of people all across the world.' In the clip, which lasts nearly two minutes, the bird takes off from the tower and soars over Dubai, allowing the camera to record stunning aerial views. The camera - a Sony Action Cam Mini - weighed approximately 300g, which is about 10 per cent of the bird's weight. Upon landing on the arm of its trainer, Mr Travers could be seen punching the air with joy before describing the flight as 'perfect'. He said: 'This was an incredible challenge and the most difficult of my career. 'Not only is this the highest vertical flight that has ever been done, but the eagle also had to fly in a totally different environment, with strong wind disturbances caused by the skyscrapers. 'This flight will create huge possibilities for future conservation programs. Freedom Conservation, organisers of the bird flight, prepare by bringing the bird up to the top of the tower .

The bird of prey can be seen perched upon the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa (right) as its trainer Jacques-Olivier Travers waits patiently at the bottom of the world's tallest building (left) for his beloved bird to return to him . Mr Travers, who became passionate about birds of prey when he was 12-years-old, waits for Darshan to land . Darshan the eagle swoops down and successfully lands on the arm of its owner, French falconer Mr Travers . Mr Travers punches the air with joy after Darshan lands on his arm after the 2722ft flight from the tower . 'Training and equipping birds of prey with these small cameras will allow us to understand exactly what a bird does when it is released into the wild, and will ultimately help our effort to restore endangered bird populations.' Mr Travers developed his passion for birds at the age of 12, after being given small chicks from a nest. He began training Darshan after selecting him from a breeding facility in Thonon, France. Last year, he completed several successful big flights with his bird of prey including one from the Golden Gallery at St Paul's Cathedral to the base of London's famous Tower Bridge. During the flight over central London in November last year, the eagle captured breath-taking footage of the capital and the River Thames with a high-spec camera mounted on its back. At the time, Mr Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected. For many years, I have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider.' Jacques-Olivier Travers (pictured with Darshan after the incredible flight) described the attempt as 'perfect' Views of Dubai captured by the imperial eagle will be used by the Freedom team to raise awareness of birds . The entire project was carried out by Freedom to try and raise awareness of birds of prey and extinction . Darshan the eagle has previously soared from the top of St Paul's in London and the Eiffel Tower in France . In another impressive flight just a month earlier, Darshan soared from the top of the 206-metre observation deck of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The bird was released from the inconic structure by its handler, before flying over the River Seine and down into the Trocadéro Gardens at 111 miles per hour. Darshan is a white imperial eagle, a bird which was once on the Red List of endangered species but has since been saved from extinction.","Darshan the eagle flew from top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa to trainer at bottom .

"Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson believes he can freewheel at Augusta this year because all the pressure will be heaped on Rory McIlroy as he goes for the career grand slam. Watson failed miserably the last time he was in the limelight as defending champion, only just making the halfway cut at Augusta in 2013. But the big-hitting American is convinced he can live up to his status as one of the favourites this time because all the attention next month will be focussed on the Northern Irishman. Reigning Masters champions prepares for Augusta by playing at the WGC Cadillac Championships in Doral . Watson insists that Rory McIlroy will be under more pressure than himself at the Masters . The world No 1 only needs an Masters crown to complete a full set of grand slams . ‘There’s no pressure on me because I have two green jackets already, but it will be different for Rory,’ he said. ‘To be going for the career grand slam and at such a young age as well, if that was me in his shoes I would consider myself under a lot of pressure because who would not want to complete that? I think the key for Rory will be to try to look at it from an achievement standpoint rather than a pressure situation – that he’s there because of the amazing feat of winning three of the four majors at aged 25. 'He can also think to himself that if it doesn’t work out this year, then at least he is going to have plenty more tries in years to come.’ Like McIlroy, Watson will complete his pre-Masters tournament preparations at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, which begins at Bay Hill in Orlando on Thursday. And the gifted leftie was full of praise for the world number one, predicting he will break many golfing records in years to come.

Phil Mickelson                    3 . Bubba Watson                 2 . (plus eight others on two) ‘What was I doing at 25? Just trying to keep hold of my PGA Tour card,’ he said. ‘And yet here’s Rory with all these tournaments he’s won already. With the talent he has, there are plenty of records he could beat as he gets older.’ Watson, of course, is not exactly short of talent himself. Twelve months on, people still talk about the pivotal drive he hit at the par five 13th during the final round at Augusta last year, that cleared the corner to set up victory – a carry of a mere 360 yards. ‘I did push it a bit,’ admitted the gifted leftie. ‘Lucky for me I hit it well and so it carried all the trouble, and I had just a sand wedge for my second shot and made birdie.’ Golf legend Jack Nicklaus holds the record with six Masters wins, the last coming in 1986 (above) He admits a touch of sadness that his second stint as Masters champ is coming to a close. ‘Anytime you can look forward to Augusta and you’re selecting the menu at the champions dinner as the defending champion, that’s a special time in the game of golf,’ he said. ‘My juices will be flowing, that’s for sure. I’m 36 now and sometimes feel old when you look at some of players on tour. But I’ll feel like a kid again when I get to Augusta. I always do.’","Bubba Watson will be bidding for back-to-back titles at Augusta .

"The International Cricket Council has described the remarks of its own president Mustafa Kamal as 'very unfortunate', and insists its umpires' 'integrity cannot be questioned'. Kamal put himself at the centre of a row over umpiring decisions which went the way of India in their World Cup quarter-final victory over Bangladesh in Melbourne on Thursday. India opener Rohit Sharma was reprieved as he neared his century when a no-ball was called because of the height of the delivery; then Bangladesh batsman Mahmudullah had to go when a marginal call came down in favour of boundary fielder Shikhar Dhawan, whose foot was ruled to be just clear of the rope when he took a catch at fine-leg. Shikhar Dhawan's catch of Bangladesh's batsman Mahmudullah during their quarter final proved controversial . Bangladeshi politician Kamal's ICC role is largely ceremonial since cricket's world governing body updated its constitution a year ago. He has nonetheless threatened to resign over the decisions taken by umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould in the match which finished in a 109-run win for India. Kamal implied the result was a foregone conclusion, and that world cricket is being run for the benefit of its superpower India. 'There was no quality in the umpiring. It looked like they took the field after it [the outcome] was pre-arranged,' he said. 'As the ICC president, whatever I have to say I will say it in next meeting. It could happen that maybe I will resign. There was doubt about whether the fielder had made contact with the boundary rope, but the decision stood . 'I cannot represent the ""Indian Cricket Council"". If someone has imposed a result on us, in that case no one can accept it.' ICC chief executive David Richardson has responded with an emphatic dismissal of Kamal's insinuations. He said: 'The ICC has noted Mr Mustafa Kamal's comments, which are very unfortunate but made in his personal capacity. Rohit Sharma was given a reprieve after being caught out off a no ball, and went on to make three figures . 'As an ICC president, he should have been more considerate in his criticism of ICC match officials, whose integrity cannot be questioned. 'The no-ball decision was a 50-50 call. The spirit of the game dictates that the umpire's decision is final and must be respected. 'Any suggestion that the match officials had 'an agenda' or did anything other than perform to the best of their ability are baseless and are refuted in the strongest possible terms.'

"Rory McIlroy needs Tiger Woods to play in the Masters to help ease the burden of expectation from his shoulders as he chases a career Grand Slam, says Paul McGinley. Ten years after that chip-in and his fourth - and last - Masters triumph, the world could be denied the latest episode of the Woods soap opera at Augusta National. Even if he declares ready to play next month, the 14-time major champion still appears plagued by demons, seemingly both mental and physical. But while some might think McIlroy stands to gain the most from not having to battle against the greatest golfer of his generation, there is a distinguished voice suggesting quite the opposite. Rory McIlroy (pictured) needs Tiger Woods to help ease the burden of expectation, says Paul McGinley . McGinley feels McIlroy could benefit from Woods playing in the Masters to help ease the expectation . Some might think McIlroy could gain from Woods's absence but others, such as McGinley, disagree . The man now being widely hailed as Europe's most astute Ryder Cup captain, when asked whether it will be easier for McIlroy if Woods plays the Masters, said: 'Of course. Look what happened at the US PGA last year, all the talk was ""is Tiger going to play, is he not going to play?"" Rory was favourite, but all the expectation, all the talk, was focused on Tiger. Rory didn't sneak in the backdoor, but he was able to go about his business without the attention on him.' Woods, nine months shy of his 40th birthday, will fall outside the world's top 100 when (or if) he gets to Augusta - his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20-year-old in 1996. McGinley admits he has been 'shocked' at the decline, particularly the horrid chunked chips that have raised questions of the yips. 'The intensity Tiger has given to the game does have an effect,' he said. 'Is there a little bit of burnout going on? There's a reason why guys don't play their best golf in their 40s and late 30s.' Woods has been plagued by serious back injuries but blamed his chipping issues on swing changes. McGinley thinks there could be more to it, however. 'My hunch would be there's something bigger going on. Rory is in the evolution towards his best golf. There's no doubt Tiger has peaked, in age times, and in terms of when guys normally play their best golf. 'That doesn't mean he's finished, but certainly he's, in Rory wording 'in the back nine of his career'. McGinley, the victorious Ryder Cup captain, speaks with  the media at Gleneagles in September 2014 . McGinley feels  McIlroy needs Woods to play in the Masters to take the pressure off of him . 'It's not just the wear and tear on your mind and body, having performed at a very high intense level with scrutiny like Tiger's had for 20 years. It's (the) mitigating circumstances - he's got two kids growing up and he's spending more time with them, he's going through a divorce and that causes issues too, and he' s in a new relationship. He's now got some business interests that are going through and designing golf courses that he never did before. 'So Tiger's focus and his evolution as a human being have moved on, and maybe that's one of the reasons why all of a sudden his focus is not here any more.' But while Woods's star is waning, his successor's is very much on the rise. Victory at Augusta would secure McIlroy's first green jacket - four years after his infamous final-round meltdown - and a seat among the golfing gods. At the age of just 25, McIlroy could join Sarazen, Hogan, Snead, Nicklaus, Player and Woods himself as only the sixth man to win all four majors. A five-time major champion he may be, but that is a huge amount of pressure on a still fresh-faced kid from Holywood, Northern Ireland. McGinley, however, is keen to point out that McIlroy is blessed with an exceptional maturity. Woods, nine months shy of turning 40, will fall outside the world's top 100 when - or if - he gets to Augusta . Woods faces his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20-year-old in 1996 . 'It's incredible how much he gets it, how mature he is for such a young guy. But he's had a lot of life experiences. Compared to me, Darren (Clarke) and Padraig (Harrington) when we turned professional, we hadn't travelled the world like Rory had. So he was ahead of the game when he turned pro, and he's just kept on improving. He's evolving and getting better and better.' Although McIlroy now wears Woods's crown, he is not yet a superstar like the American. The world is waiting to see whether McIlroy can claim his place in history, but it is desperate to answer the burning question: is Tiger really finished? 'I do hope Tiger comes back, we all hope Tiger comes back,' says McGinley, who will be at the Masters commentating for Sky Sports, the only place to watch all four days live. 'I don't know if he will or not, we'll have to wait and see.'","Rory McIlroy could benefit from Tiger Woods playing in the Masters .

"There is a small corner of north Manchester which can boast two mini sporting dynasties that continue to be remarkably productive. Most famously from Bury are the Nevilles, whose notoriety takes in the worlds chiefly of football and netball, together with Phil's England age group honours at cricket. And then there are the Crosses, who can field a West Ham United footballer, a Superleague netballer and two very accomplished cricketers, the youngest of whom is becoming a fixture in England's women's cricket team. Kate Cross is part of the seam attack for England's women's cricket team and helped them win the Ashes . Kate Cross is daughter of former Upton Park striker David, but has followed more the path of her brother Bobby, who was contracted to Lancashire. The first girl to gain a place at the county's cricket academy, she has progressed to becoming part of England's seam attack, and was part of the team that won the women's Ashes last year. 'We've got quite a few connections with the Nevilles, they live not far up the road from us,' says Kate, 23. 'Phil and Gary went to the school next to our house and my sister Jenny played netball with Tracey [who is now England's interim head coach]. My mum still plays netball in the same league as Tracey's Mum.' These days David is a scout for Blackburn Rovers, and while he is best remembered for his 99 goals with the Hammers, he is a lifelong cricket nut. 'My dad was able to play cricket at the beginning of his football career and towards the end. I am too young to have seen him play, but I did manage to play a game of cricket for the thirds at Heywood with him when I was 14.' Cricketer Cross (left) is the daughter of former West Ham United striker David (right) The Neville brothers Phil (left) and Gary, pictured here playing in 2005, are also from Bury . Tracey Neville (right) is a retired netball player and is pictured here at the 1998 Commonwealth Games . These are exciting times for young women getting involved in elite sports, as evidenced by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year team award to the England rugby team, ahead of competition such as Paul McGinley's Ryder Cup victors. The paying public are yet to be convinced in many instances, but there is a big drive to promote women's sport among governing bodies, backed by many in the media. But it was not always a fashionable cause, as the younger Cross daughter recalls when she was given a place in Lancashire's boys academy at the age of 15. 'At the time there seemed to be some mixed feelings about it in a few quarters. There were quite a few people set in their ways with their cricket who were saying she has taken the position of a boy. Because I would never play in the Lancashire men's first team they didn't see it as the right investment. 'Although there was a bit of negativity it gave me the realisation that I could go further with my cricket.' Priority given to the women's game has grown to the point where the national team are now on full-time contracts that also involve them doing promotional work for the sport with the Chance To Shine charity. Cross (left) is pictured here with Sportsmail's Mike Dickson at the ECB's National Academy at Loughborough . Cross is just back from a tour of New Zealand where England edged both the one-day international and Twenty20 series, with Cross in particular shining with the ball in the ODIs. Greater financial commitment in several countries is quickening up the evolution of the women's game. While Cross bowls her late outswing at around 70mph, and the very fastest in the women's game are in the mid-seventies, power and speed are on the rise. As Serena Williams has consistently shown with her serve in tennis, it is possible that women can propel a ball with similar power to men. 'I don't see it happening in cricket in the near future but I think it could happen,' says Cross. 'It starts as a young cricketer and if girls are now able to focus on cricket at an early age you will definitely see the speeds go up. 'Women's cricket has changed in the past few years, it used to be a lot more tactical because we didn't have the strength, but in the last few years we have really worked on that and power hitting. The England women's cricket team celebrate their Ashes victory at the WACA in Perth last year . 'It's more about boundaries. A few years ago it was more about hitting the gaps but we have got a lot stronger. I really noticed at the Twenty20 World Cup in March how much other teams are improving. I'm sure Deandra Dottin (the phenomenal West Indian hitter) can strike it as far as any man in the game. She is not someone you want to bowl at.' Cross and her fellow squad members are grateful for the financial support they get from the ECB that has allowed them to train full-time. But what about the argument that you cannot really be professional in sport unless people, or television companies, are prepared to part with money to watch? 'I've heard that said, and it's true that we certainly don't get the crowds the men get. But it has to start somewhere and the ECB have invested that money in us and hopefully our game will improve, and that will bring more crowds in. 'We sold Chelmsford out last year for a Twenty20 and got 2,000 at Wormsley for the Test against India. We get a bit lost at Lord's because it's difficult to pack the ground out. But I have seen a difference in the crowds we are getting, and it's different to Australia, who commented on how many came. When we played at the MCG there were about 200 spectators, which wasn't many in there.' Cross in action with the bat for England in a Test match against India at Wormsley last August . Her career highlight was her Test debut in January, when she helped bowl England to victory in the Ashes Test at Perth with 6-70 in temperatures that got up above 100F. 'I will remember that for a long time, one of the reasons we won the game was because we were more mentally prepared for the heat. I have never felt so shattered afterwards. We had won by lunchtime and went to a waterfront pub and I had some food at 4pm, and then it just hit me. I went to bed at 6pm and slept through until 9 the next morning.' She admits to not following women's sport a great deal, but wants to make sure that there are more names to look up to for the next generation. 'I really got into the Winter Olympics this year, watching athletes like Lizzy Yarnold. When I was growing up I looked up to Andrew Flintoff, and remember the 2005 Ashes. Hopefully in the future there will be more female names and role models.'","Kate Cross is the daughter of former West Ham striker David .

"Manor team principal John Booth has assured critics the marque will be on track and competing in the next Formula One race in Malaysia later this month. Resurrected from Marussia's ashes and wrested from the clutches of administration by energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, a reborn Manor headed to Australia for the season-opening race at the weekend with every intention of taking to Melbourne's Albert Park circuit. Although the cars passed crash tests and wider scrutiny, Manor failed to emerge from the garage even once as they ran out of time in a bid to rebuild their IT infrastructure, lost after all hardware was wiped days before a planned auction of the team's assets. Manor team principal John Booth is confident his team will race in Malaysia later this month . Although the FIA cleared Manor of a potential breach of the rules as they were investigated for failing to fulfil obligations to compete, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone was left far from impressed. Ecclestone claims Manor had 'zero' intention of taking part and has threatened to charge them for all freight costs which are borne by Formula One Management for all teams for every race. Despite that, when asked by Press Association Sport on Saturday after the team had failed to take part in qualifying whether Ecclestone was being kept in the loop about their issues, Booth confirmed that was the case. Manor drivers Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi are expected to compete in Malaysia . 'Bernie just misses nothing, does he? He has been kept aware at every stage of the process,' replied Booth. As to whether Ecclestone was supportive, Booth nodded and said: 'Yep.' The suggestion from sceptics was Manor were in Australia simply to lay claim to the £28million owed to them by Ecclestone in prize money after back-to-back top-10 finishes in the constructors' championship. Booth, however, dismissed the notion as he said: 'We're entered in the Formula One World Championship and we felt it important to be present in Australia and try and compete. The Manor team work on their car in the garage in Australia . 'I can understand people being cynical, but if that was the case we wouldn't have brought 30 tonnes of equipment, 40 people, fulfilled our contracts with all suppliers - Pirelli, Ferrari, whoever - with our best endeavours to go round and round a circuit.' Booth claims another day of behind-the-scenes graft would likely have been enough for the team to turn a wheel, underlining his confidence that Malaysia will hold difficulties. Asked whether Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi will be on track in Sepang on March 27 for practice, Booth replied: 'Absolutely. 'We're in a massively different place now than where we were at the start of last week. 'The progress was colossal, just not quite enough, but now we'll get to Malaysia on Monday, start setting up at the circuit on Tuesday, and for sure we'll be ready to run on Friday.'

"The Chinese football authority has announced plans to recruit a first batch of 120 foreign coaches by the end of 2015 to help teach pupils in primary and secondary schools, according to People's Daily Online. The news comes as a part of the 'Campus Football Promotion Campaign', which is widely understood as the country's effort to turn the nation into a football powerhouse by raising a generation of all-conquering young footballers. China's current president Xi Jinping is a massive fan of the game and is keen to see his country qualifying for another World Cup -- and ultimately winning it. Apart from importing coaching talent from overseas, the authority also confirmed that it is to make football a mandatory lesson in 6,000 selected schools as well as launching football leagues on campus from September this year. Pupils from a primary school in Luoyang (pictured) doing 'football exercise' between classes last week . The country's education authority has made football a compulsory part of the national curriculum . 6,000 primary and secondary schools in China have been chosen to specialise in football. In these schools, pupil will have one football lesson every week . The authority is also hoping to recruit and train 30,000-50,000 football teachers in 2015 across China . The series of new football-oriented education reforms were announced by Wang Dengfeng, Deputy President of Chinese Football Association, during an interview. 'The desired foreign coaches need to come from countries that are traditionally good with the sport, especially those who are particularly experienced with training youngsters,' said Wang, who is also in charge of the Culture, Hygiene and Arts section in the Ministry of Education in China. The first batch of 120 foreign coaches will be sent to 40 cities around the country. Wang stressed that they are not recruited to train professional football teams, but to teach ordinary schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools. Every pupil in China will be required to learn basic football skills such as 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . The country's Ministry of Education plans to build an army of local football teachers too. The expectation is to recruit and train 30,000 of 50,000 of them in 2015 throughout China. Outstanding retired athletes from the army will also be arranged to work as PE teachers, according to Wang. Professional football leagues will also be launched this year in all tiers of academic institutions, from primary schools to universities. Wang expects the leagues will create at least 290 champion teams from primary schools alone. China is aiming to complete its first set of football textbooks by the end of March. Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting the books . Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'Campus football competitions will be mainly organised by schools,' he said, 'and the aim is to cultivate public interest and to create a football culture.' The Chinese authority has already made football a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren. In normal schools, the sport will be a mandatory course for at least one semester during pupils' academic years; whereas in the country's newly established 6,000 football-specialisedd schools, schoolchildren will receive one football lesson every week. China's men's team. For a country of 1.37billion people their ranking of 82 does not sit well with Chinese fans . Additionally, 30 football 'experts' in China are working on drafting the country's first set of football textbooks. These textbooks will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP) and put to use from this September.

Henry knows all too well what relegation feels like having lost the battle to stay up when working under Terry Connor at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2012.

"The Harry Kane show continues at Tottenham. His first Premier League hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday ensured Spurs stayed in the hunt for a top-four finish. It's 29 for the season now. Will he score his first for England in the coming days? After another virtuoso display, in front of Roy Hodgson, he'll almost certainly be presented with his England debut. Tottenham striker Harry Kane scored his first ever Premier League hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday . Kane scores his and Spurs' third goal during the 4-3 win over Leicester at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino believes that Kane has kept his head on his shoulders . Harry Kane is the first Spurs player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Gareth Bale in December 2012. It's keeping your feet on the floor time for Tottenham's talisman after a fairytale breakthrough campaign. When he trains alongside Wayne Rooney and Co for the first time this week you'd forgive Kane if his ego inflates somewhat. However, his club manager Mauricio Pochettino insists there's no danger of Kane turning into a Big Time Charlie. 'I think he's a very humble person,' said the Argentine. 'From the beginning of the season I think he impressed us with his human side. His mentality is that he always wants to improve, he never complains. 'I think it's a perfect mentality to develop his skill. You can it feel from the beginning with some people, they're are humble and they improve. 'Kane has the right mentality. I think always our job is to try to improve our players but Harry Kane is Harry Kane because he's Harry Kane.' Kane's superb form for Tottenham this season has culminated in a first call-up to the senior England squad . If he scores again, Kane would be the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsman . Pochettino's chirpiness is likely to subside should his striker pick up an injury during the international break. Kane, obviously, will be vital to Pochettino as his side continue with their Champions League charge. Barring a miraculous dip in form or injury, Kane is virtually certain to become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsmann during the 1994-95 season. Surely individual honours await Kane, even if Champions League football doesn't. 'Can Kane win the player of the year? I don't know, I think Harry is today, a player who people prize a lot,' said Pochettino. Following his hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, Kane was awarded with the match ball . 'I think that this season Harry has a big impact in the English football. I think that he's one of the better English players so far. 'He works hard, he's improved his game and is always available in the training. Harry Kane deserves his moment. 'Am I worried about him picking up an injury on England duty? No, I think it's a very good thing for him. It's a very good moment to be in national team.' Pochettino, however, is concerned about the fitness of his goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who needed stitches in a knee wound following a hefty collision with team-mate Kyle Walker in the second minute on Saturday. Spurs medical staff will make checks on the wound this week but the injury will rule him out of France's games against Brazil and Denmark. Though the keeper's wife, Marine Lloris, eased fears that the keeper will face long spell on the sidelines by tweeting: 'Hugo needs to rest bit but he will be back really soon.'

"Inevitably, it all kicked off in the end. Three games in two competitions over 10 days has forged some barely disguised contempt between Celtic and Dundee United. Six red cards tell their own tale. For Jackie McNamara’s team, the frustration — and indiscipline — is growing. Ryan McGowan became the fourth United player to see red in the dying minutes, seconds after Celtic’s Anthony Stokes was dismissed for a retaliatory kick at Paul Paton. Afterwards, Ronny Deila rounded on the Australian, claiming he could have injured substitute Liam Henderson ‘for life’. The open wounds enveloping this fixture are now there for all to see.

Sent off: McGowan . Booked: Cierzniak, Rankin, Ciftci . Referee: Calum Murray . It is hard to see who will stop Scotland’s champions now. United will have a fourth attempt in the SPFL Premiership this weekend. Yet after losing the League Cup Final and crashing out of the Scottish Cup in this quarter-final replay, that prospect holds all the appeal of a cold-meat buffet with Jeremy Clarkson. Inverness Caley Thistle will make all the right noises before a Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden. Aberdeen believe their title aspirations are alive and well. Yet, Celtic are developing a habit of wrapping themselves around opponents and squeezing tight. For Deila, the fourth domestic Treble in this old club’s history is edging over the horizon. Jason Denayer’s 17th-minute headed goal was the platform for Leigh Griffiths to add a second on 57 minutes. Kris Commons thrashed the third high into the net 12 minutes from time before Virgil van Dijk tapped in from close range in the final moments. By then, things threatened to run out of control. Stokes had taken a kick at Paton and witnessed the flash of red. The crowd bayed for retribution against McGowan seconds later and were duly obliged by referee Calum Murray. In a freakish run of three consecutive meetings, United have now scored one, losing six. They return to Glasgow at the weekend a punch-drunk team blighted by suspensions, with former players Stuart Arsmtrong, Gary Mackay-Steven likely to return to the Celtic fray. It’s hardly a prospect to savour. Deila’s team began the game with a flourish and kept going. Nadir Ciftci, the United striker spared further punishment for a kick to the face of Scott Brown in the first game, felt the Celtic skipper’s robust retribution in all of six seconds. It was a forerunner for what was to come. For one heart-stopping moment in only the second minute, the visitors feared they might witness their latest red card in this fixture when keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak raced from his line to clatter Griffiths as he hared on to a superb Commons through ball. Griffiths had already lost control, the goalscoring opportunity gone. Referee Murray — rightly — contented himself with a yellow card. He would have the chance to flex his muscles later. Jason Denayer (centre) rises above the Dundee United defence to score the opener for the hosts . Denayer celebrates after putting Celtic 1-0 up in the Scottish Cup quarter-final . McNamara reshaped his defence in the absence of suspended duo Paul Dixon and Sean Dillon, fielding midfielder John Rankin as a makeshift, emergency left-back. The midfielder suffered a form of torture here. It made for painful viewing. James Forrest — finally free of injury and a scorer in last Sunday’s League Cup triumph — used his pace to offer Celtic width and speed. Even so, the home team had just one goal to show for 45 minutes of dominance at the interval. It came from a Calum Butcher foul on Commons midway inside the United half. Stokes — an improved performer since his recent disciplinary faux pas — floated the ball into a crowded area, Denayer planting a firm, looping header beyond Cierzniak for his fifth of the season. At Hampden, Celtic were loathe to build on their lead and possession. So it was here again. They had the chances. A Commons corner picked out van Dijk, the Dutchman’s firm header surging over the bar. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) is airborne as he puts his side 2-0 in front against Dundee United . Griffiths gives a salute as he slides across the Celtic Park pitch in celebration . Taunting and tormenting Rankin, Forrest then came close to scoring by accident. Putting his head down and surging for the byeline, his attempted cross dropped under the bar and was heading into the net until Cierzniak tipped over at the last. Another opportunity was passed up before half-time, a sclaffed Cierzniak kick out to Nir Bitton prompting a rare loss of composure in the usually unflappable Israeli. He had the chance to shoot, but opted to take on Callum Morris instead and lost the ball. United’s resistance was sporadic. They came close in 32 minutes after an outstanding incursion down the right flank by McGowan. The Australian made it unchecked from his own half to the Celtic byeline, his low centre aimed at Ciftci before Celtic keeper Craig Gordon managed — unconvincingly — to get a hand on the ball. Kris Commons (second left) scores Celtic's third goal of the evening at their home ground . Commons celebrates as Celtic go three up against Dundee United in the cup . Efe Ambrose, in that way of his, casually walked the ball clear from under his own crossbar. Celtic then began the second period in a ragged, loose fashion and that allowed the visitors their best spell of the game. In the opening five minutes, United summoned more attacking menace than they had managed in the entire first 45. Ciftci’s low, right-foot shot was pushed up in the air by Gordon as he retrieved another piercing ball across the face of goal from McGowan. But it didn’t last long. Until the 57th minute to be precise. Celtic scored with virtually their first effort on goal in the second period, Griffiths cleverly guiding a quite superb long ball from Brown past Cierzniak with a first-time effort from 12 yards. The outcome was placed beyond doubt 11 minutes from time. Commons blew a fine chance after a flowing passing move involving Darnell Fisher, Bitton and a Stokes cut-back. Last season’s Player of the Year — a scorer at Hampden last Sunday — dallied too long. Celtic's Stokes speaks with referee Calum Murray before he is sent off . Celtic's John Guidetti (second right) shows his fury as he comes together with McGowan . McGowan is sent off by referee Murray as both sides end the match with 10 men . Van Dijk scores with a tap-in late on to cap a successful night for the home side . But within seconds he atoned, playing a deft one-two with substitute John Guidetti before slamming the ball high into the net for 3-0. What came next was regrettable, but predictable. Two teams sick of the sight of each other began settling scores. Stokes took a blow to the mouth, drawing blood, and the Irishman took swift revenge as he lay on the deck. Off he went. Within moments, the scores were evened up when McGowan’s crude lunge at substitute Henderson sparked a melee at the corner flag. The former Hearts player went off after what Deila described as a ‘stupid’ challenge — with some verbals between the two as he left the pitch. And Deila’s players had the last word when van Dijk tapped in Denayer’s simple cut back from close range.","Celtic comfortably progressed to the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-finals .

"Lindsey Vonn won the World Cup downhill title for the seventh time after winning the last race in the discipline on Wednesday at the season-ending finals. Her seven downhill titles and her 18th crystal globe are both records for women. 'It's incredible after being out with two knee operations. It is just amazing to be sitting where I am today,' the American said. 'I'm so proud and happy, and I really have to thank the people that supported me and got me back to where I am now.' Lindsey Vonn won her seventh downhill title by pipping Elisabeth Goergl to the finish line . Vonn is delighted to be competing for major honours  after undergoing two knee operations . Vonn finished 0.24 seconds ahead of Elisabeth Goergl and 0.30 ahead of Nicole Hosp. Austrian racer Anna Fenninger finished second in the downhill standings. She trailed Vonn by 35 points heading into the race, and failed to make an impact on the Roc de Fer course, finishing nearly one second behind Vonn in eighth place. Vonn, who raced immediately after her, increased her speed on the bottom section to clinch a 66th career race win. She is the all-time leader in wins. Some fans near the finish held up banners saying 'Congrats Lindsey' as she raised her poles. Vonn finished the downhill season with 502 points, putting her 103 ahead of Fenninger. Tina Maze of Slovenia was third with 356. In the race for the women's overall World Cup title, Fenninger holds a 12-point lead over Maze. Vonn finished ahead of second-placed Anna Fenninger to win the downhill globe . Maze gained some ground on Fenninger by finishing fourth on Wednesday. Vonn, a four-time overall World Cup champion, is out of contention for the overall title this season. Vonn blew out her right knee in a super-G at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria. She hurt her knee again in her comeback, keeping her out of last year's Sochi Olympics. She went nearly two years without a victory before winning a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada, in December. The following month, she overtook Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup victories. 'I'm incredibly thankful to be holding another downhill title,' Vonn said. 'It's been a long two years coming back from my injuries.' Vonn looks extremely focused as she speeds down the course during the alpine ski . Vonn will battle with Fenninger again on Thursday when the super-G title will be decided. Vonn is eight points ahead of Fenninger. 'Tomorrow is a chance for another globe. It's going to be tough because Anna's skiing really well, and it's going to be soft conditions like it was today,' Vonn said. 'But something about this track suits me. I'll give my all, as I always do.' Fenninger has been in great form, winning gold medals in giant slalom and super-G at the world championships last month, and placing second in downhill behind Maze, who finished second to Fenninger in super-G at the worlds. Also, Kjetil Jansrud clinched the men's downhill title by winning the last race, too. The Norwegian finished 94 points ahead of Hannes Reichelt of Austria.","Lindsey Vonn is 'proud and happy' to be back following serious injuries .

"Alan Stubbs has lambasted Willie Collum over the referee’s role in the goal that sealed a 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road. The Hibernian boss was astonished that Collum didn’t award a free-kick after Lee Wallace appeared to foul Paul Hanlon as the centre-half sought to clear. Kenny Miller seized the loose ball and, with the home defence still appealing for an infringement, cracked home an 80th-minute shot that added to Wallace’s opener. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs speaks to the fourth official; he was unhappy with the referee's performance . Referee Willie Collum was on the end of some stick from Hibs boss Stubbs after their game against Rangers . Stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but couldn’t disguise his anger towards Collum, who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season. ‘Can I say no comment in case I get into any trouble?’ Stubbs opened. ‘I’ve been in management a short time. I was a player a long time. Over the years, that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time. ‘I think that’s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble. ‘Not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, 100 per cent. But a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently. Stubbs was sure that a foul on Paul Hanlon (right) would have been given '100 per cent' of the time . Stubbs (centre) watches on from the dugout as his Hibs side fell to a 2-0 defeat by Rangers . ‘When he sees it back again... well, there’s no point. He’s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very, very wrong. ‘There was no point speaking to him afterwards. Everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul. ‘I don’t want to sit here and try to justify a decision. Only one guy can do that, but he’s protected and not allowed to talk. It spoiled the game, although obviously not from Rangers’ point of view.’ Hanlon was booked for his protests towards Collum as Rangers celebrated Miller’ s first goal since December. ‘Most of the stadium felt it was a foul,’ said the defender. ‘I thought it was but the referee thought differently. Kenny Miller (centre) celebrates after his goal gave Rangers an unassailable 2-0 lead over Hibs . Miller is mobbed by the ecstatic Rangers supporters who had made the trip to Easter Road on Saturday . ‘I read the pass, got in front of Wallace and went to clear with my right foot. I just felt like I was taken out. ‘It’s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game. ‘I wasn’t given an explanation, he (Collum) just decided to book me for dissent even though I didn’t say much. ‘I just said it was a foul, along with everyone else who surrounded him. ‘I didn’t even think I was in his face but I think he just has to pick a player and book him.’","Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller scored as Rangers beat Hibernian 2-0 .

"Not content with second spot at FIFA's goal of the year award, Republic of Ireland women's forward Stephanie Roche has added another wondergoal to her collection. The 25-year-old came in just behind Colombia forward James Rodriguez's World Cup superstrike in the 2014 Puskas award contenders - and if this effort is anything to go by she could be walking FIFA's red carpet alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi again this year.

"Jenson Button firmly believes he made the right call in re-signing for McLaren despite the woes currently being endured by the team. Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen - standing in for the absent Fernando Alonso - will start Sunday's Australian Grand Prix from the back row of the grid in 17th and 18th positions respectively. Whilst not McLaren's lowest grid slots, in terms of performance and how far they are off the pace compared with the leading cars, it is the team's worst qualifying performance in their 49-year history. Jenson Button is pictured with his model wife Jessica ahead of Saturday's qualifying session . The Briton endured a miserable day at the office and was eliminated from qualifying in Q1 . Button was the best part of six seconds slower than reigning champion Lewis Hamilton, who went on to clinch the 39th pole position of his Formula One career. Button, who signed a new two-year deal with McLaren in December after he was kept waiting months on a decision as to whether he would be retained, has every faith McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda will get it right. The 35-year-old, however, has warned it will take time as he said: 'When I re-signed I was thinking long term. We're all thinking long term. 'It's unfair for us to sit here now and be harsh on anyone because this is a massive learning curve for us. 'This could be something great in the future, and that's what we need in the sport, someone to challenge Mercedes out front, and I really do think this is the team that can do that. Button insists McLaren have the tools to challenge Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes in the future . Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen will start from the final row of the grid in Melbourne tomorrow . 'I know we're a long way off right now, but it was always going to be very difficult. 'It's tough times and it's going to be for many weeks, but that is what is going to make us stronger in the future and hopefully build us into a winning team. 'Just don't expect us to gain two seconds at the next race, and then another two seconds. It's not going to be like that, but you will see progress.' Racing director Eric Boullier has confirmed McLaren and Honda know where the issues lie, and are working as fast as possible to rectify them. 'Actually we have fewer issues this weekend than we had in testing, which is the good news, we have made some progress,' said Boullier. 'Yes, there is a fix in place and we are working on a recovery plan, but as to time we don't know. 'We just want to do our best to recover as quickly as possible.'

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he is 'relaxed' about Raheem Sterling's contract situation despite claims that the latest discussions have failed to find a solution to a long-running impasse. The club have tabled what a couple of weeks ago Rodgers described as an 'incredible' offer - reported to be in the region of £100,000 a week. A few weeks before that the Reds boss had suggested an agreement was imminent but latest reports suggest there has been no movement in negotiations. Raheem Sterling has still not penned a new deal despite being reportedly offered £100,000-a-week . Reds manager Brendan Rodgers (left) insists he is 'relaxed' about the situation .

Sterling has been locked in talks over a contract extension for several months but the 20-year-old has told club officials he wants to focus on the remainder of Liverpool’s Premier League season and on winning the FA Cup. Given Sterling’s status as one of Europe’s top emerging talents, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are watching on closely. Likewise, Premier League clubs will also enter the race if it becomes clear Sterling is available. Nonetheless, Rodgers claims he is not overly concerned by the current situation. 'There is nothing new to report on it. I am quite relaxed about Raheem's situation,' he said. 'He is not going anywhere in a hurry - he has still got this season and another couple of years to go on his contract. 'I think it is quite obvious when you look at Raheem's situation anyone with Raheem's best interests would see Liverpool as the best option for his career. The Jamaican-born winger has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season . Rodgers had previously claimed that the club would not be held to ransom by the player's agent . 'He turned 20 in December and he has made 114 appearances, which is a remarkable amount at a club of this size to be given that opportunity. 'He has made it clear himself that he loves being here and I think he was quoted as saying this is the best place for any young player to develop, so that makes me quite relaxed. 'I am sure the club and his representatives will find the solution for that.' Rodgers has previously suggested the club would not be held to ransom by Sterling's agent and said the contract offer they had made was more than fair for a player of the England international's age and potential. Asked why he thought a deal had not been agreed yet, the manager said: 'I'm not sure. It is not in my area really. 'I speak to Raheem about his football and concentrate on his football and see what goes from there.' Sterling and Jordan Henderson, who has been captaining the side in the absence of the injured Steven Gerrard, are the two players whose contracts appear to be taking most of the headlines. Sterling trains with captain Steven Gerrard (right) who has recovered from a spell out with a hamstring injury . However, with Liverpool closing in on a top-four place and having one eye on a possible FA Cup final, it is imperative they do not allow off-field issues to distract them. Rodgers is confident neither player will drop their standards as he believes they are both focused on the job in hand. 'These are two players who want to ensure they are here for the future,' he added. 'The model of this club is to develop the talent and create world-class players and then, of course, it is important we keep those - especially when they are here already - and that is something we are working hard to do. 'The players are working well, they are concentrated, and that side of it they have to leave to their representatives and the club so we'll just focus on the football. 'It is never easy but there are players, with all due respect, in League Two and League One who are working on six-month or one-year contracts. Anfield captain-in-waiting Jordan Henderson (3rd left) is also yet to sign a contract extension . 'It is a lot more insecure at that level than it is at this level so I am sure they will cope fine knowing they have two or two-and-a-half years left on their deals.' Liverpool will have to watch the race for the top four develop without them this weekend as they do not play until Monday when they travel to Swansea. The squad has been boosted by the return of Gerrard from a hamstring problem which has sidelined him for seven matches while Martin Skrtel, after his head injury last weekend against Blackburn in the FA Cup, and midfielder Joe Allen are both fit. Defender Jon Flanagan has also returned to training after a long-term knee problem.","Liverpool manager is 'relaxed' over Raheem Sterling's contract situation .

Leinster flanker O'Brien grabbed two tries as Ireland thumped Scotland 40-10 at Murrayfield to claim back-to-back Six Nations titles for the first time since 1949. The 28-year-old backed up scores from captain Paul O'Connell and centre Jared Payne as Ireland denied England the title by virtue of points-difference. Sean O'Brien of Ireland celebrates with the Six Nations trophy after the 40-10 win over Scotland on Saturday . England saw off France 55-35 in a madcap Twickenham encounter, but fell foul of the triple-bill Super Saturday set-up for the second year running, six points short on the target set by Ireland. Happy to embrace hindsight with the title secure for another year, O'Brien believes defeat to Wales must now act as a harsh World Cup lesson for Joe Schmidt's men. 'Looking back now it might not have been the worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, of Ireland losing 23-16 in Wales to spoil their Grand Slam chase. 'We know we can learn and move forward. That was the biggest thing to come out of last week: that we didn't do our jobs correctly and we didn't do what we did during the week. Sean O'Brien of Ireland goes over to score the second try in a 40-10 win at Murrayfield . Ireland's O'Brien scores a try during the 2015 RBS Six Nations match at Murrayfield on Saturday . 'If we approach the game like we did today, for instance, make sure everyone is going 100 miles an hour, we know we are never too far away.' Ireland's third Six Nations triumph in six years tees head coach Schmidt's men up nicely for the autumn World Cup in England. Schmidt's impressive transformation of Ireland's fortunes raises hopes that his side can reach a first World Cup semi-final later this year. Head coach Schmidt's ultra-tactical approach came under fire after defeat in Wales, with Warren Gatland beating his Kiwi compatriot at his own game. Scott Williams goes over during the 23-16 victory over Ireland, which ended their Grand Slam challenge . Ireland rediscovered their attacking rhythm in Edinburgh however, their four tries against Scotland matching their previous tally for the entire tournament. O'Brien is adamant Ireland can play whatever brand of rugby required to get the job done under shrewd boss Schmidt. 'There has been a lot of talk about the style of play the last few weeks but defences in this competition are very strong,' said O'Brien. 'With analysis and what not, they are able to close people down and the quality of player and strength in depth, you have really good players playing against you. Captain Paul O'Connell holds aloft the Six Nations trophy after Ireland were crowned champions . 'You have to bring them to a place where they are under a lot of pressure and maybe we haven't done that in the last few weeks. 'But we can be very proud of ourselves today of how we approached the game and did our business. 'I wouldn't say it was a different style (against Scotland). 'We have been trying to play a bit like that the last few weeks but we haven't been, and we've let ourselves down at times with our own errors as well, letting teams into games. 'But we approached it the right way against Scotland, did our jobs, and it paid off.'

"Wolves kept their promotion hopes alive with a routine 3-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Bakary Sako's penalty and Benik Afobe's 27th goal of the season sent Kenny Jackett's side on their way as they kept in touch with the top six in the Sky Bet Championship. James Henry then added the gloss to a comfortable victory meaning Wolves have lost just once in their last seven games.

Tomasz Kuszczak saved well from Jacques Maghoma but Wednesday are left marooned in mid-table with little but pride to play for. Wolves made two changes as Scott Golbourne and Nouha Dicko replaced Kortney Hause and Henry, while Stevie May returned for Wednesday along with Maghoma and Marnick Vermijl. And the visitors threatened first as Atdhe Nuhiu and Tom Lees headed wide before Wolves took the lead in controversial fashion after 19 minutes. Dicko burst down the right and skipped past one sloppy Wednesday tackle but then went down under a soft challenge from Claude Dielna in the area and referee Simon Hooper gave a penalty. The forward looked to have fallen easily but Sako sent Keiren Westwood the wrong way from the spot for his 12th goal of the season. James Henry runs to the crowd after finishing off the scoring with a stunning effort after 67 minutes . Maghoma fired at Kuszczak as the visitors tried to respond before Westwood saved well after Kevin McDonald squeezed in behind the Wednesday defence. And the keeper had to be at his best again on 31 minutes when he turned Dicko's 20-yard effort wide. A minute later and Jack Price shot straight at Westwood as Wednesday were once again opened up, this time by the lively Rajiv van La Parra. The winger fired home from the edge of the area and gave Kieran Westwood no chance of saving it . But Kuszczak kept Wolves ahead 10 minutes before the break when he clawed away Maghoma's header. The Wednesday striker had been their biggest threat and he shot just wide after the restart before Nuhiu headed over. Wolves' slow start gave the visitors encouragement but the hosts doubled their lead out of nothing on 55 minutes. Sako (centre) was a danger throughout and scored the opener from the spot but could have had more . Matt Doherty wriggled free on the right and crossed for the unmarked Afobe to thump a volley in off the post from 12 yards. With that Wednesday crumbled and Henry made it 3-0 12 minutes later with a classy strike when he cut inside and curled into the top corner from 20 yards. It was game over but Wolves suffered a blow when Richard Stearman was carried off on a stretcher with 16 minutes left after appearing to go down under little pressure to dampen their night.","Wolves are three points off the play-off places with eight games remaining .

"Manor  had no intention of competing at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and will pay a price for their failure to race, Formula One's ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone indicated on Monday. The struggling British-based team, who emerged from the remains of the failed Marussia outfit after going into administration and missing the last three races of 2014, failed to turn a wheel on the track in Melbourne. They missed all three practice sessions and Saturday qualifying, blaming software problems, which ruled them out of the race. Manor mechanics work on their car in Melbourne, but they failed to take part at any point over the weekend . British driver Will Stevens has been named one of Manor's drivers this term, and Graeme Lowdon (right) However, they escaped punishment with stewards deciding to take no action after an enquiry decided the team had made 'all reasonable endeavours' to get their cars ready. 'We should have never ever, ever allowed Manor to do what they've done. It's our fault. I predicted this would happen,' Ecclestone said. 'They had no intention of racing in Australia. Zero. They couldn't have raced if someone had gone there with a machine gun and put it to their head. 'It was impossible. So they had no intention. We'll have to see now. And they will have to pay their way to get there and get out of there,' he added. Bernie Ecclestone has indicated that Manor will pay the price for their no-show at the season opener . Marussia, who were ninth overall last season thanks to a ninth-place finish by Frenchman Jules Bianchi in Monaco, won a race against time to get their cars through crash tests and onto the air charter for Australia. Ecclestone said there had been no charge for the freight because they were entitled to that providing they were competing. 'They are not competing so they have to pay for that,' he added. The team are in line for some £28million of revenues from last season but would have forfeited the right to that if they had not turned up to compete in Australia with cars that satisfied the regulations. 'We knew we had the possibility of unknown problems and we haven't had the benefit of sorting some of those problems out in pre-season testing,' sporting director Graeme Lowdon said. 'But equally we had to come here on the basis that we're racing so we brought all of our normal equipment. There's 28 tonnes of equipment to support these cars and all of the staff.

"Fans didn’t know what to do or where they should go. The final whistle went in Twickenham, Ireland were Six Nations champions for the second time in 12 months and after two absurdly dramatic hours the realisation dropped out of the Edinburgh night as suddenly as a falling star. The match in London had been such a frantic and joyous mess that nobody with a dog in Ireland’s fight dared to secondguess their emotions. When Nigel Owens brought 80-plus minutes of frenzied farce to a finish in London, the hundreds of Irish fans who had congregated around a big screen outside the Scottish stadium were stunned. For a while they did nothing but roar. Beer accounted for it in most cases, but their reactions were, shall we say, a deal less sharp than those of Luke Fitzgerald and Seán O’Brien earlier in the day. Ireland players celebrate as they are crowned Six Nations champions at Murrayfield . Captain Paul O'Connell holds aloft the Six Nations trophy after Ireland were crowned champions . It took supporters several minutes to stop screeching and turn and lurch back towards the stadium, where the presentation took place within ten minutes of the cessation in Twickenham. Events moved with the suddenness of a palace coup, and Ireland took the crown watched by 5,000 delirious countrymen and women who eventually scrambled back into the ground. It was dark night by now, but the inky gloom thrown by cold Scottish concrete didn’t bother them. They would have raised a party on Lough Derg. Eventually a camera caught the Irish players in the tunnel, in their suits but hugging and kissing as if the final whistle had just sounded on a cup final. They bounded on to the pitch, cheers poured off the south stand like water and they went to the presentation stage. There, Paul O’Connell lifted the Six Nations trophy high above his head and his colleagues leaped around him. The suits and the jubilation lent the scene the look of a Lotto celebration photo. But there was more to this than luck. Two bizarre hours had to be put in by Joe Schmidt and his team as England and France competed like a pair of boxers with big fists and no guard, but they had put in a couple of outstanding hours of labour themselves before then. The Irish squad celebrate their Six Nations success as fireworks are set off from within Murrayfield . Irish fans celebrate their side winning the Six Nations after watching England beat France 55-35 in London . They didn’t fluke their way to the nighttime joy that created a terrific racket in the well-appointed neighbourhoods around the home of Scottish rugby. They earned their right to truly unique celebration circumstances. These days become in memory an account of inevitable success. In years to come, when the events of Saturday March 21 are considered, it will seem like the outcome was irresistible. An Ireland title retention will in the telling become a certainty from early in the day. But in the bumpy, brittle second-to-second reality of a sporting contest like this, where every point must seem more precious than a gulp of oxygen, there are 50-50 splits throughout the game. There are incidents where the story of the day could be decided, a missed tackle, an ambitious break, a crooked throw. Little dramas mushroomed over the 80 minutes and you watched and wondered which one would eventually represent this taut and extraordinary Saturday: There was the early try of Paul O’Connell, playing arguably his best Test rugby at the age of 35, the lion roaring through winter. Seán O’Brien was not at his best in Cardiff but rumbled back to it here, and his first try was a triumph for the man but also for the coach as a variation on a lineout move Schmidt employed at Leinster befuddled Scotland. Sean O'Brien of Ireland goes over to score the second try in a 40-10 win at Murrayfield . As O’Brien crossed, the thought occurred that this moment combining personal triumph and coaching imagination might be the microcosm of the day. But the seesaw wouldn’t rest, and when Tommy Bowe was snared short of the Scottish line in the second half, it had the look of a memory that would cause fans to grind their teeth. An even more troubling portent recurred, and it was the nine points Ireland left unclaimed after two penalty misses by Johnny Sexton and one, with the last act of the match, from Ian Madigan. Ireland were harvesting big numbers against their helpless opponents but large totals are best gathered by letting no opportunity slip. In failing with those three kicks the Irish out halves were in danger of being trapped in history the way Denis Leamy has: This was truly Ireland’s greatest performance under Joe Schmidt Captain Paul O’Connell scored the first of Ireland’s four tries in Irish rugby’s historic day in Murrayfield, with flanker Sean O’Brien (pictured right with Johnny Sexton) crossing twice and Jared Payne also going over to end Welsh hopes of winning the title. Ireland players celebrate at the end of the match at Murrayfield before later being crowned  champions . O’Brien, who was named man of the match, said: ‘I think we executed very well and did all we could do – and hopefully it goes our way. It was important we came out and expressed ourselves. Driving into the ground and seeing all the Irish support put a chill up our backs. ‘We had to go out and stick to our process, try and win the game first and foremost and let the scoreboard look after itself.’ a substantial career reduced to a lapse. For Leamy, it happened eight years ago this month when he tapped a quick penalty under his own posts as Ireland were on a points’ hunt against Italy in Rome, in vain pursuit of the championship. The ball got turned over, Italy scored and France squeezed to the title. That cruelty would more likely be visited upon Madigan because he is the less experienced man, and has not put in the kind of trophy-laden service that Sexton has. He was in danger of being pointed out by the crude and the obvious as Ireland’s spoilsport, but there was none in green on Saturday. Ireland's O'Brien scores a try during the 2015 RBS Six Nations match at Murrayfield in Edinburgh . This was the outstanding performance by Ireland under Schmidt so far. It was better than the New Zealand match because it was more sustained. The two rivals cannot be compared, but the results can. Ireland lost to the Kiwis but they won here. Both matches were portraits in excellence but the work was completed on Saturday. The clock turned towards 8pm and outside the ground, a terrible singer with a guitar belted out awful songs. As Schmidt returned to the media room, the dismal troubadour was singing ‘Wish You Were Here’. He at least got that much right.","Ireland crowned 2015 Six Nations champions after dramatic final day .

"In the closing stages of the RBS 6 Nations’ greatest day, Ben Youngs played like a true champion. But that status eluded him once again — and he knew exactly why. England’s scrum-half had tormented France during the gloriously, bewilderingly compelling match which provided a pulsating finale to Super Saturday. But a fourth successive year as runners-up left the national team shattered, with their gallant role in epic sporting drama serving as meagre consolation. England fell just six points short of being crowned Six Nations champions . A 55-35 victory over France was not enough for England to overhaul Ireland at the top of the standings . And though Youngs had been the catalyst for a daring charge towards the unlikely target of a 26-point winning margin with his two tries, countless line-breaks and dashing creativity, collective disappointment eclipsed any personal pride. As participants and observers alike tried to make sense of a 90-point, 12-try edition of ‘Le Crunch’ which often defied logic, the devastated man of the match pinpointed why there were no medals around English necks. ‘I don’t think the Six Nations title was lost today, it was lost last week, when we missed too many chances,’ he said, in reference to the 25-13 victory over Scotland seven days earlier. ‘We should have been way ahead on points difference going into this game.’ Ben Youngs believes England lost the Six Nations title last week when they only beat Scotland 25-13 . England had many chances to beat Scotland by a bigger margin last weekend at Twickenham . Correct. It would have deprived a captivated audience of an absorbing spectacle spanning three high-octane games, but England could have made Saturday’s fixtures in Rome and Edinburgh all but irrelevant if they hadn’t squandered a raft of try-scoring openings in round four. If Stuart Lancaster’s men had merely needed to win, they would not have scorched the earth as they did time and again in front of a fervent crowd, but it is highly likely they would have secured their prize. Instead, they ran amok to amass a record total against their cross-Channel rivals, only to be left six points short and inches from glory as a rolling maul at the end threatened to bring the house down until referee Nigel Owens penalised the hosts to signal the dying of the light. After familiar English dejection and an outpouring of Irish euphoria as Joe Schmidt’s team retained their title on points difference, the inquests began at Twickenham. George North's inspired performance helped Wales to a 61-20 win over Italy to put them in with a shout . Ireland thrashed Scotland 40-10 at Murrayfield to overhaul Wales, and England fell  short in their response . Circumstances demanded an adventurous streak and the upshot was seven tries against opponents who had conceded just two in their previous four games. A torrent of quick lineouts and tapped penalties, heads-up running and off-loading made for a stirring sight but, while the real damage had been done a week before, there were also fresh faults. For all his evident pride, backs coach Andy Farrell will not have been amused to see England concede five tries at home, even though they had to go for broke. When Vincent Debaty rounded off a stunning French raid on the hour, Youngs wore a thunderous look. ‘They took their tries well but we’ve got to be better than that,’ he said. ‘It was one step forward, one step back. For every good thing we did, we weren’t able to keep backing it up. If we can be a bit smarter in defence, that is the way for us to play.’ England’s expansive approach was certainly effective and pleasing to the eye, but there was a period in the first half when they became too frantic, when a composed outlook would have told them to build a score patiently. Stuart Lancaster has seen his side finish as runners-up in the Six Nations for four years in a row . Still, criticism must be tempered in the context of a 20-point thumping of a French team which bore no resemblance to the rabble of previous weekends. For Youngs, there was irritation that their opponents had fought hard while Scotland and Italy had presented limited resistance to the other title challengers. ‘France turned up — I don’t know what happened to Italy or Scotland,’ he said. ‘We knew we were going to be chasing it and we did that. But it was shame those other teams weren’t a bit more resilient.’ France’s resilience brought out the best in several England players besides Youngs. Captain Chris Robshaw strove to carry the ball and the team heroically while James Haskell was in the sin bin for a rash trip in the second half. Billy Vunipola completed another 80 minutes of surging intensity and out wide, Jack Nowell had been peripheral early on but by the end he was rampant and had another two tries. England started their campaign with a morale-boosting win over World Cup Group A rivals Wales . English thoughts of ‘if only’ have become an annual routine and this year they have cause to lament the failure to cope with an aerial barrage in Dublin and their profligacy against Scotland. The second-half efforts against Wales and France represented their peaks and as Courtney Lawes noted, with the World Cup in mind they will take heart from recent wins over Pool A rivals Wales and Australia. Twickenham was loud and proud on Saturday evening and with five consecutive victories there, Lancaster’s side are enjoying a spell of home rule at just the right time. The performances of George Ford, Jonathan Joseph and Nowell have generated optimism, and while inside centre remains a problem position, in most areas there are now multiple options. The likes of Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury and Alex Corbisiero face a battle to reclaim lost places. As they stood in their post-match huddle, England were no doubt exhausted and demoralised. Finishing second again suggests they are stuck on a plateau but, in certain respects, this performance represented telling and timely progress.","England missed out on winning the Six Nations title by six points .

"At $450 a kilo Aizakura Wagyu beef is the most ­expensive meat ever sold in Australia. Aizakura Wagyu beef can trace it’s lineage back to the best beef in Japan which supports its hefty price tag and guarantee of quality. Called Aizakura H178, one 423kg carcass is now currently the only one available for sale and worth the huge amount of $190,000. Aizakura Wagyu beef is the most ­expensive meat ever sold in Australia . The Sunday Telegraph reports that Anthony Puharich will sell the prized cuts from Vic’s Meat Market in Pyrmont and Victor Churchill butchery in Woollahra. Victor Churchill’s Woollahra store sold all of its sirloin after just four hours into the first day of sale, adding up to about 20kg. One 423kg carcass is now available for sale and worth the huge amount of $190,000 . 'This one it hit the mark in every way shape and form,' head butcher Dennis O’Rourke said. Wagyu breeder David Blackmore and son Ben produce the high quality meat. They confirm that the carcass is the progeny of exceptional bloodlines and its origins can be traced back to Japan’s most famous cow - Kikutsuru from the Hyogo Prefecture, home of Kobe beef. Wagyu beef is generally best eaten as thinly sliced carpaccio .

"Cricketer David Warner has opened up about the emotional turmoil he feels every day as he continues to grieve over the devastating death of his friend and team mate, Phillip Hughes. Hughes was tragically killed in November 2014 in a freak accident during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG. Warner was by Hughes' side when the 25-year-old was struck in the head by a bouncer, resulting in a catastrophic head injury. Warner, 28, desperately tried to help the young batsman, holding Hughes' hand as he was taken from the field. 'When I got home after that day I was standing in the shower and I was sort of facing the wall with my hands on my head going: “why?” His fiance, former ironwoman Falzon, described her husband-to-be as a 'warrior' on the pitch but a 'softie' at home. Falzon told 60 Minutes that Warner has been 'truly inspirational'.

Warner has opened up about how he took to the pitch again just two weeks after Hughes' funeral . Four months after Hughes' distressing death, it's clear that the memories of the fatal blow and Hughes' final days are never far from David Warner's mind. 'The thought of coming off that day (at the SCG) holding his hand was…' Warner began, fading off as he was overcome with emotion during his interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes. 'It hurts every day when I think about it.' Warner says that he still can't comprehend that his mate lost his life whilst playing a game. ‘It’s hard to talk about it now; It was so hard to talk about it with Candice,’ Warner told Channel 9's 60 Minutes, speaking about his fiance. ‘I turned around to Candice and said, 'Why? Why does this happen? 'Why did this happen in a game of cricket?' Warner broke down in tears during the interview as he tried to explain the pain of his grief, with his devoted fiancée Falzon by his side to offer support. Warner admits that he still battles with Hughes' death, asking: 'Why? Why does this happen? Why did this happen in a game of cricket?' David Warner celebrates his century at the Sydney Cricket Ground against India by looking to the sky . The Australia batsman removed his helmet and kissed the ground after reaching 63 on January 6 . Best mates: David Warner (L) warms up pre match alongside Phillip Hughes (R) in June 2013 . Hughes was placed in an induced coma after his accident and his loved ones held a vigil at his bedside for two days, as the country prayed for a miracle that never came. Tragically Hughes died on November 26, just three days shy of his 26th birthday. Just two weeks after Hughes' funeral in his NSW hometown, Macksville, the shattered Australian cricket team travelled to Adelaide to face the unimaginable task of playing again. During the interview, Warner spoke for the first time about how it felt to step onto the pitch again so soon after Hughes' traumatic death. At a time when many doubted he could even face a ball, Warner scored an incredible 145 runs from 163 balls on the first day of the Test against India. ‘Looking into the sky, looking into the stands just brought a big smile to my face thinking “I’ve done it for him, I’ve done it for my mate,' Warner said with a smile. He looked to the sky and put his bat in the air in acknowledgement to his late friend too . A commemorative plaque to Hughes was unveiled before play began at the SCG on January 6 . Warner plays an attacking shot during his score of 101 on the first day of the fourth Test . Warner's accomplishment wasn't only an amazing feat for the sport but a moving display of raw emotion. However, the hardest test was yet to come. The fourth and final Test of the series was held in Sydney, meaning Warner had to return to the SCG and play on the same pitch where his beloved 'Hughesy' was felled. 'It is still difficult returning to the SCG,' Warner admitted to 60 Minutes. 'You take each step as it comes. But it just hits you even more, the closer you get to the wicket.' That day, January 6, was not only an incredible success for David Warner but a moving tribute. He scored an emotional century on the first day of the Test against India less than two months after Hughes had been struck. He holds his bat in the air and acknowledges the crowd after reaching three figures against India . Warner was visibly emotional as he walked out to bat, looking at the sky and talking to himself . A visibly emotional Warner crouched down on the pitch, removed his helmet and kissed the turf when he reached 63 - the score which his former team-mate and friend had been on before he died. Warner jumped into the air and looked at the sky after reaching three figures, acknowledging his fallen team-mate, as Australia played their first Test at the SCG since Hughes' death. It was a crucial step for Warner as he grieved the death of 'Hughesy' and learnt how to love cricket again. ‘I think sometimes you need to visit these things and the only way to face it is to come face to face with it.'

"Getting children to welcome a new baby into the home can sometimes prove difficult - especially when it wasn't the playmate they were hoping for.

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has urged Formula One's moaners to visit the Wailing Wall if they want their prayers answered on a change to the sport's regulations. Wolff was responding to the latest complaints from Red Bull team boss Christian Horner in the wake of Mercedes' crushing start to the 2015 season as Lewis Hamilton spearheaded a one-two in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Horner was left to reflect on 'a s***** Sunday' and the fear fans will turn off F1 after Mercedes' domination of the race at Melbourne's Albert Park . Nico Rosberg showers winner Lewis Hamilton after Mercedes finish on-two at Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton races to victory as Mercedes extend last season's dominance into the new campaign . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution . After winning the constructors' and drivers' titles for four years from 2010-2013, with Sebastian Vettel at the helm, Mercedes have taken up the mantle of F1 powerhouse. Having won 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors' crown, and with Hamilton clinching his second championship, the start to the new year was a breeze for Mercedes. Hamilton beat team-mate Nico Rosberg by 1.3secs, with Vettel third on his debut for Ferrari but 34.5secs off the pace. Predicting 'a two-horse race at every grand prix this year', Horner has called on the FIA to act to prevent an F1 yawn, and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given Red Bull's success. 'When we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - I remember double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was prohibited, engine mapping mid-season was changed,' said Horner of the steps taken to negate his team's performance. Red Bull's Christian Horner has complained about Mercedes, despite his team winning four consecutive titles . Horner claim that leaving Hamilton and Rosberg to fight it out for the title is unhealthy for the sport . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . 'Anything was done and that wasn't just unique to Red Bull, but Williams in previous years and McLaren, etcetera. 'Is it healthy to have this situation? The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at. 'Mercedes, take nothing away from them, they have done a great job and they have a good car, a fantastic engine, and two very good drivers. 'The problem is the gap is so big you end up with three-tier racing and that's not healthy for Formula One. 'The FIA have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise I fear the interest will wane. 'I didn't see Mercedes much on the TV and I can only imagine that's because it's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race.' Referring to the fact Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony, Horner added: 'The highlight for me was to see Arnie on the podium!' Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger interviews Hamilton after his winning start to the season . Responding to the call for equalisation, Wolff said: 'If you come into Formula One, try to beat each other and perform at the highest level and then you need equalisation after the first race - you cry out after the first race - that's not how we've done things in the past. 'I think 'Just get your f****** head down, work hard and try to sort it out'.' Quickly clarifying his remark, Wolff added: 'I didn't mean the f-word in relation to him (Horner).' Asked whether he feared another political season, Wolff replied: 'It is always a political season. It was last year and it is this year. 'There is this wall in Jerusalem that you can stand in front of and complain. Maybe the guys should go there.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067 . 2.

"A father has been accused of blowing marijuana smoke into the mouth of his infant child, police said. Christopher Kling was detained after officers were allegedly shown a smartphone video of him breathing the fumes into the baby's mouth. Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the home of the 22-year-old's estranged wife in Beaverton, Oregon, just before midnight on Sunday. Christopher Kling, 22, has been accused of blowing marijuana into the mouth of his infant child .

"An Oklahoma sheriff deputy's backflip and mid-air twist have made him the internet's newest star after a video captured him performing stunts while dunking on the basketball court. Deputy Erik Gransberg was on duty at a local high school's fundraising assembly when he captured the spotlight and a standing ovation. The audience at Edmond Memorial High School first see the basketball coach pass Gransberg the ball as an invitation, only for him to throw it right back. Scroll down for video . Oklahoma sheriff deputy Erik Gransberg has become the internet's newest viral sensation after a video captured him performing mid-air twists and backflips on a basketball court . For his stunt, the deputy runs for a trampoline set up near the net. He then executes a perfect twist in the air as he throws the ball to the court's floor . A student who was running behind Gransberg then jumps off the trampoline and grabs the basketball mid-air before he successfully dunks it . The assembly's MC pleads 'come on, officer' and the coach tries one more time. This time Gransberg, still in his uniform, accepts. For his first stunt Gransberg runs across the court and jumps on a trampoline set up near the net. He throws the ball against the backboard as the coach runs up behind him, catching it and making a perfect dunk. The crowd cheers, unaware that what they had seen was just the deputy's warm-up. Gransberg then corresponds with a student player and, after a shake of hands for good luck and a wave to the crowd for some support, he's off. The deputy runs again for the trampoline, jumping off it to execute a perfect twist in the air as he throws the ball to the court's floor.

"A video emerged today that claims to show Oscar Pistorius playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal. The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder. The disgraced sprinter, who was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has struck up an unlikely friendship with the Czech fugitive since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria. In the 90 second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves. Kickabout: A video emerged that claims to show Oscar Pistorius (white T-shirt) playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal, seen here taking on the role of goalkeeper in a penalty shoot-out . Enjoying some freedom: The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder . Wide of the mark: Pistorius's shot misses the goal and hits a door instead. The double-amputee was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 . Incarcerated: The disgraced sprinter has struck up an unlikely friendship with Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir (right) since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria . The footage, shot from above on a mobile phone reportedly by a convicted robber, was published today by South Africa's Daily Sun newspaper. The pictures appear to support recent reports that the double-amputee has slimmed down dramatically since his incarceration four months ago amid fears of poisoning by other prisoners. According to jail sources, the shamed athlete is surviving on tins of baked beans, pilchards and an African vegetable dish called 'chakalaka' bought at the prison tuck shop after spurning his rations. Wearing trainers, grey shorts and a white, unbranded T-shirt that appears to swamp his lean frame, the 28-year-old's thin arms protrude from its sleeves. The images are in stark contrast to the muscle-bound track star who made history at the London Olympic games by competing against able-bodied athletes. During the day, Pistorius is required to dress in the regulation orange jump suit which is issued to all inmates at the jail. Fun and games: In the 90-second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves . As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete . But according to a spokesman for the jail, he is entitled to dress in sports gear for his hour of daily exercise. As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete. Although in the video Pistorius appears to move easily on his prostheses despite his obvious drop in weight, during his long murder trial, his doctor told the court of the pain the fallen sprinter suffers a result of wearing artificial limbs that fit poorly as a result of weight loss. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population. For the purposes of their football game, the doors provide make-shift goal posts and Pistorius shows himself to be useful in goal, deflecting the older man's attempt to score by blocking one shot with a prosthetic leg. At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand. In apparent deference to his opponent, the Paralympic gold medalist is seen moving a concrete-weighted pole and plastic bag out of the way in order for Krejcir to have more room to take aim at the goal. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population . At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand . When it is his own turn to take penalties, Pistorius strikes hard, but hits one of the door 'goal posts', before sprinting off to reclaim the ball – clearly relishing the short burst of speed. Prison chiefs are mindful of the threat to Pistorius's safety at the massive jail, where gangs dominate prison life and sexual and physical violence is the only means to progress up the gangs' chain of command. He spends much of his day isolated from other prisoners, but Krejcir – despite his links with violent crime – is obviously perceived to pose no danger. Last month, MailOnline exclusively revealed how Pistorius had been re-classified to a low-risk A category prisoner, entitling him to greater freedoms and privileges behind bars, including 'contact' visits, a radio and the freedom to wear jewelry. The Daily Sun newspaper, which received the footage from a prisoner inside the jail, quoted an unnamed inmate who complained that Krejcir and Pistorius were getting preferential treatment because they are both white. The paper reports that Pistorius is given mineral water, fresh fruit and tea for breakfast - treats that are not afforded to other prisoners and prepared only for him. 'We are all in prison and we must be treated the same. The colour of your skin should not be a passport to get on the sweet side of the law,' the prisoner told the paper. The noise of the prison, which houses 7,000 inmates, can be heard on the video soundtrack, drowning any exchanges between the two men.

Pistorius is being held in the hospital wing of jail . Grim: Prison officials search an inmate's cell. Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep (file picture) Krejcir, currently on trial for kidnapping, attempted murder and drug dealing, appears to enjoy the yard knockabout. The Czech fugitive is facing a long incarceration as a prisoner on remand, with a number of outstanding cases against him. Detectives said it would take years to wrap up investigations into the Czech's links with the criminal underworld including murder, drug trafficking, robbery and fraud. Krejcir currently has three court cases running against him, but as an unconvicted prisoner is entitled to greater privileges than his neighbour on the hospital wing. Krecjir's latest charge involves the murder of a Lebanese national who was shot more than 30 times when he stopped at a traffic light in Johannesburg 18 months ago. News of the unlikely friendship between the two was revealed when Krejcir wrote a letter to prison authorities complaining that a treadmill and exercise bike – that he trained on alongside Pistorius –had been removed from the corridor outside his cell. Krejcir used a false passport to move to South Africa seven years ago and has been linked to the unsolved murders of, among others, a luxury car exporter, the owner of a string of strip joints and a known drug dealer. Victim and killer: Model Reeva Steenkamp died after Pistorius fired four shots at her through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day two years ago . In 2013 he survived an attempt on his own life which involved remotely-operated guns which had been hidden - 007-style - behind the number plate of a parked car. In December, the double-amputee's brother told South Africa's YOU magazine how the athlete had hoped to begin a basketball training programme for inmates, many of whom suffer from ill health due to HIV, Aids and TB. According to Carl, Pistorius had requested a donation of basketballs from his family in order to set up the project after applying for permission from prison bosses. In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29 year-old Mrs Steenkamp at his home on St Valentine's Day 2013. The double-amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. However, the state has appealed Pistorius' acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete's own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. The next hearing in the case is due to take place on Friday.","Video appears to show the killer athlete having a kickabout in prison yard .

"Diego Costa has been ruled out of Spain's upcoming matches against Ukraine and Holland with a hamstring injury. The Chelsea striker was substituted with 15 minutes remaining during Sunday's 3-2 win at Hull and Spain on Tuesday announced that he would return to the Premier League club for treatment during the international break. A statement on Spain's official website read: 'Diego Costa, left the premises of the Spanish Football Federation this morning after undergoing several tests with the medical services of the RFEF. Diego Costa has been ruled out of Spain's matches against Ukraine and Holland with a hamstring injury . Costa was taken off with 15 minutes to play during the win away at Hull City on Sunday afternoon . 'The striker has suffered a level 1 hamstring tear on the biceps femoris of the left thigh, which was previously already noted by the medical services of his club.' The statement continued: 'Diego Costa will return to Chelsea FC where he will undergo the corresponding medical treatment.' The 26-year-old scored his 20th goal of the season with a wonderful curling effort to put the Blues 2-0 up on Sunday, but he hobbled off before Loic Remy came off the bench to secure the win for Jose Mourinho's side. The Chelsea boss said afterwards that extra care has to be taken with his star striker when it comes to his hamstring. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho bemoaned Costa's fragility, dating back to last season . 'When a striker is playing, the team needs a goal to win the game and with 15 minutes to go the striker, a guy with a lot of experience of hamstring injuries, says ""it is over for me"", then it is over for him,' Mourinho said. 'He has this problem. He tried to play the Champions League final for Atletico (Madrid, last season) and was injured again and again and again. He has this fragility.

"Ander Herrera says Lionel Messi was so good  against Manchester City, it almost made him cry. Messi was mesmerising in last week's Champions League last 16 tie at the Nou Camp, and the Manchester United midfielder says watching the world's best player at the top of his game made him emotional. Herrera also revealed that captain Wayne Rooney is the joker inside United's dressing room, but admitted that he has to keep the conversation away from boxing, for fears Rooney might hit him. Ander Herrera, one of Manchester United's star players on Sunday, tackles Liverpool's Adam Lallana . Herrera says watching Lionel Messi against Manchester City almost made him cry with joy . The Manchester United midfielder says he needed time to adapt to life at United, because he is 'earthly' 'The last time I cried?' he said, when asked in an interview with Spanish paper El Pais. 'I almost cried watching Messi against Man City. He's so good! But anyway, I get emotional very easily. But hey, I get excited easily and not only with the major teams. I'm a classic man and I was delighted when we played vs Yeovil Town in front of 8,000 standing people yelling at me: ""Who are you?"" 'There's only one Messi and one Ronaldo, where the club must adapt to them. The rest of players are earthly so I must adapt to United.' Herrera also made reference in the interview to the recent scandal involving United captain Rooney, who was videoed boxing in his house with former team-mate Phil Bardsley. Herrera was asked about the sense of humour in the dressing room, and said it is better with Spanish players . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney insults the Spaniards in their own language, according to Herrera . 'The jokes here are different,' said Herrera. 'Rooney is outgoing and insults us in Spanish. I'd rather talk to him about football because he likes boxing and could try it with me.' However, he was also clear that respect for Rooney is high, insisting that 'I just listen to Rooney and Carrick before games'. 'There is a lot of respect for Rooney and Carrick,who spent many years here, because you see that it is very difficult to do. 'But David De Gea says the dressing room used to be more hierarchic with Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.' Herrera says Michael Carrick is one of the main leaders in the Manchester United dressing room . The Manchester United star, who played a beautiful pass to Juan Mata for his side's first goal on Sunday at Anfield, also praised English football for the patience of its fans, and the high standard of refereeing. 'The Premier League is the best place to succeed because people are patient. In Spain there's more stir around you from press or fans. 'There's a lot of respect for referees in England. Now I thank (former Athletic Bilbao manager Marcelo) Bielsa for telling me referees are a helpful instrument for football.' Herrera, who scored against Yeovil in the FA Cup, compared the game to Barcelona's Champions League tie .","Ander Herrera says Lionel Messi was so good it made him emotional .

"A yoga teacher who nursed her boyfriend after he suffered a stroke had to flee Britain when he started bombarding her with abusive letters. Alessia Avellino, 42, said her relationship with 51-year-old Paul Bijl broke down after the stroke four years ago completely changed his character. But Bijl still often sent her letters and text messages calling her a ‘c***’ and ‘whore’, forcing Miss Avellino to flee her flat in St John’s Wood, north-west London, to her native Italy . Ex-boyfriend: Alessia Avellino (left) said her relationship with Paul Bijl (right) broke down after his stroke . She told the London Evening Standard: ‘He looked the same after the stroke but had become someone else. I couldn’t handle it. It destroyed me. I cried myself to sleep every day.’ Miss Avellino, who is also an artist and has exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts, said Bijl ‘went bananas that I had left him’ and would shout at her in front of other people. She withdrew a harassment case after he promised to change, but then called police when the abuse became ‘relentless’. Bijl has since admitted harassment at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. The Westminster resident was sentenced to six months of community service and handed an indefinite restraining order, but Miss Avellino stressed that he is ‘no monster’ and ‘needs help’.

"A video has been released which appears to show Wayne Rooney being knocked out cold by former Manchester United team-mate Phil Bardsley. The Old Trafford captain and the Stoke defender pulled on gloves during a night-in at Rooney's Cheshire mansion last month - but Bardsley's wife Tanya dismissed the incident as a joke. With only a small space in which to work in Rooney's lounge, the pair trade light blows for just under a minute before Bardsley sends Rooney reeling. The England striker lies motionless under a chair for several seconds before the video, obtained by The Sun, cuts out. Wayne Rooney, a big boxing fan, posted this picture on his Instagram with professional boxer Paul Smith . Phil Bardsley's wife Tanya  moved to defuse the furore by claiming the video had been a joke . 'Wayne had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that,' a source told the newspaper. 'He made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed, not moving. 'People were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage. 'Everyone realised it was a stupid thing to do, but they just got carried away.' Bardsley's wife Tanya later hit back at the furore caused by the release of the video. She tweeted: 'Seen the sun, 2 mates havin a laugh video doesn't show Wayne jumping straight up and laughing with Phil #cleveredit.' The video is believed to have been filmed on February 22, the day after United lost 2-1 at Swansea. Rooney is wearing a pair of white Adidas gloves while Bardsley pulls on a pink pair. They appear to be sparring gloves rather than the smaller, less padded sets worn in professional fights. Neither man has a headguard on and while Bardsley is wearing shoes, Rooney is in his socks. After touching gloves, they circle each other before Bardsley throws a left hand. Rooney paws back without connecting. Bardsley is the more aggressive throughout, and tries to go for Rooney's body, pushing him back. The pair separate but again Bardsley comes on strongly, landing a right uppercut. Rooney tries to respond but misses wildly before his former team-mate bides his time and throws the shot that sends Rooney backwards, narrowly avoiding a chair as he hits the deck. The incident could leave Rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from United chiefs over his choice of extra-curricular activities. Given he skipper's United, the forward is a regular for Louis van Gaal's men. And the United manager is unlikely to be impressed with Rooney for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training.

VIDEO Van Gaal refuses to discuss 'ridiculous' Rooney story . Former Birmingham and Sheffield United midfielder Curtis Woodhouse - who swapped football for boxing and became the British super-lightweight champion - saw the funny side of it, posting on Twitter beside two pictures of himself boxing and playing football: 'Some can, some think they can?? Rooney... not everybody can do it!!! it's not as easy as I made it look.' When asked by one Twitter user whether he would consider fighting Rooney for charity, Woodhouse replied: 'When he wakes up maybe'. Rooney comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high-profile bouts. Speaking seven years ago, Rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career. 'I think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer, especially breaking through to the Premier League at such a young age,' he said. 'I needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me. It made it easier to play than it might have been and it's helped me with the way my game is now. 'All through my life - from the ages of six, seven and eight - when big fights were on television, I used to stay up with my dad to watch them. 'I've always loved watching boxing and I went boxing training for about three or four years when I was younger. It's a sport I've always been involved in. 'I was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when I was about 15. But Everton who I was with at the time, said I had to concentrate on one of them and I opted for football.'

"Chelsea captain John Terry praised the character of his Premier League-title chasing team to bounce back from conceding a two-goal lead to beat Hull and enter the international break on a high. Draws against Paris St Germain - a result which ended the Blues' Champions League participation - and Southampton may have knocked confidence. And when Hull came back from going 2-0 down after nine minutes to draw level at 2-2, Chelsea had to dig deep to win 3-2 through Loic Remy's strike. John Terry praised Chelsea's character after recovering from allowing Hull back into the match against Hull . Terry and Nemanja Matic celebrate with Eden Hazard after the Belgian gave Chelsea an early lead . Terry talks to the Chelsea players after Diego Costa put the Blues 2-0 up at the KC Stadium . It leaves Jose Mourinho's men with a six-point lead and a game in-hand on second-placed Manchester City. 'The importance of the win showed on the players' faces and that of the manager afterwards,' Terry said. 'When you set the standard so high as we have done from the word go, then start dropping points at home and go out of the Champions League, once again it comes back down to character. 'It's immense in the dressing room, there is an awful lot of experience in there. It will serve the younger lads well, too. 'It was an important three points going into the international break. For everyone to dwell over that for two weeks was massive.' Terry and his team-mates applaud the Chelsea fans after beating Hull 3-2 on Sunday . Jose Mourinho looks disgruntled after watching his Premier Leaders throw away a two-goal lead in first half . Mourinho reflected on a commanding advantage which he hopes will help Chelsea win a first Premier League title since 2010. 'It's the best position since the beginning of the season,' Mourinho, who is chasing a third Premier League title, told Chelsea TV. 'The maximum points (advantage) we had was eight points and when we had eight points we were speaking about 20 matches to go. 'In this moment we have six points (advantage) with one match in hand with 24 possible points for our opponents. 'We know our opponents are there, we know football is very unpredictable, we know that what is happening to us for the last two or three months we cannot control. 'But we also know that we are strong, we are together and we are going to fight to get the points we need to be champions.' Hazard jumps for joy after his fine strike put Jose Mourinho's side into the lead in Hull . Diego Costa doubled the visitor's advantage with a fine curing effort past Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor . Mourinho was referring to the incidents, such as in the draw with Southampton, which he believes denied his side more points than they earned. The win at the KC Stadium was Chelsea's third in seven games. The Blues had followed the Capital One Cup win over Tottenham at Wembley with victory over West Ham, but had been frustrated since. Now Terry hopes his Chelsea team-mates can return from the international hiatus reinvigorated and ready to carry the momentum from the Hull win by claiming a first home win since February 11 against Everton. 'The title race is exciting,' the former England defender added. 'There is still an awful long way to go. We have Stoke at home and QPR away next, which is always a tough one for us. Loic Remy's scored the winning goal for Chelsea moments after coming on as a second-half substitute . Ahmed Elmohamady netted Hull City's first goal to give them a route back into the match at the KC Stadium . Abel Hernandez capitalises on Thibaut Courtois' mistake to get Hull City back on level terms . 'Hopefully everyone will come back fit after the break and go again. 'But it's important we get back to winning at the Bridge because it's something we haven't done for a few weeks.' Remy was being readied to play alongside Costa at Hull, but had to instead replace the striker, who picked up a hamstring injury. It was the France striker's fourth goal of a season which has seen him given limited opportunities, mainly off the substitutes' bench. He told chelseafc.com: 'It is true it is frustrating sitting on the bench but the manager knows all the team and he has very good quality in the squad. 'I know there are only 11 players on the pitch and as soon the manager needs me I am here. 'It's one of my best moments at Chelsea. I hope I will have more moments like that before the end of the season.'","Chelsea beat Hull 3-2 at the KC Stadium on Saturday in the Premier League .

"Police are continuing to question a man arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence (pictured) Police are continuing to question a man arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence as they finished searching a house linked to his arrest. North Yorkshire Police arrested the married 59-year-old yesterday in connection with Miss Lawrence's disappearance in 2009. He remains in custody this morning and later today police will have to make a decision on whether to charge or release him, or will need to apply for extra time to question the suspect. Officers have been combing a semi-detached home in a quiet York cul-de-sac as part of their investigations, and a spokesman said the search of the property concluded last night. A spokesman said yesterday that Miss Lawrence, who was 35 when she went missing, had not been found. Her parents, Peter and Joan, were told about the arrest shortly before it was made public and are being supported by trained officers. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, has urged people not to identify the arrested man, who is from the York area, for fear of compromising the inquiry at what they describe as a 'critical phase'. He said: 'To ensure the investigation and legal process are not compromised or potentially damaged in any way during this critical phase in seeking the truth about Claudia's disappearance, North Yorkshire Police strongly advises the media and members of the public against identifying the man who has been arrested. 'This includes naming or publishing images of the man on traditional media platforms or social networking sites. 'I urge everyone to show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important inquiries.' Scroll down for video . The father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York. Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of the city, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. Officers have been combing a semi-detached home in a quiet York cul-de-sac as part of their investigations, and a spokesman said the search of the property concluded last night . An officer searches the front garden of the York house yesterday as part of the police investigation . Police search the front of the house in York. The man arrested in connection with Miss Lawrence's disappearance remains in custody this morning . A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said he was 'actively pursuing new leads' and that his team had made 'significant progress' since the force began reviewing the case in 2013. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef. The arrest came days after police released previously unseen CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive. The footage, released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance, was taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of the missing chef;s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder. As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him. Police appealed for information to identify both men and the arrest came five days later. Miss Lawrence's father, Peter, said yesterday: 'Any progress is good. It is encouraging to know that, following all the media activity over the last three weeks, from Claudia's 41st birthday to the sixth anniversary of her being missing, North Yorkshire Police continue to be active in seeking answers as to what has happened to Claudia. 'It is to be hoped that the matter can be resolved as soon as possible and I encourage people to continue to come forward with information to the police.' Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009 . Previously unseen CCTV footage released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance is shown on a digital advertising vehicle close to her home last week . Jen King, one of Miss Lawrence's closest friends, said: 'Everyone wants closure, but they have already arrested two people and got nowhere.' Neighbours in the quiet cul-de-sac in a middle-class neighbourhood were surprised by the police activity. One said: 'I know him, I've lived here for 20 years and he's just a normal bloke. He's lived here longer than me.' The neighbour said he had recently lost his job working as a manager for a large firm. Miss Lawrence returned home from work on Wednesday, March 18, 2009, and spoke to her parents separately on the phone that evening. She has not been seen since. Her father reported her missing on the Friday. Despite a huge investigation police have failed to find a single clue to explain what has happened to her. The suspect being questioned was one of many men who were spoken to at the time of the original police inquiry because he drank in the same pub as Miss Lawrence. The landlady of a different local pub, who also knows the suspect, said yesterday: 'He said the police spoke to him at the time, but he always made light of it. He said the police went to his house. He is a really funny, really nice guy who reads loads of books. He was very witty.' Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or www.crimestoppers-uk.org .

"Frustrated Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was left to reflect on 'a s****y Sunday' and the fear fans will turn off Formula One after Mercedes' domination of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. After winning the constructors' and drivers' titles for four years from 2010-2013, with Sebastian Vettel at the helm, Mercedes have taken up the mantle of F1 powerhouse. After winning 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors' crown, and with Lewis Hamilton clinching his second championship, the start to 2015 was a breeze for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg finished first and second respectively at the Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton races to victory in Melbourne as Mercedes dominance of Formula One rolls on . The two Mercedes team-mates celebrate their winning start to the new season with some champagne . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . Hamilton beat team-mate Nico Rosberg by 1.3secs, with Vettel third on his debut for Ferrari, but 34.5secs off the pace. Predicting 'a two-horse race at every grand prix this year', Horner has called on the FIA to act to prevent an F1 yawn, and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given Red Bull's past success. 'When we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - I remember double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was prohibited, engine mapping mid-season was changed,' said Horner of the steps taken to negate his team's performance. 'Anything was done, and that wasn't just unique to Red Bull, but Williams in previous years and McLaren etcetera. 'Is it healthy to have this situation? The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at. Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between 2010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat was forced to retire early in what was called a 's****y weekend' by Horner . 'Mercedes, take nothing away from them, they have done a great job and they have a good car, a fantastic engine, and two very good drivers. 'The problem is the gap is so big you end up with three-tier racing and that's not healthy for Formula One. 'The FIA have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise I fear the interest will wane. 'I didn't see Mercedes much on the TV, and I can only imagine that's because it's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race.' Referring to the fact Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony, Horner added: 'The highlight for me was seeing Arnie on the podium!' Horner's comments were borne out of exasperation at the job power-unit supplier Renault have done since the system came into force at the start of last season. The hope was Renault would have closed the gap to Mercedes over the winter, but instead they appear to have fallen further steps back. Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger interviewed winner Hamilton after the race in Australia . The former governor of California raises a smile from third placed Sebastian Vettel now of Ferrari . An angry Horner, who saw Daniil Kvyat retire on the formation lap with a gearbox issue, said: 'It's been a tough weekend and a very tough weekend for Renault. 'The engine is quite undriveable and you can see and hear that from the comments the drivers are making. 'They need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly because it's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in Abu Dhabi in both power and driveability.
