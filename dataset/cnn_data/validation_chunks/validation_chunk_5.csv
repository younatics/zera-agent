"(CNN)A Russian property developer, a Chinese outfit operating shell companies and Venezuelan officials ripping off the state-owned oil companies -- all of them are accused of coming to a bank in the European principality of Andorra to ""wash"" their money. Now the U.S. Treasury is casting a spotlight on the alleged misdeeds of senior managers at the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA), several of whom have been arrested in the past few days. The Treasury Department has alleged that ""high-level managers [at BPA] accepted payments and other benefits from their criminal clients."" The Andorran authorities took over the running of the bank after the Treasury revelations, and the director general of the Banca Privada, Joan Pau Miquel Prats, was arrested late Friday. Two more bank officials were arrested Sunday. Tiny Andorra, nestled in the rugged Pyrenees mountains, has two big neighbors. One is France. And the scandal has spread to its other neighbor, Spain, where corruption among public officials is a hot-button political issue. Prats had driven BPA's expansion into Spain, through its acquisition of Banco Madrid, in 2011. Banco Madrid caters to wealthy private clients and came under investigation by Spanish financial authorities last year. Since the BPA scandal broke, the commission that investigates illicit financial activity, Sepblac, has raised questions about accounts held by influential Spanish political and business figures at the Banco Madrid. They have not been named. The Central Bank has taken control of Banco Madrid and sent in two inspectors to examine accounts there. The bank's board, which included Prats and a former high-ranking official of the Central Bank, resigned on Thursday. Spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined. Spanish authorities are separately investigating substantial assets held at the Banca Privada d'Andorra by members of the Pujol family, who have long been prominent in the politics of Catalonia, a region of Spain that includes Barcelona. The director of the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said that ""BPA's corrupt high-level managers and weak antimoney laundering controls have made BPA an easy vehicle for third-party money launderers to funnel proceeds of organized crime, corruption and human trafficking through the U.S. financial system."" BPA has correspondent accounts with four banks -- HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank -- through which hundreds of millions of dollars passed. Senior managers at BPA tailored services to their clients to disguise the origin of funds, the Treasury said. One manager provided ""substantial assistance"" to a Russian client, Andrei Petrov, described by the Treasury as a ""third-party money launderer working for Russian criminal organizations."" Petrov had also received a line of credit from Banco Madrid and is alleged to have bribed local officials in the resort where he set up a property development company. He was arrested in Spain two years ago and is accused of helping launder some 56 million euros ($59 million) in proceeds from Russian criminal organizations. Petrov is yet to go on trial. According to the U.S. Treasury, Petrov has links with one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, Simeon Mogilevich. BPA is also alleged to have helped Venezuelan money launderers siphon funds from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. ""This money-laundering network worked closely with high-ranking government officials in Venezuela, resident agents in Panama, and an Andorran lawyer to establish Panamanian shell companies,"" the Treasury said. BPA processed about $2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme. Treasury said another senior official at BPA accepted bribes in return for processing bulk cash transfers for a Chinese money launderer, Gao Ping, who was arrested in Spain in September 2012. ""Through his associate, Ping bribed Andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in China,"" it said in a statement. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has reacted to the growing scandal by downgrading Andorra's rating. Andorra is highly dependent on its banking sector, which makes up some 20% of its GDP. Spain has long battled the presence of Russian organized crime on its soil. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, wealthy Russians came to Spain for its climate and what were then lax financial controls. Among them were more than a few ""vory v zakone,"" the top echelon of Russian organized crime, according to Spanish officials. Spanish prosecutor Jose Grinda Gonzalez told U.S. officials five years ago that these individuals had no known jobs and unknown sources of income, yet they lived in large mansions. Grinda's remarks were reported in a diplomatic cable later published by WikiLeaks. Grinda had prosecuted Zakhar Kalashov, a Georgian-born, Russian citizen widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Russian mafia. Last year, before he completed his nine-year sentence, a Spanish appeals court deported Kalashov to Russia, where he is now a free man. Another Spanish prosecutor, Fernando Bermejo, told US officials in 2009 that there was large scale money-laundering going on in Catalonia and ""many, many"" members of the Russian mafia were active there. Because of growing international cooperation, Spanish prosecutors have stepped up their pursuit of alleged gang leaders, money launderers and embezzlers from Eastern Europe. Among the latest to be detained is a former finance minister from Ukraine, Yuriy Kolobov. He was detained at a luxury development in Alicante earlier this month, after prosecutors in Kiev charged him with embezzlement and is awaiting extradition. Kolobov was a minister in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Ukraine during street protests a year ago.

"(CNN)Five Muslim women stand tall in a boxing ring, slowly winding strapping around their hands. A spotlight is trained on them and the audience draws close, hanging on their every word. ""How can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame, feel humiliated for feeling, for saying, doing, thinking as we please? How can that be freedom, how can that be truth?"" Performed at Southbank Centre's WOW -- Women of the World Festival -- Common Wealth Theatre's ""No Guts, No Heart, No Glory,"" tells the true story of Muslim female boxers from Bradford in the north of England, and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers. The critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp, dance, shout, swear, punch, and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by Ambreen Sadiq, a former UK national champion, and one of Britain's first Muslim female boxers. Her journey to success wasn't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother. ""I got bullied quite a lot growing up, my dad's Pakistani and my mum's Portuguese,"" Sadiq told CNN. ""I got stick from both sides, from white and black people. I felt like I wasn't accepted. I used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted. ""People would stay stuff about how I looked... everyone said that's a boy's sport, what are you doing that for? You're going to look like a man, like a transsexual. ""I was bullied from such a young age, I felt like it was never going to stop. Boxing helped me to control that anger."" It was a transformative experience for Sadiq -- she went from being quiet, having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations, and thereby build self confidence. ""Instead of punching someone in the face I'd punch the bag,"" she added. ""If anyone came up to me and said anything I could just walk away from it -- whereas before I'd just straight punch them in the face or something. So it's helped me a lot with discipline."" It's sometimes hard to imagine Sadiq as a boxer -- her movements are calm and assured, and a kind smile is never far from her lips. ""Boxing has made me the person I am today, and I'm so proud of the person I am,"" said the 20-year-old trailblazer, who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps. ""I've had a lot of girls -- not just Asian girls -- coming up to me and asking, how do you stop people saying it's a boy's sport? How can you convince your parents to let you box?"" While boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and Muslims participating it can feel more like a cause, with Sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls. ""What's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes? When we're in that ring we look like boxers -- we don't look like a girl or a boy. ""You come into that gym, you come into that show, you come into that ring thinking I'm a boxer, not that I'm a girl or I'm a boy."" The role of Nicola Adams -- the first ever female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal -- has also been key in the fight for acceptance. Sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach Alwyn Belcher, who also worked with Adams, originally refused to train women -- that is, until he turned up to coach the GB team (believing they'd be men) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work. ""That's the day he met Nicola Adams,"" recalls Sadiq with a laugh. ""He said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen."" Since Adams' success at the Olympic Games, females boxing once a week increased by 79% according to a 2013 Sport England study, but even the production of ""No Guts, No Heart, No Glory"" highlighted the barriers women potentially face. Cast member and aspiring medical student Freyaa Ali said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show, but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives. ""It wasn't even the boxing and it wasn't even the speech, it was the dancing we do in the ring. I'm incredibly lucky to be able to do this, and I was just so sad for her. You know there are certain women out there who can't do what we're doing right now."" ""I think that's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this."" If women do feel restricted by their religion or gender, Ali urged them to take things step by step. ""Go for it, just go for it. I think maybe talk to your parents first, and just tell them Mum, Dad, this is what I want to do, I want to box, I want to dance, I want to act, or whatever she wants to do. ""Tell them, you know what? Its OK what I'm doing, I'm not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things, I'm going to stick to my limits and stick to my religion, it's not harming anyone. ""My parents would say, if you're happy, we're happy. I think anyone's parents would say that wouldn't they? ""The first step is trying it and opening that door. Once you can open it an inch you can open it a mile.""","""No Guts, No Heart, No Glory"" is a play by Common Wealth Theatre that tells the true story of Muslim female boxers .

"(CNN)Even if you're sweating on the treadmill and grunting at the weight machine, you're probably still forgetting 57 important muscles that define part of who you are and how others perceive you and even help manage your mental well-being. They're in your face. Face Love Fitness, a pop-up boutique in downtown Manhattan, offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy, looking young and feeling good. ""The popular notion that one should avoid touching one's face for fear of creating wrinkles is completely incorrect. Skin responds beautifully to mindful touch,"" says Rachel Lang, an esthetician (skin care therapist), who co-founded the Face Love skin gym with massage therapist Heidi Frederick and personal trainer Kate Gyllenhaal. Not all skin experts agree. Some dermatologists, including Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a clinical associate professor at Tulane University, say that exercising facial muscles is counterintuitive to dermatologists. They treat lines and wrinkles caused by facial muscle movement, called dynamic wrinkles, with the muscle relaxing medication botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name ""Botox."" ""I do think there could be some value to relaxation and stress relief provided by massage, but exercising facial muscles will not make you look younger and may even make you look older,"" says Farris. But proponents of massage say healthy, youthful skin is well-worked skin. ""When you stimulate pressure receptors under the skin, as you do in a moderate pressure massage, you increase the temperature of the skin, you slow down the physiology, you reduce the release of stress hormones and enhance immune function"" according to Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. ""Just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general, it would also be expected to contribute to skin health."" This is the philosophy at the skin gym, where they say the massage and movement is detoxifying and increases oxygen and blood circulation to the skin, which can result in fewer wrinkles, a firmer jaw line, improved skin tone, and even reduced headaches and eyestrain, according to Lang. ""It is like any exercise, you need to do it two to three times a week for the best results."" It may look a little silly, contorting your facial expressions as Lang drags a plastic roller across your face, or trying to lift your eyebrows against the resistance of an elastic band across your forehead, but the effect of working out your face is pleasantly refreshing. Under the skin there is an area of fatty tissue called the subcutaneous layer. It diminishes with age. The loss of this area contributes to decreased firmness, giving facial skin an older, tired look. Exercising the facial muscles tones and lifts the skin because your facial muscles are attached to your skin and the bone like a web that forms the shape of your face. Through the massages and resistance training, Face Love Fitness claims muscles in the face become stronger and taut, rejuvenating the appearance of the face. ""This is great for everyone, it doesn't matter what age or gender or skin type. This is beauty and health anti-aging from the inside out. It supports and amplifies whatever routine you already have and will give you positive results regardless of your skin condition,"" says Lang. ""Because it refreshes and detoxifies, the massages are also good for hangovers,"" she adds. ""We all know that keeping the body fit with exercise is essential. Why do we stop at the neck?!"" asks Gyllenhaal.","A boutique in Manhattan offers face workouts and massages .

"(CNN)As long as 7,000 years ago, the Chinchorro people who lived along the desert coast of what is now Chile and Peru were mummifying the bodies of those who died. But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a ""black ooze,"" it said. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy . The role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by Harvard professor Ralph Mitchell and researcher Alice DeAraujo, according to the news release. Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans . But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. ""You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem,"" he is quoted as saying. A ""complicated process"" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release. It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

"Selma, Alabama (CNN)Crowds massed at a bridge in Selma, Alabama, Sunday to remember and reflect upon the sacrifices of another crowd that gathered at the same bridge half a century ago on a day that came to be known as ""Bloody Sunday."" Walkers marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the afternoon to commemorate those freedom-marchers who were clubbed and tear-gassed by state troopers as they peacefully filed across on March 7, 1965. The crowd was massive. It was shoulder to shoulder near the bridge and several blocks away. There were so many people that walking is a bit misleading -- people just really moved inch by inch along the way. The protest decades ago against the denial of civil rights to Americans based solely on the color of their skin, and the television coverage of the bludgeoning dealt them, hastened the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. On Sunday at Selma's Brown Chapel AME, a historically black church, leaders in the religious and political realm as well as community organizers gathered to hear speeches, sing hymns and remember what happened 50 years ago. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was in the audience. Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke, as did Rev. Al Sharpton. An important figure in the decades-long fight for civil rights, former Atlanta Mayor and U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young remembered the struggle in the 1960s but wanted everyone to keep pushing forward and thinking about achieving economic equality today. ""We've got to focus on ourselves not as problems but as visionaries,"" he said. ""We have come a long, long way, but I have enjoyed every bit of it,"" Young remarked. Several people remarked at how much it meant that the day before, on Saturday, America's first African-American President, Barack Obama, made a rousing speech on racial progress in a diverse country. He said that the struggle against discrimination continues today. Looking back, the ""Bloody Sunday"" march was triggered when a law officer shot a black man dead the month before. But it was about more -- the right to vote for all Americans. About 600 people were going to march 50 miles to the state capital in Montgomery before they were forcibly stopped. Sunday's festivities started with a breakfast and end late with a dance. A string of parades, receptions, reflections, films and discussions will fill the time in between. The  commemoration marking 50 years since ""Bloody Sunday"" continues on Monday. ""Our march is not yet finished. But we are getting closer,"" Obama said Saturday, his words echoing into a crowd of thousands lined up in front of him. Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights. ""If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,"" the President said near Edmund Pettus Bridge. Read President Obama's prepared remarks . The President said that what civil rights marchers did years ago ""will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible; that love and hope can conquer hate."" He hailed the marchers as heroes. The President said that ""the Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation."" The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to ""pre-clear"" any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them. Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress. 50 years later: Memories from 'Bloody Sunday' nurse . Many of the nation's leaders, activists and celebrities were in Selma on Saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event. On Saturday, Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus, a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. ""We must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work. There's still work to be done,"" said Lewis, adding this is an opportunity to ""redeem the soul of America."" John Lewis's memories of the march . Reflecting a sense of change in the half century since ""Bloody Sunday,"" and with Selma again in a national media spotlight, the mood in the crowd Saturday was of unity, and talks were focused on how to move America forward. But some current Selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82% black and with more than 40% of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance. Geraldine Martin, 59, has lived in Selma all her life. She was 9 years old on ""Bloody Sunday"" and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister, Belinda, to the world on that day. The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart. Opinion: Selma's historic bridge deserves a better name . Belinda left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta. Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside. ""I don't see how Selma will move forward without togetherness,"" said Belinda. ""There is no diversity in Selma. People don't live together."" CNN's Moni Basu reported from Selma. CNN's Slma Shelbayah wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Steve Almasy and Douglas Brinkley contributed to this report.","A large crowd walks the footsteps of those who marched 50 years ago .

"Perth, Australia (CNN)In the Swan Valley on the outskirts of Perth, a petite, blonde woman opens the front door. Dressed in skinny jeans, a gray t-shirt and black heels, Danica Weeks welcomes us inside her family home. Her warm smile and sparkly green eyes briefly disguise the deep-seated grief and sadness that constantly envelops her. The mother of two young boys can't move on. Her life is stuck on March 7, 2014, when she kissed her husband Paul goodbye at Perth International Airport. He was heading to Mongolia, where he would begin work as a mechanical engineer at one of the mines. It was a big job with enormous opportunity that could set up his young family. Unable to wear jewelry at the work site, he gave Danica his wedding band saying that if anything was to happen to him, she should give the ring to the first son that marries. Wearing it on a simple chain around her neck, she touches it as she speaks. ""I'm so glad that happened, that I've got this for the boys,"" she said. ""And for me, because I may never get anything. It may be the only piece of him that I have that is so close to us."" Paul Weeks, 39, left Perth that day and flew to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for his flight on to Beijing. Just after midnight on March 8, he boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Weeks had no idea about the plane's disappearance until she got a call from a news reporter asking if her husband was on board the missing Boeing 777. ""My life stopped that day, so that's what I remember. I'm purely now just existing. People say you're coping. I wouldn't call it coping; it's existing."" She has yet to tell her eldest son Lincoln, 4, that his father whom he adored will never come home. She can't make sense of it herself. How is a 4-year-old going to understand? She tells him Daddy is working in Mongolia -- the truth is just too painful. ""You create your own scenarios in your head and you can't bear to think that someone -- your best friend, amazing husband, the father of my children -- went through any of that. I don't want that for him. It's the not knowing that really destroys you."" The past 12 months have been a roller coaster of emotions for Weeks. Initially she thought the plane had crashed but when no debris appeared she clung on to hope. When the ""pings"" were discovered and authorities believed they would find the black boxes within days, she was told to prepare for her husband's memorial service. When that turned out to be wrong, her heart sank once again. Now there are days when her grief paralyzes her and she can't get out of bed. There are other days when she affords herself the small luxury of daydreaming and imagines him walking in the front door. ""When I'm alone and I think 'what if he comes back?' I see our wedding pictures and I think if he was to come back it would be amazing (for me) and for the kids. Jack has grown so much -- he was 11 months when Paul left. We're coming up to his second birthday. ""We've gone through all the 12 months of special days and I look at Jack and he's the spitting image of Paul. He would be blown away by how much he's grown. He should be here seeing all of that and the reason we don't know why is so painful. ""I can't even explain the pain -- it's unbearable."" We discuss the current search underway in the southern Indian Ocean more than 1,000 miles from where we are sitting in her home. Weeks looks deflated -- she's physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. ""They're very optimistic about this latest search. I can't share in that anymore. I've thrown my emotions and hopes into so many other searches. It's too much for me now. I won't come back. Half of my soul was on that plane with Paul and now nearly a year on ... I don't think I will ever find myself again."" Week's eyes well up with tears as she talks about her husband whom she met at the Munich Beer Festival 15 years ago. Since then, they had been inseparable --  until now. Her greatest fear is if nothing is found in the 60,000 square kilometer priority search area -- due to be completed by May - the authorities will call off the search operation. No country has said this but it doesn't stop Danica from thinking it. ""You know, that's so unfair -- where does that leave us? We can't move on beyond MH370. They may be able to but they don't come home to an empty house and 2 young children that should have their father here. They (the Malaysians) are legally and morally committed to bringing them all home and that's what they should do"". When asked what she'll be doing on March 8 -- one year since MH370 disappeared and since she last saw Paul -- tears stream down her face. ""Probably crying a lot. I never thought we'd reach a year and not know. You go through every anniversary, Lincoln's birthday, Paul's birthday, Christmas. You think we'll know by then and it's a year on."" While her loss and pain is palpable, there is an incredible strength within Weeks. She has to remain strong, she says, for the sake of her boys. ""I will keep searching. I will never stop searching for him. He gave everything to us. He is amazing. I know that if the shoe was on the other foot, he wouldn't stop looking for me. ""And I will never stop looking for him either.""","Danica Weeks is raising her two young sons without her husband, who was aboard MH370 .

"(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft. But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013. Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week. A DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt. The DNA analyst, Diane Biagiotti, testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination, lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster. The office manager at the rental car office, Keelia Smyth, testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17, 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office. Inside Hernandez's downward spiral . It was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum, and he also offered some to Smyth. Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA, she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile. Hernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez, told CNN' that she thought Friday ""went very well"" for him. Testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima. The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. State Trooper David Mackin, a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services, reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the ""getaway car,"" which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol, Connecticut. But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home.  Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun. In addition, no prints were found on any of the shell casings, including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office. Another key find: tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the Altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene, according to court testimony. Shaquilla Thibou, Lloyd's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed, took the stand Monday. About an hour before his death, she said she watched him get into a silver Nissan Altima as she sat in a friend's car outside her home. Thibou, who was 19 at the time of her brother's killing, told jurors that when Lloyd first walked to the car, he opened the front passenger door. He stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car. ""The light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat,"" she said. Then she saw the Altima pull away. It was 2:32 a.m. Thirty minutes later, Thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone. She noticed a text from her big brother. Thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts. The judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life, legally called ""a dying declaration."" That means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m., Lloyd texted his sister asking, ""U saw who I'm with?"" At 3:11 a.m he checked in again, texting ""hello."" Finally, at 3:19 a.m. Thibou answered, ""my phone was dead who was that?"" At 3:22 a.m., Lloyd responded, ""Nfl."" A minute later, he sent his last text, ""just so u know."" During grand jury testimony, Thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging. When reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that Lloyd had been shot to death, Thibou began to cry silently, wiping her tears after Assistant District Attorney William McCauley gave her a tissue. During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee introduced a photo of Lloyd taken by Thibou. It showed Lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of the black Suburban that Hernandez loaned him. On Wednesday, jurors got an up-close view of the clothes Lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times. Massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist Sherri Menendez held up Lloyd's bullet-riddled dark blue Old Navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt.  Jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt. The shirt was stained with blood. Menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead. During her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt, she found both and was able to determine that Lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet. The autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground. Just weeks before Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder, he toured rental apartments with New England Patriot employee Kevin Anderson, real estate agent Barbara Scardino testified Thursday. She said she was initially contacted by Anderson to find some apartments to show Hernandez.  He had previously called her to help other Patriot players find homes and apartment rentals, sometimes second residences near Gillette Stadium. This means the Patriot staff knew about Hernandez's second home. In early May of 2013, she showed Anderson and Hernandez four apartments.  Hernandez settled on the two-bedroom condo in Franklin, Massachusetts, referred to as his ""flophouse."" Hernandez's home in North Attleboro and his condo in Franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium. Hernandez's Franklin neighbor, Carol Bailey, also took the stand, telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo. It was Hernandez's friend Wallace. Bailey paid close attention to Hernandez and Wallace, seeing them come and go during their short stay there. During her one attempt to talk to Hernandez and say hello, she says he sort of grunted back, calling it a ""nondescript"" noise.  She also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded ""locker room-ish"" coming from the apartment as well as a strong ""skunk-like"" smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall. After mid-June, she never saw him again. A representative from Sprint, Justin Darrow, started off the week with a light moment. He appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question. He then turned to Judge Susan Garsh and apologized. ""It's a big case. Sorry."" Showing no emotion, Garsh struck the comment from the record. Darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between Sprint cell phone client Ernest Wallace and Odin Lloyd, Aaron Hernandez and Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, the night before and morning of Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say they believe Hernandez was using his fiancee's phone to call Wallace. Jenkins granted immunity . Darrow also explained how cell sites (or towers) in the Sprint network tracked the phone calls, and thus tracked the direction they were driving. Another cell phone representative also testified. T-Mobile engineer Patrick Quinn testified about the data transmissions from Lloyd's cell phone beginning on June 17, 2013, at 2:32 a.m. That's when Lloyd was picked up outside his home in the Nissan Altima. Data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg methodically walked Quinn through data transmissions received on Lloyd's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from Dorchester to the industrial park in North Attleboro. The last cell tower was just 400 yards from Lloyd's body.","Testimony this week focused on DNA, fingerprints and tire treads .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Sam Simon, the nine-time Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop ""The Simpsons,"" made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook. He was 59. Simon was diagnosed in February 2013 with terminal colon cancer. Yet through it all, he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor. ""The Museum of Broadcasting called and said, 'We were thinking about doing an archive interview with you. Do you mind if we did it now?' "" Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron's WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013. During his brief career, the influential Simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom ""Taxi"" at the age of 23; wrote for and produced the comedies ""Cheers"" and ""The Drew Carey Show""; and created a Fox series for the legendary stand-up comic George Carlin in the mid-1990s. Simon also wrote the 1991 film ""The Super,"" a 20th Century Fox comedy starring Joe Pesci as a New York slumlord. Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series ""Anger Management"" and hosted a show on Radioio.com. He showed up frequently on Howard Stern's SiriusXM show and in March 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being ""the perfect friend."" Story: Terminally Ill 'Simpsons' Co-Creator Vows to Give Away Fortune . A cartoonist and Stanford graduate, Simon developed ""The Simpsons"" with Matt Groening (who came up with the characters based on his family) and producer James L. Brooks. All three had worked on ""The Tracey Ullman Show,"" where Bart Simpson and his family got their start as animated sketches shown before and after commercials. ""The Simpsons,"" centering on TV's ""first fully self-aware dysfunctional family,"" as Simon put it, debuted on Fox on December 17, 1989, and is now the longest-running primetime series in American history. Ken Levine, an Emmy winner who has written for ""The Simpsons"" and other sitcoms, described Simon's contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in Stanford Magazine. ""Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters,"" Levine said. ""Is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters three-dimensional? His comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In 'The Simpsons,' the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?' -- that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters."" Simon also is credited with assembling the show's elite writing team that included Al Jean, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Conan O'Brien. Story: James L. Brooks on 'Simpsons' journey . ""I remember Sam coming into the room, and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated,"" O'Brien told Vanity Fair in 2007. ""He's hilarious. It was fun to try and make him laugh. I remember that about Sam. If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited."" Tired of the grind, Simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him ""tens of millions"" every year. The agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed, and his name appears in the credits of every episode. A couple of years after he left, Simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business. He was in his mid-30s. As detailed in The Hollywood Reporter's 2013 Philantrophy Issue, Simon's charitable contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs. His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Virginia, headquarters The Sam Simon Center; international nonprofit Save the Children; and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels -- used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing -- the M/Y Simon. Simon also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf. ""The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I'm getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer's funeral because they all know I'm sick,"" Simon told THR's Gary Baum. ""I am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff. The truth is, I have more money than I'm interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of. And I enjoy this."" In May 2014, it was revealed that Simon spent $60,000 to rescue an abused thoroughbred. Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for writing/producing ""The Simpsons"" (many after he left) and one for producing ""The Tracey Ullman Show,"" was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000). Neither marriage produced any children. Born June 6, 1955, Simon grew up in Beverly Hills in an era when the neighborhood was ""quaint,"" as he put it. Groucho Marx lived across the street, and he recalled walking into his parents' room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed. (He stressed they weren't about to have sex.) Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost. While at Stanford, Simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in San Francisco and the school paper and landed a job at Filmation Studios doing storyboards for ""The New Adventures of Mickey Mouse"" and ""Heckle & Jeckle."" Simon scored his first TV writing gig on the animated ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" in 1979. He mailed in a script to ""Taxi"" (co-created by Brooks) that was accepted, and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner. Simon also went on to direct episodes of the Carlin show, ""The Drew Carey Show,"" ""Friends,"" ""Norm"" and ""Anger Management."" An avid poker player, Simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for a Playboy TV show in 2009. The show also featured Tilly -- a very good player -- as well as comedians Dave Attell, Norm Macdonald, Jeffrey Ross and Artie Lange. Another one of Simon's more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of Sweet Science Inc., which managed boxer Lamon Brewster. His fighter stunningly knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004. During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to ""list the three things he loves to do. When he can't do those any longer, it's time. ""One of my three things is laying in bed and watching TV. So by that criteria, I will never be euthanized."" Later, talking about all the millions he's given to charity, he added: ""I kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person. But I know I would be a nut if I didn't have a lot of money.""

"(CNN)Families of children killed at the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have filed lawsuits against the estate of the shooter's mother, saying Nancy Lanza was careless and negligent in leaving a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle unsecured in her home. Adam Lanza, 20, used the assault rifle to kill 20 first-grade students and six adults in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The younger Lanza was mentally unstable and used his mother's Bushmaster to kill her before he went on the rampage at the school, and then killed himself. At least eight lawsuits have been filed in Connecticut courts since January on behalf of relatives of 16 people killed in the massacre -- four adults and 12 children. Court documents also list two people who suffered serious injuries. In December, the parents of nine children killed at the mass shooting, along with one teacher who survived, filed a separate lawsuit against the businesses behind the Bushmaster rifle. Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed one day after the second anniversary of the killings, named Camfour, a gun distributor; Riverview Gun Sales;  as well as the Freedom Group, the company that owns Bushmaster. It blamed the numerous lives lost in just 264 seconds on the shooter's weapon of choice, the Bushmaster. Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the law firm for the families in the Bushmaster lawsuit, is also representing some families in the cases against Lanza's estate. The lawsuits were first reported Friday in the Connecticut Post, which said Nancy Lanza is believed to have had insurance on the home worth more than $1 million. ""Unlike our case against Bushmaster, Camfour (the distributor), and Riverview for the negligent entrustment and marketing of combat AR-15's designed for the military to inflict mass casualties against the enemy to civilians like Nancy Lanza, we expect this claim to be resolved quickly,"" attorney Josh Koskoff said of the estate lawsuits.

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Albert Maysles, who collaborated along with his late brother David in a documentary film career that included the troubling 1970 concert documentary ""Gimme Shelter,"" has died. He was 88. The director and cinematographer, an Oscar nominee, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan of natural causes, Stacey Farrar, marketing director at the Maysles Center in New York, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Gimme Shelter"" -- which chronicled the 1969 Rolling Stones tour that culminated in the Altamont Free Concert, in which a fan brandishing a gun was stabbed to death by a Hells Angels security man — stood in a stark and more enduring counterpoint to the myth of the documentary ""Woodstock,"" a depiction of the glorified 1969 free concert whose own dark side was left out in its pre-conceived, celebratory style. Their most well-known film, ""Grey Gardens"" (1975), was a profile of Jacqueline Onassis' eccentric cousins -- mother and daughter Big Edie and Little Edie Bouvier -- who lived in a dilapidated, cat-packed estate in East Hampton, New York. The brothers worked with fellow directors Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer on the film, which was remade as a Tony-winning Broadway play and as an award-winning 2009 HBO drama that starred Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange. Just prior to ""Gimme Shelter,"" they filmed ""Salesman"" (1969), which covered six weeks in the lives of four door-to-door Bible salesmen. The brothers, who preferred the moniker of filmmaker rather than director, often focused on musical figures. Maysles was a cameraman on D.A. Pennebaker's ""Monterey Pop"" (1968), about the celebrated California music festival that featured electrifying performances from the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. TCM Classic Film Fest: Albert Maysles on Freeing Cameras, Capturing Truths (Video) During that period of their career, they also collaborated on such direct cinemas as ""What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A."" (1964), ""With Love From Truman"" (1966) and ""Meet Marlon Brando"" (1966), which premiered at the New York Film Festival. In 1968, they made ""Vladimir Horowitz: The Last Romantic,"" and the following year, they shot ""Horowitz Plays Mozart,"" also for TV. ""People are people. We're out to discover what is going on behind the scenes and get as close as we can to what is happening,"" he said of their cinematic style. There were often emotional reactions to their films; fans applauded them for the trust they developed with their subjects, allowing them to reveal long-repressed feelings or telling insights. Their style -- with their subjects caught by a hand-held camera and shotgun mike -- was in the tradition of such documentarians as Frederick Wiseman. However, cinema verite ""purists"" argued that the Maysleses sometimes exploited the content, particularly in regard to the omniscient editing of ""Gimme Shelter,"" where their flashback storytelling style created a dramatic foreboding and ""imposed"" a narrative on the Stones' tour. Flashbacking from Mick Jagger reviewing their footage, with Altamont's horrific memory in the recent past, ""Gimme Shelter"" punctuated a feeling of dread as the events moved inexorably to the tour's cataclysmic end. Originally, the ""free concert"" was planned to happen in San Francisco, but logistics went askew and it ended up at the Altamont Speedway in Northern California. Muddled by inadequate planning and the darkness at the fringes of the peace/love zeitgeist, the concert was a ghoulish nightmare. Admittedly, the Maysleses straddled a line between artistic license and nonfiction narrative. ""Al and Dave often argue that all they're doing is filming what's there. The detail is comment: fingers scratching, soft focusing. A filmmaker is always making comments,"" cinematographer Haskell Wexler once opined in a Village Voice article. He and his brother, who died in January 1987 at age 55, received an Oscar nomination for the 28-minute short ""Christo's Valley Curtain"" (1974), about the artist's first public work. That year, Albert shot film of the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman 1974 heavyweight title bout in Zaire that would become the 1996 Oscar-winning documentary ""When We Were Kings."" Maysles won three Emmys, two for his work with his brother on ""The Last Romantic"" and ""Soldiers of Music"" (1991) and one for ""Abortion: Desperate Choices"" (1991). In 2001, he shot ""Lalee's Kin: A Legacy of Cotton"" for HBO, a depiction of rural poverty in the Mississippi Delta that he created with Susan Froemke and Deborah Dickson, with whom he also worked on ""Desperate Choices."" Maysles also filmed half-hour portraits of filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Robert Duvall and Jane Campion, and he remained quite active in his later years. Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2015 . He was born November 26, 1926, in Boston and raised in nearby Brookline, Massachusetts. He got a B.A. at Syracuse University and a masters at Boston University, where he subsequently taught. During World War II, he was stationed at the U.S. Army's Headquarters Intelligence School in Oberammergau, Germany. In the mid-1950s, Maysles traveled to Russia, where he made a 1955 film on mental health care and psychiatry in Russia. It was shown on NBC's ""Today"" show and by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. In 1957, the brothers began working as a team. They traveled from Munich to Moscow by motorcycle and made a film about the Polish student revolution, 'Youth in Poland,"" which was televised by NBC. Next, they worked on an experimental TV project for Time Inc., with Maysles shooting Primary and Yanqui No! In 1962, they formed their own company. They made ""Showman,"" a portrait of movie magnate Joseph E. Levine that brought them attention. The film was acclaimed on the festival circuit, but the Maysles dubbed it an ""expensive resume.""

"(CNN)Fortunately, the intensive diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran and another war didn't stop after 47 Republican senators, led by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, appeared to try to goad Iran's leaders into forgoing a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute. Neither have they stopped since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered what was effectively a reelection campaign speech on the House floor. Despite so many concerted efforts to sabotage our diplomats, our negotiators are still hard at work to secure an agreement with Tehran that, if successfully concluded, will go down in the annals of diplomatic history as marking a new era for U.S.-Iran relations. Indeed, progress toward a political framework would move us closer to attainable safeguards on Iran's nuclear program as well as jump-start a more productive relationship that could pay extra dividends for years to come. Before President Obama's phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last fall -- the first direct contact between U.S. and Iranian heads of state in more than 30 years -- such an agreement seemed unthinkable. Now, with clear-eyed diplomacy, negotiators from the U.S. and five other countries, plus Iran, are in reach of delivering a peaceful resolution to the decade-long impasse over Iran's nuclear program. Diplomats have tackled thorny, complex nonproliferation issues that have never been comprehensively addressed in a multilateral agreement before. They have labored to eliminate Iran's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon while allowing the country to maintain a limited nuclear energy program, but under what is arguably the world's most locked-down nuclear inspections regime. U.S., German, British, French, Chinese and Russian negotiators are continuing to build on the solid success of the preliminary nuclear accord negotiated last year, the so-called Joint Plan of Action. That plan continues to grant inspectors daily access to Iran's nuclear facilities in order to verify its adherence to the agreement.  As a result, Iran's nuclear program will be frozen for the first time since its inception, as diplomats craft a comprehensive resolution to this standoff. If and when a final agreement is reached, the President may temporarily waive some sanctions if Iran's compliance can be verified. Congress has, for its part, authorized the President to provide limited, temporary and reversible sanctions relief so long as doing so advances U.S. national security interests. As former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and countless other national security experts have attested, such a diplomatic solution to this crisis is squarely in the national interests of the United States. In exchange for Iran following through on its promises to constrain its program in accordance with the agreement, the U.S. Congress will be asked to lift sanctions permanently. If Tehran demonstrates its long-term commitment to limit its nuclear program to exclusively peaceful purposes, then when the time comes, Congress should be ready to lift the sanctions. In the interim, it is crucial that all parties scrupulously adhere to the terms of this landmark agreement.  While Iran must not install unauthorized centrifuges, attempt a secret program or otherwise fail to adhere to the agreement, the U.S. Congress also has responsibilities under the agreement, including appropriations for its execution and refraining from imposing new sanctions in violation of either the letter or the spirit of the deal. All this suggests that to jeopardize such progress at this critical stage would be reckless, if not foolhardy. Of course, history suggests that we should be cautious. And the stakes are indeed extremely high. But the last thing the world needs is another major war in the Middle East. Members of Congress should therefore join the preeminent statesmen, military officers and the overwhelming majority of the American public in welcoming what is poised to be a diplomatic success -- one that could protect U.S. security and prevent further instability in the Middle East that would result from a nuclear Iran. We should ensure that our diplomats have the support they need to reach the finish line and that our President is able to cross it.","47 Republican senators last week sent an open letter to Iran's leadership .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)The Afghan woman is dragged onto a roof and hit with a stick, as a horde of angry, screaming men swarm around her. At one point, video shows her standing with her face covered in blood. She is pushed and falls over, and her beating continues with feet, with rocks, with boards. Then, in the last part of the video, her body is engulfed in flames -- though it's not known whether, by that point, she was already dead. This horrific scene played out in Kabul on Thursday. It's already had ripple effects, including a United Nations statement on Friday condemning what it called ""the brutal killing and burning of a 27-year-old mentally ill woman."" That corresponds with what the woman's parents told CNN affiliate Tolo News, saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years. It's not known whether her attackers knew this, or that it would have mattered. What motivated the mob, according to witnesses, was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the Quran. CNN hasn't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze. Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs has found no such evidence, either, according to Tolo. Mark Bowden, acting head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission, said that burning the Quran hurts efforts to promote ""understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions."" ""However, the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act,"" Bowden said, ""that should result in those responsible being prosecuted, to the fullest extent possible, under Afghan law."" Nahid, a 45-year-old woman who goes only by one name, told CNN what she saw and heard outside the Shah Do Shamshera shrine, which is opposite a mosque by the same name. A group of women were shouting at the eventual victim, accusing her of burning the Quran, according to Nahid. The woman yelled back. This got the attention of men nearby. Police tried to close gates to keep them out but it didn't work, said the witness, noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman. The hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire, said Nahid, who watched from inside the shrine. ""(They) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the Kabul River,"" she said. As of Saturday, 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman's death, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. Seddiqi said that the investigation is ongoing. President Ashraf Ghani ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars. His government is ""committed to protecting and safeguarding all Islamic values,"" including prohibitions on burning the Quran (if that is, indeed, what this woman did). That's a responsibility of the nation's security and legal system, Ghani said, not of individual Afghans. ""No individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners,"" the President said. ""Launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to Sharia and Islamic justice."" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","11 have been arrested in woman's beating, government spokesman says .

"(CNN)Well, it was weird while it lasted. On Wednesday, lawmakers in Ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess Ecstasy, crystal methamphetamine, ketamine, magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs. The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. ""We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,"" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. ""The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment."" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or ""head shop"" drugs -- ""all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,"" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal. Varadkar also told the Irish Times that the court ruling could affect ""dozens"" of cases, although The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process.","The president signs emergency legislation .

"(CNN)A 20-year-old man from the St. Louis area has been arrested in connection with the shooting of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Jeffrey Williams was arrested late Saturday, and he has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said at a news conference in Clayton. ""The demonstrations were pretty much over (when the officers were shot). People were leaving, and that's when this happened,"" he said, describing Williams as a demonstrator who had taken part in protests on numerous occasions. At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property, and McCulloch said he believed Williams had an outstanding warrant after not reporting to his probation officer for several months. The prosecutor repeatedly thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He also said that, because of the public's assistance in the case, police were able to serve a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, ""which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered"" at the scene of the shooting. Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they ""buy"" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. ""It's possible he was firing at someone else,"" he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward. Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, challenged the idea that Williams was a well-known protester. ""I asked him (Williams) why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community. It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested,"" said Robinson, who spoke to Williams on Sunday. Robinson added: ""We won't allow this to distract us from our mission, and from purpose, because we will continue to fight."" The shootings occurred Wednesday night. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw ""muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,"" Belmar said. ""We could have buried two police officers,"" Belmar told reporters last week. ""I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was."" Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward. He declined to provide any information on the tipster or the nature of the tip. Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. ""As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don't know,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. ""In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting."" Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said. ""These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,"" he said. The department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed African-American teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. ""We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts,"" the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works for that police department. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both men were treated and released.

"(CNN)""Every day, we cried"" -- these were the words spoken over and over to me by a colleagues as we sat down after another long day for a rare drink in Monrovia, Liberia's bustling capital. She was reminiscing about the period in September and October when the Ebola outbreak was at its peak. ""Of all the pain that we faced, the cremation was the hardest,"" she explained. I knew exactly what she meant -- cremation was as far away from the norm for burials in West Africa as one can imagine. As the Ebola outbreak wanes in Liberia, it is easy to imagine the heroes as the myriad of foreign doctors, nurses, epidemiologists and logisticians that have come to support the country in their days of need, and yes, these expatriates have definitely brought to bear much knowledge, expertise and resources on controlling the outbreak. But there is a group of heroes who are unlikely to make any headlines or be celebrated as such. They are the thousands of Liberian citizens that have gone door-to-door asking questions, looking for the ill, offering advice, day after day, after day for months on end. When they do find an ill person who may have Ebola, they begin the painful process of convincing them that it is safer to be an Ebola treatment unit than at home. Often the question that follows is: ""What happened to all those that went in before me? What happened to them?"" Thankfully, Liberia appears to be on its way back. It currently has the lowest numbers of confirmed cases of Ebola since the onset of the second phase of the outbreak in the middle of last year. The streets are full of activity and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives. At the Grand Royal Hotel, on Tubman Avenue, the main road through Monrovia, the manager sits in the popular café in the front garden. Most of his guests are still members of the large contingent of development workers from all over the world, or members of the armed forces and police services that form part of the U.N. military mission in Liberia, UNMIL. He admits that while this has been good for business, he would rather have his ""normal"" clients back. Monrovia is an interesting place -- it feels very West African. The food is familiar -- fish, plantain, rice... with lots of red pepper. The power situation is still very poor and most people in Monrovia rely on generators. It has a lovely but underutilized beach front; the perfect setting for a cold bottle of ""Club"" lager in the evening. There are quite a few restaurants and supermarkets -- mostly run by Lebanese entrepreneurs. As we drive past the Presidential ""mansion"" -- I ask why it looks empty and I am told that there was a fire in it a few years ago and that the renovation is not yet complete. President Sirleaf uses the office of the Foreign Ministry, and otherwise lives in her private residence, I am told. From the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it was ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. Out of this crisis, must emerge a new country. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia's ""single"" story. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of West Africa's emerging middle class. With lots of mineral resources, Liberia has so much potential. But, its most obvious resource and probably its most underutilized are its human resources. The University of Liberia is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in West Africa, but has known better times. The government of Liberia needs to think strategically and creatively on how to channel the goodwill of the world and the determination of its people into programs and projects that will put Liberia on a new trajectory. It may be impossible to imagine in 2015, but one only needs to look east to Rwanda for how a country can emerge from the most tragic of circumstances to become a proud and resilient country. Liberia will be back, but it will take leadership and courage. Despite the long hours of work, the tedious meetings, the long nights writing reports and re-strategizing, my best memories of Monrovia will be good ones; of a beautiful county and a resilient people.

"(CNN)A Michigan woman lost her Planet Fitness membership over the ""inappropriate"" manner in which she complained about a transgender woman in the locker room, a gym spokeswoman said. Yvette Cormier's membership was not canceled for simply raising the issue, ""as we welcome all feedback from our members,"" said McCall Gosselin, director of public relations at Planet Fitness Corporate. Rather, it was the manner in which she expressed her concerns that club management felt was inappropriate, resulting in the cancellation, Gosselin said. Cormier stands by her actions in a case that has drawn attention to transgender rights. ""This is all new to me. I didn't go out to specifically bash a transgender person that day. I was taken aback by the situation,"" Cormier told CNN. ""This is about me and how I felt unsafe. I should feel safe in there."" The mother of two says she was acting out of concern for her safety and the privacy of other female gym members when she raised the issue on Saturday, February 28. She went to the front desk after someone who looked like a ""man"" entered the women's locker room while she was changing. ""I wanted to know why there was a man in the women's locker room,"" she told CNN. ""He looked like a man, and that's what stopped me in my tracks."" She said the front desk employee told her about Planet Fitness' ""no-judgment"" policy, which allows people to use changing room based on ""their sincere, self-reported gender identity."" Unsatisfied, she said she called Planet Fitness' corporate headquarters and heard the same thing. ""That should be something they pointed out when I signed up,"" she said. ""If you have male parts you don't need to be in the women's locker room. I don't care what you are; I don't care if you're gay lesbian, transgender or transvestite. I am uncomfortable with you as a male in my locker room, in my restroom."" She returned to the gym Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday ""to get the word out"" to other women that they ""let men in the women's locker room,"" she said. ""Every day I said 'just so you know, there's a man they allow in this locker room and they don't tell you that when you sign up,' "" she said. The next day, she found out that her membership had been canceled. Cormier said Planet Fitness needs to do a better job of informing members of its policy allowing members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity, which refers to a person's psychological identification as a man, woman or another gender. ""The manner in which this member expressed her concerns about the policy exhibited behavior that management at the Midland club deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled,"" Gosselin said in a statement on behalf of Planet Fitness. ""Planet Fitness is committed to creating a nonintimidating, welcoming environment for our members. Our gender identity nondiscrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity."" LGBT advocates applauded the Planet Fitness policy, saying it was necessary to ensuring the safety and privacy of transgender individuals. Planet Fitness has the right to allow members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity, Alison Gill, senior legislative council for the Human Rights Campaign, told MLive. Even though gender identity is not a protected class under Michigan anti-discrimination laws, transgender individuals still have the right to use whichever bathroom they feel comfortable using, attorney Jay Kaplan with the ACLU of Michigan's LGBT Project told MLive. ""A transgender woman would be much more at risk for her safety if she had to use the men's bathroom,"" he said. Cormier does not see it that way. But she agrees with LGBT advocates on one potential solution: unisex, single-stall bathrooms.","Woman loses gym membership after complaining about transgender woman in locker room .

"New York (CNN)Crews searching at the site where a building exploded in New York's East Village found two bodies in the rubble Sunday. The victims' remains have not yet been officially identified, but authorities believe they are the two people who were reported missing after Thursday's blast, New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters. The men reported missing last week, Nicholas Figueroa and Moises Locon, were thought to have been at a sushi restaurant at the time of the explosion. Crews are still searching the scene, Nigro said, even though it's unlikely there are other victims. Three buildings collapsed and four others were damaged Thursday by the explosion and raging gas-fueled fire that followed. Nigro declined to discuss details about what caused the blast, saying an investigation is ongoing. Investigators are looking into whether a gas line was ""inappropriately accessed"" at the building where the explosion occurred, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Friday. Gas utility inspectors checking on work in the building's basement left the premises about 30 minutes before the explosion. In August, Con Edison shut off gas lines at the building for 10 days after discovering they'd been tampered with, according to Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for the utility. Images from the scene . Before last week's blast, the restaurant's owner had smelled gas and contacted the building's owner, but didn't contact authorities. That was a ""major mistake,"" New York Emergency Management Commissioner Joe Esposito said Sunday. ""They should have called 911,"" he said. ""We don't know what the outcome would have been. But that's what they should have done."" Nicholas Figueroa's body was one of those recovered from the rubble Sunday, family spokeswoman Awilda Cordero told CNN affiliates NY1 and WABC. ""Thank you to everybody for all the effort they did,"" she said. ""Yes, it is Nicholas. They found him."" Figueroa, who had recently graduated from college, was on a date at the sushi restaurant and went to the back to pay when the explosion occurred. The family is devastated, she said, but relieved to learn that his body was found. ""They've been waiting and waiting. ... This is just the beginning of doing something that they needed to do,"" she said. Locon, an employee at the restaurant, was reported missing by his brother, police sources said last week. ""I saw that young man every day, every single day we had a chat to say 'hello how's business,'"" Michael Schumacher, who owns a grocery store near where the explosion occurred, told WABC. ""Kid worked hard for his family"" Schumacher said. CNN's Julia Talanova reported from New York. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton made it clear Tuesday that when it comes to her emails, which traveled through a private server during her time at the State Department, we'll all just have to trust -- and she'll verify. Using strong language, the former secretary of state insisted that despite concerns from both sides of the aisle on issues including national security, accountability and transparency, there's simply nothing to see here. ""I went above and beyond what I was requested to do,"" she said. ""I fully complied with every rule,"" she declared. And in case you were wondering if there was going to be an independent review of her emails, there isn't. Nor will she turn over her server. ""The server will remain private."" There you go. Defiant, unfazed, undeterred.  You can believe fact checkers will work overtime to parse the bit about complying with every rule. Even the White House has disagreed with that. As for everyone else, the question isn't whether Clinton did enough Tuesday to satisfy House Republicans, who will no doubt continue to hammer her on decisions she made while at State. Nor is it whether she did enough to satisfy Republican voters, who have a crystallized view of Clinton that goes all the way back to the '90s. The perception that this is just another in a long line of instances where the Clintons flouted the rules is fairly unshakable. Likewise, her cadre of loyal surrogates, who showed just how unhinged they are willing to sound to defend the irreproachable HRC in recent days, are sure to keep on circling the wagons and telling us that she is the victim of a right-wing smear campaign and -- wait for it -- media bias. The audience for whom this press conference mattered most was Democratic and independent voters, who may admire Hillary Clinton, but as history has proved, simply cannot be counted on to vote for her in 2016, especially if someone else comes along on her left. Remember, Clinton wasn't defeated in 2008 by Republicans. She was beaten by a little-known, inexperienced Democrat. That means that the half of the country that was predisposed to like her politics and who already knew who she was chose someone else. And the other half of the country did, too. She's just as vulnerable, if not more, to the same kind of usurpation in 2016, thanks to an even greater sense of inevitability on the left, and the reflexive rush to protect her from valid questions and criticism isn't helping to dissolve it. Instead of insisting she did nothing wrong and smugly placating nosy reporters, she should have promised these voters that transparency and accountability -- two words she didn't utter Tuesday -- are the cornerstones of good government and any future administration she were to run. She should have assured them that the rules do apply to her, just like anyone else, and that in the future she'll pay closer attention to them. Finally, she should have told them that the last thing she wants is to take the trust of the voters for granted, and that she'll comply with any independent investigation that's offered. Defiance has paid off for the Clintons in that they've made it through some truly breathtaking scandals unscathed. But if Clinton wants 2016 to turn out differently than 2008, she and her surrogates can't keep insisting to voters that she is above scrutiny.","S.E.

"(CNN)The next time the people of Capracotta, Italy, hear the folks in Boston complain about a snow season of more than 100 inches, they'll be like: ""That's nice. We've been known to get that much in one day."" In 18 hours, actually. It's not an official record yet, but it looks like the Italian village got 100.8 inches (256 centimeters) on Thursday, setting the all-time mark for most snow in 24 hours. Pescocostanzo, about 21 miles (34.6 kilometers) away, only got 94.5 inches (240 cm). That's more than Boston got in January and February combined, but just short of the 105.7 inches the city totaled so far for the whole season. One of the photos posted on MeteoWeb, the Italian weather website that reported the immense snowfall, showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor. She is in a second-story window. The town, which has about 1,000 residents and sits at an altitude of 4,662 feet (1,421 meters), is prone to heavy one-day snowfalls, MeteoWeb reported. You might conclude it's in the Italian Alps given all that snow, but that's not the case. It's about a three-hour drive east of Rome, roughly halfway down the Italian Peninsula, not far from the Adriatic Sea. But it is in the mountains and is vulnerable to weather coming from the northeast. The World Meteorological Organization will confirm whether the snowfall actually surpassed the 24-hour snowfall record -- 75.8 inches -- from Silver Lake, Colorado, set in 1921. MeteoWeb reported that the snow fell in 18 hours and that in unpopulated areas at higher altitudes, it is likely accumulations were much more significant.

"(CNN)Nick Gordon, Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend, says he hates her father, singer Bobby Brown. The conflict is one of many revelations in a newly released promo for an upcoming episode of ""The Dr. Phil Show.""  In the clip, Gordon cries and laments missing Bobbi Kristina and her mother, the late Whitney Houston. ""I miss Krissy and Whitney so much,"" a tearful Gordon says. ""I want them back."" Brown was found unresponsive in a bathtub on January 31 at her home in Roswell, Georgia. She has remained hospitalized after doctors placed her in a medically induced coma. Police have said they are treating her case as a criminal investigation. Gordon, who tweeted that he gave Brown CPR after finding her in the tub, has complained via social media about not being allowed to see her. ""Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,"" Bobby Brown said last month in a statement through his lawyers. The terms were not revealed. ""In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers,"" lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. ""Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart."" Gordon began living with Houston and her daughter after the superstar singer took him in when he was a teen. After her death, he and Bobbi Kristina became romantically involved. In a Facebook post on Friday, Bobbi Kristina's aunt Leolah Brown wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil, claiming that Gordon is being investigated by the police regarding what happened to her niece. ""If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded,"" she wrote.

"(CNN)Robert Durst's wife mysteriously disappeared decades ago. It's an unsolved case that hasn't stopped haunting him. Years after she went missing, prosecutors argued Durst was hiding out from investigators digging into that case when he killed a neighbor, dismembered the body and skipped town. Jurors acquitted him in a high-profile 2003 murder trial after his lawyers said he'd acted in self-defense. Now the 71-year-old millionaire real estate heir from one of New York's wealthiest families is behind bars, accused of murder again in another case that some say is tied to his wife's disappearance. FBI agents arrested Durst Saturday night in New Orleans. Investigators say they believe he was behind the 2000 slaying of Susan Berman, a crime writer and Durst's longtime friend, who was shot dead in her Beverly Hills home. ""As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,"" Los Angeles Police said in a statement Sunday. Police, who described him as a ""cold case murder suspect,"" didn't specify what new evidence pointed them toward Durst. The arrest comes amid heightened interest in the eccentric heir, who's now the focus of the HBO documentary series ""The Jinx,"" which explores whether he had any connection to his wife's disappearance and investigators' suspicions that Berman was killed because she knew what happened to her. Durst has long maintained he didn't kill Berman or have anything to do with his wife's disappearance. Investigators found him Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans, where he was staying under a false name and was carrying a fake driver's license, according to a law enforcement official who's been briefed on the case. He'd paid in cash, and authorities believe he was preparing to leave the country and flee to Cuba, the official said. He was jailed without bond and was awaiting an extradition hearing Monday morning. ""We will waive extradition and get to Los Angeles as soon as possible to answer the charges,""  Chip Lewis, Durst's lawyer, told CNN on Sunday. Durst's brother said in a written statement that he was thankful for the arrest. ""We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst,"" Douglas Durst said. ""We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done."" Accusations about what Robert Durst has done depend on who you ask. His one-time wife, Kathie Durst, went missing in 1982. No one has been charged in her disappearance. And according to The New York Times, she's been declared legally dead. Robert Durst has said the last time he saw her was when he dropped her off at a train station in Westchester, New York, so she could head back to medical school in the city. He secretly divorced her in 1990, Court TV reported. Her family has said Robert Durst is to blame for her disappearance and hailed his arrest over the weekend as a sign they could be close to getting answers. ""The dominoes of justice are now starting to fall,"" Jim McCormack, her brother, said on Sunday. ""Through our faith, hope and prayers the last domino will bring closure and justice for Kathie."" This isn't Durst's first run-in with the law. In 2003, he admitted he'd killed and dismembered Morris Black, his neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but argued he'd shot Black in self-defense during a struggle. Prosecutors argued he'd planned Black's killing in order to steal his identity and escape the attention of New York investigators looking into his wife's disappearance. Durst testified that he hid out in Galveston and posed as a mute woman because he was afraid as he faced increasing scrutiny in the case, Court TV reported at the time. ""It seemed to me the big problem was Robert Durst,"" he said, referring to himself in the third-person. ""I wanted to not be Robert Durst."" Durst is an heir to a fortune thanks to his family's New York City real estate investments. The Durst Organization was founded by his grandfather and is now run by his brother and cousin. After a civil lawsuit in 2006, Robert Durst cut ties with his family and 10 Manhattan skyscrapers in return for a $65 million settlement, The New York Times reported. In 2000, his friend and longtime confidant, Susan Berman, was killed in her California home. The killing, CNN's sister network HLN reported in 2012, occurred just after police reopened the investigation into Kathleen Durst's disappearance. ""She was a confidante of Robert Durst. She knew him well. They knew each other and were very, very close,"" CNN's Jean Casarez said. ""And it was just days before investigators were to fly out to California to talk with her about what she may have known about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst that she was shot execution-style in her living room."" For years, speculation has swirled about who could be responsible for Berman's death. She'd written books about her family's mafia ties and explored the history of Las Vegas, and some suspected she might have drawn the ire of a killer through her work. Investigators in the past homed in on one key piece of evidence: a postcard sent to authorities that tipped them off that Berman's body was inside her home. A police handwriting analysis said the writing on that card looked like Durst's, author Miles Corwin told CNN in 2004. But Corwin, who shadowed investigators working on the case as part of his book ""Homicide Special: A Year With the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit,"" said at the time that police didn't have enough evidence to charge Durst in the killing. ""They don't have enough to arrest him,"" Corwin said in 2004. What's changed since then? In ""The Jinx,"" Berman's stepson reveals a letter from Durst he found among her possessions. That could be a key development, said Michael Daly, a special correspondent for The Daily Beast. ""You look at the letter, and the handwriting is astonishingly similar,"" Daly said. The Los Angeles County district attorney reopened the Berman homicide investigation last week. Investigators haven't said whether the documentary series played a role in this weekend's arrest. HBO, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, praised the series' director and producer in a statement Sunday. ""Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement,"" HBO said.

"New York (CNN)Cardinal Edward Egan, who led the Archdiocese of New York for nearly a decade, died Thursday at 82, the archdiocese announced. Egan was pronounced dead of a heart attack at NYU Langone Medical Center at 2:20 p.m. ""Thank God he had a peaceful death, passing away right after lunch today,"" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Egan's successor and current archbishop of New York, said in a statement. Egan was appointed archbishop of New York in 2000 and later cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Egan retired from the archdiocese in 2009. As the leader of one of the largest Catholic communities in the country, Egan oversaw a growth of more than 200,000 registered parishioners and welcomed Pope Benedict XVI on a visit to New York City in 2008 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Diocese of New York. ""Cardinal Egan spread love and knowledge, and brought comfort to countless New Yorkers and others across the country and the world who sought his guidance and counsel -- especially in the aftermath of 9/11,"" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement. Egan served previously as the bishop of Bridgeport, Connecticut, from 1988 to 2000, when the diocese was at the center of a child sex abuse scandal. The Bridgeport diocese in 2001 paid $15 million to 26 plaintiffs to settle sexual abuse claims against eight priests. Egan apologized for his involvement in the scandal in a letter read across the New York archdiocese in 2002, though he later retracted that apology in an interview with Connecticut Magazine 10 years later. ""I should never have said that,"" Egan said. ""I did say 'If we did anything wrong, I'm sorry,' but I don't think we did anything wrong."" Egan was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1932 and was ordained in Rome at the Pontifical North American College in 1957. Funeral arrangements are pending, the archdiocese said.

"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)While Iraqi government and allied forces were on the defensive Friday in Ramadi, they remained on the offensive in Tirkit -- trying to win over not only the strategic city, but the hearts and minds of its nearby residents. Iraqi forces steadily bombarded the last part of Tikrit still controlled by ISIS, with fighting described by one wounded man as intense. Still, even as it fends off this assault, the militant group continues with its barbaric tactics. ""Yesterday, bodies floated down the (Tigris) River from the hospital,"" said Saber Kraidi, an eight-year Iraqi military veteran. ""They were people from Tikrit executed by ISIS."" The Iraqi military is joined by some Sunni fighters and a predominantly Shiite militia, working together to retake the city best known to most Westerners as the hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. They are working on not just winning the battle, but securing the peace.  Members of the Badr organization, a powerful Shiite armed group, handed out food and supplies Friday to residents of the Sunni village of Albu Safah, whose 30 families have been holed up the last 10 months amid the fighting. The village's leader, Haji Jamid, said the Shiite fighters' efforts were working. ""They're good,"" Jamid said. ""If someone is sick, they'll take them to the doctor, even at 2 or 3 in the morning. ""If it weren't for them, ISIS would have slaughtered us."" In June, Tikrit fell to ISIS, which has conquered large areas of Iraq and Syria and claimed them as part of its Islamic caliphate. There have several attempts to take it back since then, all of them failures. The latest push began this month, involving around 30,000 fighters. By Thursday, the government controlled about 75% of the besieged city, with about 150 holdout ISIS fighters controlling the rest, said Main Al-Kadhimi, commander of the Hashd Al-Shaabi militia. There was no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the Iraqi forces. But they have been making progress in recent days. That includes gaining control of Tikrit Military Hospital, a few blocks south of the presidential palace, on Wednesday. The goal is that, if Iraqi and allied forces can take Tikrit, then they'll have more realistic hope of similarly winning back Mosul -- a city that's nearly 10 times bigger. Yet, even if ISIS is losing ground in Tikrit, that doesn't mean it's not a dangerous, destructive force elsewhere. Case in point is happening about 100 miles south of Tikrit in Ramadi, which the extremist group began assaulting on Wednesday. Faleh al-Issawi, deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, has said officials believe the Ramadi assault ""is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation."" More than 40 Iraqi soldiers died when ISIS blew up the Iraqi army headquarters near Ramadi in Iraq's western Anbar province, an Anbar provincial leader told CNN on Friday. ISIS fighters there dug a tunnel underneath the army headquarters and detonated hundreds of homemade bombs, Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council, said Thursday. The headquarters are located in the Albu Diab area, just 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) north of Ramadi. Al-Karhout denied reports that the U.S.-led coalition had bombed the headquarters. So, too, did the U.S. government, with its Baghdad embassy stating Friday that no coalition aircraft were even in the area . A statement released early Friday by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said the Iraqi security forces had successfully repelled the ISIS attack on Ramadi, despite coming under attack from several directions. ""The successful defense of Ramadi by Iraqi Security Forces is another example of their increasing ability to defeat Daesh in multiple locations and prevent the terrorist group from gaining ground,"" said Lt.

"Washington (CNN)The State Department is reviewing Hillary Clinton's emails to determine what can be released to the public, not whether she did anything wrong, according to a senior department official. Clinton aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate State policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work. However, it is currently unclear whether Clinton broke a State guideline dating back to 2005 that suggested ""normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an (authorized information system), which has the proper level of security control."" Those guidelines were filled with exemptions that could allow Clinton to use a private account. The department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are ""not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails."" Clinton was not automatically in violation of State Department policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as America's top diplomat, the source added, contradicting other media on Thursday. ""Under federal regulations, there is no prohibition on using a personal email for official business as long as any records are preserved,"" the official said. ""Reports claiming that by using personal email she is automatically in violation of that FAM [Foreign Affairs manual] are inaccurate."" Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone, according to a former State Department official. The former secretary of state sent thousands of employees message from that account and in her four plus years at the State Department, nobody raised a red flag and say that she couldn't conduct her email communication in the manner she was conducting it, the former official adds. There were no big internal discussion among State Department lawyers, either, about Clinton's use of private email. The former official said it was simply accepted as her form of communication. Clinton's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed Democratic frontrunner for president in 2016. Experts have said it doesn't appear Clinton violated federal laws, but that hasn't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics. Clinton tweeted on Wednesday night that she asked State to release her emails. ""I want the public to see my email,"" her tweet said. ""They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."" The State Department acknowledged Clinton's request after the tweet, and a senior official said the review could ""take several months."" And while State officials said their review will focus on what can be released, the inquiry will also have to determine what is not suitable for dissemination given its sensitivity. If the department has to withhold documents, questions are likely to be raised about whether Clinton broke State Department guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials. On Friday, Marie Harf, a state department spokeswoman, said she was ""not going to speculate"" about whether there is sensitive information in Clinton's emails. ""We just don't know what would happen in that situation, there are so many variables and factors, I just really don't want to speculate,"" Harf said. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Clinton's closest aides at State were well aware that Clinton communicated using a private email address. ""Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address,"" the Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton. Clinton's spokesman failed to comment to CNN questions about those revelations by the Times. A senior State Department official did say on Friday that administration officials who engaged in email exchanges with her would been party to the fact she used a private account, although it is unclear how many administration officials she actually emailed. Several Clinton former senior staffers have said they used to get their instructions from her verbally. The questions around Clinton's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed Republicans to cast Clinton in a similar way they did her husband, former President Bill Clinton: As a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations. Charges of hypocrisy have also surfaced given that an inspector general's report from 2012 - while Clinton was secretary - repeatedly cited Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration's use of ""commercial email for official government business"" saying it was against policy to do so ""except in emergencies,"" which created morale problems, ""confusion and discouragement within the embassy community."" Gration, who resigned his post in 2012 before the IG report became public, was criticized for a number of other things in the document, but it was clear that his using commercial email instead of State Department email was a real concern. At the time, Clinton was using her own personal email account to conduct official business. Clinton set up a server at her home in New York to keep her emails, meaning she and her aides were in possession of the documents, not the State Department. When the representatives from State asked for all her records in 2014, Clinton sent them the 55,000 pages of emails. A Clinton aide said they provided ""anything that pertained to her work"" at State, but it is impossible to verify the former secretary of state did send everything. State Department guidelines require employees who use private email accounts to back up those documents on government computers so that the department can archive them and they can be available for Freedom of Information Act requests. Clinton aides argue that they complied with State rules when they sent the documents to the department, but that did not happen until 2014, over a year after Clinton left the department. In addition to directives from State, federal guidelines from Clinton's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices. The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that allowed agency employees to use personal accounts as long as they ensured ""that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" Before that, the archives agency said they did not ""specifically address this issue."" It wasn't until 2014 - when President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law - that a timeline was set up to mandate how quickly emails had to be turned over by people who used personal devices. David Chalian, Jim Acosta, Brianna Keilar and Chris Frates contributed to this report.","Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone .

"(CNN)Another flight brings another complaint about an airline interfering with a passenger breastfeeding her baby. The mothers who complain about instances of airline employees interfering with their breastfeeding or pumping aren't covering up and going away; they are tweeting out their complaints in 140 characters or less, sometimes in multiple posts, other times taking pictures of longer reports. Kristen Hilderman is the latest mother to say she was hassled while breastfeeding. The Vancouver mother was returning to Canada from a vacation in Costa Rica with her family on Sunday night when, she says, there was a problem on the final leg of her trip. Hilderman was feeding her 5-month-old son on board United Airlines Flight 438 as the aircraft taxied along the runway before taking off from Houston to Vancouver. To describe what happened next, she took a picture of her typed recollections and posted it to Twitter. ""A male flight attendant named Keith walked up to our row and said to my husband (loudly, so that everyone around could here ), 'Are you two together?'"" Hilderman wrote. When her husband said yes, Hilderman said, the flight attendant ""tossed a blanket at him ... and said tersely, 'Then HERE, help her out.' "" When she twice asked what he was supposed to help her out with, she said, the flight attendant ignored her. Passengers on the plane were supportive, she said, and told her they hadn't known she was breastfeeding until the flight attendant singled her out. ""I've been breastfeeding my son in myriad public places since he was born, and never has anyone made me feel so uncomfortable and ashamed for feeding my baby without putting a cover over his head,"" she wrote. United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said that the airline reached out to Hilderman on Monday night via Twitter and that airline officials ""look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member to understand what happened."" ""On our general approach to breast feeding, we welcome nursing mothers on board and we ask that crew members do their best to ensure their comfort and safety as they do with all customers,"" Dohm wrote in an email. ""We also ask nursing mothers and passengers seated near them to be mindful of one another's space and comfort."" Hilderman, who filed a complaint with the airline, said United had not contacted her beyond their tweeted reply but said she has found support from allies on social media. Why are we so squeamish about breastfeeding? Delta passenger Lauren Modeen, who needed her breast pump on a January flight but was forced to check it as luggage, started a  Boobs on Board Facebook page that's gained over 1,100 followers in the past month. ""Before social media, the majority of these harassment stories went unheard,"" Modeen wrote in an email. ""As a result, airlines faced little pressure to improve and pave a better way for mothers and children."" She wants her Facebook page encourage airlines ""to publicly post their explicitly clear pro-breastfeeding/pumping policies inside every airplane so the rules are not left to interpretation by an airline employee, and in turn harass/shame/bully a mother."" United, Delta and other major U.S. airlines say breastfeeding is allowed on their aircraft, although United doesn't post its policy on the airline website. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines do. Though you can't please everyone in the air, women are allowed to breastfeed in flight, says veteran flight attendant and author Heather Poole, who is also a mother. ""Which means if breastfeeding bothers you, maybe try looking away, closing your eyes,"" said Poole, author of ""Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet."" And remember that baby could be crying instead, giving you another reason to complain. ""Better a happy baby than a crying baby.""","United says officials ""look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member""

"(CNN)If you thought Simon Cowell was mean, wait till you hear what this judging duo had to say on New Zealand's spinoff of the popular singing contest ""X Factor"" on Sunday. Married couple Natalia Kills and Willy Moon, who both were on the judging panel of the show, slammed the 25-year-old contestant Joe Irvine, after his rendition of Michael Buble's ""Cry Me A River."" But it wasn't how he sang that ticked them off. ""I'm disgusted at how much you've copied my husband, from the hair to the suit,"" said Kills, referring to Irvine's new makeover for the show. ""You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting...you make me sick,"" the British singer added. Her husband Willy Moon called him ""creepy"" and likened him to Norman Bates, the killer in the horror film, ""Psycho."" Mediaworks, the owner of the New Zealand television channel TV3, which airs the show, has decided to sack the duo for their scathing remarks. ""Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,"" said Mark Weldon, Mediaworks chief executive. ""We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately,"" Weldon said in a statement on TV3's website. The couple's comments sparked outrage on Twitter. In just a day, 77,534 people signed a petition to kick the duo off the show. TV3 was quick to respond, saying that it does not condone ""bullying."" Irvine, who handled the comments calmly on stage, tweeted a smiling photo and thanked his supporters. Kills and Moon did not directly respond to the accusations, but Kills tweeted, thanking her fans for understanding her ""passionate opinions."" The native singer, Moon, who rose to fame after his song was featured in an Apple ad, was lambasted in the media earlier this week. He reportedly used abusive language at a woman in a bakery in Auckland over a parking space brawl. TV3 apologized on his behalf, saying he regretted the incident and his language, but Moon has distanced himself from the statement on social media. Thankfully, it isn't up to the judges whether or not Irvine makes it to the next round -- voters will decide his fate on Monday night's results show where fellow judges Stan Walker and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt will continue to appear. Two new judges will be announced before next week's show.

"Fall River, Massachusetts (CNN)Is there hidden meaning in recorded jailhouse calls with former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez after his arrest? Defense attorneys and prosecutors are in a pitched battle over whether a jury should be able to hear them during his ongoing murder trial in its eighth full week of testimony. Snippets of the conversations are contained in motions filed by both sides. The transcribed excerpts include Hernandez talking with his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and also with his cousin Tanya Singleton. There's also a debate about calls between Singleton and co-defendant Ernest Wallace. Prosecutors contend calls involving Wallace, Singleton, and Jenkins, in particular, are proof of an ongoing conspiracy to conceal evidence after the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd. The defense argues the calls are irrelevant, prejudicial and contain hearsay. Aaron Hernandez trial: The latest developments . Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating Lloyd's killing with the help of Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. Wallace and Ortiz have pleaded not guilty and are being tried separately. Singleton and Jenkins both face charges of their own stemming from Lloyd's killing. Singleton has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact, accused of helping Wallace escape to Florida. Singleton, suffering from terminal cancer, is expected to be called as a state's witness. She previously served time for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury. In calls between Singleton and Wallace -- after he was arrested but before she was jailed on the contempt charge -- prosecutors contend she is passing on information from Wallace to Hernandez. At trial, authorities suggest Hernandez was reaching out to Wallace the night Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was discovered. Jurors have been shown surveillance video and phone records authorities say show Hernandez borrowing his attorney's cell phone to call Wallace that night from the North Attleboro police station parking lot after Hernandez took apart his own phone. During previous cross-examination, the defense has argued there is no proof of what that call was about and there was nothing unusual about taking a battery out of a cell phone, then putting it back together. Hernandez's fiancée, Jenkins, has pleaded not guilty to lying before a grand jury. Prosecutors suspect her of getting rid of the murder weapon after receiving a coded text message from Hernandez a day after Lloyd's killing. The jury has seen a home surveillance video of her removing a trash bag from the house and driving away with it in a car. The handgun, believed to be .45-caliber Glock, has never been found. Court documents state all jailhouse calls are recorded, and detainees are notified by signs and recorded messages that their phone conversations are being monitored. Below are excerpts of some of the calls the defense wants to quash and prosecutors want the jury to hear: . July 12, 2013 -- Call between Tanya Singleton and Ernest Wallace . Wallace: ""You tell Ink, tell Ink, I love him, man. I love him."" Singleton: ""I will."" Wallace: ""Tell him no matter what, don't think I'm la-la-la'ing. I'll never go against the grain, you hear me?"" Singleton: ""Yup."" Wallace: ""Tell him we gotta work together. Tell him we gotta work together."" July 17, 2013 -- Call between Singleton and Wallace . Singleton: ""... He said you and him all the way, you know."" Wallace: ""All right. I love that ... man."" Singleton: ""He love you, too. ..."" Wallace: ""I'm riding."" Singleton: ""That's what he said."" Wallace: ""... I'm riding, you know what I mean. I'm riding."" Singleton: ""Yeah, that's what he said. And I'll let her know that you know."" Wallace: 'Cause, yo, this la la la got us all into this, man, and they gotta know."" Singleton: ""I know, yeah. it's gonna be fine. I'm gonna call your lawyer today."" On August 3, 2013, Jenkins tells her fiancé Hernandez that his cousin Singleton has been jailed for refusing to testify at a grand jury in his case. Hernandez: ""... The longest she'll do is like probably less than a month ... until the grand jury is don(e), investigation, do you know what I mean?"" ""The only good thing about Tanya being locked up is she's gonna lose weight."" In another call between Jenkins and Hernandez, Jenkins apparently isn't happy that he's asking her to put money into Singleton's jail canteen account. The defense argues it has no relevance to the murder charge. Jenkins: ""I don't know why you keep. ..."" Hernandez: ""She's got no money in jail."" Jenkins: ""... Why do I have to keep being the one to do that? That's what you're not understanding."" Hernandez: ""All right -- well --"" Jenkins: ""I'm trying to follow what my lawyers are telling me to follow, and then you keep trying to have me do other things."" Hernandez: ""Not really, but I'm saying whatever works for you."" Some excerpts are singled out by both defense and prosecutors for different reasons. In a call dated July 23, 2013, the defense suggests Hernandez appears to be doing an act of kindness for his loyal cousin by setting up a trust fund for her children. Hernandez: ""I set up an account, don't tell nobody, for Jano and (Eddie). ... ""So, don't tell nobody. I don't want nobody to know about it. And I ain't even telling my own girl, nobody. ... "" 'Cause it already started off at $100,000 for them. ..."" In their motion,  prosecutors appear to suggest it's a payoff disguised as a gift. Will the calls be played in court? On Wednesday, Judge Susan Garsh will hear arguments and then decide whether the state can admit the jailhouse calls as evidence or if they will be barred.","Prosecutors contend recorded jailhouse calls are proof of conspiracy to conceal evidence .

"(CNN)Six weeks into the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public, taken from Hernandez's own home security system. Prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest Hernandez is holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez' Boston home. ""In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,"" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testifies. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace, and Carlos Ortiz are seen on the same security video, recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013, after the men walk into Hernandez's home. All three have been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and have pleaded not guilty. Wallace and Ortiz are being tried separately. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by Hernandez. Jurors lean forward in their chairs, peering into monitors and scribbling notes as Aspinwall, a former Massachusetts state trooper and New Hampshire police chief, takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony. Aspinwall tells jurors Hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he's standing at his basement door. The defense will have none of it. They attack Aspinwall's credentials. Aspinwall is well-schooled in Glocks but admits he doesn't consider himself a gun identification expert. Hernandez's lawyers then show a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. ""Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?"" defense attorney James Sultan asks. ""No, they do not,"" Aspinwall answers. Sultan then displays a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Prosecutors dispute the suggestion. ""Are you aware of anybody going pellet gun shooting at 3:30 in the morning?"" Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg asks Aspinwall. University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann calls the Glock expert's findings powerful; yet, he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video. ""The jury might think that the defense is just throwing things against the wall,"" he says. ""But on the other hand, the jury may feel like it could be one of a dozen things. That's reasonable doubt."" One thing not in dispute: the alleged murder weapon remains missing. So does a solid motive. Prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of Hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the New England Patriots -- partying with Lloyd and Hernandez's personal barber at Rumor nightclub two nights before Lloyd's death. Investigators say Hernandez was angry that Lloyd was talking to some people that night. Hernandez and Lloyd are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club's bar, and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave, but so far there's no testimony about what may have gone wrong. What might Hernandez's fiancée say? Akil Joseph, a longtime friend of Lloyd's who takes the stand, tells jurors he talked with Lloyd at the club and says he appeared ""normal."" When Azil Joseph leaves the stand, he keeps his eyes locked on Hernandez until he walks past the defense table. Cameras show Hernandez leaving the bar, but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in Hernandez's waistband. The valet's hotel security boss tells jurors he didn't see a weapon under the football player's shirt. Near the club, Hernandez is in his SUV with Lloyd and another friend. Hernandez offers a ride to Jennifer Fortier, his babysitter, who happened to be nearby with a friend. Fortier tells jurors Hernandez and Lloyd were smoking pot. Despite her objections, Hernandez drives her and the friend to Hernandez's so-called ""flophouse"" about 20 minutes from Gillette Stadium, the Patriots' home field in Foxborough. Fortier testifies that Hernandez ""tried kissing me."" ""I told him 'No, I'm your nanny. I can't do this,'"" she adds. ""He said he understood ... and he wasn't mad at me.""","Aaron Hernandez on trial for death of Odin Lloyd .

"(CNN)Once again the global community waits to see if the United States and its partners can really halt Iran's quest for nuclear power through a verifiable accord or if Tehran is trying to buy more time for a clandestine nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having. True, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently denied it seeks anything more than nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's repeated claims in public forums that ""We do not have nuclear weapons, and we do not intend to produce them,"" have failed to convince the United States, European Union and Israel. Suspicion is well-warranted.  Iran reluctantly disclosed to the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA — only after U.S.-led detection — its clandestine enrichment of uranium at an underground facility near Qum, testing of bridge wires to explode the detonators of atom bombs at the Parchin military facility near Tehran, and development of an advanced multipoint trigger system for nuclear warheads. Even the IAEA director noted on March 2 that the agency still could not ""provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities."" As a result, the chief ayatollah's words seem more intended for defusing the international storm rather than changing domestic policy. Moreover, Khamenei has made it amply clear to Iran's citizens in the text of an infographic on his website, also reproduced by the state-controlled news media, that ""Iran must not cease or slow down"" but should ""continue nuclear research, expansion, and progress."" He has threatened as well, repeatedly, that Iran will unleash a ""crushing response"" against any nation with which it clashes, making his stated intent to continue nuclear activities more ominous. However, economically strapped and internationally isolated, Iran's citizens are putting pronounced pressure on President Hassan Rouhani and Khamenei. A November 2014 Gallup Poll indicates 70% of Iranians hope their leaders will accept an agreement. They expect the country's economy will jump-start through reduction or elimination of sanctions. So Iranian politicians and clerics, even those on the National Security and Foreign Policy Parliamentary Committee, have gradually begun acknowledging that sooner or later ""some sort of a result [i.e., nuclear deal]"" will have to be accepted by Tehran. Ordinary Iranians' desire to reach a pact with the West is understandable. Iran's economy ranks only 32nd  in the world, according to data from the World Bank, despite its vast energy resources and well-educated public. Consequently its people's prosperity has fallen to a lowly 107th among the world's societies, according to the Legatum Institute. Plunging oil prices have recently added to domestic woes, with that country facing deeper deficit in revenues much needed for development projects. Iranian leaders realize their regime remains vulnerable not only to externally imposed sanctions, but more so to internally generated widespread discontent, which erupted and was violently repressed in 2009. Regime preservation has multiple facets, however. It's not just about keeping citizens fiscally happy. Nuclear weapons work well in deterring external adversaries. Processing such technology generates much pride at home, too. Fifty-six percent of Iranians responded favorably to its continued development when polled in January. Consequently there will be countervailing internal pressure on Iran's leaders to withstand fully meeting obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty, irrespective of whether a deal is reached, even if the socioeconomic cost to their citizens and fever-pitch global consternation continue to rise. But Iran's leaders also know full well that agreeing to a pact that lifts most or all sanctions will boost the economy and thereby generate additional resources to enhance the regime's popularity at home and influence abroad. This central goal of Iran's presence at the negotiating table was made crystal clear during the Supreme Leader's Nav Roz, or New Year, public address on March 21: ""Removal of sanctions is part of the subject of negotiations, not of the results ... removal of sanctions should occur without any deal when an agreement is reached."" ""We can see a path forward here to get to an agreement ... [and] very much believe we can get this done by [the deadline of] March 31,"" stressed a senior State Department official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Lausanne on March 25. Negotiators have even added three more months to resolve the technical details of the overall agreement. Diplomacy may, as the Obama administration has stressed repeatedly, indeed be the most efficient and least dangerous way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Certainly neither the American nor the European publics want another drawn-out war in the Middle East. But as the United States and other world powers work fervently toward clinching the long-awaited nuclear agreement with the Islamic republic, it is important for Western negotiators and politicians to bear two central considerations in mind: (1) Irrespective of mechanisms written into the deal, will verification actually be possible on the ground to ensure Iran both limits and becomes fully transparent about its nuclear program? (2) Would the world collectively or the United States independently be able to enforce punitive actions, such as re-establishing sanctions, if Iran fails to comply fully and in a timely manner? Iran's President continues to suggest that his country seeks a ""win-win deal which would serve the interests of all the parties,"" as does his negotiating team. But many Western and Middle Eastern leaders fear the United States and its allies will not be able to truly enforce nuclear limits upon Iran through any treaty. Certainly not only many Asian and African nations, but even two of the superpowers, Russia and China, see little if any threat from Tehran and would much prefer to reopen large-scale trade with Iranians than argue about atomic fission. Last November, Russia even entered into an agreement to build at least two nuclear reactors in Iran. Once sanctions are lifted, multinational corporations will likely invest heavily in Iran and resist having to pull out subsequently. Not surprisingly, influential hard-line Iranian leaders including Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, who heads Iran's judiciary, trumpet: ""Our country and our negotiating officials ... are the real winners in these talks."" Four years ago Iran's Revolutionary Guards declared: ""The day after Iran's first nuclear test is a normal day ... but for some of us there will be a new sparkle in our eyes."" Even if a deal is done, will Iran gamble that with the exception of the United States and Israel, nations can come to live with it eventually reaching the threshold of nuclear breakout or wielding nuclear weapons?","Authors: Iran's people want a deal in hopes of a better economy .
They say Iran's leaders recognize that having a nuclear program can elevate its international clout ."
"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coasted to victory in Tuesday's elections, defying pre-election polls showing his Likud party trailing his main rival, the center-left Zionist Union. Ever the master politician and brilliant tactician, he used the politics of fear to galvanize his right-wing base, which ultimately secured him a fourth term. Israel, however, may not fare as well as its leader did at the polls. In a matter of days, Netanyahu exposed his true attitude toward Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, in the process threatening to further erode an already strained relationship with the White House. Less than two weeks ago, Netanyahu declared that his speech of June 2009 at Bar-Ilan University, where he publicly endorsed a demilitarized Palestinian state, is no longer relevant. On Monday, he continued on this theme, announcing that a Palestinian state would not be established under his watch. These comments were tactical moves aimed at mobilizing his base, but so was his Bar-Ilan speech a maneuver aimed at appeasing U.S. President Barack Obama and quelling criticism from abroad. Ultimately, political expedience led Netanyahu to reveal what many critics had long suspected: He has never supported a two-state solution. In the last six years of his premiership, Netanyahu has spoken out repeatedly against a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed land swaps -- the basis for a two-state solution; insisted that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people -- a condition no Palestinian leader can accept; and presided over unprecedented settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians regard as their future capital. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister has disparaged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at every opportunity, asserting that he encourages terrorism -- a claim that was contradicted by the head of Israel's top security service -- and repeating the mantra that Abbas is not a legitimate peace partner. In 2011, he reportedly quashed the Palestinian leader's draft peace agreement that had been secretly negotiated with former Israeli President Shimon Peres. In a less guarded moment, Netanyahu told Israeli writer Etgar Keret that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was ""insoluble."" Netanyahu's duplicity on the Palestinian issue has led to a highly dysfunctional relationship with the Obama administration, which has tried, in vain, to broker an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. He made a farce of last year's John Kerry-brokered peace talks by increasing settlement work fourfold during this negotiating period. Adding fuel to the fire, Netanyahu has repeatedly injected himself into U.S. politics, most recently with his acceptance of an invitation by House Speaker John Boehner to address Congress -- a move that was widely seen as a partisan ploy to undercut the White House. Obama has yet to respond to Netanyahu's most recent statements, which can only serve to further damage Washington's ties with Jerusalem while contributing to Israel's growing isolation. One European government after another has begun to turn its back on the Israeli government, taking steps to recognize a Palestinian state since it appears less and less likely that one will emerge as a result of negotiations. But criticism of Netanyahu's approach to the Palestinian issue has also come from none other than the Israeli security community, many of whose members are alarmed at Israel's deteriorating position in the international community in general and its schism with Washington in particular. A broad array of former generals, ex-heads of Israel Defense Forces military intelligence, and former chiefs of the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence services have long argued that the status quo is unsustainable and that a two-state solution is vital to Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state. In the last month, nearly 200 of these former high-ranking security officials launched a campaign demanding a change in leadership in light of what they view as Netanyahu's failure to take any diplomatic initiative while harming one of Israel's greatest security assets: its relationship with the United States. Israelis did not heed the ex-security officials' warnings when they voted to retain Netanyahu as their Prime Minister. But while Netanyahu's come-from-behind victory may attest to his shrewd political instincts, it will also come with a high cost for his country.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won re-election Tuesday .

"(CNN)Two Los Angeles police officers were wounded in gunfire late Sunday, and police told local media they believe the officers were targeted. They were on duty in South L.A., when gunfire erupted in the early evening, grazing both of them, said Officer Cory Meisner. They both sustained minor injuries and were treated at the scene. One of the officers had to have bullet fragments removed from his arm later, according to the LAPD. The Los Angeles Times reported that the officers had been driving through the neighborhood dressed in plain clothes. The officers returned fire, and several suspects scattered, Det. Meghan Aguilar told the newspaper, adding that the officers believed that they were targeted. But a public information officer for the LAPD disputes that possibility. ""The officers were in plain clothes,"" Rosario Herrera told CNN.  ""This cannot be called targeting.  The narcotics officers from the 77th  division were driving in an unmarked police vehicle around 64th and Broadway when they were shot at and they returned fire."" Three individuals were detained for questioning, according to Herrera, but were not arrested.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)For Iowa's economy, corn is everything. So it's no surprise that the Republican governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10% in renewable fuels. One of those is ethanol -- with corn often a key ingredient. ""Don't mess with the RFS,"" Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday, offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1 corn-producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar. But it's a less popular policy for small government conservatives, who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector. In his first 2016 visit to Iowa, Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. ""The market's ultimately going to have to decide this,"" he told the audience at the event, which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate, which passed in 2007, has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost corn-heavy economies. ""But as we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest,"" he argued, saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. ""So at some point we'll see a reduction of the RFS need, because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country."" He declined, however, to suggest when exactly that may happen. In his remarks, Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines, he stood by his support for Common Core, the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives. Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray . Bush's frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail, no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences. Still, he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he'll be cooking some ""Iowa beef"" Sunday when he's back home with his family in Florida, adding that he'll probably make some ""really good guacamole,"" too. Talking about campaigning for his father's presidential campaigns in Iowa, Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. ""I remember eating really well -- eating really, really well."" With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage, each candidate sat on stage for a 20-minute Q&A with Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1,200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry. While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it, saying Washington shouldn't be ""picking winners and losers."" ""I have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies, asking for special favors,"" he said. ""I think that's how we got in this problem to begin win."" Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations, consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government's support to break through oil's stronghold of the market. Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn't be well-received, but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity. ""Look, I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you'd like me to give is, 'I'm for the RFS, darn it.' That'd be the easy thing to do. But I'll tell ya, people are pretty fed up, I think, with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing, tell another group another thing."" Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline, that's fine, he said, but not the federal government. ""I philosophically don't agree that Washington, D.C. needs to be making these decision that affect ... our agriculture industry,"" Perry said. Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said he ""absolutely"" supports the RFS. ""That's what the law requires. So let's make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum,"" he said, drawing applause from the crowd. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, ticked off what he called a ""laundry list"" of benefits, including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers. ""It is very important for rural Americans,"" said the former senator from Pennsylvania. For his part, Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security. ""America needs to do three things to be free: feed itself, fuel itself, fight for itself,"" the former Arkansas governor said, adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States. Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons. ""The decisions are made not just frankly for what's best for Iowa -- that's not the rationale. You can't make a decision and say, 'It's good for Iowa. Gee, they're the caucus state, we better suck up to them.' We better make decisions that are good for every consumer,"" he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who's had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January, made clear that while he's generally a free market guy, he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance. ""Right now, we don't have a free and open marketplace, and so that's why I'm willing to take that position,"" he said. But, similar to Bush, Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and ""you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies."" The audience at Saturday's event was largely subdued, given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance, less red meat. Those who supported the RFS, however, received a strong response from the crowd. As for those who opposed it, Bill Couser, who co-chairs a campaign called America's Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate, said he's not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months. ""Maybe I didn't like a few of their answers, but it's going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues,"" he said.","Iowa politicians, residents very protective of corn's role in their economy .

"(CNN)A British boy whose parents were once arrested for pulling him out of a hospital now appears to be free of cancer, a family spokesman said Monday. Ashya King, 5, had proton beam therapy and appears to have had no cancer for months, Jonathan Hartley said. Is proton therapy the 'magic bullet' for cancer? The family is in Spain. Ashya's parents, Brett and Naghmeh King, are afraid to return to the United Kingdom for fear of arrest, though they are in talks to return, Hartley said. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said in September that it would not arrest the parents. That announcement came after they were arrested in Spain while authorities decided whether to charge them and extradite them to Britain. The Kings had serious concerns about the medical treatment that Ashya was receiving at University Hospital Southampton. So they defied doctors' orders and took him out. Dr. Hernan Cortes Funes, who's overseeing Ashya's treatment, agrees with the assessment that Ashya is cancer-free, he told CNN on Monday. Still, there is a high chance of recurrence, he said. Funes gave CNN details: . In August, Ashya had surgery in Britain to remove the tumor. The kind of tumor Ashya had is very aggressive and can often relapse in the brain or the spinal cord. The standard treatment is radiotherapy in the brain and spinal cord, which can cause serious side effects or even death. Ashya's parents wanted to instead do a new proton therapy, which is conducted by only a few sites in Europe. One is in the Czech Republic. Since Ashya was born in Marbella, southern Spain, his family contacted a hospital there and then took Ashya to have proton therapy in  Prague in September. The next month, the boy began rehabilitation in Marbella. Initially after the proton therapy, Ashya was mute and had no movement. But after three months of intensive treatment, he can walk generally unaided. He has also been swimming and playing with toys, Funes said. His family comes to see him every day. Ashya has difficulty speaking but continues to improve. He can say a few words, and he can give simple answers when asked questions such as whether he is hungry. Medical officials in Madrid will make a molecular profile of the tumor that was removed to help identify the risk of relapse. Doctors have requested a sample from Southampton. The surgery conducted in Southampton was excellent, Funes said.","Ashya King, 5, had proton beam therapy, Jonathan Hartley says .

"(CNN)An unseasonably warm winter has left parts of Alaska's Iditarod trail without snow, exposing grass and gravel and forcing the famous dogsled race to move 225 miles north. Opening ceremonies in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kick off Saturday in Anchorage. When the race begins Monday, mushers will cross the starting line in Fairbanks instead of Willow, the traditional starting point. It's the second time in the race's 43-year history that the starting point has moved from Willow to Fairbanks because of weather-related issues, an Iditarod spokesperson said. The first time was in 2003. While cities across the northeastern United States have seen record snowfall this winter, Alaska received less snow than usual. Anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season, compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches. Race organizers made the unanimous decision in February to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas, and ""therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race,"" Iditarod Chief Executive Stan Hooley said in a press release. While snow has fallen east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it, Hooley told CNN affiliate KTVA-TV in February. The racing course spans a 1,000-mile trail across the Arctic tundra, ending in Nome. The race usually takes 10 days to finish, although Dallas Seavey finished the race in 2014 in a record time of eight days, 13 hours, four seconds, and 19 minutes. The lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the Pacific to the region, said meteorologist  Dave Snider with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. ""It's the same weather pattern that brought the east coast such snowy and cold weather this season.  Alaska was simply on the warmer side of this weather pattern,"" he said. Warm sea surface temperatures along the Alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions, he added.","Alaska's famed Iditarod race starts Saturday .

"(CNN)When an officer kills an unarmed suspect, the question arises time and again: Can a police department investigate a high-stakes case involving one of its own, without bias? For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. ""The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,"" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. ""I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,"" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. ""We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that."" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires ""an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death."" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. ""Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,"" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. ""This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. ""Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,"" she said. ""There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed."" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. ""Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,"" he said. ""And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.""There are ""powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,"" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. ""For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,"" he said. ""If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system."" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.  The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged in the death, but he was fired for not following protocol. Robinson's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police: Michael Brown, who was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo. But there are stark differences between Robinson's case and the two others. After Brown's death in August, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson asked the neighboring St. Louis County Police Department to investigate. The case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like  in Garner's case. ""The decisions of grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown raised two primary concerns,"" the NCSL said. ""First, many were worried that since the evidence on which grand juries base their assessment is sealed, there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of their decisions. ""Second, there was apprehension over the decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in either case. Some are concerned that police may receive favorable treatment due to the close proximity in which law enforcement and district attorneys work."" Robinson's case won't just by handled by state investigators; it'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney's office, Koval said. ""The State of Wisconsin's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics, interviews, technology feeds, etc.,"" Koval wrote on his official blog. ""This investigation is then turned directly over to the second layer of review, the District Attorney's Office, who then makes a ruling on the question of whether there is criminal culpability on the part of my officer."" After the deaths of Brown and Garner, President Barack Obama announced the ""Task Force on 21st Century Policing,"" aimed at strengthening trust between communities and officers and identifying which practices can be improved. The task force's interim report, released this month, calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer-related deaths. ""The importance of making sure that the sense of accountability when, in fact, law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to need to consider,"" Obama said. ""We have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Julie In and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Wisconsin state investigators -- not local police -- will investigate Tony Robinson's killing by officer .

"(CNN)The terror that came to Tunisia on Wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor, Egypt -- was a long time coming. Tunisia has been widely seen as the only success story of the Arab Spring with a new progressive constitution, a freely elected secular President and Prime Minister, and a moderate Islamist opposition so far committed to democratic principles. But economic progress has lagged well behind. High unemployment has created frustrations among the young and a significant number have looked for answers in radical Islam. Political opening in Tunisia has given radicals more breathing room, their numbers swollen by the release hardened Islamist militants during the 2011 Tunisian revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule. One of those who was freed from jail was Seifallah ben Hassine -- also known as Abu Iyyad -- a veteran Tunisian Jihadi who worked with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1990s and founded the Tunisian Combatant group. Soon after he was released he founded Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia, a pro-Jihadi movement which has up to 40,000 followers. The group has a similar outlook to its namesake in Libya which the United States says carried out the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, and according to Geoff Porter, a terrorism expert at North Africa Risk Consulting, there are real and fluid links between the two groups. Three days after the Beghazi attack, Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia organized a mob attack outside the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia which put American lives at risk. According to the U.S. government, the group has also been responsible for several other attacks, including attempted suicide bombings at Tunisian tourist destinations. In October 2013, a Tunisian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in Sousse, killing only himself. Another was arrested in Monastir before he could blow up his device. The two had reportedly tried to travel to Syria but had been persuaded enroute by Jihadis in Libya to bring Jihad home. In 2013 two secular Tunisian politicians were assassinated by Islamist extremists.  The United States said Ansar al Shariah was implicated in the attacks. In the last two years, Tunisian security forces have increasingly cracked down on Ansar al Shariah, but the movement still has a significant following. Ben Hassine fled to Libya where he is now believed to be based. The Syrian Jihad has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in Tunisia. Over 3000 Tunisians have flocked to fight Jihad in Syria and Iraq, many of them joining ISIS. And about 500 are believed to have returned stretching the resources of security services. In December 2014 ISIS released a video calling on Tunisians to pledge allegiance to ISIS and carry out attacks, including assassinations. The Tunis museum attack took place just days after a Tunisian Jihadi tweeted that a pledge of allegiance by Tunisian Jihadis to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was coming soon, according to the SITE intelligence group. The Tunisian Jihadi who posted the message Sunday claimed to belong to ""Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia."" In December, a grouping by the same name had pledged allegiance to ISIS. But the earlier pledge appears not to have fully registered with ISIS.  An ISIS fighter in Raqqah, recently appeared in a video questioning why Jihadis in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. The Tunisian Jihadi replied ""Wait for the glad tidings of what will bring you joy. ... The delay of the public pledge of allegiance was for the sake of preparation."" The statement raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS's debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian Jihadis for maximum impact. While pro-ISIS twitter accounts lit up in celebration after the museum attack, there had been no credible claims of responsibility as of late Wednesday. Tunisian security officials are worried about spillover from an increasingly chaotic Libya.  ISIS has taken advantage of a simmering civil war in Tunisia's neighbor to rapidly expand. It is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. And it has built an increasingly significant presence in Tripoli itself, carrying out a gun attack on the Corinthia Hotel in January. A number of Tunisians are also believed to be training with ISIS in a half dozen training camps the group operates in the Green Mountains between Benghazi and Derna in eastern Libya. In late 2012 al Qaeda's North African affiliate AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group is believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces. The Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border. ""They have been the most active terrorist organization in Tunisia to date,"" Porter told CNN. ""It is rumored, but not confirmed, that they are getting additional personnel from Algeria because members of AQIM in Algeria have been fleeing intensified Algerian military operations."" Andrew Lebovich, a North Africa security analyst based in New York told CNN that the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade issued a statement late last year threatening to attack Tunis. ""Most of their attacks have been in the Djebel Chaambi region but it's possible they have extended their operations closer to the capital,"" he said. The museum attack is the biggest crisis faced by Tunisia since the revolution. It is likely to significantly impact Tunisia's tourism industry, worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive. There is also concern Tunisian security forces, traumatized by the attack on the capital, could once again embrace repression in their struggle to contain the Jihadi threat. ""The Parliament was debating tougher anti-terrorism laws when the museum attack took place. The worry now is that Tunisia's security services will crack down hard on Islamists increasing tensions and making the problem far worse,"" Lebovich told CNN.","Tunisia was widely seen as only success story of Arab Spring .

Terror has been percolating in the region for a while, stoked by regional unrest ."
"(CNN)Tampa police have arrested a pair of teenagers in last week's shooting of a young pit bull mix that was left for dead. The 17-year-olds face aggravated animal cruelty and armed trespassing charges after tying the hound, now named Cabela, to railroad tracks and shooting her multiple times. Surveillance video from the area showed a group of individuals walking the dog along the tracks in the city's Sulphur Springs neighborhood before later running away, said Detective Patrick Messmer. Neighbors heard gunshots and police were called. Cabela was purchased to be used in dog fighting, but she wasn't any good at it so they wanted to get rid of her, according to Messmer. ""This appears to be an isolated incident,"" he said.  ""It doesn't appear that there was a large amount of dog fighting that goes on in the neighborhood."" On March 5, police found Cabela tightly tied to the tracks and shot three times -- twice in the neck and once in the shoulder. ""Nothing gets you ready ... to see a dog -- a helpless animal -- tied so tight to a railroad track around the neck that it's literally pinned down,"" said Sgt. Rich Mills, who freed her. ""She was literally pinned down. She could not get away even if she tried."" Once freed, Mills rushed Cabela to Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center. Initially, it was thought the young dog would have to her right front leg amputated because the damage was so severe, but a metal rod was inserted and she's recovering. In fact, Cabela's already walking on her repaired leg. Rehabilitation will take four to six weeks, according to Dr. Jamie Davidson.

"(CNN)It's probably the most important advice Nigerian movie superstar Ramsey Nouah ever received: ""My friend said,"" Nouah recalls,""'you look like a great actor, why don't you act?'"" That was some 25 years ago, when Nouah was looking for funds to cover his school examination fees. Nouah took his friend's suggestion and started auditioning for TV shows. He quickly landed a role in a successful soap opera, and soon after he made his debut in Nollywood, Nigeria's mighty movie making machine. Today, Nouah is one of the industry's most popular names, having starred in dozens of films and won several accolades. His latest movie -- ""Thy Will Be Done,"" by director Obi Emelonye -- became last month the first Nollywood film to premiere at London's BFI IMAX, Britain's biggest cinema screen. CNN's African Voices caught up with Nouah to talk about Nigeria's film industry and present him with the questions you sent via the #AskRamsey and #CNNAfrica hashtags. CNN: How have you seen Nollywood change and grow over the years? Ramsey Nouah: There have been several phases in Nollywood, like in everything in life. We started off Nollywood almost like making bread out of stone; there was nothing, no investment, no structure, nothing on the ground to actually help the industry but we've brought it this far and we are very happy. CNN: How do you see the political situation in Nigeria and what do you think about the recent security tensions? RN: I find it quite dicey, it's a case of uncertainty, not knowing what is going to happen ...however I'm actually endorsing the present government because he [president Goodluck Jonathan] has contributed immensely to the growth of our industry -- call me selfish call me what but I've been in this industry for 25 years, no government ever spoke about my industry like this one. He gave us audience, he listened to us, he gave several grants to help the industry, he sent so many of the practitioners outside to big film schools ... he's giving money for distribution -- so for all these reasons. There was a point where there was a nosedive, when it was hitting the rocks because it was predominantly dependent on DVDs, and the quality of the production was poor. It was successful up to a point until piracy came in and intellectual properties weren't protected and practitioners weren't getting their worth. But now there is the cinema, which is growing drastically in Nigeria and that has really helped bring back Nollywood. So I would say right now it's getting better ... because cinema culture is beginning to come -- if you're going to shoot a cinema movie then you've got to be thinking about the quality of the production and of the story. CNN: So what have you learned throughout this journey? RN: I learned a whole lot of lessons, when the chips were high -- many people knew me and everything but I was so deeply passionate about the industry that I wanted growth and I wanted something better. I wanted Nollywood to look like Hollywood and Bollywood, I wanted it to have that appeal ... and at some point in my industry it wasn't happening. Because I'm one of the very top actors, knowing that with my influence I could make a difference, I decided at some point ... to be like ""look guys, lets upgrade, the new technologies are coming,  how do we move forward."" Most of the people I was working with wanted to live in that mindset, and I felt ""no, I need to make a change,""... and then I was just picking movies deliberately that I knew would stand the test of time as I grow old. Ramsey Nouah: I think my greatest inspiration is my passion for my art. My passion is my major drive, I love what I do and I like the competition, I like the circumstances that surround my industry and how to make it better -- if it was too easy and too fluid, maybe if it wasn't as challenging, my passion would have died but I think the challenges make it stronger for me. Ramsey Nouah: I'm not very certain -- I've come to learn about life that never say never. I was thinking maybe in the next 10 years I'll probably be behind the camera, directing and working on my own flicks but at the same time,of course, if in the next 10 years I am still good enough to tell a story and get into characters then I will still be there acting. Besides that, of course, humanitarian stuff mostly. Ramsey Nouah: I think it's a public service kind of thing that everyone is beginning to think that ""OK, we can make a change"" ... and most of my colleagues are thinking, ""if people believe in me that I can do it then I can make it happen."" For me, I'm too much of a creative person than a politician so it's going to be really hard, but I never say never ... I'm not ruling it out and I'm not saying that I'm keen or I'm going to go there. Ramsey Nouah: I stay under the radar (laughs). I don't know I'm not a scandalous person by nature so I guess that's what it is. Ramsey Nouah: Yes, yes my pair, my partner -- of course, I will, some time hopefully soon, we're looking forward to working on another very good blockbuster some time in the future. Ramsey Nouah: I am spearheading the ""New Nollywood,"" so it's more of getting a good production out and getting a good production out is quite capital intensive. You need investors and you need to explain to the investors and let them know what they're going to benefit if they do get involved. So it's a long thing, unlike how we just used to do cheap movies and it was like quick -- people could actually tell most of our stories from the beginning, they could tell the end already. I want that to change, hence I don't do too many of them movies anymore, but the cinema movies are now coming out and when that starts to come out then it would give room to people getting more from the movies. Ramsey Nouah: I usually like to unwind by playing my sports: I like to play squash a lot, and I love adventure so basically when I'm not working I like to do crazy things, the things that people would least except that I'd want to do like skydiving ,bungee jumping, mountain climbing, all of those things.

"(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. ""Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,"" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. ""It couldn't be done without it."" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker ""The Money Man"" or ""TBE"" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. ""I think they're both playing their roles,"" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. ""You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation."" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? ""If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, "" says Sauerland. ""But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history."" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. ""Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,"" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. ""If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,"" McLaren says. ""So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer."" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. ""A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,"" he says. ""If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer."" Sauerland agrees. ""Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,"" he says. ""It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar."" ""It'll be an interesting fight,"" adds McLaren, ""just because they are so different.""","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao bout set to be the largest purse in boxing history .

"(CNN)Israel has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one-fifth of its country's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat. We were born into the wrong tribe, so to speak. Campaign season shed light on the troubling reality in Israel -- that tribalism trumps democracy and ethnicity trumps citizenship. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Arabs were ""being bused to the polling station in droves,"" people around the world were justifiably horrified. And Monday, in response to the outrage, he apologized for his statement, offering that he knew his comments ""offended members of the Israeli Arab community."" But Netanyahu's policies speak much more loudly than his half-apology. And with him poised to serve a fourth term, many Palestinian citizens of Israel fear, with good reason, that his victory means it is open season for anti-Arab racism in the Knesset and in the streets. Israel's war on its Palestinian citizens is nothing new; our rights have been under attack for years (imagine a proposal that forced Jewish Americans to sign a ""loyalty oath"" to the United States as was proposed for Palestinians and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel). However, the majority's attempt to further entrench institutionalized racism and deny the rights of indigenous Palestinians has achieved frightening momentum. The controversial ""Jewish Nation-State Bill"" that previously floundered in the Knesset has been resurrected. The bill, if passed, would codify the principle of preserving a Jewish ethnic majority. There are versions of it that establish Hebrew as the sole official language and recognize Jewish religious law as a ""source of inspiration for the Knesset."" Even Israel's Supreme Court has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights, which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its Jewish citizens. In response, the government changed the Supreme Court's composition to tilt it further to the right. Today, the sole Arab Supreme Court justice, Salim Jubran, very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to Israel's Palestinian citizens. Opinion: How Obama handed Netanyahu victory . The 2011 Admissions Committees Law — upheld in 2014 by the more conservative  Supreme Court, which includes the first Israeli settler jurist — allows hundreds of localities in Israel to essentially reject applicants seeking to buy homes built on state land because the applicants are deemed ""unsuitable.""  The law caused an outcry among Palestinian citizens and human rights groups, who assert that it's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against Israeli citizens on the basis of ethnicity. Simply put, the law enforces segregation within Israel, helping to keep Palestinian citizens out of Jewish communities. Attempts to marginalize Palestinian citizens of Israel also extend to the political sphere. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's successful push to raise the threshold required to win seats in the Knesset was a move designed to exclude Palestinian lawmakers. Ironically, that move backfired, prompting four Arab parties to create the Arab Joint List, whose members span a wide ideological spectrum. Despite their political differences, they were united by one important mission, and that was to defend the rights of Palestinians, whether they reside within Israel or in the occupied territories. The Joint List won 13 seats and took third place in the parliamentary election. While their unity and strong showing is encouraging in the face of Israeli efforts to divide and weaken the Palestinian community, the fact that they were forced to unite on the basis of ethnicity rather than ideology is a reflection of Israeli politics, which draws boundaries among its citizens on the basis of ethnicity and religion and openly participates in ugly, xenophobic electioneering. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The Greek philosopher Aristotle once said that the essence of democracy is ""to rule and be ruled in turn,"" but as Hassan Jabareen, head of Adalah: The Legal Center for Minority Rights in Israel, puts it, in Israel, ""Arabs are always ruled and Arab citizens are always in the opposition, never in the coalition, no matter how many seats they win."" It is very telling that Netanyahu could well form his coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, who called for beheading disloyal Arab citizens of Israel and whose party Yisrael Beiteinu only won six seats in the Knesset, and not with the Arab Joint List, which won more than twice as many seats and is calling for equality and an end to Israel's military occupation of Palestinian lands, which has lasted nearly half a century. If Netanyahu's re-election is an ill omen for the Palestinian citizens of Israel, it is even worse news for the 4.5 million Palestinians under occupation who are ruled by a state that denies them all rights. When Netanyahu said on the eve of the election that he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state, he was making it clear that the occupation will continue as long as he remains in power. Opinion: The danger of Netanyahu's win . Renouncing Palestinian statehood rallied Netanyahu's base by reminding them of how much he has done to preserve and extend Israel's grip on its West Bank settlements, built in violation of international law and considered illegitimate by official U.S. policy going back decades. In fact, blocking the creation of a Palestinian state has been Netanyahu's life's work. Over the years, he has rhetorically ""accepted"" Palestinian statehood while continuing to steal the very land that would comprise a Palestinian state. The lip service he has paid to Palestinian statehood and his desire to return to the bankrupt ""peace process"" has provided him with a useful smokescreen behind which he continues to actively realize the vision he revealed in his recent political campaign when he ruled out a two-state solution -- a vision of a greater Israel where Palestinians live under apartheid rule, without a state and without equal rights . The policies that Israel's electorate has chosen are directly at odds with U.S. interests, not to mention American values. Citizens around the world, including in the United States, are increasingly frustrated with Israel's treatment of Palestinians and its role in helping to fuel armed conflict in the region, as demonstrated by its current effort to scuttle U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. Netanyahu is expecting to attempt to resume business as usual with Washington, offering occasional platitudes about peace in exchange for the freedom to deepen the occupation and strip away the rights of Israel's Palestinian citizens. Given what is at stake, it will be dangerous for America -- and for Israel -- if President Obama plays along.","Rula Jebreal: Netanyahu showed his views during the closing days of the campaign .

"(CNN)You may have heard that Israeli politics is extremely complex. But one of the most important forces at play there is actually rather straightforward: When Israelis feel safe and strong they tend to support moderate parties. When they feel vulnerable they move to the right. Understand that, and you will understand Israel -- and why President Barack Obama may have inadvertently given Benjamin Netanyahu a helping hand. Israelis know they need American support to survive in a hostile, increasingly unstable and radicalized neighborhood, but they don't believe they can trust Obama to help keep them safe. And the president, despite taking numerous measures to support the Jewish state, has done a dismal job of persuading Israelis that he has their back. This reality helps explain how Netanyahu and his rightist Likud party pulled off an upset victory this week, despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition Zionist Union heading into Tuesday's election. Clearly, it's not all Obama's fault. Netanyahu's opponents also failed to address security issues, believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough. And Netanyahu is a skilled, articulate and shrewd politician. But Obama, like it or not, was one of the reasons for Likud's success. When Netanyahu traveled to Washington a couple of weeks ago to warn the U.S. Congress about an impending ""bad deal"" with Iran over its nuclear program, Obama refused to meet with him, claiming he didn't want to influence Israel's elections. Few believed this was the real reason -- it's no secret the two men don't particularly like one another. Through much of his presidency, Obama has failed to convince Israelis thay they can trust him. And his handling of the recent spat with Netanyahu only added to the problem. By appearing to dismiss Netanyahu's warning of a ""nuclear nightmare"" over the Iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no ""viable alternatives,"" Obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious Israelis that the United States will safeguard their survival. His tacit acknowledgment that there might be no alternative to an imperfect deal was of little comfort to Israelis who have spent years hearing genocidal threats from the Iranian regime. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The fact that Obama has become one of the key reasons why Netanyahu continues to win elections in Israel is ironic considering Israelis are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the United States, a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country's survival. One recent poll showed only 37% of Israelis believe Obama has a ""positive"" position towards Israel, a mood that has undoubtedly helped Netanyahu enormously, despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said Netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with Washington, and despite Israelis saying close relations with the United States are the second most important factor for Israel's security, behind only Israel's own military strength. All this left a genuine opening for Obama to influence the Israeli electorate, because Israelis desperately want to trust the American president -- and they remain America's biggest, most loyal fans, according to a recent Pew poll. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory . Yet despite the positive sentiment in principle, Israeli voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that Obama has their best interests at heart. This point was underscored in a recent poll that asked Israelis recently if they believed President Obama would agree to a deal that Israeli officials considered harmful to Israel's security. Of those that responded, 61% said yes, he would do so. However, 95% of Labor supporters said no, Obama would do no such thing, while 93% of Likud voters said they believed Obama would disregard Israel's security. The worry over security extends beyond a nuclear deal with Iran to include the other key foreign policy issue -- the possibility of a Palestinian state. A majority of Israelis still support the creation of two states, one for Israelis and another for Palestinians. And despite the last-minute statements from Netanyahu dismissing the idea, it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown Israelis continue to support the establishment of a Palestinian state, as long as Israel's security can be assured. The trouble is that right now, many Israelis don't believe they can preserve their security with a Palestinian state just a few miles from their major cities, not least because previous territorial withdrawals -- from Gaza and from southern Lebanon -- have simply created launch pads for attacks against Israel. So when rightist leaders such as Netanyahu say Israelis will not be safe with a Palestinian state, voters are inclined to believe them. All this suggests that if Obama wants to persuade the Israeli public to push its government towards compromise, he needs to rebuild the public's trust in him. Israelis want peace, but they also need to be reassured that their safety and survival is a paramount concern of their U.S. ally. And if President Obama cannot assure them of this? Well, they will simply wait until there is a president they feel they can trust. It's not that complicated.","Benjamin Netanyahu secured re-election in Israeli election on Tuesday .

"(CNN)A Georgia police chief who said he accidentally shot and seriously injured his wife while the couple were sleeping in bed has resigned, the Peachtree City Police Department said Wednesday. William McCollom stepped down as chief of police in Peachtree City nearly a week after a prosecutor announced that although the New Year's Day shooting appeared accidental, McCollom could eventually face a misdemeanor charge accusing him of recklessly taking a gun to bed after drinking alcohol and taking sleeping medication. The shooting in Peachtree City, an upscale community of 35,000 people south of Atlanta, left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist. ""I have had had two families in Peachtree City -- my police family and my personal family. In light of the recent tragedy in my personal family, I need to continue to focus my time and efforts there,"" William McCollom said in a message posted Wednesday on the police department's Facebook page. Medics and police rushed to the McColloms' home early on January 1 after the chief called 911 to say he accidentally shot his wife as both were sleeping -- by inadvertently moving a gun that he had taken to bed with him. ""The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, put it to the side, and it went off,"" McCollom says in a recording of the 911 call. Later in the call, the operator asked McCollom, ""Were you asleep also when this happened?"" ""Yes,"" the chief, 57 at the time, replied. Last week, Scott Ballard, district attorney for a several-county area that includes Peachtree City, said a Georgia Bureau of Investigation probe found the following: . -- McCollom went to bed on New Year's Eve after consuming alcohol and sleep medication. -- After barking dogs awoke him in the middle of the night, he got up, picked up his Glock 9mm gun from a dresser and checked the house. After finding nothing, he returned to bed, placing the gun under the sheets. -- McCollom woke up to the sound of a gunshot that struck his wife's right side. A wound on his right hand corroborates his claim that his palm blocked the ejection of a spent shell. -- Forensic analysis of the sheets shows that the gun was fired from under the sheets. Investigators concluded there was no evidence to suggest McCollum intentionally shot his wife, and that he didn't appear to have any motive to harm her, Ballard said. Still, Ballard said he would ask a grand jury on April 15 to indict McCollum on a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct, ""since the chief took a loaded gun to bed with him after ingesting alcohol and sleep medication."" Margaret McCollom has been staying at a spinal cord rehabilitation center, being treated for paralysis below the waist and other complications, Ballard said last week. McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, CNN affiliate WSB reported. Magazines and websites regularly rank Peachtree City as one of the best places to live and raise a family. The community's trademark: Residents putter around in golf carts on the community's 90-plus miles of paved pathways.

"(CNN)The owner of a Chinese restaurant in Nairobi, Kenya has been arrested following an uproar over its policy of banning African customers at night, according to reports. Owner Zhao Yang was arrested for operating a restaurant without a valid license shortly after local press ran a story alleging that Kenyan reporters were turned away from the restaurant -- for being African. Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper carried a story Monday that its reporters had been barred entry to the restaurant, being told by a guard at the entrance that ""the time for Africans is over"" when the journalists arrived at 7 p.m. Only locals accompanied by Chinese, European or Indian patrons would be admitted, the newspaper reported. It also reported that two local politicians, ""loyal patrons"" Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and former Cabinet Minister Raphael Tuju, had been admitted, the latter being a friend of the owner. Kenyan social media users were quickly up in arms about the ban, taking to Facebook and Twitter to voice their displeasure, using the hashtag #noblacksallowed. The establishment, known only as Chinese Restaurant, in the Kilimani neighborhood of Nairobi, has subsequently been closed after it transpired that it lacked several necessary licenses, said reports. The Daily Nation reported that the Chinese-owned eatery lacked liquor, health or change-of-use licences -- the latter needed as the property had been converted from a residence to a restaurant. Co-owner and restaurant manager Esther Zhao told the newspaper that the ""no Africans at night"" policy had its roots in security concerns. ""We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't,"" she said, referencing the Islamist militant group that is active in Kenya and neighboring Somalia. ""It is not like it is written on somebody's face that they are a thug armed with a gun,"" she said. The restaurant's owners appeared to admit culpability in a statement reproduced in the newspaper. ""Because of the concern of the business environment at night and the bad memory of (a robbery in) 2013, we adopted certain measures. Unfortunately, some of the measures were inappropriate, we sincerely apologize for this,"" the management said in a statement. China is the largest outside investor in African economies but resentment against Chinese in Kenya and other African nations is significant as many Africans often regard Chinese businesses as, in the words of one Chinese journalist, ""resource predators"" or ""environmental vandals."" One Kenyan reporter commenting on the restaurant's ban likened the policy to a new form of colonialism in Africa.

"(CNN)Some viewers of the iHeartRadio Music Awards on Sunday night took to social media to vent about the opening monologue, saying one controversial joke by Jamie Foxx crossed the line.

""We got some groundbreaking performances, here too, tonight,"" Foxx said. ""We got Bruce Jenner, who will be doing some musical performances. He's doing a his-and-her duet all by himself."" There have been reports that Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist, plans to transition from male to female. However, Jenner has not spoken publicly about any such possibility.

Foxx's joke wasn't the only part of the show that made headlines. Pop princess Taylor Swift continued her recent hot streak by winning artist of the year and song of the year for her hit ""Shake It Off."" Swift also played guitar onstage while Madonna sang her new song, ""Rebel Heart."" And Justin Timberlake received the iHeartRadio Innovator Award for his achievements as an entertainer.

They called me weird,"" he said in accepting the award. ""Thankfully my mother taught me that being different was a good thing. That being different meant you could actually make a difference so I wanna thank my mom..."" In his monologue, Foxx also took potshots at the ""Blurred Lines"" copyright-infringement battle and the health of a famous 1990s record executive. Those jokes found more acceptance than the Jenner quip. ""Marvin Gaye had the number one song, featuring Pharrell (Williams) and Robin Thicke,"" Foxx said, setting up for his punch line: . ""Marvin Gaye just made $7.4 million just last week. He's making beats in heaven. It's crazy,"" he joked. ""He might be dead, but he ain't dead broke."" Gaye's children had sued Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke over the 2013 hit ""Blurred Lines,"" which jurors decided borrowed elements from Gaye's soul classic ""Got to Give It Up.""

The crowd laughed again when Foxx turned to Death Row Records founder Marion ""Suge"" Knight, who has been charged with murder in the hit-and-run death of a man run over by a truck. ""He will not be here tonight,"" Foxx said of Knight. ""He founded Tha Dogg Pound, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and now he needs a seeing-eye dog.""

"(CNN)Blame it on Beyonce. Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out ""If You're Reading This, It's Too Late."" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled ""Jungle."" U2 . The shock in the band's album ""Songs of Innocence"" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement.

"(CNN)The health of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday. The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. ""Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,"" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. ""We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,"" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.","Health of Singapore's first prime minister deteriorating .

"(CNN)On Saturday, just hours after four suicide bombers set off a series of blasts in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri that left at least fifty people dead and scores more wounded, the militant organization thought responsible for the attacks, Boko Haram, reportedly announced that it was swearing allegiance to the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). According to a report quoting the SITE extremist monitoring organization, an audio recording purportedly from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, hailed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as ""caliph"" and declared: ""We announce our allegiance to the Caliph...and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity."" This latest development is not entirely unexpected given the increasing convergence between the two groups over the course of the last year as well as the severe pressure that the militaries of Nigeria and its neighbors have recently (if somewhat belatedly) brought to bear on it. In fact, the ""shout-outs"" exchanged regularly between Boko Haram and ISIS were not just rhetorical flourishes, but indicative of a veritable courtship as the former appropriated more and more of the latter's symbolism, tactics, and ideology. This isn't the first time that Boko Haram has adapted itself to conform with a larger extremist network that could aid it: previously the group underwent a similar evolution after Shekau took over from its slain founder, Muhammad Yusuf, in 2009 and aligned it with al-Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which gave Boko Haram training as well as facilitated its carrying out of Nigeria's first suicide bombings in 2011. Despite the assistance that Boko Haram received from AQIM and other aligned groups in the years since, the Nigerian militants' ideology and brutal tactics have progressively drawn closer to those of ISIS. Like ISIS, Boko Haram has progressed far beyond asymmetric terrorist attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in its successfully overrunning and effectively controlling large parts in northeastern Nigeria and displacing millions of people. Just two weeks ago, in his most recent annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned the U.S. Congress that ""Boko Haram will probably continue to solidify its control over its self-declared Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria and expand its terror campaign into neighboring Nigerian states, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad."" The timing of Shekau's pledge of allegiance is not without its strategic logic. Notwithstanding its string of victories through the beginning of this year, Boko Haram has been reeling in recent weeks from a series of military defeats at the hands of the Nigerian armed forces as well as a multinational force from neighboring countries, including Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. The Nigerian government and its regional allies have been pushing back and, in quite a number of instances, retaking towns. Likewise, ISIS has seen its rampage through Syria and Iraq stall and it has increasingly been put on the defensive by operations like the massive Iranian-backed Iraqi offensive to retake Tikrit this past week. Thus for both groups the new linkage provides a much-needed propaganda fillip at a just the right moment. So what does the pledge mean moving forward? At least in the short term, the merger will not have much immediate impact on the battlefield: the different social and political contexts in which each operates and the vast geographical distance separating the two groups means that each will have to face its foes with little more than moral support from each other, notwithstanding some evidence of possible collaboration in cyberspace and in terms of media production. However, finding the military noose tightening around him, and with the approbation of his new ISIS overlord who has embraced all manner of brutal tactics ranging from mass kidnappings and executions to the burning alive of a captured Jordanian pilot, Shekau can be expected to give even freer rein to the gruesome tactics for which he stands out, even among company such as this. And with Nigerians scheduled to cast ballots in a hotly contested presidential election on March 28, it is virtually guaranteed that militants, who reject democratic politics along with other ""infidel"" ideas, will target the electioneering and voting processes as well as try to exploit whatever disputes and tensions arise from them. Saturday's quadruple bombing in Maiduguri may just be the start of an intensified campaign of terrorist attacks. Over time, however, it could lead to the internationalization of a threat that has up to now largely been confined geographically. There is the risk that fighters from North Africa and other areas finding it harder to migrate to the ISIS caliphate's territory in the Levant, may well choose to move to the Boko Haram emirate instead. In fact, the international support recently pouring in for the multinational African anti-Boko Haram force from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and others may render the Nigerian militants' fight all the more attractive to these foreign jihadists. On the other hand, Boko Haram's success as a movement has largely been the result of its denunciations of the Nigerian political elites resonating with the many ordinary citizens as well as its ethnic appeal to the Kanuri population in particular, both of which advantages could be lost if it becomes merely another ""province"" of a far-flung ""Islamic State"" focused on a broader jihadist cause. All this suggests that it remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of affiliation with ISIS -- including possible new streams of recruits, funding, and media and other support -- will offset Boko Haram's recent battlefield losses or outweigh the damage that it will incur as result, including greater attention from Western militaries and security agencies. What is clear, however, is that Boko Haram has shown once again that it remains one of the fastest-evolving jihadist groups, one that bears close watching not only for its challenge to the security of Africa's most populous country and its biggest economy, but for its not insignificant threat to the wider region.","Boko Haram has reportedly pledged its allegiance with ISIS .

"London (CNN)Having been Tony Blair's spokesman and strategist for a decade and more, having been at his side through election campaigns, wars and peace processes, political and personal crises, scandals galore, having spent thousands of hours facing down possibly the most questioning media on the planet, and having done thousands of talks and interviews since leaving TB's side, I am very experienced in answering difficult questions. But right now, I am struggling and I thought a little bit of crowd sourcing with the highly intelligent men -- and especially the women -- who visit CNN.com might help. This is something I would never have considered before the advent of the blogosphere and social media, but where better now to start than at the home of the likes of Christiane Amanpour and Becky Anderson. So here is the situation. As you might know from a chat I had on CNN with Christiane last month, I have written my 11th book. It is called ""Winners: And how they succeed."" It looks at hyper-achievers in sport, business and politics, interviews some of the biggest and most successful names alive -- and analyses some who are dead -- and tries to draw general lessons for all of us. It is going very well thank you. Not least thanks to media interest and a host of events, at which it has been snapped up variously at gatherings for students, business people, football fans, environmentalists and political activists, it has gone within four days of publication to Number 1 in the UK hardback non-fiction charts. I would be lying -- something I am not prone to do whatever the haters may say -- if I said I was not seriously chuffed about this. As my former Downing Street colleague, now of Portland PR, Steve Morris, said at the launch: ""If you write a book called 'Winners' and it goes straight to the charity shops, don't be surprised if people call you a loser."" Fear of failure being a bigger driver for most of my interviewees than any joy in success, this was not something I was prepared to allow. So what is the problem as I look down from the top of the Sunday Times charts at those reviewers who said it was awful? (I would incidentally have preferred no stars in the Mail on Sunday to the one that they gave me. Please take note for next time.) The problem is women, or more precisely how I talk about them. At every single one of the nine or so events I have so far done about the book, and in several of the many interviews, I have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question: ""Do men and women win in different ways?"" And I don't really know what to say. So help me please CNNLand. At the first event, hosted by the Financial Times, my partner Fiona and my daughter Grace were sitting in the front row, squirming as I told how I had written a chapter on the Queen, named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the most impressive current political leader, interviewed and profiled U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour as my main voice on leadership, done the same with Arianna Huffington as a great innovator, talked to gymnast Nadia Comaneci about her ""perfect 10,"" and presented Paralympian athlete and Tanni Grey-Thompson and Australian surfer Layne Beachley as two of the best interviews about resilience. As Grace said afterwards -- well to be honest she heckled me at the time with the words ""shut up Dad, this is embarrassing,"" -- I was answering a question I had not been asked, namely ""why aren't there more women in the book?' rather than the one I had been asked, ""do men and women win in different ways?"" At my next outing, in front of the amazingly bright international postgrad students at Hult International Business School, with Grace not there to heckle, but Fiona sitting three yards from me, the same question came again almost word for word. As the above names were reeled out once more I sensed I needed something more than a list. I needed an argument, the likes of which I used to specialize in framing and honing. So I waffled a bit about glass ceilings and how Fiona's generation had won the battle for women's equality in the eyes of the law but Grace's generation needed to win the battle in terms of the culture of the land. I thought that was quite good, and dare I say a rather decent soundbite. But moderator René Carayol clearly didn't agree and handed his microphone to Fiona to ask her for her view. She said it was still a man's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men. Men also didn't appreciate either that reality, or that it therefore becomes harder for a woman to win than a man in many sets of circumstances. She got a round of applause before the twitterati took to social media to say she had put me in my place. The row in the car on the way home was reasonably good-natured, considering my partner of 36 years was basically confirming I was not a new man and suggesting I talked absolute tosh about whether men and women win in different ways. At my next event, a Labour fundraiser, thankfully neither Fiona nor Grace could make it. So when the same bloody question came up again I started off with my list of names but stupidly mentioned the Queen first promoting a left-leaning chorus of ""for heaven's sake she is hardly typical,"" so that by the time I got to Fiona's point, I was struggling again. God knows what would have happened if I had said Margaret Thatcher was in there, in the section comparing her leadership to David Cameron's (sic). But here is the thing. Afterwards a woman who shall be nameless -- but she does work for Harriet Harman, the chief architect of Labour's new feminism and the proud leader of the pink campaign bus tour (which I love by the way) -- said this to me: ""You have to come back and do more in the campaign. Because I think there is something of a crisis of masculinity in UK politics right now."" In other words there's me trying to get the right answer to a question that has genuinely been troubling me, and an arch feminist says I need to do more of the Alpha Male thing. You can't win, said I. So come on. Help me. This question has come up everywhere I have been. I have more events to do. I have more interviews. And the next time I sit down with CNN's woman winners, Christiane or Becky, I need to have a better answer than the ones I have been deploying thus far. Free signed book and invite to a future event for the best suggestion. Either here in the UK now or in what I believe Americans call the fall when it comes out there.","Alastair Campbell wants CNN users to help him answer the question: ""Do men and women win in different ways?""

"(CNN)Cycling's international governing body for a long time failed to tackle widespread and well-known doping problems in the sport and gave special treatment to Lance Armstrong, according to a damning new report. The investigation by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) slams the way the world body -- the International Cycling Union, or UCI -- operated over a lengthy period and calls for a series of changes to its governance. The report highlights multiple instances in which top UCI officials protected, defended and made decisions favorable to Armstrong despite concerns that he was doping. Current UCI president Brian Cookson, who was elected to his post in September 2013, told CNN Monday that he had written to one of his predecessors, Dutchman Hein Verbruggen, to ""consider his position"" as the honorary president of the world governing body  in the light of the findings. Both Zerbruggen and Irishman Pat McQuaid, who Cookson unseated, both come under intense scrutiny in the report for their dealings with Armstrong. ""UCI exempted Lance Armstrong from rules, failed to target test him despite the suspicions, and publicly supported him against allegations of doping, even as late as 2012,"" it says. The UCI ""saw Lance Armstrong as the perfect choice to lead the sport's renaissance"" after a devastating doping scandal at the 1998 Tour de France, according to the report. ""The fact that he was American opened up a new continent for the sport, he had beaten cancer and the media quickly made him a global star,"" it says. But Armstrong's spectacular downfall in 2012, which saw him stripped of his Tour de France titles and dropped by sponsors, helped intensify scrutiny over how he managed to get away with doping for so long. Under Cookson, the UCI set up the independent three-person commission to investigate the causes of doping in cycling and allegations that the UCI and other governing bodies were ineffective in their responses. In one case, the commission says, the UCI limited the scope of a supposedly independent investigation into allegations that  Armstrong had tested positive in a drug test at the 1999 Tour de France. UCI officials and Armstrong's team became heavily involved in the drafting of the investigation's report, which was released in 2006. ""The main goal was to ensure that the report reflected UCI's and Lance Armstrong's personal conclusions,"" the commission says. ""The significant participation of UCI and Armstrong's team was never publicly acknowledged."" Between 1992 and 2006, UCI's top officials focused on protecting cycling's reputation rather than trying to root out ""endemic"" doping practices of which they were well aware, the commission's report says. ""Not only did UCI leadership publicly disregard the magnitude of the problem, but the policies put in place to combat doping were inadequate,"" it says. The report highlights McQuaid's decision to allow Armstrong to participate in the 2009 Tour Down Under even though the cyclist hadn't been in the testing group for the required period of time. The commission says although there is no direct evidence of an agreement between McQuaid and Armstrong, McQuaid ""made a sudden U-turn and allowed Lance Armstrong to return 13 days early"" to take part in the competition, ""despite advice from UCI staff not to make an exception."" ""There was a temporal link between this decision, which was communicated to UCI staff in the morning, and the decision of Lance Armstrong, which was notified to Pat McQuaid later that same day, to participate in the Tour of Ireland, an event run by people known to Pat McQuaid,"" the report says. The report says the commission found no evidence to support allegations of corruption over payments made to the UCI by Armstrong. But it adds that ""requesting and accepting donations from Lance Armstrong, given the suspicions, left UCI open to criticism."" CNN wasn't immediately able to reach McQuaid, but Verbruggen issued a lengthy statement Monday, claiming ""wild conspiracy theories and accusations have been properly debunked once and for all."" He said: ""I have studied the CIRC report and I am satisfied that it confirms what I have always said: that there have never been any cover-ups, complicity or corruption in the Lance Armstrong case or, indeed, in any other doping cases."" Armstrong, who cooperated with the commission's investigation, thanked it for ""seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search."" ""I am deeply sorry for many things I have done. However, it is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright, dope-free future for the sport I love,"" he said in a statement. ""In the rush to vilify Lance, many of the other equally culpable participants have been allowed to escape scrutiny, much less sanction, and many of the anti-doping 'enforcers' have chosen to grandstand at Lance's expense rather than truly search for the truth,"" said Armstrong's attorney, Elliot Peters. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, which banned Armstrong from cycling for life in 2012, welcomed the commission's work. ""The report confirms that, for more than a decade, UCI leaders treated riders and teams unequally -- allowing some to be above the rules,"" said USADA Chief Executive Travis T. Tygart. ""The UCI's favoritism and intentional failure to enforce the anti-doping rules offends the principles of fair play and is contrary to the values on which true sport is based."" Cookson told CNN that the world governing body would be stepping up its fight against drugs cheats, working closely with the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), national federations and, if necessary, law enforcement agencies. But the 63-year-old Briton still believes cycling has taken strides forward in the fight against drugs cheats. ""Large numbers of riders are competing without doping,"" he said. ""I want to encourage them and support them. I think it's possible to compete successfully in our sport without doping."" However, Cookson reacted angrily to other aspects of the report, which suggested amateur cyclists and junior competitors were involved in doping. Of older cyclists, competing in Masters categories, Cookson gave a damning verdict. ""The only people they are fooling is themselves, they are deluded,"" he said. But his harshest words were reserved over allegations that drugs were being peddled to young cyclists. ""The people involved should be subjected to criminal proceedings because that's child abuse. I'm astonished and appalled by those findings,"" he said.

"(CNN)You're late for your flight, sweaty from having dragged your luggage to the check-in counter, and stressed about making it through security before boarding begins. For some of us, this is the rule, not the exception. For most of us, it's a pretty unremarkable scenario. Not so fast, says the Transportation Security Administration. Typical airport behavior like this could make you a suspicious traveler who should be subjected to questioning and additional screening -- and possibly referred to the police for investigation, detention or arrest. That should seem far-fetched, but it isn't. The TSA continues to use pseudo-scientific ""behavior detection"" techniques that have given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling at our nation's airports. Through a program called Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques, or SPOT, the TSA employs thousands of ""behavior detection officers"" who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of ""mal-intent"" in airport screening areas. The officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the TSA associates with stress, fear or deception. When the officers perceive clusters of such behaviors in any given individual, they refer that person for secondary inspection and questioning. The SPOT program relies on theories about ""micro-expressions,"" involuntary facial expressions that supposedly appear for milliseconds despite one's efforts to conceal them. Behavior detection officers look for such micro-expressions while scanning passengers' faces or engaging in casual conversation with them. It's as nutty as it sounds. Setting aside that the officers' perception of these behaviors is inherently subjective, there's just no evidence that deception or ""mal-intent"" can reliably be detected through observation, especially in an unstructured setting like an airport screening area. The fact that many people find such settings inherently stressful only compounds the problem. If TSA's behavior detection officers look for stress in a stressful environment, they're going to find it, along with plenty of false positives. Just about everyone outside the TSA who has reviewed the SPOT program has decided that it's unscientific and a waste of money. An exhaustive review by the Government Accountability Office found the SPOT program lacked a scientific basis, that the behavioral indicators it relied on were subjective, and that the TSA had no effective means to test its effectiveness. In no uncertain terms, the GAO recommended that Congress curtail funding for the program. An independent scientific advisory group that reviewed the SPOT program also concluded that ""no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior, including intent."" And during a congressional hearing on the program, Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina observed, ""To my knowledge, there has not been a single instance where a behavior detection officer has referred someone to a law enforcement officer and that individual turned out to be a terrorist."" Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, stated, ""I am concerned that TSA will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach."" Despite this withering criticism, SPOT remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over $1 billion (that's with a b) since its inception in 2007. Repeat: over a billion dollars on a misguided program that doesn't work. Equally troubling is that SPOT has given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling -- an unfortunately inevitable result when law enforcement or border agents single people out based on hasty, gut-level judgments about them. Allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers have come not only from travelers, but also from numerous other officers. Over 30 behavior detection officers at Boston Logan International Airport said that profiling was rampant there. One of the officers told reporters, ""They just pull aside anyone who they don't like the way they look -- if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewelry, or if they are Hispanic."" Another officer submitted an anonymous complaint saying, ""The behavior detection program is no longer a behavior-based program, but it is a racial profiling program."" The TSA has not revealed what, if any, steps it has taken to ensure that unlawful profiling does not occur in airport screening. Nor has TSA explained why -- despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary -- SPOT contributes meaningfully to aviation security. That's why the ACLU submitted an FOIA request to TSA seeking information on its use of behavior detection. We've received no response, so we're taking the TSA to court to get the information the public needs to fully evaluate it. People expect that when they travel, they will be screened for weapons or explosives that could bring down an airplane. They don't expect -- nor should they -- that officers will make probing judgments about their intentions based on little more than their facial expressions, or that they will be stopped, questioned and perhaps even searched because of their race or ethnicity. It's time for TSA to explain and justify the SPOT program. Or better yet, listen to those who say it's a waste of money and scrap it entirely.","TSA's SPOT program screens passengers for ""micro-expressions"" to determine if a person is suspicious .

"(CNN)It's seen a rapacious Leonardo DiCaprio rip-off the gullible, Sarah Jessica Parker ponder sweet amor and an air-headed Brad Pitt harbor intentions of blackmailing a CIA agent -- all just a bridge away from the madness of Manhattan. In the old times, Brooklyn's historic Navy Yard would be lucky to attract the stars of the silver screen to a USO show. Today, its home to one of the largest film studios outside of Hollywood. The ""Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Sex and the City Two"" and ""Burn After Reading"" are just a few of the major motion pictures shot at Steiner Studios in recent times. More than 40 feature length and TV productions were filmed here in the last year alone. Studio chairman, Doug Steiner, opened the site just over 10 years ago. ""It was really awful looking with wild dogs -- literally wild dogs -- roaming the streets here,"" Steiner said. ""I liked the industrial landscape a lot and the opportunity. To me Brooklyn was a great opportunity waiting to happen because of the proximity to Manhattan."" At its peak during World War II, the Brooklyn Navy Yard employed some 70,000 people. But the 1.2 square kilometer site fell into steep decline in the 1960s when the sailors moved out. Today, the yard is a vastly different place -- and not just because of the Hollywood A-listers strutting around. A non-profit corporation has been regenerating the location with the aim of creating new employment opportunities since the turn of the century. Steiner studios was one of the first tenants but others have followed. One former warehouse represents the corporation's biggest project to date, with more than 90,000 square meters of space up for grabs and the potential creation of 3,000 new jobs. ""I think our influence on Brooklyn in general has been quite substantial,"" said David Ehrenberg, CEO of the Brooklyn Naval Yard Development Corporation. ""We were the first entity that started investing substantially back into these old buildings on the Brooklyn waterfront. ""And to some extent (we) proved a concept -- that manufacturing and industrial and creative companies would want to take root in Brooklyn,"" Ehrenberg said. Being at the forefront of these wider trends has helped attract a new type of workforce to the area. Steiner says housing prices within half a kilometer have risen up to ten times. Some 1,500 people already work at the studio, which is set on a path of rapid expansion. It is benefiting from the explosion in demand for high quality content across mobile devices - and Steiner sees it as part of a wider trend. ""Old media has always been based in New York City and continues to be based (here), film and television has been anchored in LA and high-tech has always been in northern California,"" Steiner said. ""But I think right now we're seeing everything coming together in New York.""","Brooklyn Navy Yard has been transformed from disused site into hub of commercial activity .

"(CNN)American missionary Phyllis Sortor, who was kidnapped last month by masked gunmen in central Nigeria, has been freed, a U.S. official confirmed Friday. Officials refused to provide details of her release, but said it involved some form of negotiations. Five men abducted Sortor, a missionary from Seattle with the Free Methodist Church, from her workplace February 23 and demanded a ransom of 60 million Naira ($301,500), Kogi state police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi said. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. Kogi state is located away from the areas where Boko Haram operates, making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to them. But there is the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped Sortor, or that she might be sold to another group.","American missionary Phyllis Sortor was kidnapped by masked gunmen in central Nigeria on February 23 .

"(CNN)In 2007 I had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent my getting ovarian cancer. It was a surgery of the kind that Angelina Jolie recently underwent, as she revealed Tuesday in a New York Times op-ed.  Two years ago, Jolie divulged that she'd had a prophylactic double mastectomy -- I had done this as well, in 2012. Along with the effects of the surgeries themselves, we now also share a related fallout: surgical menopause. This change can be big and, for me, happened almost immediately. There is little easing into it: the age-inappropriate night sweats, hot flashes, weight gain, mood swings.  When I had my ovaries removed at age 37, I suddenly felt less vibrant and beautiful, and instead experienced the slow creep of feeling old.  What will this transition mean to someone like Jolie, so identified for her attractiveness and glamour? (She may keep that part of her transformation private, but -- as with her disclosures about the surgeries -- it might do some good to discuss that, as well.) I've been talking and writing about BRCA1 since I learned more than 10 years ago that I carried this insidious, inherited genetic mutation.  I've discussed how these operations have affected my relationship with my husband and our two children.  But often it takes someone as public, as gorgeous, as famous as Ms. Jolie to powerfully move the conversation about cancer prevention surgeries forward. Her transparency helps normalize the experience of women considering their own options.  It chips away at the stigma surrounding this treatment decision and offers women a new shorthand for explaining such a difficult choice to their families. When I underwent each of my surgeries a few friends looked at me sideways.  They weren't familiar with BRCA and or how surgery could statistically reduce my chances of developing cancer.  Now Ms. Jolie has changed this. Her willingness to share such intimate experiences means more people will become educated and more BRCA survivors will feel free to speak of their scars.  And there are many resources for BRCA-positive women. In June, I will be speaking at the annual FORCE conference (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered), which has partnered with another wonderful organization, the Basser Research Center for BRCA  (part of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania). Both are leading the way in the scientific research and understanding of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.  They also provide resources around risk assessment, prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship, as well as links to chat rooms and local support groups. It's not often a writer finds her circumstances so closely in sync with a Hollywood star.  But I like to think Ms. Jolie and I, two women who truly have nothing in common, are linked in our determination to be proactive.  We have looked fear in the face and made the only decisions that made sense for our families and our selves.","Like Angelina Jolie, Allison Gilbert had two preventive cancer surgeries to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes and  later her breasts .

"(CNN)A year-and-a-half ago, when the Jesus edition of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard's ongoing book series about the deaths of famous people was released, O'Reilly did the talk show circuit to promote the book. To ""60 Minutes"" O'Reilly professed that his ""Killing Jesus"" is not a religious book. It was purely historical, said the Fox News host. He said it investigates the political circumstances surrounding the most famous death of all time. When asked why Jesus was killed, O'Reilly said, ""He was upset that the Jews were taxing -- and overtaxing, extorting -- the folks."" Jesus was executed, according to O'Reilly, not because he claimed to be God, but because he interrupted the ""money flow"" of taxes to the Romans and the Jewish temple leaders. As a theologian, I must say that O'Reilly buried the lead. The death of Jesus of Nazareth, at least historically speaking, was just one more ignominious execution of a peasant Jew in a long line of such executions. A century before Jesus' death, the Romans crucified about 6,000 slaves on the roads leading to Rome, putting to an end the Third Servile War. Like Jesus, these slaves stood up to the Roman Empire and were quickly defeated. Crucifixion was common. Five things Bill O'Reilly flubs in 'Killing Jesus' Jesus' death was unique because of its theological and religious import. At least that's what his earliest followers decided upon reflection. Jesus was not the messiah that the Hebrews had anticipated. In fact, he'd done just about the opposite of what was expected: preached peace, lived in relative obscurity, and died young. Jesus was most definitely an outsider -- on this O'Reilly and I agree. He lived in the outer reaches of the empire, a non-citizen with few rights. Even his Galilean accent was considered backwoods in the metropolis of Jerusalem. Whether it was the Roman occupying force or the powerful temple leaders, they must have thought, ""Jesus is not like us."" So it's pleasantly surprising that the TV movie based on O'Reilly's book casts a Muslim actor, Haaz Sleiman, as Jesus. Sleiman was raised in Lebanon. He is thick-featured and broad-shouldered. And he is robustly hirsute, the very opposite of the wispily-bearded Ted Neely from the Jesus Christ Superstar of my youth. Speaking of Ted Neely, he is just one in a long line of blue-eyed Jesuses in art and film. For a long time, the actors chosen to play Jesus have looked more like O'Reilly and me than like a Judean. Sleiman is a welcome break from that tradition, but some people have voiced displeasure at his casting. Having a Muslim portray the founder of Christianity, they contend, is an offense. Sleiman disagrees. ""My religion is inclusivity,"" Sleiman told me, and he is an effective evangelist of that religion. He is unashamed to talk about his connection to God, his respect for all three Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- and in the ""beauty and magnificence of humanity."" To play Jesus, Sleiman said, he simply focused on the divinity that he believes is available to all human beings, a divinity that Jesus was specially aware of. When Bill O'Reilly portrays Jesus as a champion of low taxes and an opponent of big government, he's not committing a mortal sin. He's doing what so many have done before: seeing in Jesus what they want to see, and making Jesus into someone who looks, talks, and thinks like they want him to. So maybe the best thing that Christians can do during this Holy Week is to watch a Muslim portray Jesus. In that portrayal, we might be reminded that Jesus himself didn't look like the dominant culture of his day, and he practiced a religion that the Romans did not understand or respect. We live in an uneasy time between Christians and Muslims, between Christianity and Islam. And it wasn't so different in the first century. Then, an obscure figure who was little understood preached peace and died a sacrificial death. Now a Muslim actor is bringing him to life, and that is no more scandalous than Jesus' own life.","A TV movie based on O'Reilly's book ""Killing Jesus"" casts a Muslim actor as Jesus .

"Boston (CNN)The defense in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested Tuesday afternoon after presenting only four witnesses. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday. The defense case lasted less than two days, while the prosecution presented more than 90 witnesses over the course of a month. Federal prosecutors rested their case Monday with grisly testimony about how the bomb Dzhokhar Tsarnaev placed near the marathon's finish line tore through the bodies of 8-year-old Martin Richard and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. A second bomb placed by Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, killed Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. The short presentation in the sensational trial wasn't surprising, given that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney, Judy Clarke, acknowledged during opening statements that ""it was him,"" referring to her client's culpability. Testimony ended with an FBI fingerprint investigator who talked about numerous pieces of evidence with Tamerlan's fingerprints and not Dzhokhar's. Earlier, a computer expert testified about computer searches on Tamerlan's computer -- including gun stores, transmitters, fireworks firing system, detonator and Boston Marathon -- in the weeks before the bombing. Similar searches were not found on Dzhokhar's computer. Jurors first will be asked to determine whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 counts. Because 17 of those counts carry the death penalty as a possible punishment, a second phase of the trial will follow if the jury convicts him. In the penalty phase, jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors, such as the heinousness of the crime, versus mitigating factors, such as Tsarnaev's family history and his youth. He was 19 at the time of the bombings. The defense, which began calling witnesses Monday afternoon, has argued that Tsarnaev, known to friends as Jahar, fell under the sway of his more extremist older brother after their parents moved back to Russia. Jahar Tsarnaev was flunking out of the University of Massachusetts and had lost his financial aid at the time of the bombings. Prosecutors William Weinreb, Aloke Chakravarty, Nadine Pellegrini and Steve Mellin presented witnesses who told the story of Tsarnaev's alleged scheme with Tamerlan to build and detonate pressure cooker bombs as an act of jihad. The brothers, Muslims of Chechen descent, allegedly sought to kill Americans at an iconic public event to retaliate against U.S. policies they believed harmed and oppressed Muslims abroad. Prosecutors delved into Tsarnaev's text messages and Twitter posts and showed jurors militant material found in his laptop, phone and iPod. They included writings available online from top leaders of al Qaeda. They used data mined from a GPS device and store receipts to trace the purchase of the pressure cookers, BBs and ammunition. Jurors saw photos of pressure cooker parts, fuses, Christmas lights and other bombmaking materials found in the Tsarnaev family's Cambridge apartment, where Tamerlan lived with his wife and child. And they showed security surveillance videos of the brothers in the crowd near the finish line: In one, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be seen blending in with the crowd behind the Richard family for four minutes. He appears to slide a backpack off his shoulder near a tree and walk off, glancing over his shoulder. He broke into a run as the bomb went off. After the surveillance photos were released to the public three days after the bombing, the brothers allegedly embarked on a desperate -- and deadly -- attempt to escape. Jurors heard from carjacking victim Dun Meng and saw the brothers on convenience store surveillance video shortly before Meng's escape. He can be seen jumping out of his leased Mercedes SUV at a gas pump and running across the screen as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev casually strolls through the store, picking up an armload of snacks. Prosecutors also used ballistic evidence to link the brothers to the shooting of a campus cop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gunbattle with police in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died as a result of that gunbattle. The defendant, allegedly attempting to run down police, instead ran over his brother in the stolen Mercedes. Jurors also viewed a boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sought refuge during the ensuing manhunt, which put Boston under a ""shelter in place"" lockdown. He used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called his ""manifesto"" on the sides of the boat. It was pocked with bullet holes and streaked with blood. He wrote he was jealous that his brother had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior in the gunbattle with police. He asked God to make him a martyr, too. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty, although his attorneys do not dispute that he participated in the bombings. Clarke asked jurors in her opening statement to keep their minds open to an alternative explanation. The defense began its case with two witnesses called to offer scenarios that differ from the version of events offered by FBI witnesses. One focused on the the defendant's Twitter posts a year before the marathon, including mundane matters such as whether he should sleep in or get breakfast. Another challenged the way the FBI used GPS points and store receipts to document the purchase of pressure cookers, BBs and ammunition -- allegedly by Tamerlan Tsarnaev. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this story.","Defense in trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested after less than three days .

"(CNN)An employee at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans has tested positive for a potentially deadly strain of bacteria kept at the facility. The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the bacteria are not likely to be a threat to the general population. The worker tested positive to exposure of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause can cause melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease. ""It is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread,"" according to the CDC website. The CDC is waiting on additional test results to determine if the exposure occurred at the research center or somewhere else, McDonald said. The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture are at the campus, continuing an investigation that began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others have antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. Since then federal health officials have been working with state and local officials to investigate the source. Blood tests have been conducted on nearly 70 primates at the center, with one testing positive for antibodies, McDonald said. According to the CDC, ""the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source.""","The CDC says bacteria are not likely to be a threat to the general population .

"(CNN)The fallout at Sigma Alpha Epsilon continues. Just days after a video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song, another video is making the rounds. This one appears to show the fraternity's house mom laughing and saying the n-word. Two students expelled over racist chant . The Oklahoma Daily, the university's student newspaper, posted a Vine dating from 2013 that shows an older woman talking over a rap song, saying ""ni****"" seven times in quick succession. The woman, who is seated with an Oklahoma shirt behind her, laughs before repeating the racial epithet. The sound of ""All Gold Everything"" from Trinidad James -- a black, Atlanta-based rapper -- can be heard in the background. Black OU SAE alumnus: 'They are not my brothers' The student newspaper reports that the woman appears to be Beauton Gilbow, who was the SAE chapter's house mom. She responded in a statement Tuesday. ""I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news. I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist. I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life. ""I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week,"" said Gilbow. Before the Vine came out but after the fraternity chapter was suspended, the woman known as ""Momma B"" told CNN affiliate KOCO-TV that she was blindsided by the overall controversy. ""I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me,"" Gilbow said. ""This has been my life for 15 years. And it's tough.""

"(CNN)There is always champagne at these things, but this art opening is an actual party. Purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of London's Royal Academy; punk music falls down the stairs and Kenneth Anger's homo-erotic biker short Scorpio Rising is playing on a TV screen. Jarvis Cocker is here, and so are Bob Geldof and Rupert Everett. There are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux, as well as twenty-somethings in backpacks huddled in groups, downing their drinks before walking into Pace London's booze-free exhibition space for the opening of A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser. While his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned London art community, eminent gallerist Robert Fraser, who ran a gallery in London during the Sixties and again in the Eighties, was a seminal part of the Swinging Sixties scene. His notoriety hinged on scandal, parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era, as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art's Next Big Thing. This is the eminent dealer who sold art to Paul McCartney, and hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono's first joint exhibition; the Savile Row-clad Etonian whose Mayfair galleries attracted the likes of Marlon Brando, Marianne Faithfull and William Burroughs in the 60s and 80s; the silver-tongued heroin addict who introduced Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat to Britain, and was arrested -- and, in his case, imprisoned -- for drug possession with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during the 1967 Redlands Bust. Curated by the artist Brian Clarke, A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel, the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s. ""There are oceans of anecdotes by Robert, and some of them are true. But the anecdote isn't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had, this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy,"" says Clarke, arguably the world's most well known stained glass artist. I first met Clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage-cum-mansion in London's tony Notting Hill neighborhood. A literal portrait of Fraser painted by Basquiat hangs prominently in the living room, surrounded by works by Warhol, Francis Bacon and others. Clarke, who was a close friend of Fraser's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery, is still finalizing the exhibition selection, but his energy is easy, if a little manic. Harriet Vyner, a long-time friend of Clarke and Fraser, and author of the Fraser biography Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser, has been collaborating with him on the catalog. She's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean. ""I remember going to Seditionaries, (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's 70s punk shop) on the King's Road, and it felt a bit scary, but that was part of the thrill,"" she says. ""And that's what people often felt about going to the Robert Fraser gallery in both incarnations."" The idea for the portrait came from Pace London's managing director Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst a year ago, when Clarke told her he'd been entrusted with Fraser's archive. (Fraser died of AIDS-related illness in 1986 at the age of 49.) ""The 'light bulb moment' really struck when we realized that Pace founder, Arne Glimcher, was setting up his first gallery in Boston at the time Fraser was opening his own gallery in London,"" Dent-Brocklehurst writes in an email. ""We're exploring our own DNA with this exhibition while paying tribute to one of the most flamboyant dealers and aesthetes. ""There's a buzz in London right now around the exhibition and many artists, museum directors, celebrities, aspiring artists, art students are all very keen to rediscover Robert's personality."" To hear Clarke speak about Fraser is to have assumptions alternately challenged, rebuked and confirmed. He makes no excuses and offers no explanations for Fraser's ""more hedonistic side,"" but emphasizes his generally quiet demeanor and modesty. The overall impression is of someone with an acute eye for talent (he showed Bacon, Warhol, Dennis Hopper, Richard Hamilton, Jim Dine, Robert Mapplethorpe and Jean Dubuffet) and a rebellious, destructive streak. This is reflected in the exhibition itself, which is set up like an archive. Works from the luminaries Fraser knew, showed or admired are on the walls, while personal effects -- a thank-you note from Ed Ruscha, a Sex Pistols Never Mind the Bollocks poster, arrest warrants, an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver -- are kept behind glass cases. In one corner, there's a recreation of his desk. Take a few steps, and you're looking at the drum from The Beatles' 1967 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, which Fraser art directed. Other elements reflect their personal relationship. A Gerhard Richter that recalls a joint trip to Berlin to see his works in person. An inscribed copy of an Edward Burne-Jones biography was gifted from Fraser to Clarke. There was more to Fraser, it seems, than the people he associated with. ""There is always around Robert this aura of all these celebrities and things like that, and it's true that they were there, but it wasn't anything that he either curried or boasted about,"" Clarke says. ""He was not a respecter of persons. He liked people or he hated them."" He was often reluctant to discuss his connections and friendships, even with those close to him. Clarke remembers discussing Truman Capote with Fraser at length during a stay in New York. He didn't realize the two were friends until Capote came over to their table a few nights later to hug Fraser. Similarly, Vyner remembers Fraser fawning over Prick up Your Ears, John Lahr's 1978 biography of playwright Joe Orton, without once mentioning that he was an early backer of Orton's productions. (She would discover this while researching Groovy Bob.) ""For all of the inevitable references to the hedonistic side of Robert, he had a very sophisticated intelligence in terms of visual art, and genuinely in terms of culture,"" Clarke says. ""So whilst he was not inclined to talk culture, he was eminently capable of it."" Back to Pace. A party-goer and I get to chatting about the exhibition, the party, and Fraser. She enjoyed the party, but didn't -- doesn't -- know much about Fraser the man. ""The exhibition is so chaotic and eclectic,"" she says. ""Maybe that was him as a person?"" Around 9:00 pm, security guards are shepherding the reluctant crowd out of the building, into the cold night. On the steps, a particularly drunk kid tries and fails to goad someone into a fight, while the less inclined start hailing cabs and mapping how to move the night into Soho. I recall something Clarke told me a few weeks prior, an effort to summarize the spirit of Fraser's galleries and its infamous parties, studded with stars and doused in glamor and excitement. ""When you were with Robert, you felt there was nowhere really much better to be. You knew that you would not have more fun anywhere else, that's for sure, and you would not be more stimulated,"" he'd said with a kind of wistfulness. ""It was brief and short-lived, but that light burned bright.""

"(CNN)Preliminary exit poll estimates released by Israel's three major broadcasters late Tuesday show an election too close to call. Millions of Israelis cast their votes to determine their country's next Prime Minister and the makeup of its parliament. Channel 2 Israel reports the Likud party, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has a slight lead over the Zionist Union, led by Isaac Herzog -- 28 seats, over 27 seats. Channels 10 and 1 show the two tied with 27 seats each. The incumbent claimed victory ahead of a final count. ""Against all odds, we achieved this huge victory,"" Netanyahu told his cheering supporters. ""Now we should form a strong and stable government that will be able to take care of the security, safety and welfare of each and every citizen of Israel."" The Zionist Union responded by saying in a statement that the Likud party ""keeps misleading."" ""The rightist bloc has shrunk. Everything is possible until the real results are in, when we can know which parties passed the electoral threshold and which government we can form. All the spins and statements are premature,"" it read. Official results are not expected to be published until next week, and the process of building coalitions could take much longer. Gabriel Sassoon, foreign communications adviser for the Herzog campaign, said: ""The fat lady has far from sung in this case. We do not know. The parties are neck and neck and it's a matter of coalition negotiations and let me tell you, it's entirely possible to form a center-left coalition at this point. Israel is tired of nine long years of Netanyahu."" Election ballots are for political parties rather than individual candidates. Israel has a proportional representation system, meaning a coalition government is likely to be formed within its 120-seat Knesset. How does Israel's parliament work? CNN's Elise Labott described the early results as a ""stunning turnaround"" for Netanyahu, who took a sharp turn toward the right during the final days of the hotly-contested campaign. ""It seems to have worked. He seems to have energized that right-wing base and now he is neck-and-neck with  Isaac Herzog, even inching a little bit ahead of him,"" she said. ""We'll have to see who's able to form the coalition with the other parties, but it does look as if Prime Minister Netanyahu has fought his way back and has a very good chance of forming this government."" Before polls closed Tuesday, Netanyahu released a video on his Facebook page urging his supporters to vote, suggesting that leftists are bringing ""huge amounts"" of Israel's Arab citizens to the polls to vote against his Likud party. ""The right regime is in danger, the Arab voters are coming in huge amounts to the polls,"" Netanyahu said. ""The leftists are bringing them (Arabs) in huge amounts to polls using buses. ... We have an urgent wake-up call."" Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. According to the early exit poll estimates, an Arab coalition ranked as the third largest party. Arab citizens of Israel face defining moment in election . Moshe Kahlon, a former Likud minister who now heads the Kulanu party, said Netanyahu's statement ""clearly shows he is feeling the pressure."" ""These remarks were inappropriate and regrettable,"" Kahlon said. Polls closed at 10 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET). Following the release of exit poll estimates, President Reuven Rivlin said that citizens need a ruling government as soon as possible. ""The President will work with all the election bodies to start the consultations process ASAP. We hope to start as soon as Sunday,"" his office said in a statement. Herzog comes from Israeli political royalty. His grandfather, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was the first chief rabbi of the state of Israel. His father, Chaim Herzog, was an Army general, an ambassador to the United Nations and the President of Israel. Before entering politics, Herzog served with a military intelligence unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, rising to the rank of major, and worked as a lawyer and served as the director of the Israel Anti-Drug Authority. He began his political career in 2003, when he first won a seat in the Knesset with the Labor Party. He held a variety of ministerial positions, including minister of housing and construction, minister of tourism and minister of welfare and social services before becoming leader of the Labor Party in 2013. In those elections, he also became the leader of the opposition, as Netanyahu won another term as Prime Minister. Herzog has pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform, vowing to ""change the nature of the division of wealth."" He has also promised to restart stalled peace talks with the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu served for six years in the Israeli Army in an elite commando unit until he was wounded in a rescue operation during an airplane hijacking in 1972. In 1976, Netanyahu's brother was killed in a raid to try to free hostages in Uganda from an Air France jet hijacked by pro-Palestinian terrorists. Netanyahu set up an anti-terror institute in his name. His outspokenness on the threat of terrorism attracted attention, and he was given high-profile diplomatic assignments. In 1988, he was elected to the Knesset. In 1996, he became Israel's youngest Prime Minister. He was defeated three years later after signing an interim peace agreement with then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. In 2009, he again became Prime Minister. CNN's Labott says Netanyahu's emphasis on security -- particularly speaking out loudly on Iran -- and his counteroffensives against Hamas in Gaza have boosted his popularity in Israel. But Labott says peace with the Palestinians remains elusive, and Netanyahu is finding himself increasingly alienated from Western partners. As negotiations with Iran near a crucial state, Netanyahu has sided against the White House, telling the U.S. Congress this month that a proposed agreement was ""a bad deal"" and would not be supported by Israel, which would stand alone if necessary to defend its people. Five key challenges for next Prime Minister .

"(CNN)Sorry, Spotify, but it appears Taylor Swift has found someone else to fill that ""Blank Space."" Billboard reports that most of Swift's albums are streaming on TIDAL, the music service recently purchased by Jay Z via his S. Carter Enterprises. In November, Swift refused to allow from Spotify to stream her new album ""1989"" and pulled the rest of her catalog from the site. The singer has been outspoken about her beliefs that the current state of the music industry is making it hard for  artists (Spotify reportedly pays between $.006 and $.0084 per stream) and has endorsed the buying and selling of digital and physical albums rather than streaming. Taylor Swift pulls her music from Spotify . Music sales have declined sharply in the past few years, and in July, Swift wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal about the future of the music industry in which she touched on the issue. Customers ""are buying only the (albums) that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone,"" she wrote. ""It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us."" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek responded in a blog post to the singer/songwriter's decision to deny her music to his 40 million-plus customers. His company was not the enemy, he said. ""Spotify has paid more than two billion dollars to labels, publishers and collecting societies for distribution to songwriters and recording artists,"" Ek wrote. ""When I hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they've seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated, I'm really frustrated too. The music industry is changing -- and we're proud of our part in that change -- but lots of problems that have plagued the industry since its inception continue to exist.""

The actor, who plays hip-hop recording mogul Lucious Lyon on the series, recently told Entertainment Weekly that's he's ""mad that we don't say n****r  in the show."" ""Why is TV showing something different from the reality of the world?"" Howard asked. ""Why is there a thing called censorship that stop people from hearing everyday talk? We use n***** every day. It's become part of a conversation. Why aren't we using it in the show?"" He expanded on his thoughts during an appearance Monday on ""Access Hollywood."" ""Well, I believe if we're gonna really tackle racism, if we're gonna tackle bigotry, if we're gonna tackle homophobia, we need to attack it dead-on. You don't just sit up, you know, let's give a little aspirin right here; no, we need to take the sutures, open up the problem and reach in and grab it,"" the actor explained. ""And since n****r is used in almost every conversation in most black neighborhoods, why is it that we don't hear it on TV anymore? Are white people afraid of it? Did they create the word? But if this is something that we use on a daily basis, then let's address what it really means."" And what does the word mean to the ""Empire"" star? ""Oh, it could mean love; sometimes it's a noun; sometimes it's a verb; sometimes it's an adjective; it's all, there's a spirit attached to it, you know,"" Howard said. ""My dad uses it. My brothers use it. I use it. I'm sitting here, I'm hoping maybe I won't use it with my son, but I don't know if I'll be honest if I didn't use it with my son. You know, my friends use it. I call my white friends 'what's up, my n****?' You know, that's, it has taken on this term to us, but it's blown out of proportion outside the world, so I don't know."" But co-star Taraji P. Henson, who plays his ex-wife, Cookie Lyon, is not feeling it. When TMZ asked whether she believed the Fox series should be using the word, she responded, ""Naw, you might piss people off."" David Rambo, one of the show's writers, told TMZ that as a white man, he didn't think he could make the call on whether to use the word. Context is everything, he said. ""It's a powerful word,"" Rambo told TMZ. ""It's such a huge issue. It came up a lot in our writers room.""","The actor said he'd like to see the word used on his series .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil  (CNN)Demonstrators took to the streets across Brazil on Sunday, protesting corruption and demanding the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Her administration is struggling amid a weak economy and a massive corruption scandal involving the country's state-run oil company. ""I love Brazil. I love my country. And I am tired of corruption. We are tired of corruption. It doesn't matter which political party you are from, we are tired of being robbed,"" a protester told CNN in Sao Paulo, where people packed the main Paulista Avenue. In Rio de Janeiro, they gathered along Copacabana beach, while in the capital, Brasilia, protesters marched on government headquarters. The mood was festive. Many demonstrators wore the country's colors -- green, blue and yellow -- waved flags, and chanted: ""Out Dilma."" Amid complaints about the economy, protesters say they are incensed because Brazilian investigators are unraveling a huge money-laundering and bribery case centered around Petrobras, the country's national oil company. Dozens of politicians, some in Rousseff's party, are accused of accepting millions in payments. The President has not been implicated in the investigation, but she was the Energy Minister and chairwoman of Petrobras during much of the time that the alleged corruption took place. Why are protesters furious with Brazil's President? Sunday night Rousseff sent two of her ministers to address the nation at a televised press conference. The justice minister and the general secretary said that the government was listening and would announce changes in several days designed to combat corruption. The announcement did little to quiet the protests in some cities. Many protesters banged pots and pans and honked car horns. CNN iReporter Bruno Teles with Avant Drones shot aerial footage of the crowds in Sao Paulo. He said, ""Brazilians are tired of such corruption, lies and [the] bad economy."" Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She won re-election in October, in one of the tightest races in recent years, but has since seen her approval rate plummet along with the economy. Brazil is headed into recession again this year, inflation is up and the currency is at a 12-year low. Rousseff's approval rating down to 23% from 42% at the end of 2014, according to DataFolha. The economy is expected to contract this year and the real has plummeted 23% against the dollar. Barbara Arvanitidis reported from Sao Paulo. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Patrick Gillespie and Shasta Darlington also contributed to this report.","Protesters denounce corruption and demand the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff .

"(CNN)On and off for over 40 years, I have had the privilege of roaming around the West Wing of the White House, usually as a member of the staff, sometimes as a journalist or visitor. For all that time, almost everything has been pretty much the same -- from the configuration of furniture in the oval to the four Norman Rockwell sketches hanging in the hallways. But this past weekend, making a visit, there was something that was brand new and entirely welcome:  There among the stream of visitors touring the West Wing were many families of every color, especially African-Americans.  You may not think that is so different, but it is. For as long as I have known, the West Wing has essentially been the preserve of whites, especially white men. My wife Anne and I, along with 10-year-old grandkids Gabriel Barnett and Maya Gergen, were there for a superb, two-hour tour by a young man, Clay Dumas,  once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the President.  (He also happens to be white.) Like most staff members over the years, Clay spoke with near reverence about his President as he pointed out many photos of Obama on the walls. What seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new: Photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their President alongside and of equal standing with whites. Of course, it didn't take a visit to the white house to know that Barack Obama has promoted diversity.  Still, before seeing up close, I had not appreciated how deeply his approach has permeated day-to-day life.  This White House appears to be a model of racial, ethnic and gender integration. To be sure, earlier presidents had already taken steps down this path.  President Bill Clinton was the first to name a cabinet in which women and people of color outnumbered white males.   President George W. Bush surprised some when he continued that tradition.  But in the West Wing itself, white men continued to dominate the inner circles. President Obama's efforts to allocate power in new ways have  sometimes raised hackles.  That three of the most influential people around him are African-American women isn't the issue, insist critics sotto voce; rather it is whether two of them, Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice, are the right people for their jobs. Both have come under periodic barrages.  But to be fair, it isn't as if there hasn't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful White House jobs. As I left the White House this past Saturday, I knew that I would continue to grind my teeth over many of President Obama's policies along with his leadership style. But as a white southerner inspired by the civil rights movement, I must say that I was also impressed and grateful that he has made the West Wing such a welcome home for Americans of every color and background.  It's about time. I will write my young friend Clay and tell him that one day, accompanied by his grandchildren, he will return to the West Wing and be proud that he served under the first president to turn diversity into a living reality at the White House. That is one of the positive legacies of this President that deserves greater recognition.","David Gergen says Barack Obama doesn't get enough credit for transforming the White House .

"(CNN)Last month, my husband and I took our daughters to a Columbia University women's basketball game. We live nearby, had already attended a men's game and were excited for our girls, one of whom plays basketball, to watch college women in action. When we walked into the arena, my mouth practically dropped to the floor. Only a handful of people were there, quite a contrast from the nearly packed house for the men's team. It must be winter break, I thought. It wasn't. Sure, the Columbia women's team hasn't had a great season for years -- and this year wasn't much different. Still, only a handful of spectators to cheer on women who were clearly standouts in their high schools to make it to a college basketball team? I sat on the bench, cheered the women and fumed. How to Super Bowl #LikeAGirl . A few weeks later, the Princeton women's basketball team did something no other Ivy League men's team had done before, racking up 30 wins and zero losses during the regular season and beating the Ivy League season record of 28-0 held by the 1970-71 Penn men's team. (Princeton ended up losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament, finishing with a 31-1 record.) The Princeton team garnered national headlines, which was great, but I still wondered what it was going to take for women's sports to get the same attention as men's sports -- meaning an equal number of fans, TV rights, marketing endorsements, you name it. Is such a day even possible? Consider salaries alone. The average salary for a WNBA player is $72,000, which doesn't include bonuses and benefits, while the average salary for an NBA player is around $5 million, or about 70 times what the average female basketball player makes. And look at the differences in coverage. The Final Four teams for the men's NCAA basketball tournament got front page attention in Monday's New York Times. The women? A story without a photo deep in the sports section. I met Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, during a spectacular and inspirational women's conference in Jacksonville, Florida, last week called Generation W, where I moderated panels on issues affecting women. ""This connection with sports and masculinity is a very tough nut to crack. People have been trying to crack it for a long time,"" said Hogshead-Makar, who has devoted her career to the advancement of girls and women in sports. Why has coverage of women's sports stopped post-Olympics? More than 40 years after the enactment of Title IX, a law that says that any school receiving federal funds cannot discriminate based on sex, there are still huge disparities, she said, with men getting $190 million more per year in college athletic scholarships than women. ""It's appalling what these huge differences are. Any fifth-grader can walk into your average high school or college softball baseball facility and say, 'Duh, that's not equal.' "" Hogshead-Makar, who is chief executive officer of the advocacy group Champion Women, said even though Title IX requires that women get the same access to media and support that men get, it's not happening. ""The coupling of sexism and sport, having this be an exclusionary practice, is still a strong one,"" said the 1984 Olympic champion. Attitudes about women and sports still have a long way to go before we get to true gender equality, based on a recent poll by Always, the brand that brought us the viral #LikeAGirl video sensation. While a majority of the 1,800 men and women polled said both genders were equal in math and science, they said sports was the one area where they believe there are differences. A significant percentage of both women and men said men are better at sports, with 32% of women feeling that way and 47% of men, the poll found. Hilary Knight, a member of the U.S. Olympic hockey team, called the findings ""disappointing"" but said women's sports is still young, with Title IX only a few decades old. ""It's just a gradual growth process that we kind of have to see through,"" said Knight, who appears in the most recent #LikeAGirl video, this one released for International Women's Day this month, showcasing women proudly talking about how they shoot, score and do chemistry like a girl. Knight admits the changes in women's sports might not come during her hockey career but says she believes they will eventually come, especially as more women play the game. When she started playing hockey 15 years ago, there were few girls who did. Today, you walk into a local rink and you'll find girls' and boys' teams, she said. ""It's a slow process, but as long as you are changing the stereotype, and you are really empowering women and girls to feel proud of who they are and not hindering their progress in any way, I think we are going to see sport get to where it needs to be."" Michele Yulo, whose 9-year-old daughter, Gabi, plays basketball and baseball on boys' teams, also thinks it will take time to create the opportunities for women, which will help change the mindset about women and sports. Her main focus, she says, is on making sure girls like her daughter can play the sports they love. In June, her daughter will play in an all-girls baseball tournament in Orlando organized by a program called Baseball for All, which was founded to ensure that girls can play baseball when they are young and continue playing the game when they are older. ""What I think is gaining traction is an awareness of female athletes in general and recognition of their strength, skill and determination -- and that yes, this has some effect on the popularity and growth of women's sports programs,"" said Yulo, creator of the blog Princess Free Zone. ""There seems to be a greater push for girls and women to be taken seriously in sports."" Girls' and women's sports are growing in popularity as participation increases, said Deborah Slaner Larkin, chief executive officer of the Women's Sports Foundation. Slaner Larkin points to U.S. women's soccer star Alex Morgan, for example, who has over 1.5 million followers on Twitter, and how the upcoming Women's World Cup in Canada is a trending topic worldwide. That said, girls have more than 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play sports than boys do in high school and about 63,000 fewer participation slots at the college level, according to Slaner Larkin. ""Once sports are recognized as a birthright for both genders, the rest will fall into place,"" she said. Helping get us there, she said, is a new generation of moms who played sports as a result of Title IX, which became law in 1972. ""These women identify as athletes and women's sports fans, and they will now pass down their experiences to their daughters,"" she said. Getting women into the stands is key to winning television coverage and the big salaries that come with that exposure, said Michael Graber, a sports cinematographer and father of two girls. ""In sports TV, the tail wags the dog. The money goes where the audience is,"" said Graber, who is the husband of  Diana Graber, the co-founder of the digital literacy site CyberWise.org. ""Money will go to women's sports as soon as an audience wants to watch women, so the best way to support women athletes is by attending women's sports in the first place."" John Furjanic of Chicago said he and a friend took their young daughters to a DePaul University women's basketball game for Valentine's Day for the third year in a row. ""In my humble opinion, any father who doesn't take their young daughters to watch women's sports (at all levels -- grammar school through pro) is missing a chance to expose their children to the opportunities that await them,"" said Furjanic, whose daughter is 7. ""Long-term, parents taking kids to women's games and women's teams promoting themselves in schools has to be helpful to establishing widespread popularity, generations at a time."" Getting more people into the stands and seeing more girls play more sports will bring about change, many women say. So too will seeing new leaders emerge who believe in gender equality in all areas, including sports. ""Sports are a microcosm of life,"" said Slaner Larkin. ""As we begin to see a more diverse group of men and women in leadership and decision-making roles throughout the industry, we should also see significant changes in media, sponsorship and other fundamental areas of support."" Hogshead-Makar, the former Olympic champion, told me about a case she recently learned about involving dramatically unequal facilities for the women's softball and men's baseball teams at a public high school in Indiana. ""It tells the baseball players you're more important,"" she said. ""That's equally as unhealthy, as for a girl to hear that she's not as important as for him to hear that he's more important."" ""When the leadership says, 'We're going to make this just as important,' "" change will come, she said. What do you think it will take for women's sports to get the same attention as men's sports?

"(CNN)Ted Cruz is going on Obamacare. The newly announced Republican presidential candidate told CNN's Dana Bash on Tuesday that he will sign up for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act -- a law he has been on a crusade to kill. ""We'll be getting new health insurance and we'll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we'll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,"" Cruz said. Asked whether he would accept the government contribution available to lawmakers and congressional staffers for their health care coverage through the ACA, Cruz said he will ""follow the text of the law."" ""I strongly oppose the exemption that President Obama illegally put in place for members of Congress because (Senate Minority Leader) Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn't want to be under the same rules as the American people,"" Cruz said, before repeating: ""I believe we should follow the text of the law."" Under the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress and some designated congressional staffers are required to obtain health care coverage through the D.C. Health Link Small Business Market. The Office of Personnel Management's guidelines state that lawmakers and their staff receive a ""government contribution"" if they get health care coverage through the ACA. But some lawmakers have declined to accept the contribution, saying they do not want to get special treatment. After the interview, a Cruz spokesperson clarified that he wouldn't take the contribution. Cruz's admission comes one day after CNN first reported that the senator would no longer have access to health benefits through his wife's employer, Goldman Sachs. Heidi Cruz, a managing director at the firm's Houston office, has gone on unpaid leave for the duration of the senator's presidential campaign and will not have access to the company's benefits during that time. Cruz's campaign appeared caught by surprise Monday by questions about the senator's health care. Asked how Cruz's family would be covered after his wife lost her Goldman Sachs benefits, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler repeatedly answered that he didn't know. It's a deeply ironic development for the Texas conservative firebrand, who vaulted to fame during his few years in the Senate in large part by denouncing President Barack Obama's landmark health care law. He led an effort to defund the law that contributed to the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz denied that there was anything ironic about him going on Obamacare, saying he was simply following the law. ""I believe we should follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with,"" Cruz told CNN. ""It's one of the real differences -- if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change."" After the publication of this story, Cruz advisers said there was nothing unusual about the senator signing up for insurance coverage through his employer. They argued that Obamacare has wiped out the individual market, leaving Cruz with few options. Cruz said he will continue advocating for repealing the law. ""What is problematic about Obamacare is that it is killing millions of jobs in this country and has killed millions of jobs,"" Cruz said. ""It has forced millions of people into part time work. It has caused millions of people to lose their insurance, to lose their doctors and to face skyrocketing insurance premiums. That is unacceptable."" CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","After interview, Cruz spokesperson says senator won't take government contribution to purchase Obamacare ."
"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces have started what they believe will be the conclusive push to retake the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS, a paramilitary force participating in the offensive said Tuesday. The forces have started ""the decisive operation"" to liberate Tikrit just over a week after the overall operation began, advancing toward the city from several directions, according to a statement from the predominantly Shiite paramilitary force Hashd Al-Shaab. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured parts of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. In the past few days, forces progressed roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) down one road toward the city and, by Monday, were about a mile from its center. ISIS fighters have retreated toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaab's media office said Tuesday. Al-Shaab's forces appear to be leading the fight for Tikrit, with support from the Iraqi army and Sunni tribesmen. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report from Atlanta.","A major offensive for the city was launched just over a week ago .

"Lenakel, Vanuatu (CNN)Jacobeth Nilah wails in pain in the storm-battered hospital. The 9-year-old girl suffered a head injury when the roof of her family home fell on top of her as Tropical Cyclone Pam raged over the South Pacific island where she lives. The storm, one of the most powerful ever to make landfall, killed her mother and brother. Now, Jacobeth's life hangs in the balance, says Dr. Lawrence Boe. If she's not airlifted soon, she could die in the stricken hospital whose equipment was damaged in the cyclone, the doctor told CNN on Tuesday. She needs surgery and a bed in an intensive care unit. Dr. Boe is the only doctor at the hospital, which is the only hospital on Tanna, one of more than 80 islands that make up the nation of Vanuatu. Cyclone Pam raked across the archipelago with 155 mph (250 kph) winds over the weekend, destroying thousands of homes and killing at least 11 people. The storm also cut off communications between the capital, Port Vila, and many of the outer islands like Tanna. That left Dr. Boe unable to reach anyone in the capital to ask for supplies or a medevac for Jacobeth, who lies in a room with dozens of other patients who were injured in the storm. Dr. Boe used a CNN satellite phone on Tuesday to raise the alarm. He said he thinks authorities are going to send some help. He listed to CNN some of the basic but vital resources the hospital is lacking: ""Water and food for the patients and some medical supplies to deal with the injuries. IV fluids and rehydration fluids for dehydration."" ""Water would be number one on the list,"" he said. Tanna is an hour-long flight from the capital. And the town of Lenakel, where the hospital is situated, is another 45 minutes of rugged driving from the airstrip. Aid groups have expressed serious fears about the potential scale of the devastation left by the cyclone on the more remote islands of Vanuatu, where many people live in rickety homes made of thatch or metal sheets. The death toll currently stands at 11, according to Vanuatu authorities, five of them from Tanna. But officials say it will take days or even weeks to get a full picture of the destruction. The country's roughly 260,000 citizens are spread across about 65 inhabited islands. Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale has called Cyclone Pam ""a monster,"" saying it has set back the development of his country, already one of the poorest in the region, by years. One aid organization has said it could be one of the worst disasters ever to hit the Pacific. The storm flooded many of the wards of the hospital on Tanna, which lies near the southern end of the archipelago. Half of the hospital is unusable. As the cyclone pummeled the hospital and its surroundings, the patients cowered in two rooms. Uprooted trees now litter the building's surroundings. Its flagpole was snapped in half. Volunteer nurses have come to help the dozens of patients. One baby was born Monday and now lies on a bed in the ruined maternity ward. Her parents, Alina and Ron Loman, haven't chosen a name yet. They're just happy their child is healthy amid so much destruction. CNN's Ivan Watson reported from Lenakel, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","A 9-year-old girl with head injuries urgently needs airlifting for surgery, doctor says .

"(CNN)Michael Graves, an American architect and designer, died Thursday at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, of natural causes, according to his firm. The award-winning architect died ""suddenly and peacefully"" from natural causes, according to a statement from Michael Graves Architecture and Design. He was 80. Graves was one of the most revered contemporary architects, known for his postmodern designs, and won hundreds of prizes in his field. He started his practice in 1964, which designed over 400 buildings worldwide. Architecture critics hailed him as one of the original American voices in architecture as he has designed hundreds of buildings for corporations, governments, foundations and universities. Among his noted works are The Portland Building in Oregon, The Humana Building in Louisville, Kentucky, the NCAA Hall of Champions in Indiana, and the Team Disney building in Burbank, California. He has been praised for making buildings functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. For many Americans, Graves might be best known as the designer of household items. One of his best known designs was the Alessi stainless steel teakettle with a red bird at the tip that sang when water had boiled. Graves helped propel Target and its collaborations with designers to massive popularity. His line for Target included practical items from tea kettles and drying racks to whimsical kitchen equipment like an avocado scooper and large bamboo salad tongs. His Target line came with a simple, idealistic premise: ""Good design should be affordable to all."" His designs were also sold at JCPenney and Black & Decker. He was awarded the National Medal of the Arts, as well as the Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture. Born in Indianapolis, Graves received his training at the University of Cincinnati and Harvard. In 1962, he began teaching at Princeton University. In 2003, Graves became paralyzed from the chest down after suffering what started out as a sinus infection. Graves recalled being severely ill and examining the ugly sheets and bad design in hospitals. He decided: ""It's far too ugly for me to die here."" The illness phased in a new chapter in his life. Struggling in hospital rooms made him determined to improve health care facilities and designs, including more user-friendly hospital furniture for patients. ""I wouldn't have been a health care nut if it hadn't been for my paralysis, so something good came from this,"" he told CNN in 2011. Michael Graves: Why hospital rooms don't work . Throughout his illness, Graves continued to sketch. ""Whether I was paralyzed or not, I would draw, because drawing for me is like playing the piano,"" he told CNN. ""You've got to keep practicing, got to keep doing it. It's not that you lose it, but you don't draw as well if you don't draw every day.""","American architect Michael Graves dies in Princeton at age 80 .

"(CNN)The caller sounds extremely worried. He tells a 911 dispatcher that he hit someone with his car. ""We need an ambulance right now,"" the caller tells the California Highway Patrol.

On Tuesday the highway patrol released two 911 calls from the incident in which the frantic caller pleads for medical help for the man. The operator tells him the highway patrol is on the way. He asks the caller if the person is walking. The caller says he didn't see the man because of the setting sun and again worries about medical assistance. ""I need an ambulance, man. Ambulance.

This guy is hurt,"" the caller says. Another 911 dispatcher tells him the ambulance is already en route and transfers him to a medical services dispatcher. Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy said Monday. The posted speed limit was 55. The jogger, identified as Jose LuQuin Jimenez,  was in fair condition Tuesday, a spokesman for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital said. The man suffered multiple fractures, Clotworthy said earlier. ""Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way,"" said Clotworthy. According to the spokesman, the jogger and Crosby were on the same side of the road. Pedestrians are supposed to be on the left side of the road walking toward traffic, Clotworthy said. Joggers are considered pedestrians. Crosby is known for weaving multilayered harmonies over sweet melodies. He is part of the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash, and was also a member of the Byrds. ""David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone. And, based off of initial reports, he is relieved that the injuries to the gentleman were not life threatening,"" said Michael Jensen, a Crosby spokesman. ""He wishes the jogger a very speedy recovery."" CNN's Dana Ford, Tony Marco and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Caller pleads for medical help for the man he hit with his car .

"New York (CNN)A missing eighth-grade student who was found dead near his Pennsylvania home on Sunday died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the county medical examiner. Cayman Naib, 13, vanished Wednesday after leaving his home in Newtown Township without his wallet or his phone, according to his parents. A K-9 unit located his body Sunday afternoon some 150 yards away from his home, said Mark Hopkins, chief of Greater Philadelphia Search and Rescue.  Hopkins said Naib was under snow, and in a ""sleeping position."" Brian Razzi, chief of administration at the Delaware County Medical Examiner's Office, determined Monday that it was a suicide. Naib's parents confirmed the news on Facebook. ""For those who have been following the Naib family's sad and incredibly devastating news, we have just learned from the medical examiner's office that Cayman took his own life,"" wrote Becky and Farid Naib. ""The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head."" They said the gun had been taken from the home. ""The police have informed us that despite being fitted with a trigger lock, the gun was still able to be fired,"" they said Monday. The Naibs said Cayman's suicide most likely occurred Wednesday evening, just hours after he walked out of his home upon receiving an upsetting email from his school. ""Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue homework (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any preplanning,""  read a Thursday facebook post. ""He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this,"" the parents wrote. A search for the teen had drawn hundreds of volunteers, who traded messages and posted updates on a Facebook page called ""Find Cayman."" ""The family would like to reiterate their profound gratitude and appreciation for all the thousands of friends, family, community, law enforcement, local, county, and federal, search and rescue, fire departments, the school communities ... and even perfect strangers who came out to volunteer, supported them with prayers and good wishes, and have loved them through this heartbreaking ordeal,"" read a Monday post on the site, since renamed ""Celebrating Cayman.""  ""Their only solace throughout these past few days has been the closure they have received from the community's efforts to find Cayman.""

"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)Two men in blue smocks were mopping up blood spilled in the main entrance to the Dijla Hospital south of Tikrit when we arrived there mid-morning Friday. The air shook with outgoing rockets and artillery roaring toward the center of the city. We were escorted by men from the Badr Brigade, the biggest and best-organized Iranian-backed force fighting ISIS. As we got out of our car, a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the Iraqi Red Crescent beckoned urgently to video journalist Mary Rogers to come inside. He led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five men, some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns, others in dark green military fatigues. They were huddled over a man naked to the waist, a thick plastic tube inserted in his side, red with blood, leading to a bottle filling up with more blood. The wounded man -- no one knew his name -- had been shot in the head, the chest and the leg. He was motionless. The head doctor, in dark green combat fatigues, told me the man was in critical condition. All the while, the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central Tikrit. From the sound, it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby. Several other wounded fighters were in the entrance, but their condition was much less grave. One, who identified himself as Sadiq, had been shot in the upper thigh, but was fully conscious. He told producer Kareem Khadder he had been shot in central Tikrit that morning, recalling at the time he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense. While Mary and Kareem were doing that interview, I walked around the hospital to see if there was anything else that might help us put together a report. It was a ramshackle place, it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while, perhaps because until recently it was in no-man's land. When I went back to see where Mary and Kareem were, I was told Mary was down a corridor where an ""operation"" was about to take place. Mary was invited to film the operation. I found her putting on a surgical gown and blue shoe covers. Several men rolled a gurney through the corridor in our direction. The same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room. He never made it into the operating theater. A different set of doctors or medics started working on him, pumping air into his lungs, then applying CPR. His chest took a final heave, as the doctors tried to find a pulse, but there was no pulse to find. There was no ""operation."" This was a last, desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying. His face was yellow and waxy. He was dead, but the doctors didn't call time of death, . In the meantime, our escorts were calling us to leave, we needed to move to our next destination, which they had told us was the position from which artillery and rocket launchers were at work. Mary, who was at the far end of the gurney, wedged her way out and we went outside.  She went to the car, I chatted with a pair of Iraqi journalists in the entrance. They had been here for more than two weeks. I bade them farewell, and walked toward our car. And then, everything changed. I heard a commotion behind me, and the doctor I had spoken to before passed me, shouting, ""Grab all the cameras! Get the cameras!"" ""What's the problem?"" I asked him. He didn't provide an explanation. ""Give us your cameras now!"" he barked at me. A group of militiamen had surrounded Kareem, and was insisting he give them his small camera. More militiamen, plus some of the hospital staff gathered around him, shouting angrily that all cameras must be surrendered. Right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle, about to shoot in the air. This is going to get very messy, I thought to myself. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and there was no shooting. But everyone was very agitated. Much shouting ensued between our entourage and the local militiamen. Our chief escort, Ma'in Al-Kadhimi, was gesturing wildly and arguing with them to calm down, but he wasn't having much luck. He is a commander of the Badr Organisation, but these men were with the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade (Kataib Jund Al-Imam in Arabic). It's a separate group, and clearly Al-Kadhimi, who was treated with deference by his own men, didn't enjoy the same esteem here. In the meantime, I joined Mary in our car, concerned that too many of us arguing with this large group would only make matters worse. Kareem was busy negotiating outside the hospital. We locked the car doors and did our best to pretend we were simply waiting patiently to move. Soon a group of men armed with AK-47 assault rifles gathered outside the car, knocking on the window and angrily gesturing that we must give them the camera. Mary discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one. It's an old trick that sometimes works in situations like these.  Although I could understand everything this crowd was saying, I feigned ignorance. This went on for about 45 minutes. Some in our entourage were trying to keep the crowd from banging on the car windows and wrenching open the locked doors. Kareem hid his small camera in one of the cars and saw the big camera being taken away by several people. Kareem followed the camera to make sure it was safe. Inside, everyone was shouting, with Kareem refusing to do anything before someone explained what was going on. The armed men wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted, and weren't going to take ""no"" for an answer. Kareem then went inside one of the rooms to carry on negotiations. Armed men barred Kareem from leaving the room. Eventually, Kareem said we should delete the sequence of the dying man, after our Iraqi security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise, we were in trouble. Kareem looked at the camera and noticed the card was missing. A media-savvy member of the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade insisted we were hiding the card with the footage. Finally Kareem returned and said that if we didn't hand over the camera there would be trouble. The atmosphere was such that we realized that not handing over the camera would make matters much worse. So we gave Kareem the camera and waited. A few minutes later, he returned. They know the data card is empty. They want the one with the pictures, he said. So we gave it to him. Soon Kareem was back. ""They don't know how to delete the pictures of the dying man,"" he said. So Mary went with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man. To cut a long, tense story short, Mary didn't delete the footage. Someone else did, all the footage from the hospital. After about an hour and a half, we finally left the hospital compound. Our escort, Al-Kadhimi, was shaken. He, and we, were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the Tikrit front, there might be unity against ISIS, but that's about where it ends.","A CNN crew finds medical personnel trying to save a wounded fighter in Tikrit .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight collapsed in court Friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $25 million in a murder case, an amount  Knight's attorney said was excessively high. The attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post. Knight bent over in his chair at the defense table, with his attorney beside him, and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown. Moments earlier, the judge ruled that Knight ""has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past."" ""In this court's opinion, $25 million is reasonable, and it is so set,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. Attorney Matthew Fletcher told CNN affiliate KABC that Knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out. Fletcher later saw Knight in the holding cell, and ""he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him,"" Fletcher told the station. ""And he wiped the sweat off his head and said, 'I haven't had my medication,' and I said since when, and he said since yesterday. That's when I went back in and told the judge 'You need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he hasn't been fed' and the judge said, 'Well, they offered him food at some point today,' and I said well that's not what I've heard,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. Knight, who suffers from diabetes and blood clots, was taken to the hospital, the attorney said. Knight's condition was not immediately available. He has collapsed before while in custody. Knight has been held in solitary confinement, Fletcher added. When asked about the $25 million bail, Fletcher said, ""It's just laughable."" The bail in other prominent murder cases ""at most is $5 million,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. ""The heads of the Mafia, $5 million (bail),"" Fletcher said. Prosecutors sought the $25 million bail, he added. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 13. Knight, 49, has pleaded not guilty to several charges that accuse him of running over two men -- killing one of them -- in January after an argument. Knight is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run, with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, prosecutors said. The man who died was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap record label owner. The second man is Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, 51. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. At the time of his most recent arrest, Knight was free on bail in a robbery case. CNN's Rosalina Nieves, Paul Vercammen, Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","""It's just laughable,"" Knight's attorney says about high bail .

"Paris (CNN)French police have arrested four people linked to Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman and hostage-taker at a Parisian kosher supermarket on January 9, a Paris prosecutor's spokesman said. A French policewoman is among the four taken into custody, French national police said. The policewoman worked at the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois, northeast of Paris, the spokesman said. According to Le Figaro newspaper, the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois is the location of an important intelligence center. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store before police shot and killed him. His attack followed one on the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. France has been under a heightened state of alert since January's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, authors of the deadly attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices, were killed days later after two violent standoffs. The brothers were accused of killing 12 people in a massacre at the magazine offices. Coulibaly, suspected in the slaying of a police officer, was killed by security forces after he shot and killed four hostages during the siege at the kosher market. Charlie Hebdo has a controversial history of depicting the Prophet Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. Earlier cartoons depicting Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago. Since the attack, European nations have carried out raids on suspected terror cells with links to ISIS in Syria.","Four people connected to gunman Amedy Coulibaly have been arrested, official says .

"(CNN)Nearly 70 years ago, comic strip detective Dick Tracy showed off his first two-way wrist radio, inspiring baby boomers to babble into their knuckles in pursuit of bad guys like Pruneface and the Mole.  The gadget was updated to a TV phone in 1964, heralding a fantastic future for mobile communications. A half-century later the future is finally here, with a new wave of Tracy-esque devices certain to accelerate following the much anticipated debut of Apple Watch in April -- which became official with the company's ""Spring Forward"" preview on Monday. In classic fashion, consumers huddled around Apple stores to get a peek, some even showing up wearing padded wrist ""hoodies"" to make room for the watch when it goes on sale next month.   Naturally, Apple faithful were urged on by Tim Cook, who tweeted: ""Got some extra rest for today's event.  Slept  in 'til 4:30."" Arianna Huffington weighed in on Twitter, too: ""Looking forward to a smart watch that tells me not to cram too many things into too few hours."" Analysts project sales of 25 million the first year and nearly 70 million by 2018. Prices for the new watch range from $349 to a reported high of $17,000 for an 18-karat gold version to make any Rolex show-off feel at home. Enthusiasm for Apple Watch -- and its long line of apps -- could lift the fortunes of Samsung, Sony, Pebble and others pitching their own interactive watches, making the human wrist the most coveted piece of real estate since the redevelopment of Times Square. If Apple Watch does indeed take off, it would reignite the emerging -- but tricky -- market for wearable devices following Google's sudden move in January to halt public sales of its Glass product, which failed to catch on in light of what the Wall Street Journal said were concerns over ""privacy, technical shortcomings and a lack of obvious uses.""  The company is going back to its drawing board and hopes to re-introduce Glass later this year. As the wearables wrist race heats up, it's worth considering how these meta-timepieces -- with their tactile messaging, biometric loops and eye-controlled display screens -- could alter everyday behavior and spur new codes of etiquette, not to mention a few novel personality disorders. One of the most awaited features of Apple Watch will be its ""taptic"" engine, a sensory feedback tool derived from gamer joystick technology that allows for personalized tapping vibrations -- a ""Yo""-like blip for a work pal or an echo of your own heartbeat captured through an embedded cardio sensor. Of course, your intended recipients will need their own Apple Watch to ""feel"" your greeting. Early adopters will have to be extra careful with these taps -- imagine the explaining needed when someone inevitably sends a sonic valentine of their beating heart to their boss, or their child's soccer coach. Taptic wrist vibes can also carry a purpose -- reminding you to pick up a carton of eggs on your way home from work, or delivering an insistent flick from a client demanding a call-back. Therein lies a brave new response in human conditioning. All of us are accustomed to electronic signals -- an alarm clock in the morning or a pop-up calendar invite on your phone.  But there's something Manchurian Candidate-like about a digital prompt delivered palpably to your wrist. Sure, the watch is a transmitter, but it's the person who's being programmed. In the not-so-distant future, that driver you see lurching toward the off-ramp or the friend whose face glazes over at lunch could be in the grip of a taptic command from their watch. As an accessory, smart watches are perfect for new spatial positioning technology, such as Apple's iBeacon, which can triangulate a user's exact location inside a building and allow targeted messaging when deployed in, say, a supermarket. Wall Street Journal tech columnist Christopher Mims recently extolled the promise of iBeacon synched to your wrist device. He wrote: ""Imagine walking into a grocery store with a shopping list on your watch, which knows your location so precisely that it can plot a route through the store, saving you the frustration of wandering from aisle to aisle, wondering where that one particular item is."" That sounds great -- until the day our shopper, now utterly dependent on the beaconing system, discovers in a panic that she left her watch on her bedroom dresser.  ""How will I ever find the A-1 sauce?"" will come the cry.  You laugh now, but look what's happened to legions of drivers, who can no longer navigate their own cities without relying on GPS.  Look for more pile-ups at the deli counter once users let their watches do their shopping. The real question is what strategies smart-watch wearers will devise so as not to appear to be staring at their wrists all day. Anyone who's ever been trapped in an interminable business meeting or on an awkward date knows there are only so many ways you can discreetly glance at your watch before it becomes obvious.  Now, suppose you're trying to follow someone's Instagram or Twitter feed or the score of the Yankees game, or perform any of a myriad functions that phone users have been doing for years, but which might look a little ruder when applied to your wristwatch. Definitely expect to see more people fiddling with their sleeves, admiring their nails and earnestly cupping their brows with their opposite hand, in order to get a better look at the action on their watch. Many users may end up simply removing their watches and dropping them in their laps alongside their phones, so they can tap with one hand and swipe with the other. As an unexpected boon to evolution, Apple may soon be responsible for helping humans achieve a new level of ambidexterity, along with super-strong eye muscles. Of course, a constantly raised wrist puts a strain on the shoulder, which suggests we'll soon be hearing about exercises designed to prevent watch fatigue. Some enterprising type might come up with a fashionable i-sling or support cushion to keep the arm and wrist sufficiently elevated to allow for hours of uninterrupted tapping and finger sketching. With so many digital features to track personal fitness -- including Apple Watch's ""accelerometer,"" which will measure total body movement, as well as the number of steps and calories burned in a day -- the new wearables aspire to promote extreme wellness. The flip side is that such constant self-assessment will also lead to an increase in hypochondria and OCD symptoms among many wearers who already went nuts with their Fitbits. And get ready for a new universal facial expression to emerge on elevators, subways and at the dinner table, as users learn to open their little round retina using just their eyes.  It will be unblinking, mesmerized and Zombie-like, with a hint of chin dribble:  the Smart Watch Stare.  I'm looking forward to practicing my own version.  And if Pruneface is out there listening, I'm coming for you.","Allan Ripp: Preview of Apple Watch opens up challenging new world of etiquette, behaviors as people adjust themselves to it .
From having to find subtle ways to glance at wrist, to relying on watch to guide us around a market, we'll feel like watch programming us ."
"(CNN)The cost of college has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. Students today face annual costs, between tuition and living, that can easily exceed $10,000 at a community college, $18,000 at a public four-year college (in-state), and $40,000 at a private four-year school. It's unsurprising that today's students often graduate with large debt loads. More than two-thirds of students graduate with debt. And the average amount of debt owed is about $30,000. Given the cost of college, students and families need to know that they're making a good investment. That's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes, not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits. A college degree is the only sure path to middle-class security, and because young people and their parents know that, the cost of college, and the availability of loans and other aid, has become a powerful political issue. But for all the attention paid to the price of college, we haven't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money's worth. Is American higher education worth the price? Are students and their families getting what they're paying for? There's plenty of evidence that for many of them, the answer is no. In 2006, a government study found that nearly 70% of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials. In a 2011 book, ""Academically Adrift,"" researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45% of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking, complex reasoning, and communication skills after two years of college. Even at the end of four years, 36% of the students hadn't gained those skills. Given the evidence, maybe it's not a surprise that employers aren't impressed by recent college graduates. Employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students: the ability to critically think, communicate, work in a team, write effectively, and adapt. Yet only about one-quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today's global economy. A recent Gallup poll found that only 11% of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job. In addition to money, these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests, but the time doesn't seem to have translated into learning. Why is this? Perhaps it's as simple as this: We measure education in terms of time, rather than learning. A four-year degree attests that you have acquired 120 credits. That's an accidental result of the credit hour system, which was created by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie more than 100 years ago, for the purpose of providing struggling professors with pensions. At the turn of the 20th century, Carnegie created a $10 million free pension fund to help professors retire. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which was set up to administer the fund, determined that only ""full-time"" faculty would qualify for pensions, which they defined as teaching 12 ""credit units,"" with each unit equal to one hour of faculty-student contact time per week, over a 15-week semester. While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload, the credit hour quickly morphed into much more. The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning, but the temptation of an easy-to-understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist. It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier. If credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning, they would be fully transferable across institutions. An hour in Arizona is an hour in New York. But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges, suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves, they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned.  Many students, however, believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next. This is an unfortunate and costly assumption, as community college students in Louisiana will tell you. Until recently, Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four-year state school. That's a year of time and money lost. Given that nearly 60% of students in the United States attend two or more colleges, the nontransfer of credits has huge costs, not only to individuals, but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time. If higher education doesn't trust its own credits, why should anyone else? And Louisiana students aren't alone; transfer students across the country lose credits, which lengthens their time to get a degree. So we have two problems: Students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money-- can't use or transfer them. Others who have accumulated costly credits haven't learned much. And then there's a third dimension: Millions of people who have learned a great deal have no ""credit"" because they learned it at the wrong place — that is to say, not at a ""college."" Someone who has spent the last 10 years working as a nurse's aid in a hospital who decides to go get a nursing degree has to start from scratch, taking introductory courses he could probably teach, because colleges treat those without credits as blank slates. Employees at a biotech company with a high-quality on-the-job training program might learn more than someone in a two-year college science program, but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning, the learning won't ""count."" For the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill, the focus on time rather than learning, especially when between family and work, their time is scarce, is a daunting proposition. State and federal governments add to the problem, because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year, most of it is for time served, in the form of credit hours, rather than learning achieved. We need to stop counting time and start counting learning. What could that look like? We don't have to wonder; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time—some for decades. One relatively new program is Southern New Hampshire University's College for America, or CfA, an online ""competency-based"" Associate of Arts degree aimed at working adults. The program has no courses, no credit hours and no grades. The school has broken down what students with a degree from CfA should know and be able to do, what it calls competencies. CfA worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for, like communication, critical thinking and teamwork. Then faculty designed real-world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency. Unlike in credit-hour courses, CfA has no seat-time requirements. Students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies. Someone who worked at a PR firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies. And the faster students can progress, the less they will ultimately pay. Students pay $1,250 for all-they-can-learn in six months. This means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they don't already know, rather than wasting it on what they already do. Students at CfA can be confident that their time and money are well spent and, at the end, they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do. CfA is not the only one to offer this to students, nor the only model. Hundreds of schools, from Antioch to the University of Michigan to Purdue University, are looking to offer competency-based certificate, associate, and baccalaureate degree programs.  How are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition? In many cases, the answer is surprisingly simple—and, sadly, not commonplace in higher education—by focusing on what students need in order to, wait for it, learn. Fancy amenities, great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention, but they have little to nothing to do with student learning. Some competency-based programs don't focus on research -- faculty are hired for specific expertise, like curriculum design, English literature or advising. Other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling. This allows for more targeted, personalized support by faculty. There is, however, a downside for students: Self-paced competency-based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time-based credit hour, making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support. Without access to these dollars, the programs will remain one-offs and unavailable to the majority of Americans who could use them. Only recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $150 billion-plus financial aid budget. The U.S. Department of Education is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour, and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the House and Senate to explore innovative ways of paying for learning, rather than time. As higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive, measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students, taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford. Paying for what students learn and can do, rather than how or where they spent their time, would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed, high-quality degrees and credentials.","Is American higher education worth the price?

"(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, ""You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year."" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on ""external operations,"" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit ""several targets"" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent ""three brothers"" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had ""lost contact with them."" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the ""simplest things such as  household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as  killing tools."" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but ""we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations."" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a ""well-known"" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making ""distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike."" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are ""still circling our skies every day"" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but ""then they come back when the sky is clear."" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones ""but no result so far,"" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was ""primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone."" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to ""bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan."" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials ""reached out to"" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book ""Manhunt,"" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a ""gift"" to him ""from all the brothers."" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is ""dangerous for the environment of the region."" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to ""send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions."" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand ""the enemy's policies in the region."" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter ""promptly"" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said bin Laden had lived in Somalia.","New documents show al Qaeda's desperate straits in Osama bin Laden's final years .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Nepal's only international airport remains closed two days after a Turkish Airlines plane skidded off the tarmac and blocked the airport's only runway. Officials said Tribhuvan International would reopen at 10 a.m. local time Saturday as preparations to move the plane continue. ""We do not know now if it will take longer than then to move the plane,"" Purna Chudal, manager of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, told CNN. More then 160 flights have been canceled since Wednesday's incident, leaving more than 24,000 passengers stranded as officials struggle to remove the immobile Airbus A330 off the runway, Chudal said. The timing of the incident is problematic for Nepal's tourism industry, which is gearing up for the 2015 climbing season. Foreigners heading to Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains transit through the airport. The authority initially said it would reopen the airport at 10 a.m. Friday, later revising that to 5 p.m., but workers were unable to remove the aircraft by that time. They were able to lift the plane's nose -- originally pitched down -- and change its tires. The main challenge now is to push the grass-grounded plane back onto the runway. Officials say the area under the plane needs to be firmed up -- a process that involves digging into the ground and filling it with gravel -- before push back can commence. The Turkish Airways incident didn't result in any major injuries but the plane has remained aground as Nepal doesn't have the necessary equipment to move it. Cargo planes were unable to fly in heavy-duty machinery because there was nowhere to land. A specialized aircraft carrying experts and aircraft removal equipment from India reportedly arrived on Thursday. Tribhuvan airport is usually closed between midnight and 6 a.m. but will remain open for 24 hours for the next few days until the backlog is cleared. More than 12,000 people fly in and out of the airport daily. The facility services about 80 international flights per day. Domestic service -- operated by by 18 and 40-seater jets -- was not disrupted. Journalist Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu and CNN's Maggie Hiufu Wong wrote this story from Hong Kong.","Services at Nepal's only international airport disrupted for the third day by a stranded plane .

"(CNN)President Barack Obama said Saturday that he learned Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for government business ""through news reports"" and was glad his former secretary of state asked for those emails to be made public. ""The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived,"" Obama said in an interview with CBS News. ""I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed."" Clinton used a private email account -- housed in servers at her New York home -- for the four years she served as America's top diplomat, a practice that skirted legal standards in place and has some Republicans calling for investigations. On Wednesday night, the former secretary of state tweeted that she ""asked State to release"" her email, a request accepted by the department. Obama backed Clinton's request, telling CBS that he thinks ""the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need."" While Obama commented on the issue Saturday, Clinton didn't mention it during an 18-minute appearance on stage at a Clinton Global Initiative event at the University of Miami. Clinton took no questions from reporters at the event. Instead, Clinton's remarks to about 1,000 students focused on the foundation's work, including a new report she will roll out Monday about the underrepresentation of women and girls. ""There's so much that needs to be done,"" Clinton said on the issue of equaling the playing field for women and girls. As she regularly does, Clinton said there is ""a lot of unfinished business"" to do on the issue. Obama sat down with CBS after the president spoke at the 50th anniversary of the ""Bloody Sunday"" marches in Selma, Alabama. ""If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,"" the President said while standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the symbol of the Selma marches. ""Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer."" Clinton did not go to Selma, instead opting to attend her Clinton Foundation event in Florida. ""Watched @repjohnlewis & @BarackObama in #Selma,"" she tweeted. ""Let's answer their call to keep fighting for voting rights, civil rights, & human rights."" Clinton mentioned the anniversary on stage, tying the marches and event into her work toward leveling the playing field for women and girls. ""You can see how progress is made by looking at what happened this weekend in Selma, Alabama, where our country is marking a historic anniversary of the long march towards equality and a more perfect union, and also recommitting to carry the cause forward into the 21st century,"" Clinton said. ""So whether it's women's rights or human rights, civil rights or LGBT rights, we're counting on all of you to lead the way, and that's what the no-ceilings initiative at the Clinton Foundation is really all about.""","President pleased Hillary Clinton emails will become part of public record .

"(CNN)Thick fog forced authorities to suspend the air search Wednesday for seven Marines and four Army aircrew, feared dead after their Black Hawk helicopter crashed into waters off the Florida Panhandle. The helicopter was first reported missing at about 8:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday. Hours later, searchers found debris around Okaloosa Island near Eglin Air Force Base, base spokesman Andy Bourland said. This debris washed up on both the north and south sides of Santa Rosa Sound, which connects mainland northern Florida and a barrier island. The air search is expected to resume midday Thursday, the spokesman said. A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said that boats will continue scouring the waters throughout the night Wednesday, weather permitting. Human remains have washed ashore in the area near Eglin. Base spokeswoman Jasmine Porterfield didn't specify what was found, noting the search-and-rescue mission remained underway. Still, there was little hope for a miracle, with Gen. Martin Dempsey -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- expressing his condolences. He said the crash was ""a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk, both in training and in combat."" ""We will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for."" The Air Force, Coast Guard and civilian agencies participated in the intensive search focused on where they believe the aircraft went down, in waters east of the town of Navarre and the Navarre Bridge and near Eglin testing range site A-17. Porterfield said approximately 100 people were involved in canvassing the ground and the waters, looking for debris: ""It's a huge effort underway."" ""We're working closely with all the parties involved to locate our Marines and the Army crew that were onboard,"" added Capt. Barry Morris, a spokesman for the U.S. Marines Corps Special Operations Command. ""And, really, just our thoughts (and) prayers are with the Marines, the soldiers and the families of those involved in the mishap."" No one is saying what caused the accident, with Eglin spokeswoman Sara Vidoni indicating only that there's no indication of anything suspicious. There was heavy fog in the area when the aircraft went missing, though the Eglin spokeswoman said it's too early to tell whether that had anything to do with the crash. ""There is training in all conditions -- that's part of the military mission,"" Vidoni said. ""They were out there doing what the military does."" According to Morris, the service members -- all men -- were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations. It involved small boats and inserting and extracting Marines from the water via helicopter. Morris would not say in which phase of the training the Marines were on Tuesday night. The UH-60 helicopter wasn't alone when it went down. A second Black Hawk -- assigned to 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond, Louisiana -- safely returned to the base, some 40 miles east of Pensacola. The aircraft were both assigned to the Louisiana Army National Guard out of Hammond and taking part in what the U.S. military called a ""routine training mission involving the Marine Special Operations Regiment"" out of Camp Lejeune. ""Whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft, it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise,"" Bourland said. The Army aircrew members belonged to the Army National Guard unit out of Louisiana, part of a unit that Gov. Bobby Jindal said ""have fought courageously overseas in defense of our nation and here at home."" By 11:15 a.m., relatives of all four of those guardsmen had been notified, though their names won't be released publicly until the Coast Guard recovers their bodies or calls off the search, said Col. Pete Schneider, a Louisiana National Guard spokesman. ""They have protected what matters most during times of crisis,"" Jindal said. ""These soldiers represent the best of Louisiana, and we are praying for them and their families."" Morris said the Marines involved in the crash were all ""highly-trained"" members of that service's special operations command. They were based out of Camp Lejeune, an expansive North Carolina base that is home to about 170,000 active deputy, dependent, retired and civilian personnel. The pilots were instructor pilots, Maj. Gen. Glenn Curtis told reporters. He said the whole crew had several thousand combined hours of operation flying the Black Hawk. In January, two Marines died when their helicopter went down at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. And last March, an F/A-18C Hornet's pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada. This week's crash involved a UH-60 Black Hawk, a twin-engine helicopter introduced into Army service in 1979 in place of the iconic UH-1 Huey. Other branches have modified the Black Hawk for their own uses, including the Navy's SH-60 (the Sea Hawk), the Air Force's MH-60 (the Pave Hawk) and the Coast Guard's HH-60 (the Jayhawk). The Army's UH-60 helicopter, which has a maximum speed of 173 mph, has an airframe ""designed to progressively crush on impact to protect the crew and passengers,"" according to the service. As Morris, the Marine spokesman, pointed out, those who get on such aircraft or take part in other military exercises aren't always out of danger just because they're off the battlefield. ""We have a requirement to conduct realistic military training,"" he said. ""And unfortunately this mishap happened."" CNN's Jason Hanna, John Newsome, Victor Blackwell, Jamie Crawford and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Heavy fog is complicating efforts; the search is expected to resume Thursday .

"Washington (CNN)House Speaker John Boehner said Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is ""innocent until proven guilty"" after the U.S. military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, but emphasized in an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release. Bergdahl's attorney also released a statement on Wednesday, outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two-page letter from Bergdahl describing the torture he endured, which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Shortly after the charges were announced, Bergdahl's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to Milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier. ""In light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity Sgt. Bergdahl endured, the purpose of his leaving his unit, and his behavior while a prisoner, it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court-martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits,"" attorney Eugene R. Fidell writes in the letter. The statement includes a two-page accounting from Bergdahl of his time in captivity, in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed, then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Read the statement and Bergdahl's letter . Bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment, and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected. ""My body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year,"" he said. Bergdahl was frequently beaten, at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose, and forced to watch Taliban videos, he said. He had no concept of time, and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family. ""I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door I was held behind,"" he wrote. Bergdahl tried a dozen times to escape, he wrote. In his interview with Bash, Boehner said ""like any American, you're innocent until proven guilty."" ""And these charges are coming. There will be a trial,"" Boehner said in an interview taped Wednesday to air Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Boehner said the ""more troubling part"" of Bergdahl saga is the fact that the U.S. government traded five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release, and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield. He expressed concerns about other detainees held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, which President Barack Obama is working to close, ""ending up back on the battlefield and threatening Americans here and abroad."" Obama ""violated the law"" in failing to alert Congress before the prisoner swap occurred, Boehner added. ""And I still believe that's the more troubling part of this,"" he said. ""We've made clear in the past that we won't negotiate with terrorists, and but yet here we did."" Military officials announced Wednesday afternoon they would charge Bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years. For that, he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison, and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank, Army Col. Daniel King said as he announced the charges. Bergdahl faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate, King said. Then, he could face court martial proceedings. The decision comes nearly a year after Bergdahl returned to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange and since the Army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009. The Army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture in December. Until now, it has been in the hands of Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who made the decision to charge Bergdahl. Several U.S. military officials CNN has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected. Ahead of Wednesday's announcement, officials said Milley only had a few choices. Though the sense had been that Bergdahl must be held accountable for his actions, there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years Bergdahl was held by the Taliban. Now 28, Bergdahl was taken by the Haqqani terrorist network. But the circumstances of Bergdahl's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear. King said he couldn't offer those details on Wednesday, and that they're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against Bergdahl. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, called the charges an ""important step"" on Wednesday. ""This is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl,"" he said in a statement. ""I am confident that the Department of the Army will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, meanwhile, lambasted the ""unevenness"" of Obama's swap of five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl. ""I wouldn't have done this trade for a Medal of Honor winner,"" he told CNN. ""No military member should expect their country to turn over five Taliban commanders to get their release. Nobody should expect that. It's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it's just the illogical nature of the swap."" Some members of Bergdahl's platoon have criticized him, labeling Bergdahl a deserter. ""I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,"" former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon when he went missing on June 30, 2009, told CNN last year. ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him."" Bergdahl was freed in May when President Barack Obama agreed to swap five Taliban prisoners who had been detained in Guantanamo Bay to secure Bergdahl's freedom, sending those detainees to Qatar. Obama announced Bergdahl's release to fanfare in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the Army sergeant's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl. His hometown of Hailey, Idaho, had planned a parade to celebrate Bergdahl's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release. After returning to the United States, Bergdahl had been on active duty at an administrative job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. There, the Army assigned Bergdahl a ""sponsor"" to help him adjust to life in his new post. Upon returning, Bergdahl refused to meet with his parents -- and months later, Army officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face. The five figures the United States exchanged to secure Bergdahl's release were Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Nori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime and had been detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. The detainee swap for Bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the Taliban. CNN's Ted Barrett and Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.","House Speaker says his problem with Bergdahl case is the way prisoner swap was handled .

"(CNN)Scene: A warm beach in the Caribbean (because as long as I'm setting a scene...), March of 2015 . Two women, both, curiously, named ""Sally Kohn,"" recline and sip their drinks at they stare at the blue-green water, occasionally checking their addictive mobile devices for new emails, conversing about the third season of ""House of Cards"" and the political mess in Washington. They're both bold progressives and Democrats more by default than enthusiasm. The two Sallys are debating whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren should respond to the calls from the Boston Globe and others for her to enter the 2016 race, challenging likely frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Sally ""Idealistic"" Kohn desperately and impatiently wants the world to be a fairer and more just place and thinks progress toward that goal could immeasurably be helped by a bold leader articulating and pushing for big ideas at the top of the national and global political hierarchy.  This Sally is wearing a skimpy bikini. Sally ""Pragmatic"" Kohn wants the world to be better too, but she's all-too-aware of how progressive idealists are chewed up, spit out and drowned out by party politics. She is conscious that Barack Obama wasn't even that progressive and knows how much more centrist he became in the first six years of his presidency.  This Sally is skeptical of how much politics can be changed from the inside as well as how much politics these days can change the world, especially given entrenched partisanship.  She is wearing swim trunks, a long-sleeve UV protective t-shirt and two hats. Sally (Idealistic)  Kohn:  Elizabeth Warren is like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics today --  she's our only hope.  There's no one else speaking as sharply and powerfully about inequality and economic populism.  Plus she has solutions.  [She takes a sip of her piña colada.] . Sally (Pragmatic) Kohn:  I couldn't agree more.  Which is exactly why we shouldn't waste Warren on a dead-end presidential campaign.  [She gulps her margarita.] . Sally I. Kohn:  First of all, you don't know it's a dead end.  Barack Obama was the underdog in 2008 and look what happened.  Plus, Warren is much more popular at this point now than he was then. Sally P. Kohn:  Yeah, but in the latest CNN Democratic primary poll, Warren trails Hillary Clinton by 52 points.  Even Joe Biden fared better. Sally I. Kohn:  Those are national polls.  Primaries are run state-by-state.  And in a different poll, Democratic primary voters in Iowa and in New Hampshire favored Warren over Clinton, so.... Sally P. Kohn:  In fairness, that poll was run by Warren backers.  And anyway, nationwide 79% of Democrats have a favorable view of Clinton.  Just 37% have a favorable view of Warren. Sally I. Kohn:  Because 63% don't know her yet.  That's why she needs to run. Sally P. Kohn:  But be honest, the path to her winning is hard to see.  Sure, Barack Obama did it once, but do you really think the Clinton machine will allow itself to be defeated twice? Sally I. Kohn:  Ah, and that's reason two why Warren should run -- because even if she can't win, she will help shape the political debate and push Hillary Clinton to the left, especially around economic justice issues. Sally P. Kohn:  Maybe, but then in four or eight years when Warren would really have a shot at the presidency, she'll be a Mitt Romney-esque already-ran, not a bright shiny new candidate.  That never helps. Sally I. Kohn:  All the more reason to run now.  Now is her moment.  Now is our nation's moment, crawling out of the economic crisis, still riddled with unprecedented economic inequality, we don't need Elizabeth Warren to be president in four years or eight years or 16.  We need her now. Sally P. Kohn:  I agree that Warren is transformational and has the bold vision we need right now.  And isn't that exactly why she shouldn't run?  National big money political campaigns are where good ideas go to die. Sally I. Kohn:  Maybe Elizabeth Warren can be the candidate to change all that, the candidate for the people, not the political process -- who even appeals to and unites independent and conservative voters who know the economy is ridiculously rigged for the rich and want government to stop aiding and abetting injustice. [They both laugh uproariously at the suggestion that politics could ever be about people, not big money.] . Sally P. Kohn:  What I will say is that now is definitely the moment for a woman president!  And Hillary's the one with the best shot.  Plus, for all her coziness with Wall Street and hawkish foreign policy, she's still a bajillion times better than any of the Republican options.

And if she doesn't win the primaries, still great -- we've sent a clear message to Hillary and forced her to be more populist. Sally P. Kohn:  Maybe...  Or maybe Warren runs and wastes all her political capital, making too many compromises to be a viable candidate and losing her pedestal as an irreverent outsider and then being defeated anyway, so she's diminished in some of the power and leverage she had before, too.  She's a great leader now, right now, as is.  The magnifying glass of a national campaign could expose her imperfections or even burn her up in the sun.... [She reaches for the suntan lotion.] .

"(CNN)Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman's lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You've been here since morning. A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can't. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can't command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day. This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets. Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country. It had been exactly three years since the last contracted case. Del Estal was fascinated by this. She couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease. She traveled to a small village near Kolkata to meet a little girl who was India's last case of polio. This gave her the inspiration to begin a long-term project on those suffering in a country that's now ""polio-free."" First she met a boy named Dharmender who lived in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India. Even though his village was poor, his family took good care of him. Del Estal spent time with him and accompanied him during a surgical procedure in New Delhi. She said that while Dharmender is very fortunate to have the opportunity for surgery, he will still never have a ""normal"" life. ""His daily life is hard. ... Everybody around him was working and having a family, and he cannot have this,"" Del Estal said. ""So on one hand, it's (a) hard situation, and on the other hand, it's easier than the other boy I met."" She's speaking of Kumar, the young man who moved to New Delhi to support himself and his elderly mother back home in a village up north. Del Estal first met Kumar when she was wrapping up the first segment of her project. From the beginning, she said, he was very trusting, allowing her into his daily life. Del Estal was intent on capturing an authentic portrayal of Kumar's life -- the everyday logistics of moving through a city without one's limbs at command. She said she was amazed at how adept he was at maneuvering his world. He could carry notebooks with his neck, grasp a pencil in between his clutched fingers, smoke a cigarette using his feet and prop his arms on his knees to move them forward. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Between the two of them -- Del Estal speaking a little Hindi and Kumar speaking a little English -- they wove a patchwork language of friendship and understanding. Kumar told her of his love interest -- a girl who had feelings for him as well -- but her parents would never allow their union. Del Estal said that while Kumar wants a job, employment is next to impossible for someone in his condition. But his spirit is tenacious. He knows how to read and write and he is skilled at taking care of himself. Before heading to the main bazaar in New Delhi every day, he washes and dresses himself. There are no days off for him. As shops open and tourists fumble through a foreign world in flip-flops and Bermuda shorts, Kumar positions himself in a visible location and smiles and greets everyone who passes with, ""Namaste."" Del Estal has been so impacted by his friendship that she said her next plans are to do a project on his life. ""I want to go to his village to meet his mother and keep taking pictures about his life because he is such a beautiful person,"" she said. ""It's such a sad (circumstance) yet amazing life. I want to keep documenting his (story)."" Elena del Estal is a Spanish photographer based in India.","In March of last year, it was announced that polio had been eradicated in India .

"(CNN)Dante Alighieri, the father of the Italian language, is turning in his grave. Believe it or not, the land where Latin originated and from which many other European languages descend is becoming ""illiterate."" Not only have Italians long forgotten the language of their Roman Empire, but they hardly know how to speak and write proper Italian. They've been negatively dubbed ""asini"" (donkeys), as in ""stupid."" If you take a look at Italian language forums and debate websites it's clear that many Italians are clueless on grammar and don't even know how to use verbs properly. At age 15, Italian students rank below the OECD average literacy level and Eurostat reports that Italy has the lowest percentage of university graduates aged 30-34 in the European Union. The media reflect society. Evening news bulletins are full of speakers and commentators making grammatical errors and even mispronouncing words. How could Dante's land become ""ignorant"" and will the government's plans to institute yet another education reform succeed in turning some donkeys -- if not into nerds -- at least into smart pupils? The decline in language skills is a trend affecting most of the Western world, but the fact that this is happening in Italy, home to some of the world's oldest universities, is quite alarming. The Romans built an empire united by the Latin language, but Italians seem to have lost such heritage. Italians were once ""literate"" -- as in ""Latin-speakers and Latin-writers"" -- grammar-savvy, poetry lovers, rhetoric freaks and great philosophers. Now they've forgotten what a conjunctive verb is, mistake adjectives for nouns and write Machiavelli with a double ""c."" Oh -- and they don't know how to break words into syllables. True, one could say Italian is a tough language, one of the most complex in the world. But that's not a good excuse. The Italian people's declining knowledge of their language is turning into a national emergency. It's not just lazy students who are responsible. The percentage of lawyers who every year flunk the written examination to become a judge is scary. When I attended university, the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on Italian literature and history. Few of my buddies passed it at the first go, others had to take it thrice and many just gave up. So how did we fall so low? Fine, ICT, smartphones and SMS are partly to blame. Abbreviations, misspellings and the introduction of many English words into Italian have impoverished language skills. Yet on its own that explanation is too reductive. The loss of Latin teaching in schools is at the root of the problem. Learning Latin assists in learning Italian and other languages as well as opening the mind to all fields of knowledge. It's been no secret across generations of scholars that being familiar with the complexity of Latin phrase structure and idioms is positive for students. Up until 1970, Latin was taught in primary and middle schools: kids learned to translate works by Virgil without using a dictionary and to recite chunks of the ""Divine Comedy"" and poems by Carducci, Leopardi and Manzoni. But today the teaching of Latin is restricted to specific humanist and scientific high schools -- called gymnasiums or lyceums -- and at university level depending upon the faculty. The crisis has dealt a further blow to the love of classics. Enrollment at classical lyceums, where also ancient Greek is also taught, is low: Only 31,860 out of a total 530,911 high school students have enrolled this academic year. Desperate attempts by modern writers to revive classical culture by translating Boccaccio's ""Decameron"" and Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" into modern Italian haven't produced great results. So far just one academy in Rome -- Vivarium Novum -- has succeeded in bringing the ""dead language"" back from the grave. Pupils here exclusively speak in Latin and are kicked-out if they get caught saying a few words in Italian. But the academy is an isolated case, looked upon as a bit ""out of this world."" Families think learning Latin and Greek is pointless because it won't help their kids find a job, which is wrong. The trouble is that students have already lost their memory. Not in the literal sense, but symbolically. The ""ars mnemonica"" -- the art of exercising one's memory, that boring yet useful technique which implies rote learning of phrases, lyrics, novels and even entire epics -- belongs to the past. If you don't sharpen mental skills, how can there be good writing? The truth is that Italian education is badly in need of a restyle. A series of education reforms in the past few years has lowered the quality of teaching by reducing public resources and the hours of Latin and Italian language learning, which teaching unions say has had a negative impact on pupils' text comprehension skills. Latin teaching should be given more space but in a new way: Not through useless translations (what do kids care about Seneca's ""Treaty on Birds?"") but through open debates and analyses on ancient texts that are still worthwhile studying today. And teachers should also get a makeover. Their mindset is old. If there are ""bad"" students it's because there are also ""bad"" teachers. Pupils want to read more than just one contemporary novel per month. They want teachers who are passionate about their jobs rather than lazily coasting towards retirement. Language teaching depends on its appeal. It must be sexy. And right now it's not.","Italy, birthplace of the Latin and Italian, is becoming illiterate, writes Silvia Marchetti .

"Atlanta  (CNN)As U.S. Air Force fighter jets and bombers carry out airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Air Force officials are waging a campaign of their own on Capitol Hill. The target: Sequestration cuts expected to take effect in 2016 that, officials say, will threaten U.S. air superiority. Air Force Secretary Deborah James told lawmakers last month that ""enough is enough"" when it comes to downsizing the Air Force, defending President Obama's $534 billion Pentagon base budget request to the defense appropriations subcommittee. ""Given the state of the world ... the No. 1 thing we have to stop is this downsizing,"" James said. Despite the concerns of defense officials, lawmakers insisted that $10 billion will need to be cut from the Air Force's portion of the President's proposed budget, which, in total, exceeds spending caps by nearly $35 billion. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, called the President's base budget ""a fantasy"" but expressed a desire to find a bipartisan compromise to provide some relief from spending caps instituted in 2013 after budget disagreements between President Obama and Congress. Until a compromise is reached, Cole said the committee will have to make ""a lot of tough decisions"" related to cutting billions from the Air Force's spending request. But will cuts actually threaten the United States' standing as the most modern and capable air fleet on the planet? Despite writing the blueprint on how to build the world's greatest air force, Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force's chief of staff, says the United States will not be able to maintain the Air Force's strategic gains once next year's sequestration cuts take effect. He says other nations are now using the U.S. model to build their own air fleets, a trend that could degrade the strategic advantage U.S. air superiority provides to the military. However, some experts say that downsizing the Air Force and even cutting its budget won't necessarily threaten U.S. air dominance. Jerry Hendrix, the director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the Center for a New American Security and a former Navy captain, says the United States is still comfortably ahead of every other nation in terms of overall air capabilities. Despite the fact that the U.S. Air Force has a quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago, it is still larger than the air forces of the next seven countries combined, said Hendrix. It is also the only nation with an operational fifth-generation fighter jet. Air Force officials argue that the force is currently older and smaller than it has ever been and that further budget cuts would hinder its ability to modernize and maintain effective command structure. ""The option of not modernizing isn't really an option at all,"" Welsh said. ""Air forces that fall behind the technology curve and joint forces without the full breadth of air, space and cyber power ... will lose."" The irony lies in that the Air Force's emphasis on investing in a fleet solely made up of high-end aircraft may be one of the key factors drawing down the size of the force, says Hendrix. He agrees that more spending should be shifted toward air and maritime power due to their increasing roles in U.S. military strategy but says mistakes were made in terms of how the Air Force has balanced its commitment to maintaining the size of the fleet with its desire to modernize. ""Air Force leadership has failed to balance the idea that quantity has a quality of its own,"" he said, adding that the Air Force should still pursue high-end aircraft but should supplement the fleet with older, cheaper aircraft models, like the F-16, for low-end operations instead of immediately phasing them out when a new generation is introduced. In order for the Air Force to maintain air superiority, Hendrix says, officials and lawmakers need to start having a real conversation about the best way to mitigate downsizing that also promotes modernization. Then they need to work out a budget and find a way to work within it.","Secretary Deborah James said ""enough is enough"" when it comes to downsizing Air Force .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Suspected Boko Haram gunmen decapitated 23 people in a raid on Buratai village in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, residents and a politician said Saturday. Scores of attackers invaded the village at 11 p.m. Friday when residents were mostly asleep and set homes on fire, hacking residents who tried to flee. ""‎The gunmen slaughtered their 23 victims like rams and decapitated them. They injured several people,"" said Ibrahim Adamu, a local politician who fled. ""They burned a large part of the village and we are afraid some residents were burnt in the homes because most people had gone to bed when the gunmen struck,"" said Adamu, a ward councilor in the village. A paramedic ‎at a government hospital in the nearby town of Biu said 32 people from Buratai were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds and burns. ""The injured victims said a lot of people were beheaded by the attackers,"" the paramedic said. Buratai now has been attacked twice by Boko Haram in the past year. In September, the  Islamist insurgents launched an attack on the village that was repelled by soldiers deployed to guard the home of a Nigerian army general from the village. The soldiers killed 20 of the gunmen. It is not clear whether the attack was in reprisal over their loss in the previous attack or was linked to the Nigeria general elections ‎that commenced Saturday. Boko Haram vowed to disrupt the elections. The militant group ISIS earlier this month said that a pledge of allegiance from Boko Haram has been accepted.","Suspected militants raid village in Nigeria .

"(CNN)Warning: This article contains offensive language. Slut, ho, hussy, heifer, bitch -- long before I ever heard those words flow in a rap song, I heard them first in my own home, my own neighborhood. And too many times, they were directed toward me or one of my grade-school girlfriends. You see, for generations, black girls have been so conditioned to being called these over-sexualized names -- first by our slave masters, then our mothers, sisters, friends and eventually the world -- that today many times we don't even take offense. We deny our pain or hurt feelings. We even make excuses for the name-callers because it's difficult to decipher, especially for young girls, when the offender means it in a tough love, sisterly kind of way or a ""he didn't mean it in that kind of way,"" as Little League standout Mo'ne Davis said on ESPN's SportsCenter on Monday. She was explaining why she had forgiven Bloomsburg University baseball player Joey Casselberry recently. Davis emailed the university to ask for Casselberry to be reinstated. Here's what he had tweeted after hearing that Disney plans to produce a movie based on Davis' life titled: ""Throw Like Mo"": . ""WHAT A JOKE. That slut got rocked by Nevada."" Ugly, jealous, hateful words meant to intimidate and objectify a 13-year-old girl. But Davis was quick to respond with a class beyond her years: ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,"" she told ESPN. ""... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more,"" said Davis, the first girl in Little League World Series history to earn a win and pitch a shutout. Bloomsburg immediately kicked Casselberry off the team but now says it will review the matter. I hope the school sticks to its decision. It was the right call and the university's action spoke volumes about its integrity -- and how it values women and girls. Surely, Bloomsburg University believes that sports are meant to teach more than simply how to hit, catch and run. We talk about using sports to build character, leadership and respect for others. Casselberry seems to have missed those lessons, or maybe he just thinks they don't apply to women. His promising college baseball career doesn't have to end over this mistake. Let the school review the situation next season; see then if Casselberry has had time to truly understand his actions. Good for Davis, for rising above the hateful remark — and also above the outrage on social media, where millions rose to her defense — to offer such a gracious response.  But it should go without saying:  It's never OK or excusable to attack a successful 13-year-old girl with such a chauvinist remark. Neither little girls, no matter their ethnicity, nor grown women are open targets for sexist, ignorant public attacks. The incident provides a good opportunity, however, for we in the black community to consider how we value our daughters. And we must take note that our sons are watching closely as they try to navigate what it means to respect a young woman today. Men who grow up to disrespect women do not only learn those lessons by watching TV or playing video games. And though it may be convenient to blame pop culture, rap music is not responsible for teaching men to disrespect women. We parents own much of the blame. Overworked, frustrated mothers and fathers often cannot find the words or the courage to have a conversation about sex with their children who are not even teens yet. But that's when the questions start for most kids. Just about every day in my old neighborhood, a playmate would get called out of her name for violating an unspoken rule about how a 9-year-old girl should behave: ""Get your trifflin' ass in the house, you little hussy. Why are you dressed like a little slut?"" an angry mom would yell down the street. Every little girl I knew heard that rant, including myself. And as kids do, it wasn't long before we were all giggling and calling one another those very same names. I don't really know how other mothers talk to their young daughters, or at least I didn't back then, but in my black neighborhood, often the conversation between mothers and daughters was not pretty. You had two choices: develop a tough skin or believe the ugly words and let your innocence be destroyed by their cruelty, even if unintended. Too many of my friends were destroyed as they struggled with the confusing messages and lack of forthright explanation and support on sexuality. It led to young teenage pregnancies, abusive boyfriends and destructive behavior. Who knows what those beautiful girls, once so full of ambition and curiosity about the world, would have become if they'd been called: beautiful, strong and smart. Maybe they would have been just like Mo'.","Roxanne Jones: Ballplayer called Mo'ne Davis slut in a tweet. She graciously asked his college to reinstate him after he was kicked from team .

"Atlanta (CNN)A report on lab safety at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency's commitment to safety ""inconsistent and insufficient."" The report, which was completed in January but posted on the agency's website this week, also says ""laboratory safety training is inadequate."" The report was put together by an external group of 11 experts in biosafety, laboratory science and research. In the report, they say they are ""very concerned that the CDC is on the way to losing credibility."" The agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in July in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews. One incident occurred in June when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus, were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques. The head of that lab resigned after the incident. This followed a May incident in which avian influenza samples, thought to not be dangerous, were unintentionally mixed with the deadly H5N1 influenza virus and then shipped to a USDA lab. Then in December, with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety, employees in the Ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high-level lab to a lower-level lab. Internal investigations were done after each incident, and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs, following the Ebola incident. The four-page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to CDC labs, meetings with CDC staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at CDC. The report recommends all CDC labs go through an external review and accreditation process. They suggest the College of American Pathologists for clinical labs and the American Biological Safety Association for research labs.  To that point, the committee says in the report, ""The CDC must not see itself as special. The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC."" Other recommendations include: . -- Funding for lab safety programs and standardized training. -- Implementing risk assessments. -- Establishing a system of responsible science and accountability. -- Rewarding researchers who run safe labs. -- Hiring a director to oversee lab safety. In response to the recommendations, CDC Chief Operating Officer Sherri Berger said in a statement, ""It's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations, especially functions as critical as lab safety. We brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions, of which many are already underway.""","External advisory committee to CDC warns the agency is on its way to losing credibility .

"(CNN)It may not provide the answer to life, the universe and everything, but when the Large Hadron Collider at Geneva's CERN starts up again this month, particle physicists are planning to give this question their best shot. Having finally nailed down the elusive Higgs boson particle in 2013 -- the elementary particle that has unlocked some of the universe's longest-standing secrets -- physicists are now on the trail of dark matter. And with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) -- the 27km (17 mile) circumference particle accelerator that occupies a tunnel on the Franco-Swiss border -- now tricked out with new magnets, more powerful energy beams and a tighter vacuum, scientists are hoping to shine a light on some of the universe's more arcane phenomena. ""Higgs was the final piece of the jigsaw of what we call the Standard Model of particle physics,"" Dr Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the facility, told CNN. ""But we know that this model is not complete."" ""One of the big things we know is out there -- but we don't yet understand -- is dark matter. ""There's a lot of astronomical observations to support the fact that this stuff exists, so this is one thing that we might hope shows up."" Dark matter is currently a hypothesis. It is a type of matter that can't be seen but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation and even the very structure of the universe. Physicists believe this unseen material makes up about 85 percent of all the matter in the universe. Regular matter, which we are made of along with all the stars, planets and other tangible cosmic material, accounts for just around 4 percent of the mass-energy of the known universe. In other words, the vast majority of what constitutes reality still eludes us. Particle physicists will no doubt be on the edge of their seats when the new souped-up collider is put through its paces this month, although it can take months for the data to be processed. ""There are a number of theories that give you dark matter candidates -- one of the favourites is supersymmetry,"" Lamont said, adding that the team got no sign of it at all in the facility's first three-year run. ""What the physicists are hoping is that with the step up in energy we will be able to explore a bit more of parameter space and that something dramatically new will show up. ""If it does, it's Nobel prizes all around; it really will be a major breakthrough. If it's not, then it's back to the drawing board."" The increased energy of the new collider will be key to the new studies. The energy of collisions in the LHC in 2015 will be 13 TeV (teraelectron volt) compared with 8 TeV in 2012 during its last run. While the facility is a big industrial user of power -- about 180MW when it's running at full tilt -- it's not quite powerful enough to dim the lights or send the air-conditioning down in surrounding areas. ""We have a dial that tells us how much energy we're using - it would be equivalent to about 10% of the total power in the Geneva canton,"" Lamont said. But anyone expecting a ""Bride of Frankenstein"" scenario of flashing lights and crackling electrical discharges is going to be disappointed. According to Lamont, while the machine is tremendously powerful, it operates within a vacuum, making it relatively quiet. ""The beam itself does hum, we can hear it oscillating, but the collision energy between one proton and another -- while it's a huge amount of energy for a proton -- is like a house fly hitting another house fly at 5 miles per hour. ""The beam, however, does have a huge amount of energy and we have to be very careful with it."" He said the proton beam is launched at a tangent to the ring and when the energy of the beam needs to be absorbed, they use a graphite block to damp it. ""Now that really does give a good bang,"" Lamont said. ""We had microphones down there and this you could hear."" While there are billions of protons per package sent hurtling through the collider at a rate of 11,000 times per second, only 20 or 30 protons per package will actually collide to produce an effect that can be studied. Scientist must monitor equipment that registers hundreds of millions of collisions per second typically over 12-hour periods. ""The experiments need this because the interesting stuff like the Higgs is extremely rare. Only very rarely do these collisions produce something interesting and this is the big challenge for us -- to trigger the interesting stuff,"" he said. The Higgs may have gone a long way to answering the questions thrown up by the Standard Model, but Lamont says there will still be plenty of good physics to be examined by what is effectively the world's biggest machine. ""We're planning a major upgrade in 2023-25 -- there'll be new more powerful focusing magnets installed and some other upgrades and this will allow us to multiply by five the number of collisions we can deliver. ""That program is planned out until 2035 ... there are some interesting milestones coming up."" He remains sanguine, however, about the possibility that after weeks of collisions and months and sometimes years of study, scientists and researchers may have actually moved further away from answering the mysteries and paradoxes of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. ""Maybe the universe is a bit simpler than we think it is,"" Lamont said. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"Atlanta (CNN)Former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. ""Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,"" Earnest said. ""He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice."" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013.

"(CNN)The transgender community is celebrating several milestones thanks to one teen doing her part for transgender visibility. Activist and YouTube star Jazz Jennings will star in a reality show debuting on TLC this summer, the network announced last week. ""All That Jazz"" will feature the 14-year-old and her family dealing with typical teen drama through the lens of a transgender youth. It's the latest show to focus on transgender individuals, along with Discovery Life's ""New Girls on the Block"" and ABC Family's ""My Transparent Life,"" on the heels of Amazon's Golden Globe-winning comedy, ""Transparent."" Opinion: 'It's a girl!' Not so fast ... ""Jazz's story is universal, yet unique, and we're proud to partner with her family to share it with TLC's audience. Jazz may be known as an author and activist, but she's first and foremost a teenage girl with a big, brave heart, living a remarkable life,"" TLC General Manager Nancy Daniels said. Wait, there's more. Jazz is also the latest face of Clean & Clear's ""See The Real Me"" digital campaign. Jazz appears in a video for the skincare company sharing the trials of growing up transgender. ""I've always known exactly who I am. I was a girl trapped in a boy's body,"" Jazz said in the video, which encourages teens to be ""your true self."" The Internet welcomed the news, applauding Clean & Clear and TLC for giving Jazz a platform. ""All this support is so overwhelming! I love you all so much,"" she said in a tweet in response to the outpouring of support. Then, Jazz lent her image to the NOH8 campaign, a marriage equality movement started in response to California's Proposition 8 against same-sex marriage. Why all the fuss? Recognition of transgender people in the media shows mainstream America ""we're real people,"" said Christine Connelly, a member of the board of directors of the Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth who came out as transgender woman five years ago. What makes Jazz so ""special,"" in the words of transgender actor Laverne Cox? Her trajectory is unique, starting with her early debut in the public eye at a time when stories of transgender people -- adults or children -- were scarce. Experience how one family reacted when their daughter said she's a boy. CNN Films presents ""Raising Ryland,"" a short film available exclusively on CNN Digital on Wednesday, March 18. ""She was the first young person who picked up the national spotlight, went on TV and was able to articulate her perspective and point of view with such innocence,"" Connelly said. She even co-wrote a children's book in 2014 based on her experience, ""I am Jazz,"" about a transgender girl. Her parents also demonstrated their unwavering support for her early on, something transgender children can't always count on, Connelly said. Jazz and her family first appeared in the public eye in a 2007 television interview with ABC News' Barbara Walters. She was 6 years old and had just started appearing in public as a female, in what the report called ""one of the youngest known cases of an early transition from male to female."" The segment with Walters said Jazz was diagnosed with ""gender identity disorder,"" a term long considered stigmatizing by mental health specialists. It was eliminated from the American Psychiatric Association manual in 2012 and replaced with ""gender dysphoria,"" a condition in which people feel strongly that they are not the gender they physically appear to be. Jazz and her parents said she began gravitating to ""girl things"" at an early age and insisting she had the wrong genitalia. At home, she wore dresses but in public she wore pants to maintain a ""gender neutral appearance."" That all changed at her fifth birthday party, when she wore a one-piece bathing suit and told her friends she was a girl, her parents told ABC. The interview catapulted Jazz and her family into the spotlight. Jazz has appeared on various television networks and news outlets, including an ABC update with Barbara Walters at age 11, a segment with Katie Couric, a report on 60 Minutes, and an Oprah Winfrey Network documentary, ""I am Jazz: A Family in Transition."" The exposure has shaped Jazz into a transgender advocate and spokesperson who uses social media to connect with fans and followers. She has more than 20,000 Instagram followers and 33,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel, where she posts her speeches, DIY craft tutorials and musings about being a transgender youth. Occasionally, she responds to questions in video Q&As, fielding tough questions about her hormone treatment and bullying with grace and ease. She began using testosterone blockers at age 11 to stop her from growing body hair, ""or else I would have a hairy beard right now, which I don't so I'm thankful for that,"" she told fans in her most recent Q&A video. Her outreach has earned her recognition from some of the country's top LGBT advocacy groups. In 2012 Jazz became the youngest person ever to be recognized in the Advocate's annual list of ""Top Forty Under 40."" She was honored at the 2013 GLAAD Awards and named a Human Rights Campaign youth ambassador in 2014. She also made TIME Magazine's ""Top 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014"" and Huffington Post's ""14 Most Fearless Teens of 2014"" list. It may seem like a charmed life but Jazz says she still faces bullying and mistreatment from people who don't understand her. The comments on her social media accounts are littered with profane attacks on her and her family. The question came up in her Q&A: ""How do you feel when people judge you?"" Clearly, it's a topic she's given some thought to. ""I don't care what people think. The only opinion that really affects me is my own opinion of myself because I determine the way I am, not anyone else,"" she said. ""If someone says something hurtful to you or makes you feel down on yourself then you just gotta stay positive and keep moving forward because they might not know much about you or they may not understand the situation.""","Transgender teen Jazz Jennings is having a moment .

"London (CNN)It's a phenomenon that's been linked to a dragon, a black squirrel and Tiangiou, the magical dog of heaven. Mythologies from across the globe have blamed them all for eating the sun. In reality, solar eclipses, like the one that can be seen across parts of the Northern Hemisphere today, are down to an amazing coincidence. The moon and sun are at just the right distance away from the Earth that they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky even though the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon. On occasion, the sun, moon and Earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the Earth, blocking the light. But that's not the whole story. A total eclipse can only be seen in the narrow corridor known as the ""path of totality"" --- or the ""inner umbral shadow."" The area where the sun's rays are only partially obscured is called the ""penumbra."" Today the moon's shadow falls across parts of North Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Millions will be in the penumbra part of the shadow and able to see a partial eclipse but if you want to catch the full majesty of the 2015 totality it will require a trip to the North Pole, Svalbard or the Faroe Islands between the UK and Norway. You can find out whether you will be able to see the eclipse by watching our animation. Solar eclipses are relatively common -- partial eclipses are visible somewhere on Earth most years -- but not necessarily in the same region. You might wait hundreds of years between two total eclipses at the same place. And not all eclipses are the same. The moon follows an elliptical orbit around the Earth which means it is sometimes closer to us -- at ""perigee"" -- and sometimes further away -- at ""apogee."" At apogee, the moon doesn't appear quite big enough to completely obscure the sun during a solar eclipse and an observer sees a ring of brilliant light around the moon. This is called an annular eclipse. At perigee (as now) the sun will be completely blocked by the moon during totality. This gives scientists a chance to study the sun's atmosphere and help solve a cosmic conundrum. Astronomer Robert Massey of the UK's Royal Astronomical Society explained that the sun's atmosphere or corona is a massive 2 million degrees Celsius but the sun's surface only around 5,500 Celsius. He said this temperature difference has long mystified scientists. ""The eclipse at totality allows us to see the inner most regions of the sun's atmosphere even if it's only for a few minutes -- it's very hard to do otherwise,"" he said. Perhaps the brief window will give solar experts a chance to collect more data. But you don't have to be an astronomer to appreciate the incredible spectacle of an eclipse. CNN would like to see your pictures and videos and hear of your experiences by using CNN's eclipse iReport assignment-- but please take care. NEVER look directly at the sun -- it is dangerous and can cause permanent damage to your eyes. Regular sunglasses are NOT safe either. Special filters are needed. Ahead of last year's eclipse in the United States, NASA advised CNN readers: ""Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the moon can still cause pain and eye damage. Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter."" NASA suggested some old tricks for viewing indirectly, like punching a hole in cardboard and projecting the light seeping through it onto a surface away from the sun. You can find more safety advice on NASA's eclipse website. A total solar eclipse is a phenomenon that won't last forever. The moon is moving away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) every year. There will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. But don't worry, you still have to time to catch one -- NASA calculates this will take about 563 million years.","Solar eclipses happen when the sun, moon and Earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the Earth .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)Grieving women carried her coffin high on their shoulders in scenes many said they had never witnessed before in the Afghan capital. Men are traditionally pallbearers in Kabul, where days earlier a mob of male attackers beat and kicked 27-year-old Farkhunda before tossing her off a bridge, setting her body on fire and throwing it in the river. Like many Afghans, Farkhunda used only one name. Early reports suggested that Farkhunda was mentally ill, but her tearful father, Nadir, told CNN affiliate TOLOnews she was a religious teacher who taught the Quran to children. He said there was no way his daughter would burn pages of the holy book, which has been cited as the motive for the horrific attack. Twenty-six people have been arrested in connection with the brutal killing, Afghanistan's Interior Minister Noorul Haq Ulumi said Monday in a statement before parliament. Farkhunda's parents said the killing was instigated by a local mullah of the Shah-e-Do Shamshera Mosque in the city's center, who had been angered by Farkhunda's accusations that he was distributing false tawiz. Tawiz are pieces of paper containing verses of the Quran which are sometimes worn as pendants to ward off evil and bring the wearer good luck. TOLOnews reported that ""in order to save his job and life,"" the mullah reportedly began shouting accusations that Farkhunda had burned the Quran. Witnesses said a crowd gathered and hauled Farkhunda into the street. ""We were asking the people to stop beating her and let us ask what religion she belongs to,"" one witness told TOLOnews. ""But the people didn't listen to us and kept beating her."" Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs said it had found no evidence Farkhunda burned the Quran. Meanwhile, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as ""heinous"" and ordered a commission to investigate it fully. Farkhunda's father said those guilty of killing his daughter should face justice: ""I don't want blood of my daughter go in vain."" Thirteen police officials have been suspended in connection with the attack, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. He earlier confirmed 11 people had been arrested. ""We're very interested particularly to see what happens in terms of the investigation of the police behavior,"" said Patricia Grossman, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""That was, for us, one of the most troubling aspects of this case -- that the police did not intervene adequately and properly to save her when there was an opportunity to do so."" On Sunday, as they watched Farkhunda's casket being carried to her grave, the crowd shouted ""Kabul police officials should be fired,"" according to Afghan human rights activist Ramin Anwari. Government officials, ministers, journalists and civil society members were among the thousands of people who attended her funeral, Anwari said. Many of them are expected to attend a large rally planned for Tuesday outside Afghanistan's Supreme Court in Kabul to call for justice for Farkhunda, he said. A Facebook page has been created in support of the cause. On Friday, the United Nations issued a statement condemning the killing ""in the strongest terms."" ""We are encouraged by initial reports of the arrest of several suspects, but call on the authorities to investigate this incident fully and bring to justice all persons who actively participated in the killing, or aided and abetted it,"" said Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative  in Afghanistan for UN Women. She said the rise in cases of violence against women and girls in Afghanistan had become a ""major concern"" and must not be tolerated. Grossman of Human Rights Watch said the attack was unusual because it took place in public and in the capital. However, she added,""Violence against women is rampant in Afghanistan. That's the kind of thing we'd like to see people address beyond this particular case."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Jessica King contributed to this report.","Family says Farkhunda, 27, made accusations against a local mullah .

"(CNN)Iran's judicial system believes in the ancient concept of ""an eye for an eye"" -- literally. On Tuesday, a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye, according to Amnesty International and Tasnim News, a semi-official news website. The punishment is believed to be Iran's first case of Qasas, meaning retribution in kind, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International denounced the sentence. ""This punishment exposes the utter brutality of Iran's justice system and underlines the Iranian authorities' shocking disregard for basic humanity,""  said Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International's Iran researcher. ""Meting out cruel and inhuman retribution punishments is not justice. Blinding, like stoning, amputation and flogging, is a form of corporal punishment prohibited by international law. Such punishments should not be carried out under any circumstances."" The acid attacker had been hired by the victim's wife to throw acid in his face, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International said the attack occurred in 2009 in the city of Qom. The defendant was blinded in his left eye at Rajai Shahr Prison, but the blinding of his right eye was postponed, Amnesty International said. The man was ordered to pay ""blood money"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Amnesty International said punishment has been delayed for another Iranian man in a ""retribution in kind"" case. That man had been sentenced to be blinded and made deaf, Amnesty International said. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran and Elwyn Lopez in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Iran's judicial system blinded a man in his left eye on Tuesday, Amnesty International reported .

"(CNN)Before this week, David Boren didn't need to add to his resume.  It was impressive enough already. The 73-year-old University of Oklahoma president was also a former governor, former U.S. senator and Rhodes scholar. Boren has become the face of the school's stand against racism after a highly visible and passionate condemnation of a video that appears to show Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members chanting a racial epitaph. It started with a bullhorn at a campus rally. ""I have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way. My message to them is: You're disgraceful. You have violated every principle that this university stands for."" It continued with a press conference, saying fraternity members had until midnight Tuesday to get out of their house. ""The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,"" Boren said, adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members. And it extended to network television. ""Sooners are not racists.  They're not bigots,"" Boren told CNN in one of his many public reprimands.  ""They are people who respect each other and care about each other."" Boren spent nearly 30 years in elected office before becoming the 13th president of the University of Oklahoma in 1994. He was a U.S. senator from 1979 to 1994, where he was the longest serving chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Before that, he served four years as Oklahoma's governor. He campaigned as a reformer, with a broom as his symbol, and when elected, he became the youngest governor in the state. He was 33 at the time. Boren is the first person in Oklahoma history to have served all three positions, according to his university biography. Boren graduated from Yale University in 1963, in the top one percent of his class. He was selected as a Rhodes scholar and earned a master's degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University, England, in 1965. Boren received his law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1968. Both his father, Lyle, and his son, Dan, served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Zero tolerance is the only answer to racism, Boren said.  Not just for the school, but the nation. ""It's not just the Greek system, it's not just colleges and universities.  It's Ferguson, Missouri.  All sorts of elements of our society are involved,"" he said. For now, Boren said the school is looking into punishing the individuals involved, especially any of those who led the chants. ""We're trying to determine if we have enough evidence and if we can meet the federal standards to prevail in court, and, if so, we'll take action,"" Boren said. ""This is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it so I think you have to send a very strong signal."" In the meantime, Boren said he will work with students who are calling for a change, including Unheard, a campus organization that formed in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Unheard, along with the university newspaper, anonymously received the video showing the fraternity chant and made it public . Boren started meeting with the group in January, well ahead of the SAE video.  Both sides described the sessions as ""constructive,"" the Washington Post reported Monday. ""They are very constructive.  They have very good ideas and we're going to make it better.  We're determined to make it better,"" Boren told CNN.","Boren is the first person in Oklahoma history to serve as governor, senator and OU president .
He's the face of the university's stand against racism ."
"(CNN)Saudi Arabia is leading a military campaign against Shiite rebels in Yemen, bringing the wider region directly into a complex conflict that has festered for months. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. ""Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners,"" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, referring to the other nations in the region supporting the campaign. Here are answers to key questions about the escalating conflict in Yemen. Analysts say it can be summed up in one word: Iran. The Saudis ""perceive this as a threat from the Iranians,"" said CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona. ""They look at the Houthis as nothing more than a proxy Iranian force, just like we can look at Hezbollah as a proxy Iranian force in southern Lebanon."" Analysts say that Shiite-majority Iran and Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia are locked in a strategic contest for influence across the Middle East. Now, the epic chess match has spread into Yemen, Saudi Arabia's southern neighbor. ""What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border, because they already feel they've got enough problems on their northern border,"" said Francona, a retired U.S. Air Force intelligence officer. Iran, northeast of Saudi Arabia, is considered to exercise powerful influence within the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in war-torn Syria and within the Shiite-led Iraqi government. The Saudis and other Gulf nations appeared to make an implicit reference to Iran in a statement about the start of the military campaign, describing the Houthi militias as ""backed by regional powers"" that are aiming for ""hegemony"" in Yemen. The Iranian government, for its part, condemned the offensive, calling for an immediate halt to Saudi-led airstrikes, state media reported. The chaos in Yemen appeared to be careering toward a full-blown civil war. The Houthis, whose power base is in northern Yemen, started protests against the central government in the capital, Sanaa, last summer. But they stepped up their campaign in September, seizing multiple government buildings. Attempts to strike political deals between the two sides had no effect, and the Houthis pushed into other areas of the country. The crisis intensified in January, when the Houthis displayed their clout by storming the presidential palace and putting President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi under house arrest. Hadi escaped to the southern city of Aden in February and declared that he remained the legitimate president. Since then, Hadi's supporters have repeatedly clashed with the Houthis and their allies, prompting the United Nations to warn of an impending civil war. The Houthis also have support from forces loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in 2012 after months of Arab Spring-inspired protests. The deepening chaos has led many governments to pull embassy staff out of Sanaa. The United States recently withdrew its remaining special forces in Yemen, dealing a blow to counterterrorism efforts in the country. Rebel forces captured parts of Aden and a nearby airbase Wednesday. Early Thursday, the Saudi-led strikes began. The airstrikes appear to be only the start of the campaign. Saudi Arabia has also pledged 150,000 soldiers to the coalition that's intervening in Yemen, the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV network reported Thursday, raising the possibility of a ground offensive. ""The airstrikes will be the kickoff of the campaign,"" Francona said ""They'll want to knock down the air defenses and create a corridor with which they can move their troops in there."" It wasn't immediately clear if other nations in the coalition were offering any ground troops. A ground offensive isn't a decision that Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud would take lightly. ""Saudi Arabia, all these years, has avoided sending troops into Yemen. It's a quagmire for the Saudis,"" CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer said in January. Beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies say they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back Yemen's ""security and stability through establishing a political process,"" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, said American forces are not involved in the airstrikes. But Francona said he thought the United States most likely assisted with information needed to pick out targets. ""The Saudis don't have the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability to determine all of these targets,"" he said. ""They've had to have had some help, and I think it probably came from us."" Arab and senior Obama administration officials tell CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will probably ask for American air support, satellite imagery and other intelligence. ""We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,"" a senior administration official said. A Saudi adviser told CNN that 10 countries are involved in the coalition: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan and Sudan. But it was unclear how many of those countries other than Saudi Arabia were taking an active military role. The Saudi adviser told CNN that the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar had contributed fighter planes to the operations. It brings another disturbing angle to the conflict. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, considered by U.S. officials to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network. The Sunni Muslim extremist group, also known as AQAP, has taken advantage of Yemen's weak government to plan and launch terrorist attacks against the West. Operating from its heartland in central Yemen, it considers both the Shiite Houthis and the pro-U.S. Yemeni government as its foes. Houthi forces have clashed with AQAP and its allies in central Yemen. And bomb attacks have repeatedly hit Shiite gatherings in the capital. There are also concerns about ISIS' growing influence in Yemen. The Sunni militant group that controls large areas of Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility for attacks on Shiite mosques in Sanaa that killed more than 130 people this month. AQAP and ISIS looked set to be ""the big winners"" from the deepening chaos in Yemen, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said Wednesday before news of the Saudi airstrikes emerged. But the big question now is whether the Saudi-led coalition will take any action against the Sunni terrorist groups. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Saudi Arabia sees Houthi rebels in Yemen as a proxy for Iran, analysts say .
The Saudis act as Yemen teeters on the brink of civil war ."
"(CNN)As the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran, let us not forget: This is the second time in two years that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East. In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally naïve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for ""death to America,"" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a naïve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road. Let's not make that mistake twice.","Cathy McMorris Rodgers: Obama administration let Syria get away with continued chemical weapons capability .

"London (CNN)As the petition to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson as the presenter of Top Gear grows to include almost 700,000 signatures, it seems the controversial star has an influential ally -- UK Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I don't know exactly what happened,"" the PM told the BBC. ""He's a constituent of mine, a friend of mine. He's a huge talent. ""Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who'd be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out, because it's a great programme and he's a great talent. ""Every organ has to be free to manage its talent. I don't want to interfere in the running of the BBC. I hope it can be sorted out. ""The prime minister has many responsibilities, sadly, securing the future of Top Gear isn't one of them."" Cameron and Clarkson are part of a group dubbed as ""The Chipping Norton Set"" -- wealthy media, politics and showbiz individuals who live in the affluent part of central England known as the Cotswolds. Jeremy Clarkson: Hated by liberals, loved by the elite . Clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer, the BBC reported on Wednesday. The BBC said Clarkson, one of the corporation's highest earners, had ""a fracas with a BBC producer"" in a statement released on Tuesday. ""Jeremy Clarkson has been suspended pending an investigation,"" they said. ""No one else has been suspended. Top Gear will not be broadcast this Sunday."" The BBC reported that the next two episodes, and possibly the third and final show of the series, will not be aired. The BBC director-general Tony Hall said that the incident is being investigated. Using the hashtag #BringBackClarkson, which is trending worldwide, some Twitter users lamented that the show would not be the same without him. Clarkson himself also took to Twitter, posting an apology (of sorts) to Labour leader Ed Miliband -- for knocking him down the news agenda. He also retweeted a ""suffering"" fan. ""Save Clarkson?"" his co-host James May tweeted. ""Save empty cardboard boxes and off-cuts of string. They're far more useful."" But a ""Sack Jeremy Clarkson"" petition is also doing the rounds, gathering 16,500 signatures so far. Some will be glad to see the back of him. Former CNN host Piers Morgan, who has had a series of run-ins with the presenter, also waded in with a cheeky jibe. This is not the first time that Clarkson has been at the center of controversy. In May last year, the television presenter asked forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show. Clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children's nursery rhyme, but that version of the take was never aired. Last year, the BBC show hit the headlines when Argentina complained about a ""Top Gear"" special filmed in the country in which the number plate H982 FKL was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Forced to stop filming and leave the country, Clarkson said on the BBC Newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental. Top Gear was named as the world's most widely watched factual program in the Guinness World Record 2013 Edition book, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show is sold to 214 territories worldwide. In a previous article on their website, the BBC said ""Jeremy Clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion."" In their statement, the corporation declined to comment any further.","Presenter was involved in an encounter with a BBC producer .

"(CNN)The FBI is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir Robert Durst could be connected to any other unsolved crimes. Durst, the focus of HBO's true crime documentary series ""The Jinx,"" was charged with first-degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante, Susan Berman. Now the FBI is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. ""They seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him,"" DeGuerin said. ""They must not have much of a case to begin with."" Durst, who authorities believe has a net worth of $100 million, has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states, according to court documents and public records. In ""The Jinx,"" Durst describes the time he spent living in Vermont with his first wife, Kathleen, running a health food store in the 1970s. In 1982, Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing. Durst says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in Katonah, New York, and she headed to their Manhattan apartment. Her family members say they believe she's dead and that Durst is the one to blame. The case has never been solved. He's also lived in Galveston, Texas, where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001. He was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he'd acted in self-defense. Last week, police searched condos Durst owns in Houston as part of the investigation into Berman's death. She was shot dead in December 2000 in her Beverly Hills, California, home. Investigators know Durst was in California the week Berman died. It's a detail Durst shrugs off in the HBO documentary,  in which he denied he had anything to do with Berman's death and said, ""California's a big state."" Authorities investigating a decades-old cold case in Vermont said Monday that there's a connection between Durst and the case of Lynne Schulze, a college student who disappeared from Middlebury College in 1971. ""We are aware of the connection between the disappearance of Lynne Schulze and Robert Durst,"" Middlebury Police Capt. Tom Hanley said. ""We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead."" Hanley elaborated Tuesday on the nature of the connection, saying Durst owned a health food store where Schulze shopped the day she disappeared. But there is no evidence the two had met, Hanley said. DeGuerin's attorney brushed off the accusation Monday. ""You know, he may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared,"" he said. ""He's an easy target."" The name of the health food store, ""All Good Things,"" was also the title of a 2010 film starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the Durst case. After seeing the film, Durst reached out to director Andrew Jarecki and said he wanted to be interviewed. The interviews with Durst became the basis for ""The Jinx."" Durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of Berman's death to Trinidad, California, a small coastal city in northern California. ""It was very rural, very pretty,"" he says. And it was a place, Durst says, where he lived ""off and on."" In Eureka, about 20 miles south, Durst has been part of another investigation. Authorities there say they haven't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who went missing in November 1997 when she was 16 years old. The police chief said investigators were interested in learning what Durst has to say about that case now that he's behind bars. ""We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst,"" Police Chief Andy Mills said. ""If information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation, then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that."" According to local news reports at the time of Mitchell's disappearance, she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into. A witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel, which resulted in a sketch of a gray-haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist Matt Birkbeck says looks remarkably like Durst. ""He wears these wide-rim glasses. He was wearing those glasses back in the day and it's also in the composite,"" said Birkbeck, whose book, ""A Deadly Secret,"" chronicles Durst's life and run-ins with the law. ""Durst apparently knew Karen Mitchell. Karen had volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, which Durst had frequented, which he had a habit of doing in different cities,"" Birkbeck said. He'd also gone to a shoe store that Mitchell's aunt ran at a mall in Eureka, Birkbeck said. The former lead investigator on the case,  Dave Parris, retired several years ago and could not be reached for comment. In 2003, he told The Journal News that there were similarities between Durst and the composite sketch. ""He's a lead we're following,"" Parris told the newspaper, ""and with all the information we've learned about him, I'm not fully comfortable that I can eliminate him from our investigation at this point."" Investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them, Birkbeck said. ""In 2002, when my book was first published, we reported that police found six addresses in the San Francisco Bay area alone. Some of them were properties, some of them were post offices, some of them were warehouse facilities. There were other address in Northern California, Southern California, as well as other parts of the country,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett: Outfront."" But the investigation is nothing new, he said. ""They've been looking at this for several years now,"" he said. ""I guess with recent events, they've really expanded their scope."" CNN's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","Police say Robert Durst owned a store in Vermont at time college student disappeared .

"(CNN)Federal and local authorities are investigating a deadly shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol Agent in Washington State. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agent fired when a suspected ""illegal border crosser"" assaulted him during a patrol along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday. The reported shooting happened near the Huntington Border Crossing which connects the cities of Sumas, Washington, and Abbotsford, British Columbia. It is one of several area border crossings between the U.S. and Canada and is located east of Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The Bellingham Herald newspaper, citing police radio dispatches, said the man was struck in the head. ""The agent had been hit by pepper spray but wasn't seriously injured, according to police radio traffic,"" the newspaper said. The shooting apparently happened on an east-west road less than 1,000 feet from the border. Video from CNN partner CTV Network showed a covered body lying on the roadway, surrounded by police and investigation vehicles. The Border Patrol agent and the shooting victim have not been identified. The FBI and Whatcom County Sheriff's Office are assisting in the investigation.

"(CNN)Confucius said: ""Study the past if you would define the future."" In Iraq, the past is glorious and long. This is where the world's first cities were built and where writing and organized government were first developed more than 5,000 years ago. This is the land that gave the world its first great literary work -- the Epic of Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk -- over 1,000 years before Homer, and over 2,000 years before Christ. ISIS, like so many iconoclastic extremist groups through history, seeks to destroy the record of the past. In the past week, video has circulated showing neatly dressed figures wielding rather new-looking sledgehammers and destroying archaeological objects in the Mosul Museum. The spectacle would be ridiculous and pathetic if it were not so tragic. Although there are suggestions that some objects destroyed are only copies, many are said to be unique and irreplaceable objects that had survived thousands of years -- until now. ISIS has been busy trying to damage the famed Nergal Gate entry to the ancient city of Nineveh -- a city with a history reaching back thousands of years -- and most recently it is reportedly bulldozing the site of Nimrud, capital of the 9th-century B.C. Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II, and source of the famed Nimrud ivories. These ivories were first cleaned by none other than Agatha Christie while accompanying her archaeologist husband, Max Mallowan, during his excavation. All attacks on archaeological sites and artifacts are brutal assaults on our collective human memory. They deprive us of the evidence of human endeavors and achievements. The destruction eloquently speaks of the human folly and senseless violence that drives ISIS. The terror group is destroying the evidence of the great history of Iraq; it has to, as this history attests to a rich alternative to its barbaric nihilism. Worse, these acts of destruction supposedly in the name of religion are dishonest and hypocritical: the same ISIS also is busy looting archaeological sites to support its thriving illegal trade in antiquities, causing further incalculable harm. The smashed artifacts of the Mosul Museum and the destruction at Nineveh and Nimrud speak to a wider ignorance of archaeology and the meaning of the artifacts that archaeologists recover, study and preserve. These objects are the material record of humanity. They are not just for scholars, they are for everyone. They are the text of the past that helps define our future. Archaeologists clearly need to do more to expand a global understanding of, and appreciation for, the heritage of the past. But it is not just a question for teachers, professors and museum curators; there needs to be much greater awareness and protection of the past across society, in Iraq, in the United States and around the world, from the government to the public. We need more archaeology education globally; in Iraq and in other ISIS-affected countries, but also among people everywhere in order to help communities -- from children on up -- understand the fragility of the archaeological record and its critical importance to understanding the human story. Ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq, is at the heart of the human story: home of the first cities, states and empires. The law Code of Hammurabi, king of Babylon over 3,700 years ago, is the first great legal text of the world; it begins a heritage leading to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights. The heritage of Iraq is our heritage, too. What can we do in response to this assault on our heritage? Providing educational opportunities and empowering communities to learn more about their cultures and histories, and those of others, is one of the best ways to eradicate destructive hatred and violence.","Sturt Manning: Video shows ISIS destroying apparent antiquities; they reflect rich history that is alternative to group's barbaric nihilism .

"(CNN)Patrick Sondenheimer loved his work as a pilot. But the 34-year-old captain of Germanwings Flight 9525 was also a loving father, his grandmother said. ""I am devastated,"" said his grandmother, who asked for privacy for the family. ""His death came so sudden and it leaves my whole family in shock."" Sondenheimer is one of 150 people who died last week when the plane crashed in the French Alps on its way from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany. Authorities have accused the plane's co-pilot of deliberately downing the jet, but are still investigating what caused the crash and trying to pinpoint what his motive may have been. Investigators haven't officially released the captain's name, and in many German media reports he's described simply as ""Patrick S."" But several relatives confirmed his identity to CNN. He had logged more than 6,000 hours of flight time, had been with Germanwings since May 2014 and had worked with Lufthansa and Condor before that, the Germanwings press office said. The married father of a 3-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter switched to flying for the budget airline so he could be closer to his family, the Independent reported, citing German media. In a leaked transcript that purportedly documents the flight's final moments, Sondenheimer -- locked out of the cockpit after a bathroom break -- pleads with the co-pilot to let him back in as the plane plunges down toward the French Alps. ""Open the damn door!"" he says at one point in a recording from one of the plane's so-called black boxes, according to a report published by German tabloid newspaper Bild. The recording, according to Bild, also includes the sounds of loud metallic bangs that sound like someone trying to knock down the cockpit door. ""He deserves the German Medal of Honor for his heroic attempt to break into the cockpit,"" his grandmother told CNN. As details emerge about Sondenheimer and Flight 9525's final moments, a chorus of social media users has also hailed him as a hero. Over the weekend, Sondenheimer's father and other family members visited a memorial for the victims in the French Alps. Francois Balique, mayor of Le Vernet, met with them there. He described the captain's father as a broken man, with many questions about why the crash had happened. Investigators haven't said much about the captain, but they've emphasized that it seems he did everything he could to try to get back into the cockpit after he was locked out. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said last week that ""violent blows as if to break down the door"" are audible in the cockpit voice recording. ""He must have realized what was going on,"" Robin said. ""And if he'd been able to open the door ... the captain would have done it.""

"(CNN)As more details about the infamous ISIS executioner ""Jihadi John"" become known, certain basic questions continue to be raised. Is Islam as a faith to be blamed for Mohammed Emwazi's voyage to ISIS, otherwise known as the Islamic State? Or is the ""War On Terror"" responsible, and is this merely ""chickens coming home to roost?"" The temptation is to come to simplistic answers. Confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in ISIS propaganda videos, many take what their propagandists say very seriously: That they are, indeed, doing what their faith tells them to do. On the other hand, few believed ISIS when it was claimed they would negotiate with the Japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in Syria, who was later killed. Taking ISIS at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things. There have been other neo-religious movements in both Muslim and Christian history. The ""Assassins,"" for example, which began in the 11th century, was a radical, heterodox movement of Muslims, which eventually died out -- in its own time, similar to ISIS today, it was decried and depicted as deviant by Muslim religious authorities as well as most Muslims. Among Christendom, many of the Nazi leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called ""Positive Christianity."" It obviously never attracted much of a following, and historians claim, ""Only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal Protestantism would recognize such a mish-mash as true Christianity."" Why, then, are we not prepared to expunge Islam from the mix when interrogating ISIS ideology? While most churches, Protestant and Catholic, rejected the ""Positive Christianity"" of Nazi Germany, there is no corresponding action from the world of Islam. The problem is, that's not entirely possible. Unlike Christendom, Islam does not admit a hierarchical, ecclesiastical authority -- so, no ""Muslim Church"" or ""Islamic Pope"" exists. Having said that, nevertheless, there are systems of religious authority in Islam. They are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed, the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval Muslim seminary. Since the dawn of ISIS, numerous Muslim religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by ISIS, on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves. That is, except for ISIS itself, and for some odd reason, some in the West who insist on taking ISIS at its word. Religious authorities at large, and Muslims in general, may recognize ISIS members as Muslims, albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals. Just as Europeans en masse rejected the claims of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass killer, who claimed ""Christianity"" as a motivator, without denying he considered himself to be a Christian. In both cases, it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified, and on what basis, particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies. That doesn't, nevertheless, entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously, and others may too. That question of ""vulnerability"" has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks. There were some in the UK who argued that Jihadi John was subjected to a type of harassment by the British security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process. In one interview, the lobby group, Cage Prisoners, insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in Syria: ""The man who cut off their heads, and if you take that back a step, the people who potentially helped in his radicalization; in this case, the security services."" Specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication, with experts from the likes of Exeter University and Kings College London describing it as ""absurd,"" and ""bizarre."" Certainly, there are questions to be raised with regards to the British security services -- including how Jihadi John, who was known to them, was allowed to leave the country, as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned. There shouldn't be any sensitivity about this -- the British security services do the job that they do precisely so Britons live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the British security services somehow radicalized Jihadi John is peculiar. There are many high-profile members of ISIS in Syria and Iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example, Lotfi Arrifin, a youth leader in a Malaysian political party. There are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide, at the hands of authoritarian governments in the Arab world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment? It very well could -- but that's not a foregone conclusion. Otherwise, given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history, we should have seen far more members of ISIS. There will be those who contend radical Islamist theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services, or foreign policy. The reality is, however, there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of ISIS or any other radical Islamist group. For different individuals, different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment. More often than not, a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of ""meaning"" in this world -- and repugnant though ISIS ideology may be, it does provide a sense of certainty. What makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths? It may be many things that condition them before they accept radical Islamism as their ""savior."" In all cases, nevertheless, there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind. We must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through, to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context, only one person has responsibility for their actions. Each one of them, themselves.","H.A. Hellyer: There is no template for explaining an individual's journey to a group like ISIS .
Often a recruit will find themselves looking for ""meaning"" and ISIS provides certainty, says Hellyer .
He adds: Regardless of context, each individual must take responsibility for their own actions ."
"(CNN)Rand Paul's goal to run for two offices in 2016 cleared a hurdle Saturday after the Kentucky GOP decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary. The plan allows the first-term U.S. senator, who's running for re-election and making a likely bid for president, to get around a Kentucky law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice. Rand Paul searches for green light on caucus proposal . After Paul met with the party's 54-member executive committee in Bowling Green for a two-hour session, the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held. The final vote would come in August when a larger gathering of the Kentucky GOP is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force. ""We thank the members of RPK for their unanimous support and look forward to continuing this process,"" said Paul's top adviser, Doug Stafford, in a statement. Kentucky law allows the state party to determine the details of its presidential preference vote, but not the primary for other elected offices in the state. In other words, Paul's name for his Senate re-election bid would still remain on the May 2016 primary ballot, but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to March. The senator appeared at the meeting to address some concerns about a caucus, namely the increased cost, as well as the lower voter turnout typically associated with caucuses. He has pledged to raise money through his donor network to help offset the costs, and proponents of the caucus argue that the significant media attention expected and Kentucky's earlier placement in the nominating calendar would spur just as much turnout. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, issued a scathing statement Saturday, saying a Republican caucus next year ""could create potential chaos in our electoral process"" and promised to ""monitor the situation"" in the coming months. ""In the meantime, I call on the Republican Party of Kentucky to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate and how the party intends to uphold the integrity of the process,"" she said.","Rand Paul wants his hat in ring for both president and Senate .

"(CNN)A group of medical students -- including an American, seven Britons and a Canadian -- may be the latest Westerners to join ISIS. It's become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. ""The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,"" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called ""Foreign fighters in Syria."" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . ""ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip."" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. ""I'm from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,"" he told CNN. ""Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape."" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include ""a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,"" Mahmood wrote. ISIS' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ""It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,"" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS' propaganda prowess ""is something we have not seen before."" ""It's something we need to do a lot more work on,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. ""We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we're combating."" ""We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,"" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,"" told CNN last year.  ""... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them."" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS ""has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,"" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS' battlefield successes gave it ""some recruitment success,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. ""Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,"" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. ""This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,"" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. ""But in fact, it's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers."" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. ""It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,"" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada's intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there's work to do. ""It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants' messaging. ""We're seeing their approaches continue to evolve,"" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. ""We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource."" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. ""We're really going to pick it up now,"" Psaki said. ""We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months."" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. ""They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,"" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. ""Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.""

"(CNN)Is there anything Monopoly can't do? Over the course of its 80-year life, it's been played underwater, underground, in space (OK, just the tokens) and on giant game boards. It's used chocolate and featured real money. There have been games that barely lasted the night and marathon contests that went on for weeks. Not bad for a game that, according to lore, maker Parker Brothers originally rejected for containing ""52 fundamental errors."" March 19 marks the official 80th anniversary of the world's best-selling board game, now manufactured by Hasbro. Its circuitous history, like its game board, has been filled with several interesting turns. Here are a few: . Legend has it that Charles Darrow, an unemployed salesman, invented the game in his kitchen in 1930. But the roots of Monopoly actually date back a few more decades, to a game called the Landlord's Game created by Elizabeth Magie in 1903. The Landlord's Game was meant to be educational, illustrating economist Henry George's belief -- inspired by the Gilded Age -- that property ownership by individuals is inherently unfair. Magie's game was an underground success, leading to a number of offshoots, including the one that Darrow tweaked. Parker Brothers bought her patent for $500 in 1935, closing the loop. As for Darrow, he was inspired in 1932 by a version created by a New Jersey Quaker community that made Atlantic City the locale of the game. Darrow added colors and other design elements -- ""a look and feel to his board that would prove immensely appealing,"" writes Philip E. Orbanes in ""Monopoly,"" a 2006 history of the game. Darrow's game was initially rejected by Parker Brothers for three errors -- not 52 -- but when his independent sales took off, Parker Brothers bought the game from him. The date? March 19, 1935. The numbers are staggering. Monopoly has been translated into 47 languages. It's played in 114 countries. It's sold more than 275 million copies. Hasbro prints $30 billion in Monopoly money each year, and well more than $3 trillion has been printed since 1935. Not bad considering each standard game comes with $20,580 -- though it's in the rules that the bank can never go broke, so make up some scrip if you need it. Incidentally, the Monopoly Man -- named Rich Uncle Pennybags -- was likely based on mustachioed financier J.P. Morgan. Even before numerous editions of Monopoly were widely licensed, there were local board variations depending on the country. Boardwalk, for example, is Mayfair in Britain, Schlossallee in Germany, Kalverstraat in the Netherlands and Rue de la Paix in France, after major streets in London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. Other streets have also drawn from local geography. The new ""Here & Now"" U.S. edition, however, opened the voting to enthusiasts -- and Pierre (population 14,000), the capital of South Dakota, won pride of place as Boardwalk. (Lima, Peru, won the World Edition.) Pierre was one of 60 cities in the running, Mayor Laurie Gill said, and was ""in the bottom of the pack"" when she was informed of the contest. Being a competitive sort, she was determined to push Pierre past perhaps more logical cities such as New York or Los Angeles. ""It's our energy and the fact we engaged our citizens,"" she told CNN. ""I was doing radio and press releases and working with our school district, and our Chamber of Commerce utilized social media. It became a big deal here."" One consideration for visitors: Pierre is on the Missouri River, but it lacks a literal boardwalk. (There are paths.) Still, given the city's triumph, you probably wouldn't want to play Monopoly against an energized Pierre resident. Pierre may be doing better than Atlantic City, which has struggled since the mid-2000s to return to its gambling heyday. Still, the New Jersey resort does have Monopoly to thank for some of its fame -- not that it was appreciated at one time. In the early '70s, a city commissioner proposed renaming Mediterranean and Baltic avenues, since both had other names in different parts of town. The idea caused an uproar among Monopoly fans and the idea was eventually shot down. ""Baltic and Mediterranean are the streets we know,"" wrote one commissioner. ""Without them, we could never pass Go."" Do you put money from Chance and Community Chest in the center of the board and collect it when landing on Free Parking? Not in the rules. Do you give $400 for landing on Go instead of $200? Not in the rules. Do you allow secret side deals? Uh-uh. (Admittedly, there is now a set of ""House Rules"" that allow for variations, but they're not official.) The dismissive line ""Do not pass Go, do not collect $200,"" which has worked its way into a few songs, is from Monopoly. And the game also gave us the term ""Monopoly money,"" as in worthless currency. There aren't many movies featuring the game, but ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" has a famous scene with William Redfield and Danny DeVito arguing over DeVito's play. Stay tuned, though: a Monopoly movie is back on after several years in Hollywood purgatory. So forget the classic definition of ""Monopoly money."" Hasbro has taken quite a bunch to the bank. The original set featured a top hat, iron, shoe, thimble, battleship and cannon. Over the years, some pieces have been retired -- including a purse, rocking horse and lantern -- and others have been added. The latest? A bag of money and a cat. And they're all still made of metal, just as they've been for decades. Want to win at Monopoly? Though there's some chance involved (pardon the pun), the low-rent light blues and the mid-market oranges are the most desirable, according to a study done for Maxine Brady's 1974 ""The Monopoly Book."" The oranges and reds are the most likely to be landed on. The more upscale greens will pay off eventually, but they're expensive to develop, so you'd better have another form of cash flow in the short term. Or you could just do what millions have done since Darrow's day: Land on someone else's hotel, get mad and turn over the game board. Hey, it worked in college.","Monopoly celebrates 80th anniversary on Thursday .

"(CNN)Was the Middle East better off under dictatorships? It is certainly tempting to think so when one looks at conflicts in the region today, from Yemen to Libya to Syria. Those three countries have followed different trajectories since the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, but what they have in common now is instability that is not likely to be overcome in the short term. While this instability is making the West -- particularly the United States -- uncomfortable, it is also a direct result of the West's own stance towards dictatorships in the region prior to and during the Arab Spring. The West's shortsightedness in handling the Middle East throughout its modern history has directly contributed to its current devastation. Before 2011, what the West most valued in the Middle East was stability rather than democracy. Arab dictatorships were tolerated for decades despite their cruelty because they served Western economic, political, and security interests. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak was seen as the bulwark of peace with Israel. In Libya, a reformed Moammar Gadhafi was courted for potential investment and trade agreements. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad was a predictable leader who maintained the Golan Heights as a conflict-free zone. In Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh was regarded as an ally against al Qaeda. Dictatorships kept the status quo manageable. Government suppression of activism and of the alternative voices of civil society and independent media meant that top-down decisions were rarely contested. This pretty much guaranteed that Western interests would be served without too many complications. In return, Arab dictators enjoyed Western financial and military aid and political reassurances. Yemen was the epitome of this dynamic. Saleh courted and was courted by American diplomats who turned a blind eye to his transgressions, from arms smuggling to forcing new businesses to include him as a ""partner"" so that he could ensure a cut in the profits, while most Yemenis lived below the bread line. READ MORE: How we got here in Yemen . Saleh's value was in engaging in the ""war on terror"" through allowing American drones to strike al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The fact that he used this engagement as an excuse to ask for military assistance for Yemen -- which in reality was used to equip what would become a private army -- was considered a small price to pay by the United States. When the reality of living under dictatorships became exposed with the Arab Spring, the West could no longer ignore it and had to publicly declare support for the uprisings. But the West did not have a long-term strategy for handling the aftermath of dictatorships -- and the results have been catastrophic. Libya saw hasty international military intervention without a vision for stabilizing the country, and today is falling apart. Syria saw diplomatic toing and froing that eventually dragged the West into a messy war. Yemen was for a while thought of as an acceptable compromise because of the Gulf Cooperation Council's initiative that ended the uprising through a negotiated transition from Saleh to his deputy Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. But the long-term implications for this transition were ignored and Yemen today is paying the price. Yemen summarizes all the ills of dictatorships and their handling by foreign patrons. The West was naïve to think that Saleh would simply accept his removal from power. In an ironic turn of events, he has found in the Houthi rebels-- who had been marginalized under his rule and became even more so under Hadi -- an unlikely ally to regain influence. Saudi Arabia was also naïve in thinking that Houthi rule in northern Yemen would be better than having a political presence for the Muslim Brotherhood -- the Kingdom's staunchest political foe -- in Sanaa. The Saudis and the West ignored the simmering sectarian tensions between the Zaidi Houthis and the Sunni tribes of Yemen, not to mention the popular anger at U.S.-led drone attacks that sometimes killed civilians. They also ignored Iran's rising ambitions; why would the Houthis -- Iran's allies -- limit themselves to northern Yemen if they could also expand southwards and rule the whole country? The situation in Yemen today shows that even though the status quo under dictatorships may have appeared stable, beneath the surface volcanoes were preparing to erupt. Dictators may keep a country secure, but they do that at the expense of their own people. They may support the West's interests, but they will turn against them whenever their own interests are threatened. Although many today lament that the Arab Spring has turned into an Arab Winter, the conflicts emerging across the Middle East are largely the result of the political, economic, and social ills of dictatorships and the conditions that had sustained them. They have come to the surface because the lid has been lifted. But the current misery in the Middle East still does not mean that the region was better off under dictatorships. The aftermath of dictatorships is always messy, and democratic transition is never linear. Those with nostalgia for the days of Arab strongmen should remember that autocratic regimes plant the seed of future unrest and therefore only offer false, temporary security -- even if ""temporary"" takes a few decades to pass.","Khatib: West supported Mideast dictators until it became unpalatable in 2011 .

"(CNN)A British military health care worker in Sierra Leone has tested positive for Ebola, a UK health agency said. Medical experts are assessing what to do next, including whether or not the evacuate the infected individual to the United Kingdom for treatment, according to a Public Health England spokesperson. An Ebola outbreak has devastated parts of West Africa, with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia being the hardest hit nations. The vast majority of the more than 24,000 confirmed, reportable and suspected cases, as well as the nearly 10,000 reported deaths, have been in those three countries, the World Health Organization reports. In some cases, citizens of other nations have come down with the deadly disease while working there -- as, apparently, is true for the UK military heath care worker whose diagnosis was announced Wednesday. Authorities are investigating how this person was exposed to the virus and tracing individuals in recent contact with the diagnosed worker, said the Public Health England spokesperson. ""Any individuals identified as having had close contact will be assessed and a clinical decision made regarding bringing them to the UK,"" the spokesperson said. Pauline Cafferkey, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United Kingdom, was discharged from London's Royal Free Hospital in January after battling the virus. She is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children, according to British media outlets.","Spokesperson: Experts are investigating how the UK military health care worker got Ebola .

"Dulles, Virginia (CNN)Two quick-thinking passengers in the third row of a United flight to Denver tackled and subdued a man who was heading toward the cockpit, other travelers on the plane told CNN on Tuesday. The incident started shortly after United Flight 1074 took off around 10:15 p.m. Monday from Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington. The Boeing 737 jet was supposed to take its 33 passengers and six crew members to Denver, but turned back because the unnamed passenger ""failed to comply with crew instructions,"" United Airlines spokesman Luke Punzenberger said. Joshua Lindstrom told ""Anderson Cooper 360˚"" Tuesday night that a man was acting strangely as he moved up the aisle. ""The flight attendant gave some sort of command to stand back, and he turned and started heading toward the cockpit. And the guy in 3E was a lightning bolt and just jumped out of his seat and took the guy down to the ground."" The hero's seatmate piled on and grabbed the out-of-control passenger's legs, Lindstrom said. Passenger Donna Tellam told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" the men reacted so quickly she thought they were air marshals. She said the unruly man had come down the aisle, screaming about the plane going too slow and flailing his arms. A flight attendant used plastic ties to bind the man's wrists as the plane headed back, she said. Earlier, a government official with direct knowledge of the incident told CNN that the detained passenger had run toward the cockpit screaming ""jihad, jihad."" Lindstrom told Cooper he didn't hear those words but after the flight was back on the ground the man who tackled the unruly passenger mentioned it. ""He said, 'Did you hear it?  Like he said 'jihad' a couple times (while he was being restrained),"" Lindstrom said. ""... In the end it was more surreal than it was scary. It was wild."" Lindstrom said two other people helped keep the man on the floor for the 20 minutes or so that it took the flight crew to return to Dulles. During that time, the subdued man's mood would change. The man was rattling on about someone trying to bring the plane down, then become despondent and cry, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" A cell phone video shows the man, bruised on his face, being held down. At one point, he pleads, ""Please stop, please stop, they said call it off."" At another, the man seems to cry as he says, ""I'm so sorry."" ""Don't move,"" one passenger says, apparently trying to calm the man. ""You're OK. We're going to get you off this plane, buddy."" The plane returned to Dulles around 10:40 p.m., said Kimberly Gibbs, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs the northern Virginia airport. Airport police took the unruly passenger off the plane, and airport firefighter-EMTs transported him to a nearby hospital, according to Gibbs. As of late Tuesday evening, the passenger had not been arrested or charged with a crime, officials said. There is nothing, so far, in the tackled man's background to suggest he has a connection to terrorists, the government source said. No weapons were found after he was subdued. By then, the other passengers -- none of whom was injured -- had been rebooked on new Denver-bound flights. Some opted to take the first flight to Colorado on Tuesday, while others chose to leave later, according to Punzenberger, the United spokesman. Opinion: Pilot: How safe are you on a plane? CNN's Rene Marsh reported from Dulles Airport, and CNN's Steve Almasy and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Tina Burnside, Javi Morgado, Holly Yan and Diane Ruggiero contributed to this report.","Witness on plane says unruly passenger talked about someone trying to bring plane down .

"(CNN)Nigerians are scheduled to head to the polls this Saturday in what will be the most closely watched elections in Africa this year. The poll will test the strength of an electoral process that has been marred by violence and flawed results throughout the country's short democratic history. The stakes are high, and there is a very real danger of prolonged violence across the country if the electorate questions the legitimacy of the outcome.  The conduct of the elections will have long lasting repercussions on both Nigerians and the U.S.-Nigeria relationship. Against the backdrop of these elections is the ongoing threat and destabilization caused by Boko Haram, a group that has killed more than 10,000 people in northeastern Nigeria during its five-year campaign of terror, and kidnapped hundreds more, including young girls. These actions have shocked and horrified Americans. What many Americans may not recognize is how important the relationship with Nigeria is for the United States.  We have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election, especially as Nigeria has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended. In the last decade, the U.S. has trained and equipped thousands of Nigerian soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia, helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the West Africa region. But now we need Nigeria to be a front-line ally against terrorism, particularly as Boko Haram pledges fidelity to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, Nigeria also has the largest economy in Africa and has the continent's largest population. Indeed, it has been identified as one in the next set of prominent emerging economies, making it a tantalizing target for U.S. private investment. It is also Africa's No. 1 oil producer, although an increasingly diversified economy -- for example in the agriculture sector -- provides a myriad of opportunities for more robust trade with the United States. Ultimately, a stable Nigeria will mean real economic opportunities for Americans -- a win-win proposition. Yet despite this potential, the uncertain electoral environment and other serious challenges stand in the way of a deeper bond. The reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation, especially when you consider the Nigerian military's poor performance fighting Boko Haram, despite security spending reportedly being around $6 billion last year -- clearly, much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries, equipment or materiel. Similarly, weak governance remains an impediment to Nigeria's progress and enhanced ties with the United States. Nearly 70% of those in areas in the north live in absolute poverty, according to recent data, as compared to about 50% in southern areas of the country.  Such failure on the part of the government to address poverty and inequality facilitates Boko Haram's recruitment effort and foments internal instability. The Nigerian people clearly believe that these issues must be addressed.  According to an Afrobarometer survey released in January, 74% of Nigerian citizens said that their country is going ""in the wrong direction.""  Half of Nigerians surveyed expressed significant concern about political intimidation or violence in the current election environment. If the Nigerian leadership rises to the challenge of tackling these difficult issues, there is nothing standing in the way of even closer ties between our two countries. But it is not just about the leadership -- this election offers the chance for all Nigerians to choose their future, and decide which policies will shape the next four years.  Their example, for better or worse, will be watched -- and perhaps even replicated by other African states. The decisions made in the coming days and weeks will shape U.S.-Nigeria relations for years to come. But more importantly, they will determine the future for Nigeria's people. The world is watching Nigeria's historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope.","Robert Menendez: Nigerian vote will test the democracy's electoral process, marred by violence and flawed results in past .

""As others, we are taught that to be successful, we must reject those other others, or we will never belong."" She also challenged black people who don't support gay marriage to resist ""messages of hate."" ""We can't say that we believe in each other's fundamental humanity and then turn a blind eye to the reality of each others' existence and the truth of each other's hearts. We must be allies.

"(CNN)Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday. ""We have to be clear about this,"" Koval said. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used."" The officer who killed Robinson, 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny, had used deadly force before, shooting and killing a man in 2007, the chief said. Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was ""concluded to be a suicide by cop"" situation. Robinson was shot after allegedly assaulting Kenny, who was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence, Koval said. Afterward, protesters in this university town took to the streets and converged on City Hall, chanting ""Black lives matter."" Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Police described Robinson as African-American. ""In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" the police chief told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday night and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house. They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother ""based on the dynamics"" of the situation. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" he said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she said. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children. ""He was our caretaker and so gentle,"" she said. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital. Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place. ""His relationship to the home is unclear to me, although there were certainly familiar acquaintances. This was not a random place. He had hung out."" In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he ""can only imagine the heartbreak"" of Robinson's parents and added he's ""concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well."" ""They are all in my thoughts and prayers,"" Schimel said. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Some are demanding answers sooner rather than later. On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday. ""Who do we trust?"" some called out, prompting the response, ""No one!"" And in another refrain, they chanted, ""Black lives matter."" The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened. ""Praying for Madison tonight,"" wrote one activist. ""Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."" Mayor Paul Soglin spoke to the raw feelings, calling what happened ""an enormous tragedy."" ""We've got a family that's really hurting,"" Soglin said, according to WKOW. ""And we've got a city and neighborhood that's feeling pretty well hurt itself."" Some of the protesters were members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. She said Young, Gifted and Black will be working with church groups on Sunday and will hold more rallies Tuesday and Wednesday.

"(CNN)Police in Charlottesville, Virginia, will publicly discuss on Monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a University of Virginia student, which was initially reported last year in Rolling Stone magazine. The police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party. The accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the Rolling Stone article. After the account was published last fall, Rolling Stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details. CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter described Rolling Stone's announcement as falling short of a full-scale retraction. It remains unclear what really happened to the female student, Stelter said. ""We are in the phase here where Rolling Stone is trying to figure that out,"" Stelter said in December. ""They've apologized, but not retracted. So they're not saying the story is false. They're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still."" The Charlottesville Police Department will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. ET on Monday. Rolling Stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly ""orchestrated the attack on 'Jackie' (the woman who was the subject of the article) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,"" a decision the magazine said it regretted. ""In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,"" Rolling Stone said in December. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that ""the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story."" University of Virginia pledges zero-tolerance in rape cases . The article chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault. It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN that is proved by email and fraternity records. Warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser's account. For example, the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity, the fraternity house has no side staircase, and there were no pledges at that time of year. Jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on, asking, ""Don't you want to be a brother?""

"(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see. ""She was barely conscious. It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,"" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. "" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen."" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. ""She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,"" Sawyer said. ""I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now."" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. ""When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it."" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. ""She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,"" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, ""She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly."" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who ""saved her own life."" The fetus died, but the mother survived and ""is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,"" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, ""We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out."" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.","Officers responding to 911 call found Michelle Wilkins covered in blood .

"(CNN)A key Al-Shabaab operative, who was connected to the Westgate mall attack in Kenya, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike, the Pentagon announced Wednesday. Adan Garar, a member of Al-Shabaab's intelligence and security wing, was killed Thursday in southwestern Somalia as he traveled in a vehicle, according to Pentagon news release. Garar was responsible for ""coordinating the terror group's external operations, which target U.S. persons and other Western interests in order to further al Qaeda's goals and objectives,"" the Pentagon said in the statement. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city. Al-Shabaab has been blamed and taken responsibility for attacks on city streets, at markets, at prisons and a U.N. compound in Mogadishu. It's most high-profile attack came in 2013 at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, when terrorists casually walked into the building, pulled out weapons and began gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege.","Adan Garar, connected to the 2013 Westgate mall attack in Kenya, was riding in a vehicle that was struck from the air .

"(CNN)George Zimmerman says he bears a grudge against President Obama, accusing him of inflaming racial tensions around the Trayvon Martin case. Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in 2013 over Martin's death, made the allegations against Obama in a video posted on his lawyers' website. The February 2012 killing of Martin, an unarmed black teenager, by Zimmerman, a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, stirred fierce debate about race and the justice system. Zimmerman, who is now 31, said he shot Martin in self-defense during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida. But critics allege the death was spurred by racial profiling. In the new video, Zimmerman claims it was Obama who stoked racial tensions surrounding the case. He cites the President's remarks in March 2012, when the case was still being investigated, in which Obama said, ""If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon."" ""To me, that was clearly a dereliction of duty, pitting Americans against each other solely based on race,"" Zimmerman says in the conversation with his lawyer Howard Iken, who does not appear on camera. Zimmerman notes that Obama's press secretary at the time, Jay Carney, had said previously that the White House would not wade into the case, calling it ""a local law-enforcement matter."" Asked if he felt there was one government agency or official who brought the most unfairness to his situation, Zimmerman is quick to respond. ""By far, the President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama,"" he says. Zimmerman's comments are the first since the U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it wouldn't bring any civil rights charges against him. He says that he feels that ""the Department of Justice process worked,"" but also that it should have investigated whether his civil rights were violated. ""They had various numerous examples of bounties place on my head, credible threats placed against myself and my family,"" he says, adding that ""the President and the Attorney General and the federal government declined to do anything about it."" Zimmerman says he has a clear conscience over Martin's death. ""Only in a true life or death scenario can you have mental clearness to know that you cannot feel guilty for surviving,"" he says.","Zimmerman criticizes Obama's comments during the Trayvon Martin case .

"Moscow (CNN)Russia was ready to put its nuclear forces on alert over the crisis in Crimea last year, such was the threat to Russian people there, President Vladimir Putin said in a documentary that aired on state TV on Sunday night. Asked if Russia was prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play, Putin said: ""We were ready to do it. I talked with colleagues and told them that this (Crimea) is our historic territory, Russian people live there, they are in danger, we cannot leave them. ""It wasn't us who committed a coup, it was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs."" But this was the worst-case scenario, he added, in the documentary broadcast on state-run channel Rossiya One. ""I don't think this was actually anyone's wish -- to turn it into a world conflict."" It wasn't known when the interview was originally taped. It aired even as speculation mounted about Putin's health, following an absence of several days from the public stage. He reappeared in public Monday. Russia formally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last March, after Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following street protests that turned bloody. Russia called his ouster a coup by radical Ukrainian nationalists. Before Crimea was formally absorbed by Russia, unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites. A referendum was held on March 16, 2014 -- a year ago to the day -- on secession from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials at the time denied there was any threat to Russian citizens in Crimea. On Monday, Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Putin had ordered Russia's Northern Fleet and other military units to be placed on full combat alert for snap checks, state media reported. ""The main aim ... is to evaluate the capabilities of the Northern Fleet to fulfill tasks on ensuring Russia's military security in the Arctic,"" Shoigu is quoted as saying by Russia's Tass news agency. The exercise will involve 38,000 military personnel, 41 warships, 15 submarines and 110 planes and helicopters, Shoigu said, according to Tass. In the documentary, titled ""Crimea: Way Back Home,"" Putin said Moscow had had no choice but to act. ""Crimea isn't just any territory for us, it is historically Russian territory,"" he said. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that has been part of Ukraine since 1954, has a majority Russian population and strong cultural and historical ties to Russia. It is also home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, at the Sevastopol naval base. But Putin said he had never thought of ""dismembering"" the peninsula from Ukraine until Yanukovych's ouster. ""We cannot leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate, to let the people of Crimea be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer,"" he said. ""I set certain tasks. I did say what and how we should do, but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the Crimea want it."" The vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from Ukraine. But the vote, staged while armed men controlled the region, was dismissed as illegal by Ukraine's then-interim government in Kiev, the European Union and the United States. The West responded with financial sanctions against selected Russian figures and Crimean secessionist leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Berlin on Monday, reiterated that Europe does not consider Russia's annexation of Crimea to be legal. ""It is important that we work for a peaceful solution, and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been restored,"" she said. ""This not only includes Crimea but also now in our daily work the areas around Luhansk and Donetsk."" Unrest broke out in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions following Russia's absorbing of Crimea. A fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces there has claimed thousands of lives. Merkel warned that the European Union was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against Russian interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in Minsk, Belarus, last month is fully implemented. Putin told the documentary-makers he was certain the United States was behind the ouster of Yanukovych, which Moscow views as an illegal armed coup. ""Formally, the opposition was primarily supported by Europeans, but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our American partners and friends. It was them who helped prepare nationalists (and) combat troops,"" he said. He also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup, rather than those involved in Crimea's annexation. Putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance Crimea would be returned to Ukraine. And it appears Russia is taking no chances. In the documentary, Putin said Russia's Bastion high-precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to Crimea to protect the territory -- ""in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space."" This can only be done following a decision by the supreme commander in chief, he said. ""So, at a certain point, we deployed these coastal systems Bastion to make it clear that Crimea was under safe protection,"" he added. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Emma Burrows reported from Moscow, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Russian President Vladimir Putin was interviewed for a documentary on Crimea shown on Russian state TV .

"(CNN)The misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. An employee at the center has tested positive for the bacterium, which is kept at the facility. The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, said the bacteria probably aren't a threat to the general population. Inspectors from the CDC and the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the misuse of outer garments ""could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice,"" a news release said. ""Additionally, CDC and APHIS inspectors determined that Tulane primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing, which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves."" The bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, was being tested on mice in a biosafety level 3 lab at the Covington, Louisiana campus. It can cause can cause melioidosis, also known as Whitmore's disease. All research with the agent at the facility was suspended on February 11 and will remain suspended until it can be shown that there are no more risks and that proper procedures are being followed, the CDC said. The CDC says the primate facility can resume that research when Tulane officials show inspectors that: . • Entity-wide procedures exist to ensure animals accidentally exposed in the future are managed appropriately; . • All personal protective equipment procedures are thoroughly reviewed and revised appropriately to lessen the risk of future breaches; . • All Tulane primate center personnel are trained on any new or revised protective clothing procedures; and . • Improved entry and exit procedures to the outside enclosures housing non-human primates are in place to stop any further transmission among the animals."" The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture say they have completed their investigation, which began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others had antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. According to the CDC, ""the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source."" It is not transmitted between humans or animals, ""and the risk of acquiring melioidosis is low,"" the CDC said. Melioidosis ""is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread,"" according to the CDC website.","The error ""could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out"" of a lab, inspectors say .

"London (CNN)British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asked Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve his country's Parliament on Monday, opening the way for campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election. The procedural step means there are officially no members of Parliament until it reconvenes on May 18 for the swearing-in of members and the official state opening of Parliament on May 27. Addressing media outside the official prime ministerial residence at 10 Downing St., Cameron said that Britain had been ""on the brink"" when he came into office. ""Of course, we haven't fixed everything, but Britain is back on her feet again."" Cameron said the nation faced ""a stark choice"" in 38 days. ""The next Prime Minister walking through that door will be me or (Labour Party leader) Ed Miliband,"" he said. ""You can choose an economy that grows, that creates jobs, that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving NHS (National Health Service) ... and a government that will cut taxes for 30 million hard-working people ... or you can choose the economic chaos of Ed Miliband's Britain,"" Cameron said. ""After five years of effort and sacrifice, Britain is on the right track. This election is about moving forward -- and as Prime Minister here at No. 10 that's what I will deliver."" Miliband launched Labour's Business Manifesto on Monday, saying that a second Conservative term would threaten Britain's EU membership and pose ""a clear and present danger"" to British firms and prosperity. ""There are two futures on offer at this election,"" Miliband said. ""To carry on with a Conservative plan based on the idea that as long as the richest and most powerful succeed, everyone else will be OK. Or a Labour plan, a better plan, that says it is only when working people succeed that Britain succeeds."" Miliband also referenced Cameron's March 23 announcement that the Conservative leader had ruled out standing for a third term -- before the election that will decide whether he even gets a second term in the top job -- saying the Conservative candidates would be ""vying against each other for who can be the most extreme on Europe."" Cameron and his Conservative Party won the last election in 2010, but not by enough to go into government alone. Without a majority in Parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs, or lawmakers, from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber that passes laws and legislation. For five years, Cameron has been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, has mostly backed Cameron in parliamentary debates against Labour's Miliband. ""For the first time ever, the Liberal Democrats go into this campaign with a record of action in government to be extremely proud of,"" Clegg said Monday. ""We have kept the government in the center ground and shown that we are the only party that can build a stronger economy and a fairer society."" The right-wing UK Independence Party, or UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. Last year, in a backlash against the EU, UKIP caused a political earthquake and won elections to the European Parliament in Britain, and some commentators have likened its impact on UK politics to that of the tea party in the United States. It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the May 7 UK general election. Some of its supporters appeared to be casting protest votes last year and could return to the established Conservative and Labour parties when more is at stake. On Monday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""UKIP is the party of real change for real people. If you #VoteUKIP on May 7th, you'll get MPs willing to hold the government to account."" Meanwhile, in Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that it could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond quit after the referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon now heads the party. ""The general election on May 7 is a fantastic opportunity for Scotland to make Westminster sit up and take notice,"" Sturgeon said Monday. ""By holding the balance of power in a hung Parliament, SNP MPs can work with others to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street -- and ensure that Scotland's priorities become priorities at Westminster,"" she said. Eligible Britons must be registered by April 20 to vote.","British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asks Queen to dissolve Parliament .

"(CNN)A dark intersection. A church van full of parishioners. And tragedy. That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. ""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,"" Bueno said. ""It breaks your heart to see something like this happen."" Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. ""We've lost a lot of family members, church family,"" Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. ""All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us."" Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. ""She loved singing and helping people,"" TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. ""She was exciting; she was the best lady to us."" Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. ""It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong,"" she told the site. ""I'll never forget his smile."" A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. ""This is a very difficult day for us today,"" he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said.

"London (CNN)London teenager Brusthom Ziamani only converted to Islam in April last year. But by August he was arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill a soldier, police officer or government official, with a 12-inch knife and a hammer found in his backpack. Ziamani was convicted in February of ""engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts"" and sentenced Friday at the Old Bailey to 22 years in prison. It's a case with chilling echoes of the shocking murder by two Islamist extremists of soldier Lee Rigby, mowed down and hacked to death with a machete on a street in Woolwich, in southeast London, in May 2013. On the morning of his arrest, Ziamani had told his former girlfriend he intended to attack and kill soldiers. He also showed her the long-bladed knife and the hammer in his bag. Police who had searched his home two months previously had found a handwritten letter in which he glorified the murder of Rigby, and stated that ""we should do a 9/11, 7/7 and a Woolwich all in one day."" Police said Ziamani, who was unemployed, had come under the influence of a banned London-based terrorist organization ""that it is believed played a major role in influencing and shaping his radical views."" That organization is Al Muhajiroun, also known as ALM. Handing down the 22-year sentence, Judge Timothy Pontius said the police had put together a ""formidable and unassailable"" case against the teenager. ""Ziamani's coldblooded deliberation under the malign influence of ALM, of whom he was a willing student, showed in court that he was far from the naive adolescent that the (defense) tried to portray him as,"" he is quoted as saying in a police statement. ""He is a man of intelligence and independent and articulate mind. He was within hours of carrying out his intention of murdering a soldier, police officer or government official to imitate the horrifying savagery carried out by the killers of Lee Rigby."" The letter that came to light when counterterror officers from London's Metropolitan Police searched Ziamani's address in June gave an insight into an extremist mind-set that already had violence in mind. Found in a pair of jeans, according to police, the letter was messily written with many misspellings. In it, he tells his ""beloved parents"" that what he's about to do is an obligation for Muslims and asks them to forgive him for all the stress he's caused them in the past. ""I'm a changed person,"" he said, saying he has to act to help his ""brothers and sisters"" in Syria and Iraq. Because he does not have the means to get to these countries, he will wage war against the British government here instead, he said, adding that it would give the authorities ""a taste of there (sic) own medicine."" Ziamani admitted writing the letter and was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offense. He was released on bail, allowing police to continue their inquiries. Police believe he converted to Islam in April 2014 and point to his postings on social media as evidence of his rapid radicalization. In May he posted ""Land of democracy = Evil,"" and in July he posted, ""Forget the protests, the only way to liberate Muslim lands is Jihad."" On June 20, Ziamani had used his phone to visit websites researching the locations for army cadet bases across London, police said. While Ziamani was out on bail, officers tasked with trying to divert vulnerable young people from the path to radicalization tried to meet with him three times, but he declined to engage with them, police said. Commander Richard Walton of the Counter Terrorism Command welcomed the sentence, saying he was ""relieved an extremely dangerous individual"" had been removed from the streets. ""Ziamani was an impressionable young man who became radicalized, then rapidly developed an extremist, violent mind-set,"" Walton said. The work of police and intelligence officials had ""probably prevented a horrific terrorist attack taking place on the streets of London,"" he said.","Brusthom Ziamani gets 22 years in prison in plot to kill a soldier, police officer or official .

"(CNN)The Queens, New York, district attorney called it ""every subway commuter's worst nightmare."" A man waiting for a train was pushed off the subway platform into the path of an arriving train on December 27, 2012. He died instantly. Erika Menendez of Queens, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime. Menendez told authorities she ""pushed a Muslim off the train tracks"" because she'd hated Hindus and Muslims ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. Menendez, 33, was allowed Friday to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter, Brown said in a statement. The judge indicated he would sentence her to 22 to 25 years in prison on April 29. Conviction on the original charge would have resulted in a tougher sentence -- 25 years to life imprisonment, Meris Campbell, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Saturday. The district attorney's office accepted the plea because Menendez promised not to appeal and because of Menendez's ""substantial psychiatric history and serious drug problem,"" Campbell said. ""We are assured she'll serve a substantial amount of time behind bars."" The victim, Sunando Sen, 46, was not Muslim. A friend told CNN he grew up in a Hindu family. The incident happened at night at the 40 Street-Lowery Street station in Sunnyside, Queens. Witnesses told police a woman paced the platform and talked to herself before pushing Sen as the 11-car train entered the station. Security video showed a woman running from the scene. Menendez was recognized on a street in Brooklyn by a passerby who had seen the video and called 911, police said. ""The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter's worst nightmare -- being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train,"" Brown said Friday. ""The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself."" A call and email to Menendez's defense lawyer were not immediately returned Saturday. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Man was pushed into the path of subway train in Queens in December 2012 .

"(CNN)""India's Daughter,"" the BBC Four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in Delhi, premiered in the U.S. last week. If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. ""A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,"" he says. ""When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent."" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, ""In our culture, there is no place for a woman"" and that if a daughter or sister ""engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight."" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, ""Violence against women is really bad...in India."" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about ""how far women have come"" in the United States. Or to say, ""Sure, we still have issues, but not like that."" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues ""like that."" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from ""The Hunting Ground,"" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing ""India's Daughter"" in Mic.com, ""from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims."" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) ""violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace."" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to ""the other,"" to the ""not here, not us, not me."" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, ""somewhere else,"" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those ""others"" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, ""India's Daughter"" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide. So let's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up, together, to say no more: not in my home, not in my school, not in my country, not anywhere.","Phoebe Schreiner: We react in horror at comments in BBC doc where India rapist says women err in fighting back .

"(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. ""In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer."" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. ""While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.""","A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .

"Norman, Oklahoma (CNN)Trinidad James isn't mad at Beauton Gilbow. The rapper's hit song can be heard playing in the background as Gilbow, the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- repeats the n-word seven times on camera. It appears overboard considering that the hook of the song, ""All Gold Everything,"" uses the word only three times per succession. Gilbow has been bombarded with claims that she's just as racist as the fraternity members caught singing a racist song on a bus last weekend. It's an allegation she's firmly denied, and the Atlanta rapper who wrote ""All Gold Everything"" is willing to give her a pass, though he wouldn't condone her use of the word. He doesn't hate her, though. ""I'm not going to be that person,"" he told CNN. ""It's a rock and a hard place. I can't be as upset at that lady. I'm upset at the fraternity because what they're saying is a chant that's just completely disrespectful to the black race. As far as that lady goes -- man, that's an old lady, man. Let that lady be."" The Trinidad-born rapper, whose real name is Nicholas Williams, said he doesn't like giving interviews about race and the n-word because his views are complex and hip-hop stars can be hypocrites when it comes to the topics. ""It's hard to ridicule somebody for something that you continue to use in your music,"" he said. ""Every (hip-hop) artist is using the n-word in their music -- hit records with the n-word in it. You can't be upset when somebody says it. You can't. It's hard to differentiate when you can use it. If we don't want the word used and the word holds such a negative connotation, then we shouldn't use it at all, period."" He compared it to children hearing their parents curse, ""and they told you not to curse. You wanted to curse. You cursed."" Context matters, he said. If you're using the word in a negative way, talking down to someone or being sarcastic, that's wrong. ""But if it's somebody that you've been rocking with or we're listening to music or whatever, I can't be upset,"" he said. ""It's humanly impossible for you to be upset at a different race saying it when you're saying it in your music. That's crazy to me."" He has a different take on the fraternity members caught clapping, pumping their fists and chanting, ""There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me."" SAE no stranger to scandal . ""I don't respect that at all. What kind of world are we living in here?"" he asked. He took it personally, he said, because he and other hip-hop artists travel the country to perform for fraternities, and to know any fraternity member would harbor such vile feelings toward him ""burns my heart."" As fellow Atlanta rapper Waka Flocka Flame noted when he canceled an upcoming show for the University of Oklahoma SAEs, Trinidad James said people of all races attend his concerts and have a great time together. ""These fraternities are places that us as hip-hop artists, we come and do amazing shows for these fraternities, like I just did Texas Tech, I just did Texas A&M, Delta Chi, Sigma Chi, and those guys were great. And I've done a show actually at Oklahoma last year,"" he said. ""So to see that that chapter feels that type of way toward the black race, it hurts, man. It sucks."" He even takes a special pride in performing in front of these audiences, he said. ""We go really hard for these college kids. I didn't go to college, so for me, I feel really good when I can make kids who are doing the right thing and going to college ... have a good time because college is so strenuous on the mind and it's so hard when you've got to pay tuition and books, trying to survive as a young adult, so that's why we try to come and make sure the kids have a great time. If you go look at the shows, it's an amazing time."" As far as the chances that he'd ever perform in front of Oklahoma's SAE chapter in the future, forget about it, he said. He doesn't care if they were resurrected as an all-black fraternity, he said. ""I don't want nothing to do with that because that's ridiculous. I feel like anything they do now is just to cover it up and make it look better,"" he said. And while it's disturbing to see young people voicing racist leanings, Trinidad James said he'd prefer to know where someone stands over being misled. Fraternities considering booking him in the future can keep that in mind, he said. ""I would rather you didn't even book me for the shows. I'm not no hired monkey,"" he said. ""Just don't be cool with me. Don't talk to me. If you feel that way about me that you would want to hang me from a tree then don't talk to me. I would stay away from you because obviously my skin color offends your life."" CNN's Nick Valencia conducted the interview from Norman, Oklahoma, and Eliott C. McLaughlin wrote from Atlanta.","Trinidad James says it would be hypocritical to condemn Beauton Gilbow .

"(CNN)Sen. Rand Paul, who is expected to announce on April 7 that he will be running for the presidency, is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism. The Kentucky senator's widely publicized appearance this month at the South by Southwest festival at Austin, Texas, was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech-savvy audience. His particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and Republican conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack. Younger Republicans, the much-desired millennial vote, seem attracted by what they are hearing. What accounts for his appeal? In an era when so many Americans seem frustrated with shallow, personality-based politics, there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas. For many disaffected younger Republicans, Paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern GOP. For almost half a century, ""big government conservatism"" has ruled the party. Although conservatism is theoretically about limited government, the historical reality has been much different. On national defense, the hawks of the GOP have been victorious. Even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government, Republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military-industrial complex. Though the GOP has little tolerance for many social safety net programs, the party has accepted sizable government support to industry, such as the financial bailout known as TARP in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests. Paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the GOP has embraced in recent decades, during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation-building and regime change. For some Republicans, including Paul, these policies were at the heart of the failures of George W. Bush's presidency and a sharp departure from the party's principles. Similarly, Paul has been one of the few Republican voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties. At the local level, he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement officers. Paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that don't sit well with a growing number of Republican voters. He has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana. He has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of Republicans are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction. While many Republicans have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from Democrats, most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas. Indeed, the recent budget blueprint from congressional Republicans exposed how thin discussions of a Republican anti-poverty program are. Their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare and regressive supply side tax cuts. But Paul, who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget, has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas, including criminal justice reform, that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated African American communities. Can Paul really win? That is unclear. Republican strategist Matthew Dowd told The New York Times: ""It's one thing to be interesting; it's another thing to be compelling. They've got to see him sitting in the Oval Office. And I do not think Rand has crossed that threshold yet."" There are many skeptics who don't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record. Paul's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him, as will some of his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure. Paul is still a Republican, so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the GOP. He is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive. While Paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable, some of his supporters smell a sellout. Arguably, we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to Iran led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas (a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish Bill Kristol), switched his approach to the issue of same-sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against ISIS. ""This is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,"" the editor of an anti-war website told the Daily Beast. ""This was the last straw. I've put up with a lot from that guy! I've had to defend him like a Jesuit. I'm done. Let somebody else do it."" But if Rand Paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the Republican candidates, at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the GOP by raising questions about some of the party's core positions.","Julian Zelizer: Rand Paul, due to announce for presidency, has attracted a lot of attention .

"(CNN)He was proud of his son for making good grades. So Officer Robert Wilson III climbed out of his squad car in snow-bound north Philadelphia to get him a gift. While shopping for a game, he died in the line of duty. Wilson was standing at the counter across from employees at the GameStop store when two brothers, Carlton Hipps and Ramone Williams,  walked in carrying guns, police said. They allegedly stuck up the store with at least five patrons and two employees inside. ""They said they thought it was going to be an easy target,"" said police spokesman Capt. James Clark. The store is in a quiet cul-de-sac. Williams and Hipps had not seen the police car outside, where Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson sat. Nor did they notice Wilson, who was in uniform. Wilson confronted them, and a firefight broke out, police said. The officer, an eight-year veteran, stepped away from others in the store to keep them out of the crossfire, police said after watching the store's security camera footage. He was a hero and a warrior, Clark said. ""He fought until the very, very end, firing at both of them."" Hipps and Williams ducked out of sight at times behind movie posters as they trained their fire on Wilson, Clark said. Within 30 to 40 seconds, 50 shots fell, he said. ""Officer Wilson was shot multiple times in the body and once in the head. That is the shot that ultimately killed him,"" the captain said. With Wilson down, the two men ran out of the store, where Stevenson intercepted them. The officer wounded Hipps in the leg, and Williams ran back inside the store. He stood around, trying to act like he was just another customer when they arrested him, police said. He later gave them a confession. Both brothers have been charged with Wilson's murder and with attempted murder on Stevenson. The brothers told police that it was their first robbery attempt, but it wasn't their first run-in with the law. Williams, who is 26, has been arrested twice before, and Hipps, who is 30, six times, police said. He was released from jail in 2009, Clark said. In the brothers' home, police found an AK-47. The guns used in the robbery were bought on the street, police said. They want to find out who provided them. At the GameStop, residents have started a memorial, and it's growing, CNN affiliate KYW reported. At the 22nd police district, where Wilson worked, the flag hangs at half-staff. Actor Dan Aykryod, who was in town on a promotional tour, made a donation to Wilson's family and encouraged others to do the same. Wilson was 30 years old. In addition to his son, he leaves behind a  1-year-old daughter. His son turns 10 on Monday. The game was also going to be a birthday present.

"(CNN)Look to the skies above London and you'll see the usual suspects -- rainclouds, planes and pigeons. But by the end of the year, you might just see something else. Longer than a soccer pitch and filled to the brim with helium, at 302 feet long, the Airlander 10 will be the world's biggest aircraft. Part blimp, part plane, part helicopter, it was originally created by British design company Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) for military surveillance by the U.S. Army. But budget cuts doomed the project and HAV bought the airship back across the pond, where it seemed set to remain on solid ground until the company received a £3.4 million ($5.1 million) grant from the UK government. Thanks to this recent injection of financing, designers and engineers are now readying the craft for first flight tests scheduled for later this year. While the concept has been around for nearly a century, airships fell out of fashion following the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, when the German passenger craft erupted into flames while trying to dock, killing 36. While an airship might seem like a craft from a time long passed, it has been given a 21st century design overhaul and HAV hopes to have airships back in the skies over the UK by 2016. Chris Daniels, HAV head of partnerships and communications, said: ""The sole problems existing old-style airships had (were) having lots of ground crew, limited ability to carry payloads and to be susceptible to weather conditions. We solved all those problems with a new concept -- a hybrid aircraft. So a mix between a wing and an airship."" The Airlander 10 -- named because it can carry 10 tons -- is made of a bespoke fabric of carbon fiber, kevlar and mylar, while the pressure of the helium inside maintains the aircraft's shape. Diesel fuel helps the Airlander take off and land and powers the propellers. The spacious cockpit is currently configured to accommodate a pilot and one observer but Daniels says this can easily be reconfigured to end-user specifications. The airship also has green credentials -- its creators say the current version uses 20% fuel burn of existing aircraft, can be fitted with solar panels, uses near-silent 325 hp V8 engines and can stay airborne for five days while carrying its maximum payload. The vehicle can also operate in extreme weather conditions (+54 to -56 degrees Celsius). While the previous U.S. Army project had military applications in mind, this time HAV plans to split end use 60:40 between civlian and military applications. Daniels says that they've had incredible interest from at home and abroad. The U.S. Coastguard has expressed interest in using the hybrid airships to monitor the nation's coastline. Meanwhile Swedish firm OceanSky, in conjunction with the government, wants to use the Airlander as an air transport system for wind turbines. Daniels explained: ""At the moment, the only way of  doing (transporting the equipment) is basically plowing a 50m-wide highway through pristine Nordic forest, which is not a good thing to do and they don't want to destroy ecological environment."" Showing the versatility in air transport operations the airship could have, Daniels said the charity Oxfam is keen to task the aircraft on aid relief missions following natural disasters, while HAV is in talks with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to help conduct scientific research. Using airships for military purposes such as reconnaissance and surveillance is not a new idea and today faces stiff competition from drones. Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of AEROSPACE Magazine, said: ""The Airlander does have one big benefit over UAVs. It can lift a heavier payload than most drones so allows for radars, better cameras, multiple sensors, etc. Payload weight is one of biggest limiters of UAVs -- so that would be extremely attractive to militaries looking to put larger or heavier sensors on board. It is also manned (piloted) which gives it more flexibility in being able to deploy to where it is needed."" Robinson also highlighted commercial possibilities for the Airlander, such as long-range cargo airships and humanitarian missions. ""The ability of the airship not to need runways or airports would be very attractive for disaster relief. While helicopters can also land anywhere, they are limited in payload and range -- plus the Airlander is much more efficient thanks to its hybrid 'lifting body' design."" He added: ""Imagine a large airship being able to land with a medical emergency department on board, right at the scene of the disaster."" But the aviation expert is also cautiously optimistic about the future of the Airlander. He said there had been several ""false dawns"" in bringing about the return of the airship in previous years, including two military surveillance airship projects from the U.S. Pentagon which were ultimately sidelined ""because they weren't confident in the technology."" While Robinson calls it ""the most promising lighter-than-air vehicle project we have seen in a long time,"" only successful first flight tests at the end of the year and further demos and trials will show off the Airlander 10's true capabilities. Until then, keep your eyes fixed to the horizon, where you might just see the future of aviation re-emerge through the clouds.

"(CNN)British law enforcement officers have arrested a 23-year-old man suspected of hacking the U.S. Department of Defense and swiping data from a satellite-based system used by the military to communicate with people worldwide, UK authorities said Friday. This arrest was one of 56 made this week in 20 separate operations conducted by regional organized crime units, Metropolitan Police officers and others. The others caught range from a family of suspected fraudsters and a 16-year-old believed to be behind hundreds of cyberattacks, according to Britain's National Crime Agency. Yet the arrest that the agency highlighted most was the one that targeted the world's most powerful last June 15. On that date, someone hacked into the U.S. Department of Defense's servers and got data related to its ""Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services"" system. This included contact information -- including their names, emails and phone numbers -- of about 800 people and info on approximately 34,400 devices, the National Crime Agency reports. None of the hacked material was considered confidential, nor did it apparently include ""sensitive data"" or anything that ""compromises U.S. national security interests,"" the British agency said. Still, the person responsible for the hack cryptically played it up big in a post to Pastebin, a website that allows for anonymous posts. Alongside screenshots of the dashboard used to control the Defense Department database, the hacker wrote, ""We smite the Lizards, LizardSquad your time is near"" in apparent reference to a notorious band of black-hat hackers. ""We're in your bases, we control your satellites,"" the hacker adds. ""The missiles shall rein (sic) upon they who claim alliance, watch your heads... We're one, we're many, we lurk in the dark, we're everywhere and anywhere."" The 23-year-old suspected hacker was not identified by name, with the UK National Crime Agency saying only that he was arrested Wednesday morning in Sutton Coldfield,a  Birmingham suburb in the West Midlands region. The U.S. military has been targeted by hackers before. Some of those actions have been blamed on ISIS sympathizers, like the January temporary takeover of the U.S. Central Command's Twitter account and YouTube page. And last year, U.S. federal officials accused four men of hacking into computer networks of the U.S. military and Microsoft and stealing more than $100 million worth of software, some it related to the video game ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3."" There's no indication that the June hack had anything to do with ISIS or involved the theft of anything of much monetary value. Still, hacks from groups such as Lizard Squad and Anonymous can have a significant impact. Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge with the U.S. Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), said in the UK government statement that ""this arrest underscores DCIS commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks."" ""DCIS special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those who attack the Department of Defense,"" Thorpe said. CNN's Ed Payne and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","The 23-year-old man was one of dozens arrested in similar operations around Britain .

The tornado warning included downtown Tulsa. Large, damaging hail the size of baseballs and hurricane-force winds were possible. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for the area until late Wednesday night. More severe weather tore through the Oklahoma City area. Another tornado was spotted about 15 miles south of town south in Moore, said Sgt. Jeremy Lewis with the city's police. ""We have about a 2-mile square area with significant damage, mainly roofs off homes and downed trees,"" he said.  ""Right now, we have the area secured, we have crews in there making sure that gas lines, electrical line, all that's turned off. "" Trees had to be cleared so law enforcement and emergency vehicles could get through. ""You know, this isn't the first time we've done this so ... unfortunately, we've gotten pretty good at getting people back into their residences as quick as we can,"" Lewis said.  ""We just have to make sure that it's safe. Lewis said a temporary hospital was treating patients with minor injuries. The original Moore Medical Center was destroyed two years ago in a tornado. Staff took cover in temporary shelters as the storm approached.

"New Delhi (CNN)Police in India's farthest northeastern state of Nagaland have arrested 43 people in connection with the killing of a jail inmate accused of rape. The suspects are being questioned over a range of offenses, including arson, rioting, attempted murder and murder, said L.L. Doungal, the police chief of Nagaland, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. They're alleged to be among a crowd of thousands of people who stormed a jail in the Dimapur district, and dragged out the suspected rapist before beating him to death in the street. The 35-year-old victim had been accused of raping a local woman last month. ""There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,"" Doungal said when news of the attack first emerged. The dead man was initially identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, but now police say they still are determining his nationality. ""I am not ruling out that he's not a Bangladeshi. I am also not denying that he is not an Indian. We are verifying his nationality,"" said G. Akheto Sema, an additional director-general of Nagaland's police, when asked about local reports suggesting the attacked man was an Indian citizen. Dimapur town remains under a curfew, Sema said, amid growing tensions between native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district. Thousands of protesters demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. ""There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,"" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack, according to authorities. ""We retrieved his body before it could be hung,"" Doungal said. With English as its official language, Nagaland is located in the extreme northeastern end of India, along the border with Myanmar. Home to about two million people, the state is spread over 16,500 square kilometers, with a relatively high literacy rate of 67%, compared with other densely populated parts of India. Ethnic tensions are rife in Nagaland and other provinces of the impoverished northeast region. Some local groups want greater autonomy, and there's general discontent over the alleged neglect of the region by successive central governments.

"(CNN)Are your heroes disappointing you? You're not alone. Most people yearn for role models, for someone to admire and emulate. But then sometimes: Crash! Unless the superheroes perform their awe-inspiring work in the comic books or the movies, they eventually slide off the pedestal; or perhaps they get smashed down to the ground, breaking into too many pieces to repair. The admirer is left heartbroken or disillusioned. If you want to admire someone fully, you should not look too closely. If you want to admire them smartly, you should brace yourself for at least some measure of disappointment. In the political arena, the season of scrutiny and revelations is just getting started with Hillary Clinton and her email practices as secretary of state under the microscope. After a press conference at the United Nations on Tuesday, worries that she is too secretive and calculating are emerging again. For some diehard supporters, this is all about Clinton-hating Republican politics. But to people who may have held Clinton as a model and inspiration, it may raise doubts. Is Hillary a hero or is she not to be trusted? Or, is there an altogether different answer? For me, two individuals in particular were once important heroes. A couple of weeks ago, during a trip to the Middle East, I had the unexpected good fortune to meet someone I have admired for many years: the Liberian President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. I had the opportunity to chat with her, and the conversation left me even more impressed with her. She's a truly inspiring woman. I tweeted a picture of the President and me, calling her ""my hero,"" a word I seldom use. Moments later, I received a reply (since deleted) from a Twitter connection informing me that Sirleaf has a dismal record on gay rights and had very publicly announced she would refuse to sign a bill to end prison sentences for gay Liberians. The incident reminded me of what has happened with another woman I have admired greatly over the years, the Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Suu Kyi endured decades of house arrest and great personal hardship to help gain freedom for her people from a harsh military dictatorship that entrenched itself for half a century. It seemed a hopeless quest, but she persisted courageously. Then, four years ago, the situation changed. The government of Myanmar (also known as Burma) freed her from arrest and she became a member of parliament and an influential political leader. The woman who stood firm for her principles has suddenly gone silent on one of the worst abuses still occurring in her country: the brutal treatment of Myanmar's Rohingya minority. This disappointed many of her admirers. Like Sirleaf on LGBT issues, Suu Kyi is making cold political calculations on the issue of the Rohingya, weighing cost against benefit, and setting aside principles in the process. Does that mean we should ignore these women's incredible track records? Should we ignore the fact that Sirleaf became the first woman to be democratically elected president in all of Africa, taking over a country racked by a brutal civil war and guiding it toward a better future; inspiring Africans to fight against corruption, showing women everywhere that they can make a difference? Should we ignore Suu Kyi's astonishing ability to draw international attention to a repressive regime, paying an enormous personal price and ultimately succeeding? Or should we ignore their deliberate blind spots on politically inconvenient issues, even if they concern human rights, which were supposed to stand at the core of what drove these leaders? The challenge is for each of us to make judgments based on our own values. Consider Thomas Jefferson, the man who composed one of the most remarkable documents in human history -- the Declaration of Independence. The words -- ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal"" -- are profound and history-changing. And yet, Jefferson, we now know, had a dark side, one that included not only slave ownership, but also the mistreatment of human beings he bought and sold. Human flaws come in all sizes, some small, some overwhelming. Men who have achieved the status of near saints were known as deeply flawed by those closest to them. Mahatma Gandi and Nelson Mandela were terrible fathers. Steve Jobs, the man who gave us our beloved iPhones and iPads, who made technology an irresistible, magnificent addition to our lives, turns out to have been a jerk in some ways. He was a genius, but he was, as one reviewer of his biography put it, ""a world class asshole."" Sports stars have broken the hearts of their admirers. From Lance Armstrong and all those who took performance-enhancing drugs to the athletes who abuse their spouses, the sound of heroes crashing off the pedestals has been deafening. And we can be sure there are many more peccadilloes that would be found if the lens closed in tightly enough. The fact is, there are no perfect human beings. The ancient Greeks took it even further, giving their gods deep, even devastating human-like shortcomings. They still had their strengths, but their weaknesses could compel their decision-making, taking them in disastrous directions. When mere mortals like the rest of us try to decide who is deserving of hero worship, we should temper our expectations. Humans will disappoint. The truth is I am almost allergic to hero worship (despite that recent tweet.) There are people I admire, but I think it's best to focus on the qualities of individuals when I find them to be inspiring and worthy of admiration -- whether it's a girl from Pakistan or a particularly courageous and wise public figure. I try to appreciate moments of heroism and impressive personality traits. There are talented, courageous, inspiring politicians, actors, activists, artists and writers. But when it comes to all-around superheroes, they belong in the comic pages and the movies.","Frida Ghitis: Are your heroes disappointing you? You're not alone .

In ""The Jinx,"" the HBO documentary about Durst's life, she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. The two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman turned up dead in Beverly Hills, California. This week, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged Durst with first-degree murder in that case. It's an accusation he has long denied. He also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance. In a 2003 trial, he admitted he'd shot a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and dismembered the body, but was acquitted of murder after arguing he'd acted in self defense. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock. ""Am I supposed to be smiling or am I supposed to be grim?"" Durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial. Charatan quickly replies, ""I would just have as close to no expression, yeah, that's what I think."" She was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney Michael Kennedy, a lawyer Durst's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case. The insanity defense Kennedy was planning to use, she said at the time, could have meant both Durst and Charatan were cut out of the family fortune. ""What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on, since I'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time, OK, that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions,"" she says in another call. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. ""She's not some opportunistic woman who came into Bob's life for monetary gain. She was very successful, a millionaire several times over long before she met Bob,"" said Amir Korangy, publisher of TheRealDeal.com. Susan Criss, the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial, said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it's clear that Charatan is motivated by financial gain. ""It's very clear that she only cares about the money,"" Criss said. Some former friends and employees described Charatan in less than glowing terms. Former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions. According to sources, she only briefly lived with Durst and they are now separated, though still married. Why doesn't the HBO documentary feature any more recent interviews with her? Charatan didn't want Durst to participate in ""The Jinx,"" Korangy said, and she hasn't spoken with him since it started airing. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Erin Burnett contributed to this report.","Debrah Lee Charatan is Robert Durst's second wife .

"(CNN)Police officer and former U.S. Army Ranger John Moynihan was honored at the White House less than a year ago as one of the nation's ""Top Cops"" for helping to save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the Boston Marathon bombers. On Saturday, Moynihan, 34, was in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital after being shot in the face at point-blank range in the city's Roxbury neighborhood the night before. The gunman was shot and killed. ""He's a strong kid,"" Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. ""He's a fighter. He's going to pull through."" On Sunday, after several hours of surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, Moynihan, who had been listed in critical condition, was in stable and improving condition, according to a Twitter posting by the Boston Police Department. A six-year police veteran and member of the youth violence task force, Moynihan was shot below the right eye. The bullet lodged behind his right ear, Evans said. In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. Police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. One round nearly killed Donohue. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their ""heroic and relentless"" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. An officer pressed against Donuhue's chest. Another forced air into his lungs. The wound near his groin was too high for a tourniquet. A 33-year police veteran, Donohue was pale and appeared dead as four officers laid him on a gurney. ""He was essentially dead,"" said Dr. Heather Studley, who took over his care at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed that night; his younger brother is on trial now in a federal death penalty case in Boston. At a White House ceremony last May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as ""America's Top Cops."" ""There are officers here who were in the thick of two attacks last year:  the shooting at the Washington Naval Yard and the bombing at the Boston Marathon,"" Obama said at the time. ""On those awful days -- and we all remember them -- amid the smoke and the chaos, the courage of these officers shone through.  And their quick thinking and level-headedness undoubtedly saved lives."" In a statement Saturday, Donohue wished Moynihan a full recovery, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. ""John played a part in saving my life, and that's something I will never forget,"" Donohue said. ""His record of service speaks for itself. Everyone is wishing him well and we know he has the strength to pull through."" At 6:40 p.m. Friday, Moynihan and other officers pulled over a car in an area where gunshots had been reported earlier, Evans said. The primary job of the task force, also known as the gang unit, is to remove guns from the streets. Six officers in separate cars, sirens blaring, were involved in the traffic stop, which was captured by surveillance cameras in the area. Moynihan walked up to the driver's side door. A man started to step out. ""Without provocation, as the driver is getting out ... you can see his right arm come up point-blank and shot officer Moynihan right below the eye,"" Evans said. Evans described the officers approach as ""very low key"" and said they weren't ""even close to having their guns out."" After shooting Moynihan, the suspect ran, turned around and fired at the other officers -- emptying his .357 Magnum, according to Evans. Evans said a middle-aged woman was who driving by at the time suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. The shooter, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot and killed. Evans said West had several prior gun convictions. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. ""None of our officers like to use their firearms,"" Evans said. ""It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face."" At a news conference, Evans and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Moynihan is white; West was black. ""Our officers did what they had to do,"" the police commissioner said. The Rev. Mark Scott of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston said Moynihan was shot ""assassination-style."" He called for calm in the predominantly black Roxbury section. ""This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,'"" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. ""It's about all-the-lives-in-the-community matter and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community."" Evans said 1,071 guns were taken off the streets in Boston in 2014, with the youth violence task force and other units helping to seize more than 700. Moynihan is a decorated Army Ranger with stints in Iraq from 2005 to 2008, according to the police department. He won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014. His girlfriend and family have been at his bedside. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Bullet is successfully removed from officer's neck during several hours of surgery .

"(CNN)There is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with Iran. But for all the heat generated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress and an ill-conceived, panicky letter to Iran's leadership organized by Sen.Tom Cotton -- the latest debate is creating little light. Indeed, it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of Iran's own foreign policies -- and whether Tehran's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all. Unfortunately, few in Congress have taken the time to consider the matter in a thoughtful, coherent manner. There are, of course, certain realities that should not be in dispute: Yes, Iran is a regional adversary to a number of its Gulf neighbors and Israel. And it does aim to provoke Sunni-led Gulf states and generally to sow seeds of sectarian Islam abroad. In addition, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp's Quds force is alleged to have provided training and weapons to a range of militants -- Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen, disenfranchised Shia Muslims in Bahrain, and even to militant groups in West Africa. Most recently, Iran has been directing military operations by U.S.-equipped Iraqi forces against ISIS militants in Iraq, forces that have been aided by U.S. airstrikes. Netanyahu grasped the irony, starkly warning ""when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy."" (Although Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be confused, insisting at a March 11 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran must be unhappy with U.S. airstrikes against ISIS). Yet the question that Netanyahu did not answer, and which Sen. Cotton and his 46 colleagues have not even asked, is what exactly should be done about Iran's activities abroad? Many in Congress fail to grasp that Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and his colleagues in Iran's Cabinet, with their U.S.-PhDs and understanding of plural democracies, are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of Iran's Quds force (its commander, Qasem Suleimani turns up in Lebanon and Iraq despite a travel and asset ban).  And yes, it was the Quds force that provided the explosives and operatives that led to significant U.S. casualties in the early years of the 2003 Iraq war. To answer the question of what to do about Iran's activities, it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement, while it has little to do with Iran's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region, can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about Iran's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head-on the concerns of its Sunni neighbors, many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with Iran. The reality is that Iran's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to assert its interests in the region, and to lay out expectations of Iran as a constructive partner. It might even lead to quiet, back-channel diplomacy about the future of Syria without al-Assad. None of this is possible in the absence of the nuclear deal. Once Iran begins to navigate its relationships as more than the isolated, nuclear-threshold pariah state it currently is, there will be less tolerance internationally for destabilizing arms transfers and the training of would-be insurgents. And there is no need to rely on Iran's word that it will refrain from such activities. As U.N. Security Council resolutions are rewritten to lift the ban on uranium enrichment in Iran, the ban on Iranian arms transfers can and should remain in place, with U.N. member states required to report to the Security Council any violations of that ban by Iran. Ultimately, as important as the nuclear issue is, the real promise of a deal is only partially about limiting the country's nuclear ambitions -- it is also about returning stability to a shattered region, exhausted and impoverished by war. Iran, the United States and Gulf allies can be partners in such a process with clear eyes and no illusions about how difficult it will be. A nuclear deal is just the beginning.","Talks are continuing over Iran's nuclear program .

"(CNN)A Colorado woman whose fetus was cut from her womb in a stabbing attack last week has been released from the hospital, relatives say. Michelle Wilkins thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes on March 18 in Longmont. Instead, when she arrived at the purported seller's home, authorities say, she was attacked, beaten and her fetus was surgically removed. The baby did not survive. Dynel Lane, 34, has been held on $2 million bond as authorities weigh charges against the former nurse aide. While the attack on Wilkins has shocked her community for its brutality, many have also remarked on the 26-year-old's strength. Bleeding and stunned in a stranger's basement, Wilkins managed to lock herself in a room to prevent any further violence, called 911 and did what she could to stem the bleeding. Police officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, who responded to the call, told CNN affiliate KDVR they weren't prepared for the grisly scene. ""She was covered from head to toe in blood,"" Sawyer said. Piotrowski told the station that Wilkins ""saved her own life,"" describing her as "" probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet."" Wilkins is now out of the hospital, according to a family statement posted on their GoFundMe page, and she's ""in a safe location"" and ""surrounded by family and friends."" More than $65,000 has been raised so far.","Michelle Wilkins, 26, thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes .

"(CNN)Although much of the United States has been shivering this winter, there's been another worrying sign of warming temperatures farther north.  The cap of sea ice that spreads across the Arctic Ocean in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year, according to NASA. Not only was this year's maximum extent, reached on February 25, the smallest on the satellite record, it's also one of the earliest. Barring a late spurt of ice growth -- possible but unlikely, according to a NASA news release -- this sets a new precedent. The analysis is based on data from the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Arctic sea ice, frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas, is in a state of constant flux. It increases its area in winter, usually peaking between late February and early April, and then shrinks in the warmth of  spring and summer to reach its lowest extent in September. If this year's maximum extent, totaling 5.61 million square miles, was reached on February 25, it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of March 12, according to NSIDC. Only once before did the peak come earlier, by just one day in 1996. A peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent, reached in 2011, according to NSIDC. Scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in Arctic sea ice, a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears, seals and walruses, for over three decades. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ted Scambos, NSIDC lead scientist, puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the Pacific and a late drop in ice extent in the Barents Sea. Strong southerly winds in early March also played a role, according to NOAA. Only the Baffin Bay area and the waters around Newfoundland had more ice than normal this winter, it said. Scientists say it doesn't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer, however. While the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011, neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum, NOAA said. ""The winter maximum gives you a head start, but the minimum is so much more dependent on what happens in the summer that it seems to wash out anything that happens in the winter,"" Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is quoted as saying by NASA. ""If the summer is cool, the melt rate will slow down. And the opposite is true, too: even if you start from a fairly high point, warm summer conditions make ice melt fast. ""This was highlighted by 2012, when we had one of the later maximums on record and extent was near-normal early in the melt season, but still the 2012 minimum was by far the lowest minimum we've seen."" Meanwhile, the summer minimum ice extent reached in the Antarctic was one of the highest recorded, NOAA said. But this isn't cause for much optimism faced with evidence of a warming planet. ""Over the span of the satellite record, Arctic sea ice has been declining significantly, while sea ice in the Antarctic has increased very slightly,"" the NOAA news release said. ""Recent research demosntrates that the Antarctic gains do not balance out the Arctic losses: globally, sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades."" According to the NSIDC, sea ice in the Arctic appears to play a more important role in regulating global temperatures than that in the Antarctic.","Scientists say Arctic sea ice appears to have set a record low maximum extent this winter .
Barring an unlikely late surge in sea ice growth, the 2015 maximum is 5.61 million square miles ."
"(CNN)The president of Sierra Leone has an idea on how to curtail the spread of Ebola: Get everybody to stay inside. President Ernest Bai Koroma on Saturday launched a campaign called ""Zero Ebola,"" in which almost all Sierra Leoneans are supposed to stay indoors March 27-29 and from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on three consecutive Saturdays -- April 4, 11 and 18. ""The campaign will provide an opportunity for communities to be directly involved in the drive to zero cases, to reflect and to pray for the eradication of this disease from our country,"" he said in a statement. Sierra Leona tried a three-day lockdown last September in what was primarily an informational campaign, with volunteers going door-to-door to talk with residents about the virus. In August, the Liberian government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of Monrovia in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. The move resulted in riots. No commercial activity is supposed to occur during the upcoming lockdown, Koroma said. Because March 29 is Palm Sunday, church services will be allowed from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Health workers, journalists and public safety officers are exempted. Koroma noted that his country has made ""tremendous progress"" in the fight against the deadly disease as the Ministry of Health reported zero new infections Friday. He warned that the rate of transmissions may increase during the upcoming rainy season. ""The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone,"" he said. ""The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake."" During Sierra Leone's lockdown last year, Doctors Without Borders said such an effort is unlikely to stop the spread of the disease. ""Large-scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers,"" the charity group said in a statement. ""This is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems."" Sierra Leone has the largest number of confirmed Ebola cases -- 11,751 so far, according to the World Health Organization. WHO says Liberia has the highest number of deaths -- 4,264. So far, 10,194 have died from Ebola and 24,701 have been infected, according to WHO. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The National Institutes for Health said Thursday it will admit an American health care worker with Ebola to its Maryland hospital. The person was volunteering at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last Tuesday that 15  American aid workers who had high-risk exposure to Ebola in Sierra Leone have arrived back in the United States for monitoring. None is known to be infected with the disease. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","Sierra Leone president orders 3-day national lockdown as part of efforts to stop the spread of Ebola .

"(CNN)Notwithstanding the polls, the valiant efforts of the Obama White House, a new unity on the Israeli left and a controversial term, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party appears to have swept to victory in Tuesday's Israeli elections. For many in Israel, the election turned on domestic economic issues and on personality. Pollsters had believed that the combination of rising prices, slowing growth and a controversial leader at the helm of the incumbent Likud would finally doom the man who was looking to notch a historic fourth term as premier on his belt. Not so much. While it will likely take some time for Netanyahu to form a new government, the reverberations of his victory will be felt fast in Washington. U.S. President Barack Obama has made no secret of his antipathy toward Netanyahu, and many believe that Obama has allowed disagreements over policy to spill over into personal animosity. And while the White House allowed it would work with whoever won the Israeli elections, it seems clear whom the President would have voted for had he been allowed to cast a ballot. So what will Obama do on the issues that have increasingly divided Israel and the United States? Some believe the President will be all the more constrained in his negotiations with Iran, especially now that Israel has doubled down on the man who took to a joint meeting of Congress to publicly excoriate Obama's hoped-for deal with the Islamic Republic over its nuclear weapons program. But the stronger likelihood is that the Likud victory will spur the administration to even more concessions to ensure a deal between Tehran and Washington. This is, after all, an administration that has written off the concerns of all of Iran's neighbors (and America's allies in the region) over a weak agreement that would likely do little more than pave the way toward a nuclear weapons capability for the ayatollahs. The reality is that where Obama might have been inclined to listen to the Israeli left (which differed little with the Likud over Iran), he will find it easy to dismiss the clamoring of the Israeli right, never mind that it represents the will of the people of Israel. Then there are the negotiations with the Palestinians. Obama has never appeared personally interested in the peace process, though his administration has made repeated attempts to bring both sides to the table. But now Washington will be in an even tougher place. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has all but abandoned the notion of bilateral negotiations toward Palestinian statehood, and has brought his case instead to the international community. He has promised he will continue to pursue recognition country by country, and through the United Nations, while at the same time seeking to prosecute Israel for ""war crimes"" through the International Criminal Court. In the waning days of the election, Netanyahu made Abbas' job all the easier by reversing his earlier commitment to a Palestinian state, suggesting there would never be one on his watch. The Palestinians returned the favor, announcing that they would redouble their efforts at the ICC. This all puts Obama in a sticky spot. It will be tempting to just let the Palestinians have at Netanyahu, and the President will likely want to do just that. But what about the broader implications of allowing the International Criminal Court to proceed with accusations by a nonstate actor against a nonmember of the court, all the while insisting it has jurisdiction? Few have any doubt that if unleashed to prosecute whom it wishes by parties without legal standing (because ""Palestine"" is not, in fact, a state), ICC prosecutions of U.S. officials will not be far behind. Until last week, Obama administration policy was to try to walk back the entire ICC mess. It is in the best interests of the United States to continue that fight, but best interests are not always the prime mover behind Obama administration policies. Of course, all involved in this could also act like adults with real issues at stake -- Netanyahu and Obama could do the right things and put behind them the fuss over the speech to Congress, the personal backbiting, and the public bickering. But that would require a maturity that neither party appears to embrace, more the shame for all of us.","Benjamin Netanyahu looked set for re-election after Tuesday's poll .

"(CNN)The Pueblo Chemical Depot will begin destroying the United States' largest remaining stockpile of chemical weapons Tuesday in southern Colorado. There are 2,611 tons of World War II-era mustard agent at the Pueblo depot. Here are nine things to know about these chemical weapons and how we got here: . 1. First use: April 22 marks the 100th anniversary of the first use of chemical weapons in modern warfare at Ypres in Belgium. 2. Huge production: From World War I to 1968, the United States produced nearly 40,000 tons of chemical weapons. These weapons were either nerve agents or blister agents. 3. Scary stuff:  Mustard agent is a blister agent, which can cause skin redness and itching, eye irritation, scarring, and an increased risk for lung and respiratory cancer. 4. Into the sea: From 1967 to 1970, the U.S. Army disposed of thousands of chemical warfare agents and ammunition into the sea as part of Operation Cut Holes and Sink 'Em (CHASE). 5. No more: Congress passed a law in 1972 known as the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act prohibiting this kind of dumping. 6. Date of destruction: In 1997, the United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty and agreed to destroy all of its chemical weapons by April 29, 2012. 7. Work not done: 90% of the U.S. stockpile -- 30,500 tons -- was destroyed by the treaty date in 2012 at depots in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Oregon, Utah and Johnson Atoll in the Pacific. The remaining 10% --  close to 3,100 tons -- is at two sites in Colorado and Kentucky. 9. Don't burn it: Residents in Colorado and Kentucky protested the use of incineration to get rid of the chemical weapons stockpile. The process of neutralization was adopted. 8. Pueblo's stockpile: The Pueblo Chemical Depot has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent. 9. The last one: The Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, Kentucky, will have the remaining chemical agent stockpile, which is a fifth of the size of the one at Pueblo Chemical Depot. But the Kentucky site has a larger variety of chemical weapons, including nerve agent.","On Tuesday, the Pueblo Chemical Depot will begin to destroy the largest stockpile of chemical weapons in the U.S.

"(CNN)The national office of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity changed its tune. Just two weeks ago, the national office condemned a racist chant that resulted in the shutdown of the University of Oklahoma SAE chapter, saying, ""The national fraternity does not teach such a racist, hateful chant, and this chant is not part of any education or training."" The fraternity brothers probably ""learned the song from fellow chapter members,"" SAE said. But in a Friday statement, the SAE national office said otherwise. The OU chapter, SAE said, ""likely learned a racist chant while attending a national leadership school about four years ago."" The fraternity invites hundreds of leaders to a six-day conference every year, SAE said. ""While attendees have little social time, there are occasions when participants can gather socially,"" the statement said. ""[Executive Director Blaine] Ayers said it is likely that during one of these social gatherings, some members shared the racist song that was recorded on video at the University of Oklahoma and shared through social media earlier this month."" Ayers said the organization has no evidence the chant is widespread across the fraternity's 237 groups. ""Our investigation to date shows no evidence the song was widely shared across the broader organization,"" Ayers said. ""The song is horrific and does not at all reflect our values as an organization."" But OU President David Boren, in revealing details of the university investigation on Friday, said the chant was an integral part of life in the local chapter. ""Over time the chant was formalized in the local SAE chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal leadership process,"" he said. ""It is clear that during the four years since the chant was brought to the university campus, its existence was known by recent members and ... it became part of the institutionalized culture of the chapter."" Boren said ""alcohol was readily available at the fraternity house"" on March 7 and some chapter members were drinking. He also said about a dozen high school students had been invited to the event and ""were exposed to the chant."" The chant was discovered by the school newspaper and a student organization, which received the video clip via anonymous messages. The video shows party-bound students on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant, ""There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE."" The university cut ties with Sigma Alpha Epsilon after the video surfaced, as did the national fraternity, and both launched investigations. The university has disciplined fraternity members with punishment ranging from permanent withdrawals to sensitivity training. Fraternity officers have issued apologies. SAE issued questions-and-answers about the controversy, noting the fraternity plans to hire a director of diversity and inclusion. About 20% of SAE members self-identify as a minority or non-Caucasian, SAE said.","Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national office issues a statement about racist chant .

"(CNN)A Connecticut 17-year-old who was forced to undergo nearly six months of chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma is in remission, her attorney said Monday. ""Cassandra C.,"" as she is identified in court papers, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September. Medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. After her diagnosis, the young woman and her mother missed follow-up appointments, prompting the hospital to contact the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. They were concerned it was a case of medical neglect. After an investigation, the department requested temporary custody of Cassandra. She was removed from her mother's home and placed with a relative. A judge then allowed her to return home under the supervision of Department of Children and Families on  condition  she agree to complete the recommended treatment. After two days of chemotherapy in November, Cassandra ran away for a week, according to court documents. When she returned home she said she wanted to discontinue the treatment. Her mother, Jackie Fortin, who said she is opposed to chemotherapy, said her daughter didn't want the treatment because she did not want to put the ""poison"" in her body. In December, a judge returned Cassandra to the custody of Department of Children and Families after hearing testimony from her attorney. She was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Now, she has just two treatments left, according to her state appointed attorney, Josh Michtom, who said she is feeling well and she is in good shape as far as her health is concerned. ""She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad and she's been well treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,"" he said. In January, he and an attorney for Cassandra's mother failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decision. In a statement emailed to CNN on Monday, Department of Children and Families Commissioner Joette Katz said, ""We are very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life."" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. Michtom said he will return to juvenile court next week to try to persuade a judge that Cassandra should be returned to her mother's custody. He will argue she is no longer in imminent risk of harm from her illness and that she wants to complete her treatment. According to Michtom, Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk. In the meantime, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. ""The hospital is effectively jail,"" Michtom said.","Cassandra C in remission after nearly 6 months of forced chemo for Hodgkin lymphoma .

""You are still in power, you have 650 million Internet users, you have billions of dollars of economic value going to the Internet everyday, you've used the Internet to increase government transparency, investors love us and they can't throw enough money at our companies that have more than half a trillion dollars in market capitalization,"" says Bishop. Soon after China tip-toed onto the Internet in the late 1980s, it laid down the foundation of the Great Firewall but critics asserted that an Internet with Chinese characteristics would be no Internet at all. During a high-profile media tour in Beijing in 1999, MIT Media Lab founder and technology pundit Nicholas Negroponte declared that a ""healthy disrespect for authority"" was required for any successful Internet industry. A year later, then-U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that ""liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem"" and that any attempt to control the Internet in China would be ""like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall."" Well folks, it's now 2015 and China has done the impossible. It's nailed the Jell-O. China has proven it can have its Great Firewall and enjoy great prosperity too. Lokman Tsui, associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and former head of free expression at Google Asia-Pacific, says that most Chinese are happy with the status quo. ""Their lives have noticeably improved,"" he says. ""The model has worked so far."" Currently home to the world's largest Internet market, China is also home to some of the world's most valuable Internet companies including e-commerce giant Alibaba and Tencent, now estimated to be worth $66.1 billion. The government has fostered the development of the Internet by offering incentives for local entrepreneurs while building walls to keep big Western rivals out. The ban on Western social media sites like YouTube and Facebook has also given home court advantage to China's own Internet stars like Youku and WeChat. And contrary to Negroponte's declaration, respecting the strict rules that govern China's Internet has not gotten in the way of innovation as Chinese tech developers reinterpret existing business models and build out new mobile apps. ""I haven't really come across anybody who would say that yes, because we don't have a free Internet, therefore we can't innovate,"" says Bishop. ""From Beijing's perspective, there's this fear that if we open up the Internet then it will be chaos. So if the cost is good-enough or almost-good-enough innovation... it seems like a pretty straight forward equation from the perspective of the policymakers."" And there are signs the Great Firewall is expanding its reach. Last week, the Chinese and English news websites of Reuters news agency became inaccessible in China, joining a number of foreign media destinations that are barred online in China. There have been ways to get around it. Through VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, web users in China can access restricted content. But in a recent crackdown, the Chinese government is shutting down VPNs -- Beijing's latest move to shore up its cyber-authority. ""You can filter out keywords, you can filter by URL, you can block or poison DNS (domain name system), and increasingly now they identify VPNs,"" says Tsui. ""The problem is that it's decided on a national level by the government,"" he adds. ""It's this attitude that 'father knows best.'"" And that ""father"" would be Lu Wei, the so-called Internet czar of China who was recently photographed smiling at Mark Zuckerberg's desk during a visit at Facebook's headquarters in California. ""Lu Wei is really pushing this 'Internet sovereignty' model, where we can control the information, we can control the Internet within our borders and we will use our model,"" says Roseann Rife, the East Asia research director of Amnesty International. ""More than that, the Chinese authorities are pushing this as a model for the globe and they are going to get a lot of acceptance or buy-in from a lot of different countries."" Amnesty International fears the Great Firewall could become the next great export from China. ""It would be a very attractive model for instance for Russia, for Egypt, or for other states,"" Rife says. ""It would be obviously in China's interest for other people and other nation states to agree with them and their interpretation of Internet sovereignty."" And instead of backing away, Western onlookers may be nodding their heads in agreement.  Last year, the U.S.-based LinkedIn decided to censor some content on its Chinese site. And fear is mounting that Zuckerberg's recent charm offensive with Lu Wei reflects Facebook's desire to do whatever it takes to crack the China market. So would global Internet users rise up against a Facebook that censors its posts and monitors its users to comply with local laws in China? It's unlikely, says Bishop. ""I actually think most users don't care."" ""At the end of the day, they're not going to give up Facebook because Facebook is operating differently in China."" A Facebook that fits the firewall, and fortune at the expense of freedom. That is precisely China's vision of how the Internet should be.","China's ""Great Firewall"" is a massive Internet surveillance and content control system .
Critics said it would stifle business but now Chinese Internet companies are worth billions .

"(CNN)Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch will read a specially-written poem at the ""funeral"" of Richard III, the King found buried beneath a parking lot -- his own distant relative. Oscar-nominated Cumberbatch, who is to star as Richard III in an upcoming TV adaptation, will read a verse penned for the service by Britain's poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. The 14-line verse, titled simply ""Richard,"" will remain a closely-guarded secret until the service of reinterment at Leicester Cathedral on Thursday. All the organizers will say is that it is a ""meditation on the impact of [Richard's] finding and on the legacy of his story."" They also have revealed that it contains the phrase ""grant me the carving of my name,"" recognizing that Richard III's grave was lost for centuries, with no tombstone to mark its location. In a statement, Duffy said it was ""a privilege to be involved, in a small way"" in the farewell to Richard, the last English King to die in battle, 530 years ago. Cumberbatch's reading will form part of a service of reinterment for the medieval monarch, which will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Key figures in the rediscovery and identification of the royal remains, including historians, archaeologists, scientists and relatives are expected to attend, along with members of the public who won a ballot for tickets. Queen Elizabeth II has written a message to be included in the order of service for the event, at which she will be represented by the Countess of Wessex. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Leicester and its surrounding villages as Richard III's coffin was carried out to the site of the Battle of Bosworth, where he was killed in 1485, and back in a procession. Since then, people have queued around the block to see it lying ""in repose"" in the cathedral where it will be reinterred in a tomb made of pale Swaledale fossil limestone from Yorkshire, set on a plinth of black Kilkenny marble. Richard III's remains were found in August 2012 by archaeologists searching for the remains of the Greyfriars Monastery, which had been covered over by a council car park. The skeleton has been studied at the University of Leicester ever since, allowing scientists to discover a host of details about Richard III's life -- and death -- by analyzing the bones. The university's genealogy expert, Kevin Shurer, has discovered that Cumberbatch is related to Richard III. ""Benedict is Richard III's second cousin, 16 removed,"" Shurer explained. ""He is linked in several ways, but ... the shortest is via Richard's mother, Cecily Neville's grandmother, Joan Beaufort. He also has more indirect links to both Queen Elizabeth II and Lady Jane Grey through other ancestors in his [family] tree. ""It is great that Benedict has the opportunity to take part in the ceremony ... having him there will add another dimension to what has already been a momentous week."" Shurer also helped confirm the link between the last Plantagenet King and living relatives Michael Ibsen and Wendy Duldig, whose DNA proved the identity of Richard III's remains.

"(CNN)The family of an unarmed biracial 19-year-old killed by police in Madison, Wisconsin, is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets. ""Our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew, and we are all left to deal with the aftermath,"" Turin Carter, the teen's uncle, told reporters on Monday. Carter stressed that his family wasn't anti-police, but said Tony Robinson's death ""highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males."" But he said the problem goes beyond the chants of ""black lives matter"" that have already been used at protests over the case. ""I encourage everybody to show support regardless of race because this is truly a universal issue. ... We don't want to stop at just 'black lives matter,' because all lives matter,"" he said. The deadly confrontation has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests. Here's what we know about the Friday night shooting. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Tony Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later, the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends. No weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Officer Matt Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Koval said it's understandable why protesters are outraged. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used,"" he said. A neighbor in the duplex said she heard it all happen. Two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex, and Robinson was their friend, Kathy Bufton said. ""I heard rustling and things being knocked over and my kitchen ceiling actually kind of shook. ... I figured something was going on,"" she said. ""I heard somebody go down the stairs. And then I heard the shots."" There were 4-6 shots fired, Bufton said. For the family, that's a horrifying reality. ""It takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life. It takes one bullet,"" Carter said Monday. ""And we know how many were fired."" This isn't the first time Kenny used lethal force. In 2007, he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a ""suicide by cop."" Kenny was exonerated of wrongdoing and received a commendation. During the confrontation Friday night, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. ""It's a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation,"" said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. ""The real fear for any officer when he's being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away,"" Palmer said, ""and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly."" Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. His mother, Andrea Irwin, painted a different picture of the teen: ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she told CNN affiliate WKOW. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" The police chief refused to comment on Robinson's criminal history or run-ins with police. ""I could but I choose not to,"" he said at a press conference Saturday. ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his."" On Monday, Robinson's uncle told reporters his nephew wasn't a saint and had made some poor decisions, but was still a ""good, kindhearted kid."" ""We paint him as a human being, a 19-year-old who made a terrible mistake at one point, which is completely dissociated from this act,"" he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, who said he met with Robinson's family the night of the shooting, said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial. ""That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" ""We know that he was not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned ... the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy."" Because Robinson did not have a weapon, the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: ""Black lives matter."" Asked the difference between Ferguson and Madison, Carter said Monday the cases are ""similar, but different,"" noting that his nephew's ""racial ambiguity"" was an important part of his identity. ""Tony's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that America's racial lines are completely, 100% blurred,"" he said. ""My sister is a white mother of black children who had black and white relatives. We are all multiple races and we each have our own complex heritage."" Among the protesters are members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. ""In light of so many things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" Chief Koval told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he knows it may be difficult for Madison to move forward after Robinson's death. He visited the teen's grandmother over the weekend but was advised by them to not visit the mother yet because the emotions are still too raw. ""We need to start, as any healing or any reconciliation should, with an 'Im sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years, if at all, to mend,"" the police chief said. ""But the effort has to be there. So we have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring the community back into the fold, as it were."" CNN's Rosa Flores, Gary Tuchman, Brianna Keilar, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Uncle: The shooting highlights ""systematic targeting of young black males""

"(CNN)Iraqi forces battling to wrest Tikrit from ISIS are now in control of the city, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Tuesday on Iraqiya TV. Al-Abadi, who is also the top military commander, said on state television that the city was liberated. While al-Abadi has declared victory in the battle, pockets of fighting continues. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias are taking part in clearing operations. Iraqi forces reached the center of Tikrit and hoisted the nation's flag on top of the Governorate Building, al-Abadi said. Fighting continued on the outskirts of the city, he added. Tikrit had been under ISIS control since June. The push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS targets around the city. The airstrikes made it possible for the Iraqi forces to move through the city. Troops reported finding dozens of roadside bombs and booby-trapped buildings as they combed the city. At a Cabinet meeting before he declared Tikrit liberated, al-Abadi was already calling the operation a success. ""The success of the Tikrit experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield, on a humanitarian level, protecting civilians as much as possible, in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces,"" he said. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate but failed until now. This operation, however, was the biggest by the Iraqi military so far. ""We managed to take (ISIS) by surprise,"" the Prime Minister said. ""And our air force ... in addition to coalition air force, helping Iraqi forces, managed to deal severe blows to ISIS and the enemies of Iraq. And our ground forces with the blood of Iraqis, Iraqis alone with their own blood,  were able to liberate this land."" The latest push began after al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and is located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. The Iraqi forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly Shiite militiamen and volunteers. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first very overt participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize: Mosul. Mosul is Iraq's second-biggest city and the site of one of its military's biggest embarrassments, when Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May and, ideally, win it back. This comment came days after al-Abadi told the BBC that while there's still work to do, he felt confident Iraqis could recapture the key northern city. CNN's Arwa Damon, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Jason Hanna and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","ISIS still has some fighters in Tikrit; joint forces are in clearing operations .

"San Rafael, California (CNN)At 74 years old, Marilyn Price still remembers the first time she rode a bike. ""My father let go of my seat, and there I was on my own,"" she said. Years later, Price realized the power of biking to change lives. During a 1982 mountain biking trip in northern California, Price reached a point on the trail where she could see all of San Francisco. Looking out at the city, she thought of the children she met while volunteering at a soup kitchen there. And it hit her: She wanted to give them the same experience. ""There's nothing like biking up a mountain and looking behind you to see all you've accomplished,"" she said. Price has since helped more than 25,000 at-risk children from the San Francisco Bay Area get off urban streets and into nature through her nonprofit, Trips for Kids. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . In addition to mountain bike excursions, the group provides bike mechanic training and the chance for young people to earn credit toward their own bikes. Today, Trips for Kids has expanded to 90 chapters around the world, serving more than 15,000 children each year. See more CNN Heroes . CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Price about the impact of her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: For many of the young people in your program, this is their first time on a mountain bike. How do they react? Marilyn Price: Many of them have never really left the city. To them, life is automobiles and buildings. Everything is concrete. But you bring them where there are no buildings, no cars, it is like, ""Wow!  I didn't know that this exists."" I think we're planting a seed that there are alternatives to getting into trouble. They can get on a bike and go to a place that is very much unlike where they live and do something positive. It's giving them the notion that there is something else. CNN: And their experience goes beyond bike trips. What else do you offer? Price: The second is our Earn-a-Bike program, where kids in the community come after school. They learn bike mechanics, and while they're participating they are earning credit. They can use it to buy bikes or parts. They're buying bikes for themselves, for their parents or siblings. I just love the idea of having them work toward a goal. They're really learning skills that will help them in the future. The third (program) is our bike thrift shop, where anyone in the community can come shop for a discounted bike. We call it Trips for Kids Re-Cyclery. All of the bikes and bike gear are donated. It provides 60% of what we need to run our programs. And it is 100% an environmental program. We follow the three 'Rs' very rigorously: reduce, reuse and then recycle! CNN: Trips For Kids has grown well beyond San Francisco. Why do you think this model works so well? Price: It's easy to use the bike to introduce kids to the environment because the bike is universally loved by children. The bike allows us to introduce them to a healthy lifestyle and good work habits. (It's) a tool to impart these life lessons. Right now there are 90 chapters, literally around the world, that are repeating our experiences. They all do bike rides and then some of them, as they get more developed like we did, also start their own Earn-a-Bike programs or their own bike thrift shops to support themselves. CNN: Did you ever imagine your simple idea would have such an impact? Price: I wear my Trips For Kids T-shirt wherever I go. I went into the bank one day here in Marin County, and there was a young girl who was the teller. She looked at my T-shirt, and she said, ""Wow -- you're with Trips For Kids? That was the best experience I've ever had. I will never forget it."" I don't know how many stories there are like that, but it's planting that seed. I just love every minute of it. Seeing the results of what we were accomplishing just had me stick with it. Since I started the notion, I haven't given up and hope to continue forever.

"(CNN)Four years ago I was laughed out of the room when I said to a group of friends: ""Pretty soon guys are going to decide their lives are more important than playing in the NFL. And they are going to stop playing."" My friends accused me of going soft, being an elitist, being overly PC. Today, I'm certain they are not saying those things about the talented 49er linebacker Chris Borland, the latest NFLer to quit. He's 24 years old and the first player to retire directly because he wanted to avoid the traumatic brain injuries that have been linked to playing football. Borland played just one NFL season. ""I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,"" he told ESPN's ""Outside the Lines."" ""From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk."" He added: ""I just thought to myself, 'What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?' "" His teammate, Pro Bowl linebacker Patrick Willis, made the decision to walk away last week, and you can't help but think his decision might have influenced Borland. Willis says he isn't really sure what he'll do next, but he knows he won't play another game in the National Football League. Although fans around the globe are begging the 30-year-old, seven-time Pro Bowler to ""unretire,"" Willis said his nagging foot and ankle injuries, and a desire for a happy life are why he walked away. ""I have no regrets,"" said a tearful Willis in his press conference last week. ""I gave this game everything I had and I am truly blessed. ... Honestly, I pay attention to guys when they're finished playing, walking around like they've got no hips and they can't play with their kids. They can barely walk. ""People see that and they feel sorry,"" Willis said. ""But they don't realize it's because he played a few extra years."" Willis, who has a degree in criminology from Ole Miss, is a wise man. And while many sports fans are in shock that any guy lucky enough to play in the NFL would just walk away from fame and wealth, it sounds to me like Willis has his priorities right. It's refreshing. And Willis is not alone. At a time of year when most football fans are consumed by trade rumors and free agency moves, several other high-profile players have decided to hang up their cleats. And what's surprising is how young they are: . At 27, Steelers linebacker Jason Worilds was soon to step into the crazy world of free agency, where he was sure to be in demand by many teams. It looked like he was just about to get his huge payday. But instead, he's leaving the game. Unlike Willis, Worilds hadn't been plagued by injuries, at least not yet. And he'd only missed one game in the past three seasons. So why did he leave? He wants to do other things, he said. Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker, 26, announced he's also retiring after just four seasons. Another Pro Bowler who had been haunted by injuries, running back Maurice Jones-Drew, 29, called it quits in Oakland recently. He lasted nine years. Young, intelligent and charismatic, ""MJD"" was adored by fans until, like so many other elite players, he was slowed down by injuries. Jones-Drew, whom I worked with a lot when he was starting out in the league, is a smart and personable guy. It was clear when I met him that he was talented enough to succeed at anything he pursued. ""Football has been a central part of my life for the past 24 years,"" Jones-Drew wrote when announcing his retirement on Twitter. ""But now I'm excited about and looking forward to the next chapter of my life."" Who knows, maybe MJD is the next Michael Strahan? That former New York Giant's successful exit from football has inspired so many younger players. Strahan's path has empowered others to value themselves beyond football. Every season, I get calls from NFLers who want my help finding a career after football. ""How do I do what Mike did; that's what I want to do,"" they say. Once dubbed the ""sack master,"" Strahan has transformed himself into such a daytime TV media darling you would think he was born to co-host ABC's ""Live With Kelly & Michael."" But even he had to decide when to quit the game before it got the best of him. It took 15 years. I will never forget how hobbled Strahan looked one early morning when an ESPN crew showed up at his door to do a ""day-in-life"" story on his off day. Bruised and still bloody that morning, he could barely get out of bed. Usually loquacious, he had trouble even talking because his swollen jaw was locked shut. He couldn't even brush his teeth properly. Shave? Forget it: hands too gnarly. And it was clear he had a severe migraine working his brain. There were very few laughs that day. Strahan was barely 30 then, and he looked like a defeated, old man. Now, every time I see him smiling for the cameras, I think how blessed he is to be healthy and enjoying his life after football. So maybe there is another way out for young players who are now better informed about the dangers of the game. Just maybe all the debates about the ugly side of football -- concussions, brain injuries, depression and suicides-- have done some good, after all. Today, a guy like Patrick Willis can walk away from the game a happy man: . ""If I want to go fishing tomorrow, I'm going to go fishing. ... If I want to go home and watch my little brother play baseball, I can go to do that. ... Life is amazing right now.""","Roxanne Jones: Several NFL players just beginning their careers, including Chris Borland, are walking away .

"Rome (CNN)Italy's highest court Friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of American Amanda Knox, according to Judge Gennaro Marasca. The high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, or send the case back for another appeal, or potentially on to a different section of the court. Knox, a 27-year-old Seattle native, and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of Knox's British roommate, Meredith Kercher. Knox and Kercher lived together in Italy at the time of Kercher's death. Sollecito and Knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal, and then Knox returned to the United States. However, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the acquittals in 2013, and they were convicted last year after a retrial. If a new trial is ordered, Knox and Sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached. But if the court upholds the conviction, the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to Knox next is uncertain. Conventional wisdom dictates that Knox will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the Italian Justice Ministry to serve her 28-year sentence, but that could take years. The statute of limitations is double the sentence, meaning the Italians have 57 years to bring her back to the country. Knox, however, would benefit from the United States' extradition treaty with Italy -- under which the United States will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the U.S. Constitution's protection against double jeopardy. Sollecito, on the other hand, still lives in Italy, and has a lot more to lose than Knox does, at least in the short term. He would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25-year sentence. All of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail. Sollecito earlier said he would be in court on Wednesday to face the judge. ""I've been living this for eight years,"" he told the Italian crime TV program ""Quarto Grado."" Not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway."" Rudy Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was convicted separately in a fast-track trial and is midway through a 16-year sentence for Kercher's murder. His case was confirmed by Italy's high court in 2010. Many commentators in the U.S. have reasoned that Italy may not ask the United States for Knox's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations. But there could be a greater rift if it appears that Knox gets away with murder and her Italian ex-boyfriend pays for the crime. If Sollecito is languishing in prison and Knox is sipping Frappuccino in a Seattle Starbucks, Italians will not be pleased, says Alessandro Capponi, an Italian journalist for Corriere Della Sera who has been covering the case since Kercher was killed in 2007. ""It will be seen as an injustice,"" Capponi told CNN. ""You may not see people out on the streets, but if you ask 10 people what they think, those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the Italian and the African are in prison. The Italians will say that the American gets away with murder and it won't be the first time."" This is not the first time Italy and the United States have butted heads on matters involving American suspects accused of crimes in Italy. In 1998, an American Marine aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the Dolomites, sending 20 people plummeting to their death. Even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight, only two of the four Marines were charged and convicted. Only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six-month sentence. In 2012, Italy's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 Americans (22 CIA agents and an Air Force pilot) for the kidnapping of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar, a suspeced terrorist, from a street in Milan. They were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison, but Italy has not yet asked for extradition. ""Our relationship with the United States is full of these diplomatic tensions,"" said Capponi. ""This will just be added to the list."" Knox's case has been divisive from the start, and her supporters have come down hard on the Italian judicial system. Sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude, knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not, so vocally criticizing it wouldn't be in his best interest. In fact, he has long suffered the impact of Knox's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized Italy from the other side of the Atlantic. By almost any Italian precedent, Sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because Knox was deemed a flight risk, she had to stay in jail. Because Sollecito was her co-defendant, he did too, even though he had no ties to anyone abroad. ""Knox could still beat the system, but Sollecito's game is up if the convictions are upheld,"" Nicola Canestrini, an Italian extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems, told CNN. ""He has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them, which will likely cause deep resentment here in Italy."" Perhaps a little too late, Sollecito's defense team has been slowly inching away from Knox, especially since the latest conviction. Last summer, he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court, in which his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno pointed out ""certain anomalies"" in Knox's testimony that have nothing to do with Sollecito. ""We ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of Amanda's testimony to Raffaele,"" Bongiorno said at the time. Whether that is enough to get the high court to give Sollecito another, independent chance is yet to be seen. ""I am not a crazy person. I am not a criminal. I am innocent,"" Sollecito told reporters last summer at the press conference. ""But my name is Raffaele Sollecito, not Amanda Marie Knox."" Now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference.

"(CNN)Authorities at Sydney Airport stopped two Australian teenagers who were suspected of trying to leave the country to join ISIS. The brothers, aged 16 and 17, raised suspicion when they attempted to pass through customs, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Sunday. ""What we have here are two teenagers who have been intercepted on their way to a potentially very dangerous situation,"" Dutton said. The teenagers had return tickets to unnamed ""conflict zones"" in the Middle East, and a luggage search heightened suspicions that they were headed abroad to fight. The boys were later released into the custody of their parents, who were said to have no idea of their intentions. ""These two young men...are kids, not killers,"" Dutton said, who added the matter had been referred to the  Australian Federal Police. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the brothers were Australian citizens who had been lured by a ""death cult."" ""These were two misguided young Australians, Australian born and bred, who went to school here, grew up here, imbibed our values, and yet it seems they had succumbed to the lure of the death cult and they were on the verge of doing something terrible and dangerous."" The prime minister spoke directly to other susceptible Australians who were considering leaving to fight abroad. ""My message to anyone who is listening to the death cult is block your ears. Don't even begin to think you can leave Australia,"" he added. Australia estimates there are at least 90 citizens fighting and supporting terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. Last month, the government announced plans to suspend or revoke citizenship for dual nationals involved in terrorism, and also strip certain privileges from Australian citizens who break anti-terror laws.","Authorities stopped two teenage brothers at Sydney Airport who were suspected of trying to join ISIS .

"Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines. In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it. Luckily, the ancient city of Babylon is outside the extremists' grasp, south of Baghdad. For nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there. They bear his name and describe him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who had the reputation of being ancient Babylon's greatest king. One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city. But it continues to be source of great pride for Iraqis who see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization. And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. ""This wasn't Saddam's,"" said Adnan Abu Fatima. ""It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians."" Abu Fatima strolled through the ruins with his family. Saddam's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him, but ISIS' destruction appalls him. ""The Mosul museum was destroyed. Why?"" he wants to know from ISIS. ""That is the heritage of your grandfathers. Why did you do that?"" The defacers' reasoning? The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the ""age of ignorance,"" ISIS says, before the advent of Islam. Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity. History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart. They've had to watch since the U.S. invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen. Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world. The U.S. State Department has announced it will return more than 60 items on Monday, which had been sneaked into the United States. Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them. Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum. ""When I saw what happened, I was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from ISIS,"" he said. Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department. ""Babylon is our soul."" It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers. The military has started a drive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from the extremists. After the rage of a battle subsided, they moved in to the outskirt town of Awja to find the former dictator's tomb flattened. Video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to YouTube. They celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor. One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site. It was a piece of history they were glad to part with. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported and wrote from Babylon, and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","ISIS has ransacked museums, bulldozed ancient cities, destroying human history .

"(Travel + Leisure)Quick, imagine a castle: it probably looks a lot like Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle, the turreted inspiration for Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Each year, more than 1.5 million travelers are inspired to make the steep walk or catch a horse-drawn carriage to reach this castle perched on a rocky outcropping in the Bavarian countryside. ""People have always been interested in celebrities and powerful people and their homes,"" says Cordula Mauss, PR officer for the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces. ""Immediately after the death of Ludwig II in 1886, the first tourists came and wanted to see what their king had built as his private residence."" While castles, palaces and châteaux naturally pique such curiosity, not all have Neuschwanstein's European fairy-tale looks. Some of the world's most-visited palaces, found across Asia, feature red exteriors, pagodas, gates and carvings. Consider Bangkok's gold-spired Grand Palace, where Thai kings lived for 150 years, and where 8 million annual visitors now traipse through ornate rooms, manicured gardens and temples, including one that houses a revered Buddha carved from a single block of jade. Travel + Leisure: See more of the world's most visited castles . Some longtime royal residences have been repurposed as museums. St. Petersburg's riverfront Winter Palace, for instance, is the sixth-most-visited castle, thanks to the appeal of masterworks by Titian and da Vinci along with lavish restored interiors, where Catherine the Great once held court. America's closest approximation is California's Hearst Castle, though it fell short of Travel + Leisure's top 20 list with only 750,000 annual visitors. And while Windsor Castle squeaked in at No. 19, Buckingham Palace didn't make the grade (567,613 annual visitors), nor did Romania's Bran Castle (542,000) or a single Irish castle. Ireland's most visited, Blarney Castle, received 365,000 in 2013. That said, there can be a downside to having too many visitors -- these are delicate, historic structures that have existed for hundreds of years, and some, like Neuschwanstein, limit daily entries. But it's hard to stem curiosity when it comes to the lives of the blue-blooded. As Mauss puts it: ""Who didn't want to be a prince or a princess or at least a knight when he or she was a child?"" The Methodology: To tally up the world's most-visited castles, T+L gathered the most recent data supplied by the attractions themselves or from government agencies, industry reports and reputable media outlets. In most cases, it was 2013 data. Here are the top 10: . No. 1 The Forbidden City (Palace Museum), BeijingAnnual Visitors: 15,340,000 . Each day, tens of thousands of visitors pour through the Forbidden City to see the 178-acre walled compound that once shielded the Imperial Palace from public view -- while housing Chinese emperors and their extensive entourages. (To handle the volume, the government has started requiring advance ticket sales during festivals and holidays and prohibiting annual ticket holders from visiting during peak seasons). Bright red buildings topped with golden pagodas exemplify traditional Chinese architecture, while the Palace Museum showcases art, furniture and calligraphy. Source: China National Tourist Office . No. 2 The Louvre, Paris Annual Visitors: 9,334,0000 . The largest and most famous museum in the world -- displaying masterpieces like La Gioconda (the Mona Lisa) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace -- got its start as a palace. The U-shaped Louvre housed generations of French kings and emperors beginning in the 12th century, and the remnants of the original fortress that occupied the site (built for King Philippe II in 1190) can be seen in the basement of the museum. The building was extended and renovated many times. Head to the decorative arts wing for a glimpse of Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie's opulent state apartments, built between 1854 and 1861. Source: Atout France, the France Tourism Development Agency . No. 3 Grand Palace, BangkokAnnual Visitors: 8,000,000 . Royal offices are still used within the Grand Palace, and state visits and royal ceremonies like the Royal Birthday Anniversary of the current King Bhumibol Adulyadej are held there each year. This was also the official residence of Thai kings from 1782 to 1925 and counts numerous buildings, halls and pavilions set around open lawns and manicured gardens. The palace's Temple of the Emerald Buddha is considered one of the most sacred sites in Thailand. Its Buddha was carved from a single block of jade, and his garments, made of pure gold, are changed in a royal ceremony three times a year to reflect the Thai seasons. Source: Thailand Tourist Services . No. 4 Palace of Versailles, FranceAnnual Visitors: 7,527,122 . When Louis XIV built Versailles in the late 1600s, it became the envy of other European monarchs in Europe, and the opulent estate retains an unmistakable allure. Versailles gets seven times the visitors of any other château in France (apart from the Louvre); it helps that it's easily accessible from Paris. No other palace in the world can match the grandeur of Versailles's Hall of Mirrors, dripping with chandeliers, and Marie Antoinette's bedroom, decorated with hand-stitched flowers. The vast grounds are free most days and an attraction in themselves, with 50 water fountains, a parterre (formal garden), a grand canal and other sites like the Grand Trianon, built for Louis XIV as a refuge from court life, and Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon. Source: Versailles Press Office . No. 5 Topkapi Palace, IstanbulAnnual Visitors: 3,335,000 . With a lovely setting overlooking the Bosporus and Sea of Marmara, Topkapi Palace was the royal residence for about 400 years until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s. The sultan lived with his wives, concubines, mother and children in the harem, under the fierce protection of eunuchs. Look for the Privy Chamber of Murat III, with its indoor pool, gilded fireplace and walls decorated with blue, white and coral Iznik tiles from the 16th century. The Palace Kitchens reopened in September 2014, displaying fine china and large cookware. And the complex also includes courtyards, gazebos, gardens and the Imperial Treasury. An emerald-and diamond-studded bow and quivers sent by Sultan Mahmud I to the ruler of Persia is just one example of the lavish gifts on view. Source: Go Turkey, Official Tourism Portal of Turkey . No. 6 The Winter Palace (State Hermitage Museum), St. Petersburg, Russia Annual Visitors: 3,120,170 . Catherine the Great and Nicholas I are among the Russian royals who occupied this green-and-white baroque palace along the Neva River from 1762 to 1917. Today, the palace is a museum with one of the finest collections in Europe, including works by Titian, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci (Benois Madonna). Much of the palace was destroyed by fire in 1837, but the beautifully restored interiors speak to the opulent tastes of the Russian elite. St. George Hall (a large throne room) features two tiers of windows, double Corinthian pink marble columns, patterned parquet floors and gilt bronze details.

This medieval fortress on the north bank of the River Thames was built to intimidate Londoners and keep out foreign invaders. The oldest part of the structure, the White Tower, dates back to the 12th century. While it originally served as a royal residence, the tower has become notorious for its use as a prison and the site of executions that included Henry VI and Lady Jane Grey. Millions flock to the tower today to see historical reenactments as well as the British Crown Jewels, among them, the Sovereign's Sceptre containing the Great Star of Africa, the largest colorless cut diamond in the world. In 2014, the tower's moat was filled with 888,246 ceramic red poppies in remembrance of British soldiers who died in World War II -- an example of art installations and events held regularly.

Austria's most-visited site is this Rococo palace, a summer retreat for Hapsburg emperors from the 1700s until 1918. Of the 1,441 rooms, the most famous is the Mirror Room, with white and gold Rococo decoration and crystal mirrors, where Mozart is said to have performed his first concert at age six. The palace's elaborate gardens can claim the world's longest orangerie and the site of the first zoo (est. 1752). The guided Grand Tour provides access to all 40 rooms open to the public, including the Gobelin Salon with tapestries from Brussels and the Millions Room, an office paneled in rare rosewood. Source: Schönbrunn Palace . No. 9 Alhambra y Generalife, Granada, SpainAnnual Visitors: 2,315,017 . Refined and expanded over centuries, this hilltop palace and fortress complex combines fortifications, gardens, churches and several palaces, notably the Alhambra, and the Generalife, the country estate of the kings of Granada and Andalusia. Both are remarkable examples of Islamic architecture from Spain's medieval period. Expect intricate arabesques, honeycomb vaunted ceilings (muqarnas) and courtyards with pools and fountains. Generalife's Moorish gardens feature large boxwood trees, rosebushes and willows and cypresses. Numbers swell in the spring and summer; to beat the crowds, consider a January visit. Source: Communications Office of the Alhambra and Generalife . No. 10 Shuri Castle, Okinawa, JapanAnnual Visitors: 1,753,000 . Shuri Castle was the seat of the kings of Ryukyu for more than 400 years. The castle was completely destroyed during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, and reconstruction work was only completed in the early 1990s. The results include eight Chinese-style gates or entrances, plus gardens, a study and a main hall with red-colored tiles on two layered roofs. The three-story red building houses two throne rooms and the royal family's private apartments. Ponds, bridges and miniature islands make up the royal gardens, added in 1799.

"(CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made news this week when he told CNN's Dana Bash that he would get his health care through Obamacare. Previously, Cruz's family was covered under his wife's policy through her employer, the investment bank Goldman Sachs. But with her husband's presidential candidacy underway, Heidi Cruz has taken a leave without pay. So she has lost her Goldman Sachs health benefits. The story went viral, in part because Cruz once engineered a partial government shutdown to try to kill Obamacare. As part of his crusade, Cruz conducted a 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor, during which he read Dr. Seuss' classic ""Green Eggs and Ham."" Spoiler alert: ""Green Eggs and Ham"" ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it. Now that Cruz is likely to try Obamacare, my guess is he will have a similar experience. So, with apologies to Dr. Seuss -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme ""President Bar"" with ""Obamacare"" -- here is my updated version of ""Green Eggs and Ham."" President BarPresident BarI do not likethat President Bar . Do you likeObamacare? I do not like it,President Bar.I do not likeObamacare. Would you like ithere or there?

"(CNN)Around the world, parents are navigating deep, uncharted emotional waters after a young man decided to leave a band. Yes, Zayn Malik has quit One Direction. For parents bewildered by the sudden outpouring of grief, here are a few facts to use as anchors in the sea of despair. Malik left the band. He didn't die. He wasn't thrown out. He quit, because he's young and didn't want to do it any more. ""I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight,"" he said in a statement posted on the band's Facebook page. Sound fair enough? In the world of One Direction fans, ABSOLUTELY NOT! A few more facts for emotional ballast: The band is staying together. The other four will continue to tour and make records and even work on their fifth album this year, the statement said. So, now that the facts are out there, how do parents cope with what may seem to be a completely over-the-top irrational response to a small change in line-up? Never, ever, underestimate the depths of adolescent emotion. ""Teenagers are wired to feel emotional and to feel almost obsessive about things, and passionate and impulsive. So it makes sense biologically that they are this entrenched in 1D,"" says Dannielle Miller, an author and teen girl educator. After the loss of Malik, Miller says many teenagers are coping with a sense of loss they've never felt before. To them, it is real, and incredibly painful. ""The last thing you want to do as a parent is to just think it's silly and to laugh at your child if she's really upset about this because her feelings will be very real to her,"" Miller says. (Or him, as the case may be). ""If you choose to laugh at her or tease her about it, then she's not going to tell you when she's grieving about other things in her life that she's really struggling with."" Arm yourself with some tissues and take a step back, advises child psychologist Dr. Louise Porter. ""A parent's job is to understand that they're sad, even if we don't understand why. If we think it's an over-the-top reaction for the circumstances, that doesn't matter,"" says Porter. She advises against trying to placate and console. ""You don't need to console, you don't need to give advice. There was a famous communicator by the name of Marshall Rosenberg who said 'don't just do something, stand there.' They just need us to hear the message that says 'you're sad.'"" There's some scary stuff out there, not least the Twitter hashtag #cut4zayn or #cutforzayn. Fans are posting images of slashed arms, as a sign of devotion or warped attempt to pressure Zayn to change his mind. In one instance, a user posted a photo that appeared to show the bloodied words ""I LOVE ZAYN"" etched on his or her arm. There's a precedent, Miller says. In 2013, a similar hashtag started that urged fans to ""cut for Bieber,"" after reports that singer Justin Bieber was caught smoking marijuana. ""A lot of those pictures were since proven to be hoaxes, so a similar thing could be happening here now,"" Miller says. ""But regardless, the reality is lots of teen girls do think that these pictures are real and are sharing them."" Miller says seeing images of self-harm could encourage vulnerable girls to do the same. ""As a parent it's really concerning because images of people self-harming can be quite triggering,"" she says. Look for signs of self-harm. Your child might start wearing clothes that deliberately cover their arms and legs, or become especially withdrawn. Miller advises parents to ask the children outright: Are you hurting yourself? ""There's nothing wrong with being quite direct about it,"" she says. ""Early intervention is always great because then she needs to learn a healthier way of dealing with stress."" The Internet is awash with melodrama on the issue of Zayn and what next for One Direction. Girls are sobbing on Vine videos, while on Twitter fans are competing to express the extent of their grief. Experts say it's not necessarily a good idea to slap an outright ban on the Internet, no matter how strongly you feel about its negative influence. ""The parent needs to ask the child is it better to be on the net or is it better to be off?"" say Porter. ""It's better to distance yourself from it at times when it's feeling overwhelming, and dip back into it as you need to, to touch base with other people."" Miller advises clearly explaining to the child why it would be better not to log on. ""Explain why, don't get cross at them. They're not doing anything wrong. They're grieving with what they see as their tribe."" But she adds: ""What you're seeing on there is a feeding frenzy of grief which really isn't helpful."" She suggests offering to replay a One Direction concert, or if the pain is still too raw, go for a walk or do something else. The good news for parents is that the trauma should subside after a couple of days. And if it takes longer? ""You don't want to rush children but if it's going on for a couple of days, you might say, ""passively coping and just being sad probably isn't going to work for you in this or in life in general so what can you do to make yourself feel better,"" Porter says. Miller says for many teens, the partial break-up of One Direction signals an end of an era. But she says if the grieving goes on for longer than a couple of days it may be advisable to talk further and perhaps seek external help. Right now, grieving One Direction fans may not want to hear it, but for parents Malik's departure offers a great opportunity to teach an important life lesson. ""This is quite a nice introduction to grief,"" says Porter, pointing out that the vast majority of Malik's fans don't know their idol. And after all, he hasn't died. Miller agrees. ""For parents, this is an incredible opportunity to show your child how to be more resilient."" ""In doing this now, in what is really distant from them, then you're giving them a wonderful scaffold to fall back on when in the real world someone leaves them or breaks their heart. We all need to learn that skill,"" she says. Look for the silver lining. Miller says Malik has set a great example for his fans by choosing his personal happiness over fame, success and money. ""That's something they should admire him for,"" Miller says. She suggests asking your child to tell you what other positive outcomes might come from this. A brilliant solo career? A happier Zayn? 1. Encourage teens to have a good cry. 2. Encourage them to self-talk themselves through this. ""He hasn't died. So what might happen to Zayn next? What could happen to the band next. Could there be a great solo album out of this? Get them thinking in a more positive frame of mind,"" Miller says. 3. Get them moving. ""Sitting in their room on the computer watching other kids cut themselves and talk about the end of the world is not helpful."" 4. Encourage them to share how they're feeling with you and to be honest with you so you can check that they're coping. 5. Encourage them to not spend too much time online. And through all that remember, in the wise words of Malik: ""It was 5 great years.""","Zayn Malik is leaving One Direction to be a ""normal 22-year old""

"(CNN)Well, I'll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525's final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it's not likely. As an airline pilot, I'm taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears -- terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions -- how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I'll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings co-pilot is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of stress-related troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don't fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it's as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ""no"" to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and shape-orientation problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we'd heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline's doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to self-disclose the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression. If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system by hiding things from it, but by every indication, this rarely occurs. The consequence for deception is having your FAA pilot's license suspended. When it comes to experiencing stress, airline pilots are no different than anyone else. But we tend to deal with stress internally. I have been trained as a peer support volunteer in critical-incident stress management, a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight. The idea is to mitigate any post-traumatic stress associated with such an event, and occasionally the process would uncover personal issues that would be referred to other support providers, like mental health professionals. I have found that my colleagues demonstrate an above-average ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance ... most of the time, of course. If personal issues invade the cockpit, mechanisms are in place to assist. What mechanisms? At my airline, both the company and the pilot's union work in unison. Programs to assist a pilot experiencing problems are just a phone call away. And if there is concern about a colleague's mental health, we can contact one of these programs on the other pilot's behalf, anonymously if necessary. In some circumstances a pilot can be removed from duty. At every recurrent training period, the curriculum includes a presentation reminding us of these mechanisms. No system is perfect. Yes, as with all human systems, somebody will fall through the cracks. Even a good psychiatrist can miss an impending suicide. Redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another Germanwings co-pilot is out there seems like an overreaction. If passengers require reassurance of my sanity, then it would be best to more actively promote the mechanisms already in place. We can start with education. As I fly back from London today, I am certain that the Gulf War Air Force hero beside me, who dealt with enemy missiles and raising a family, will do nothing other than an exemplary job. I am honored to call him my co-pilot.","Les Abend: Fliers should know that Germanwings crash is anomaly; airlines have procedures for vetting pilots' fitness .

"(CNN)Three teenagers from northwest London were released on bail Sunday after their alleged plans to travel to Syria led to their arrest. Two 17-year-olds boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested ""on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,"" the Metropolitan Police said. The investigation started on Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials on Friday, and that night, the individuals landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped, along with another person who had been regarded as suspicious by Turkish intelligence working at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three arrived back in London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. ""When we have intelligence shared with us there is no problem. We stop them and directly deport them. And of course Turkish intelligence is always on the lookout as well,"" the Turkish official said. Turkey on Thursday arrested a person who worked for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service on suspicion of helping the girls, according to Turkey's foreign minister. On Friday, a Turkish television network aired a video purportedly showing the girls preparing to cross the Turkish border into Syria. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Arwa Damon and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Three teens were released on bail in London, where they face terror charges .

"(CNN)For years, Native Americans have called on Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team's name. It's a dictionary-defined racial slur that's dehumanizing to Native Americans. And, in my view, that outweighs the arguments of Redskins advocates who defend the name as a symbol of team pride. But what about the thousands of high schools across the United States that have the name as its mascot? Where do they fit in the debate? Once you factor in freedom of speech, how should one approach this issue? Recently, in upstate New York, the Lancaster Central District School Board unanimously voted to retire its high school's mascot and moniker -- the ""Redskins."" The board called the mascot ""a symbol of ethnic stereotyping"" and said the school ""cannot continue practices which are offensive and hurtful to others"" -- namely Native Americans. Some students opposed the board's decision citing school legacy and tradition. A group of Lancaster High students hosted a walk out in protest with many carrying placards reading, ""Redskins Pride"" and ""Once a Redskin, Always a Redskin."" Coincidentally, around the same time in Delaware, the Conrad Schools of Science announced it will begin to take steps to drop its ""Redskins"" mascot before the beginning of the 2015-16 school year. Local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated Native American mascots. Furthermore, there's research that shows Indian mascots and monikers harm the mental health of Native American youths. According to one study, Native American students are reported to have low self-esteem and a suppressed sense of self-worth as a consequence of such images and language. Other research shows how all ethnic groups are hurt by poor representations of Native Americans. People ""are more likely to negatively stereotype other ethnic groups as well,"" according to Wendy Quinton, clinical assistant professor of psychology at the University at Buffalo. What the Conrad Schools of Science and the Lancaster school board decisions represent for Native Americans are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group. Still, there's the issue of free speech. Many have made the argument that Native Americans like me are trampling on the First Amendment when we call for the Washington football team to change its name. Even the ACLU has chimed in on the matter. On March 6, the organization said in a blog it does not support the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decision to cancel federal trademark protection of the Washington football team's use of the word ""redskins."" In June of last year, the USPTO had repealed six of the team's seven trademarks, finding the r-word is ""disparaging to Native Americans."" Although the ACLU agrees the team name is ""offensive and perpetuates racism against Native Americans,"" it cannot support what it refers to as language policing. ""... Because the First Amendment protects against government interference in private speech,"" staff attorney Esha Bhandari wrote. ""It isn't government's role to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable and which are not."" Here's the thing, folks -- no one has a First Amendment right to federal trademark protection. Tara Houska, a tribal rights attorney in Washington, said, ""Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. In contrast, federal trademark protection is a privilege that one applies for at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office."" I think the ACLU is confusing rights with privileges. The U.S. government isn't telling the Washington football team it can't use the word. According to the USPTO, Snyder and his ilk can keep using the team name -- he just won't have federal trademark protection. Last month, Democratic Rep. Mike Honda of California filed a bill that would ban existing and future teams that use the word from receiving federal trademark protection. He told me he's ""disappointed"" that the ACLU would defend the Washington team, which he refers to as ""a multi-billion dollar company profiting off a racial slur."" ""The First Amendment is not the issue here -- no one, including the football team, would be prohibited from using the name,"" he wrote in an email. ""The team would only lose their exclusive rights to it."" And in the case of Lancaster High Schools, the government didn't step in -- the decision to retire the name was made by conscientious objectors in the community. Let's look at the issue from another angle. What do we do as responsible adults when we learn a habit or tradition is adversely affecting our children? We do everything we can to fix the problem. What we do not do is make excuses so we can continue the terrible habit. As the late Maya Angelou so aptly put it, ""Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better."" America needs to do better as a whole with regard to Native Americans. This isn't just about Indian mascots. This isn't just about offensive racial slurs. This is about the dehumanization of Native Americans. And if history has shown us anything, it's that when one group dehumanizes another, bad things happen. Honda's bill, the USPTO's repeal and the Lancaster school board's decision are not examples of anti-free speech madness. They are acting like responsible adults in defense of children who are at risk. And as for me, I'll protect children first before I protect anyone's right to harm them.","Recently, schools are deciding to retire the term 'redskins' for their mascots .

"Jerusalem (CNN)Israel did not spy on closed-door talks over Iran's nuclear program involving the United States and other world powers, an Israeli official said Tuesday, denying a Wall Street Journal report. The newspaper reported late Monday on its website that Israel had obtained confidential information about the negotiations to help it argue against a potential deal. ""These allegations are utterly false,"" the senior official in the Israeli Prime Minister's office told CNN. ""The state of Israel does not conduct espionage against the United States or Israel's other allies."" The Israeli government's use of the information it allegedly gleaned -- sharing it with U.S. lawmakers and others to undercut support for a deal -- was what really angered the White House, the Journal reported Monday, citing current and former U.S. officials. ""It is one thing for the U.S. and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy,"" a senior U.S. official briefed on the matter said, according to the newspaper. The Israeli espionage efforts included eavesdropping and also acquiring information from confidential U.S. briefings, informants and diplomatic contacts in Europe, the report says. The senior Israeli official told CNN that ""the false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the United States and Israel and the security and intelligence relationship we share."" That's not to say Israeli officials haven't been asking around about the Iran nuclear talks, as participating parties race to get a framework agreement ahead of a March 31 deadline. Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz and Yossi Cohen, Netanyahu's national security adviser, led an Israeli delegation that met early this week with a negotiating team from France, Israeli Intelligence Ministry spokesman Eyal Basson said. The same Israeli officials left France on Tuesday morning for the United Kingdom to meet with Britain's delegation on the Iran nuclear talks, according to Basson. Both France and Britain are among the Western powers in the P5+1, a group that also includes the United States, Russia, China and Germany, whose representatives have been across the table from Iran. While in Paris, the Israeli delegation did not meet with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal. The Israeli officials' apparent aim in France was not  to ""influence Paris' position in the negotiations, but to further develop the debate on the Iran nuclear talks,"" according to Nadal. Netanyahu himself has been clear on where he stands on this debate: He told the U.S. Congress earlier this month that a proposed agreement, as he depicted it, was ""a bad deal."" The Israeli leader predicted that not only would such a deal not stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it would ""all but guarantee that Iran gets (nuclear) weapons, lots of them."" ""This deal won't be a farewell to arms; it would be a farewell to arms control,"" Netanyahu said. ""And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires."" Iranian officials have said they want a nuclear program for peaceful energy purposes. And they also want an end to the crippling sanctions which the United States and others have instituted to pressure Tehran. U.S. officials have long insisted their goal is to make sure that Iran doesn't develop nuclear weapons. But U.S. President Barack Obama's administration also has been open to talks -- and felt undermined by some moves by Netanyahu, who appears poised to remain Israel's prime minister after an election last week. In particular, Netanyahu's speech to Congress stoked long simmering tensions with Obama, not least because it was organized by House Speaker John Boehner without the White House's prior knowledge. Some questioned where Netanyahu got his information on a proposed nuclear deal, particularly at a point when negotiations were in flux with no agreement in place. According to the Wall Street Journal report, the sharing of sensitive information about the talks took place before Netanyahu's address. It describes efforts by Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer to lobby U.S. lawmakers before an interim agreement with Iran in November 2013 and briefings by Dermer and other Israeli officials in the early months of this year. But a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington, Aaron Sagui, told the Journal that ""Ambassador Dermer never shared confidential intelligence information with members of Congress."" CNN's Oren Liebermann reported from Jerusalem, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Greg Botelho and Laura Akhoun contributed to this report.","Israeli intelligence minister met with French delegation, his spokesman says .

"London (CNN)The BBC producer allegedly struck by Jeremy Clarkson will not press charges against the ""Top Gear"" host, his lawyer said Friday. Clarkson, who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world, was dropped by the BBC Wednesday after an internal investigation by the British broadcaster found he had subjected producer Oisin Tymon ""to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack."" Tymon went to a hospital emergency department to receive treatment for a split lip following the March 4 incident at a hotel in North Yorkshire, it said. North Yorkshire police said they had asked the BBC for a copy of the report and would assess whether further police action needed to be taken. ""No one who was present at the hotel during the incident came forward to report an offense to the police. Nonetheless, we have a duty to investigate where we believe an offense might have been committed, and that is what we have been doing with this case,"" police said in a statement Thursday. ""As is usual in these circumstances, we have made contact with Mr Tymon through his lawyers, to ask him to speak to us so we can ascertain how he wishes to pursue this matter."" Tymon issued a statement through his lawyer Friday saying he had informed police he did not want to press charges. ""The events of the last few weeks have been extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. The matter has taken a great toll on Oisin, his family and his friends,"" lawyer Paul Daniels said. ""Quite simply, Mr Tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the BBC he loves, as soon as possible. Further, the BBC have, in his view, taken action with a view to addressing the issues at hand. ""Mr Tymon agrees with the BBC's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on, so far as possible."" Tymon had earlier said he was grateful to the BBC for their ""thorough and swift investigation into this very regrettable incident."" ""I've worked on Top Gear for almost a decade, a program I love. Over that time Jeremy and I had a positive and successful working relationship, making some landmark projects together. He is a unique talent and I am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way,"" he said. Clarkson was suspended on March 10 after what the BBC initially described as the ""fracas"" with Tymon. Ken MacQuarrie, who conducted the internal investigation into the incident, said Tymon had been struck ""resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip."" The physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness, MacQuarrie said, but Clarkson continued to use ""derogatory and abusive language"" for a sustained period of time. MacQuarrie said Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to BBC management. Announcing Wednesday that Clarkson's contract would not be renewed, BBC Director General Tony Hall said a ""line had been crossed."" ""A member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature. For me a line has been crossed,"" he said. ""I know how popular the program is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion."" In 2013, Guinness World Records named ""Top Gear"" the world's most widely watched factual program, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show --  fronted by Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond -- is sold to 214 territories worldwide. Local versions have been made in the United States, China, Russia, Australia and South Korea. After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to ""I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear."" On Wednesday, the wording became past tense: ""I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear."" Co-host Richard Hammond tweeted: ""Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together."" On Friday James May also tweeted, saying: ""I've written some blues lyrics: Oh I woke up this morning, And ... #Still Unemployed."" Fans had earlier expressed outrage at the BBC decision to suspend Clarkson. An online petition to have Clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people. Fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired. Last week, a fan dressed as the ""Stig"" -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the BBC's London headquarters in an armored tank to present the ""Bring Back Clarkson"" petition. Clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times. While Clarkson's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers, his on- and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense. Last year, he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that wasn't aired. ""I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,"" Clarkson said in video statement posted online. He's been accused on other occasions of racism, including characterizing Mexicans as ""lazy and feckless"" and using the word ""slope"" over footage of an Asian man crossing a bridge during a ""Top Gear"" special in Myanmar. Producer Andy Wilman later apologized, calling it a ""light-hearted word play joke,"" and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to Asians. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. A CNN reporter who was at the event said Clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC had ""f**ked themselves"" and had ruined a great show. Clarkson later brushed off the incident, saying the rant was meant ""in jest"" and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the ""Top Gear"" race track.","Producer Oisin Tymon will not press charges against Jeremy Clarkson, his lawyer says .

"(CNN)Computer hacking was once the realm of curious teenagers. It's now the arena of government spies, professional thieves and soldiers of fortune. Today, it's all about the money. That's why Chinese hackers broke into Lockheed Martin and stole the blueprints to the trillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet. It's also why Russian hackers have sneaked into Western oil and gas companies for years. The stakes are higher, too. In 2010, hackers slipped a ""digital bomb"" into the Nasdaq that nearly sabotaged the stock market. In 2012, Iran ruined 30,000 computers at Saudi oil producer Aramco. And think of the immense (and yet undisclosed) damage from North Korea's cyberattack on Sony Pictures last year. Computers were destroyed, executives' embarrassing emails were exposed, and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos. It wasn't always this way. Hacking actually has some pretty innocent and harmless beginnings. The whole concept of ""hacking"" sprouted from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology nearly 50 years ago. Computer science students there borrowed the term from a group of model train enthusiasts who ""hacked"" electric train tracks and switches in 1969 to improve performance. These new hackers were already figuring out how to alter computer software and hardware to speed it up, even as the scientists at AT&T Bell Labs were developing UNIX, one of the world's first major operating systems. Hacking became the art of figuring out unique solutions. It takes an insatiable curiosity about how things work; hackers wanted to make technology work better, or differently. They were not inherently good or bad, just clever. In that sense, the first generation of true hackers were ""phreakers,"" a bunch of American punks who toyed with the nation's telephone system. In 1971, they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high-pitched tone, 2600-hertz, you could access AT&T's long-distance switching system. They would make international phone calls, just for the fun of it, to explore how the telephone network was set up. This was low-fi stuff. The most famous phreaker, John Draper (aka ""Cap'n Crunch) earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone. This trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom ""blue box"" to make those free calls. This surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs started building and selling it themselves. These are the guys who would later go on to start Apple. Wire fraud spiked, and the FBI cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes. The laws didn't quite fit, though. Kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like. But federal agents couldn't halt this phenomenon. A tech-savvy, inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born. The next generation came in the early 1980s, as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network. The Web wasn't yet alive, but computers could still talk to one another. This was the golden age of hacking. These curious kids tapped into whatever computer system they could find just to explore. Some broke into computer networks at companies. Others told printers at hospitals hundreds of miles away to just spit out paper. And the first digital hangouts came into being. Hackers met on text-only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking, share computer passwords and tips. The 1983 movie ""War Games"" depicted this very thing, only the implications were disastrous. In it, a teenager in Washington state accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war. It's no surprise, then, that the FBI was on high alert that year, and arrested six teenagers in Milwaukee -- who called themselves the 414s, after their area code -- when they tapped into the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear weapon research facility. Nationwide fears led the U.S. Congress to pass the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986. Breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own. The damage of hacking started getting more serious, too. In 1988, the government's ARPAnet, the earliest version of the Internet, got jammed when a Cornell University graduate student, curious about the network's size, created a self-replicating software worm that multiplied too quickly. The next year, a few German hackers working for the Russian KGB were caught breaking into the Pentagon. In 1990, hacker Kevin Poulsen rigged a Los Angeles radio station's phone system to win a Porsche, only to be arrested afterward. The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s. Some hacked for money. Russian mathematician Vladimir Levin was caught stealing $10 million from Citibank. Others did it for revenge. Tim Lloyd wiped the computers at Omega Engineering in New Jersey after he was fired. But hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating, though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there. The stock market, hospitals, credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now. There was a bone-chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves L0pht testified before Congress in 1998 and said they could shut down the Internet in 30 minutes. The danger was suddenly more real than ever. The ethos was starting to change, too. Previously, hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible. The Web changed that, putting all that stuff at everyone's fingertips. Money became the driving force behind hacks, said C. Thomas, a member of L0pht who is known internationally as the hacker ""Space Rogue."" An unpatched bug in Windows could let a hacker enter a bank, or a foreign government office. Mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point. A totally different kind of black market started to grow. The best proof came in 2003, when Microsoft started offering a $5 million bounty on hackers attacking Windows. ""It's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks. It's about dollars,"" Thomas said. ""Researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed. Now, they say, 'I'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government.' "" Loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well-paid, trained professionals. By the mid-2000s, hacking belonged to organized crime, governments and hacktivists. First, crime: Hackers around the world wrote malicious software (malware) to hijack tens of thousands of computers, using their processing power to generate spam. They wrote banking trojans to steal website login credentials. Hacking payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative, too. Albert Gonzalez's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company TJX in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches, like Target, Home Depot and many more. Then there's government. When the United States wanted to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program in 2009, it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen. Stuxnet caused the Iranian lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control. This was unprecedented: a digital strike with extreme physical consequences. Similarly, there's proof that Russia used hackers to coordinate its attack on Georgia during a five-day war in 2008, taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities. Then there are hacktivists. The populist group Anonymous hacks into police departments to expose officer brutality and floods banks with garbage Internet traffic. A vigilante known as ""The Jester"" takes down Islamic jihadist websites. What exists now is a tricky world. The White House gets hacked. Was it the Russian government or Russian nationalists acting on their own? Or freelance agents paid by the government? In the digital realm, attribution is extremely difficult. Meanwhile, it's easier than ever to become a hacker. Digital weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online. Anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software. And there are high-paying jobs in defending companies like Google or JPMorgan Chase -- or attacking them. As a result, law enforcement tolerance for hacking has fallen to zero. In 1999, the hacker Space Rogue exposed how FAO Schwarz's website was leaking consumer email addresses and forced the company to fix it. He was cheered. When Andrew Auernheimer (known as ""weev"") did the same thing to AT&T in 2010, he spent more than a year in prison until his case was overturned on a technicality. The days of mere curiosity are over.","The concept of ""hacking"" began nearly 50 years ago at MIT .

"(CNN)Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was hiding an illness from his employers and had been declared ""unfit to work"" by a doctor, according to German authorities investigating what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable pilot to steer his jetliner into a French mountain. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been ""slashed."" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently 17 days ago, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they'll be able to reveal just what they found in the records in Lubitz's apartment in a quiet, suburban neighborhood. They found no goodbye note or confession, authorities said. But the fact that investigators found ""ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,"" prosecutors said. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment  Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. According to authorities in Germany and France, Lubitz was a co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf on Tuesday when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. An 8-minute descent to death . Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remained the focus of investigators in Germany. Officials said Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Reuters reported that a German newspaper said Lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago. Citing internal documents forwarded by Lufthansa to German authorities, Bild reported that Lubitz had suffered a ""serious depressive episode"" around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009, Reuters reported. The Bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment.  Lufthansa officials and German prosecutors declined to comment on the Bild story, Reuters said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN. Dangerous and windy condition at the remote site, which covers more than a square mile, are hampering efforts to recover bodies and evidence, he said. Officials with experience traversing the French Alps are helping technicians who don't have alpine skills, he said. ""Since they don't know the mountains, you need to provide them with equipment, you need to hold them with rope, give them crampons so they can work well and as precisely as possible, so that no evidence, no body part could escape their vigilance,"" Naffrechoux said. Workers are now looking into the possibility of building a road to the site, Naffrechoux said. Recovery teams have made good progress, a French senior paramilitary police official told CNN. Gendarmerie Lt. Col. Jean-Paul Bloy, who is coordinating the helicopter operations for the crash site, said there will be two aircraft deployed over the scene Saturday. There were five on Friday, Bloy said. As that difficult work continued, relatives and friends of the victims traveled on Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished. They held prayers in Le Vernet, near Seyne-les-Alpes, a village serving as a staging post for the recovery operation. Flowers and pictures sat on the ground, candles flickering in the cold air. Germanwings said it was setting up a family assistance center in Marseille, France, with family briefings to start Saturday. Another flight carrying victims' relatives was due to arrive in Marseille from Barcelona on Friday. ""Our focus in these darkest hours is to provide psychological assistance to the families and friends of the victims,"" said Thomas Winkelmann, a spokesman for the Germanwings executive board. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. Meanwhile, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation that cockpits always be staffed by at least two crew members. ""While we are still mourning the victims, all our efforts focus on improving the safety and security of passengers and crews,"" the agency's director, Patrick Ky, said in a statement. Lufthansa and other German airlines have already adopted the rule, the airline said. An official with the German Aviation Association told CNN that it was only a matter of hours, or a day at most, for this rule to be implemented across all big German airlines.

"(CNN)Today, Katie Meyler might be meeting with Google executives or maybe giving a talk at the United Nations about girls' education, poverty or Ebola. But just a few months ago, she was on the front lines fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. ""I think anybody that has any feelings for the countries in West Africa that were hit was feeling helpless,"" Meyler said. Meyler had spent the last nine years of her life in Liberia setting up the More Than Me Academy, a tuition-free school for at-risk Liberian girls. While she was on summer break last year, visiting her family in the United States, her mind kept going back to Liberia and the Ebola outbreak. She couldn't sit idle as her neighbors, friends and students were fighting for their lives. Meyler, who is not a medical professional, flew back to the front lines of a global epidemic, the last place most Americans wanted to be during the outbreak. Back in Liberia, Meyler quickly realized that fighting Ebola would be more complicated than administering medical care. With dozens of aid organizations descending on the country, few of them had a history or relationship with it. Meyler saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of West Point, the slum in which her school is located. Her ability to speak the Liberian-English dialect facilitated logistics. ""The people knew what was needed,"" Meyler said. ""They knew what to do. They just didn't have the resources."" Her organization met with community leaders and they decided more ambulances were needed. In some instances, it took up to four days for an ambulance to show up. Meyler was able to bring in four ambulances and coordinate with the fathers of her students, who responded to calls by driving the ambulances. Meyler and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs, said Meyler. Next, they formed a group of active case finders, people who would go door to door in the poorest parts of West Point, looking for anyone that had fallen ill. Once a sick person was identified, a nursing team was dispatched to determine the next steps and treatment. The hardest part for Meyler, who often describes herself as a ""big kid,"" was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by Ebola. According to UNICEF, 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Meyler's school turned one of its guesthouses into Hope 21, a place to quarantine children suspected of having the Ebola virus. During the good times and the bad, Meyler took to Instagram to post photos and her thoughts. For nearly 100,000 of her followers, her Instagram became a window into the battle against Ebola. Social media have played a major role in the success of Meyler's organization since its inception nine years ago. To launch More Than Me, she did everything from fund-raising on MySpace to participating in clinical research studies. In 2012, the group was awarded a $1 million grant from JPMorgan Chase's American Giving Awards, after Facebook users voted for the organization. Long before Meyler became an Ebola fighter, she grew up in a working-class family from New Jersey. She always felt underprivileged, until she became involved in community service. That's when she decided to dedicate her life to helping people. Meyler has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in Liberia. She was one of the Ebola fighters honored as Time's Person of the Year in 2014. ""I'm not the same person that I was before Ebola hit,"" said Meyler. Reflecting on the months she spent fighting Ebola, she said, ""The people on the front lines that were risking their lives were the people who were fighting for their own lives, who were fighting for their children's lives."" Now it is about learning to live with Ebola, said Meyler, whose school has dozens of students who are Ebola orphans and survivors. Meyler continues to focus on girls and education in Liberia, meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at More Than Me.","Meyler worked with the community in Liberian slum to develop Ebola response .

"(CNN)One of the two University of Oklahoma students expelled for their role in leading a racist chant has issued an apology, The Dallas Morning News reported. ""I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless. I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,"" Parker Rice said in a statement printed by the newspaper. Earlier Tuesday, Rice and another student were expelled over their alleged ""leadership role"" in a racist chant by Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members, a decision that President David Boren says speaks to his school's ""zero tolerance"" policy for such ""threatening racist behavior."" The decision comes two days after a video of frat members singing a racist song surfaced and hours after Boren told CNN he would suspend or expel the group's ringleaders if at all possible. ""At this point, all I can do is be thoughtful and prayerful about my next steps, but I am also concerned about the fraternity friends still on campus. Apparently, they are feeling unsafe and some have been harassed by others. Hopefully, the university will protect them,"" Rice reportedly said in his apology. Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. Fraternity's house mom sings n-word . Rice has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment. ""For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again. My goal for the long-term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever I see or experience it in the future,"" his apology read. It was only a nine-second clip, but the backlash has been disastrous. Party-bound students are seen on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant, ""There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE."" After the campus organization, Unheard, and the school newspaper received the clip via anonymous messages and publicized it, the university and the fraternity's national chapter acted swiftly to shutter the SAE house in Norman. Boren promised the university's affiliation with the fraternity was done. ""I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,"" said Brad Cohen, the fraternity's national president. ""SAE is a diverse organization, and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior."" Still, it could get worse. Oklahoma may not be the only source of embarrassment for the fraternity. ""Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,"" SAE said. It's likely that if the university hadn't acted, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division could have stepped in, said Barbara Arnwine, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ""prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance,"" according to the Justice Department. In this case, Arnwine said, the university likely found that fraternity members appear not only to have discriminated in their membership -- and backed that discrimination with the threat of lynching -- but they've also created a hostile environment. The university, she said, ""would've been compelled to do something to sanction and prevent this fraternity from engaging in racial discrimination."" Arnwine said she wasn't personally familiar with the school's code of conduct, but she'd be surprised if the fraternity members' actions weren't in violation of university rules as well. All of these reasons are grounds to sanction the fraternity and expel specific members who were involved in the singing, she said. ""A very important part of the lexicon of civil rights law is that you cannot create a hostile environment where you make it so people of different races or religions or women feel they can't function at your institution without being subjected to unlawful discrimination,"" she said. It's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video, though Boren has promised the SAEs won't return during his tenure if he can help it. ""The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,"" he said at a Monday news conference. He later told CNN, ""There seems to be a culture in some of these fraternities, and it just has to be snuffed out."" The decision to shutter the fraternity was an easy one for Boren, he said. ""If we're ever going to snuff this out in the whole country, let alone on college campuses, we're going to have to have zero tolerance, and we have to act right away,"" said Boren, a former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator. ""This is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it, so I think you have to send a very strong signal."" Hundreds of students have protested the fraternity's actions. Some of them arrived Monday morning on the campus' North Oval with tape over their mouths, while the Oklahoma football team and Coach Bob Stoops marched arm in arm across campus instead of practicing. The video infuriated Oklahoma linebacker Eric Striker, who posted a profanity-laced video to social media. ""I was angry and I was outraged,"" Striker said. ""I apologize for the profanity, but I'm not apologizing about how I felt, because that's how I felt in my heart."" The fallout from the video also cost the football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. Just as they protested loudly Monday, students on Tuesday were emphatic in expressing their relief and satisfaction that those allegedly responsible for leading the racist chant got their due. Ross Johnson, a senior studying drama and broadcast media, called the video embarrassing and unacceptable as he worried that it may be seen as a reflection on him in the future. ""It sucks that I'm graduating in May. I feel I am probably going to have to explain this when I move,"" he said. ""For people who don't know the University of Oklahoma, aren't part of the student body, it's a black eye that doesn't really deserve to be there. It's a small group of people who were acting foolishly."" Another student, junior Jake Hewitt, applauded the university and the fraternity's national president for their handling of the incident. ""I think it's really good that the president is showing strong support for the students in the community here and saying, 'This is not OK. It's not going to be acceptable on our campus.' It's a good strong move, and I hope if they find out more, they do more,"" he said. Shortly after the expulsions were announced, senior Omar Humphrey, an African-American modern dance student, told CNN, ""I think it's rightfully so that they were (kicked out). ... That needed to happen. It wasn't  fair; it wasn't right. I am, as most of the student body -- not just the African-American students -- we're all disheartened by the situation. It's just really hard to think that this is still going on today, and I'm still deeply saddened."" He is still a ""proud student,"" he said, and he understands that the fraternity members in question represent ""just some microbial infestation that's on campus. It's  on every campus, it's on every campus. It's unfortunate that we have to be seen in that light."" Asked what he could say to the fraternity members if given the chance, Humphrey replied, ""I pray for their humanity. I hope that they find maturity. ... I wish them well. "" Unheard co-director Chelsea Davis said a racist mentality is not new to campus and is not confined to one fraternity. ""Unfortunately, it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen, but this is definitely not something that is brand-new. It's not something that's only seen within this one organization,"" she said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend, as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved. ""I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day, people that I see every day, could say such hateful things about me and my culture, about my friends, about my brothers and my sisters,"" she said. William Bruce James II, who was a member of the frat between 2001 and 2005, called the episode ""devastating"" -- not just because he's an Oklahoma alumnus but also because he's African-American. James told CNN that there was ""never an inkling of this song or a whisper of anything like this"" when he lived in the house. He said members of his pledge class ""wouldn't let that happen,"" and if someone did dare to start such a chant they'd swiftly speak out and shut it down ""whether I was there or not."" Since the video surfaced, James said he's heard from many of his former fraternity brothers. Like him, they're offended and supportive of the decision to shutter the Norman chapter. ""I don't know what happened to the culture of my home,"" he said. ""That is not my home. That is not SAE. They are not my brothers."" Opinion: Are frats 'a form of American apartheid'? CNN's Brian Carberry, Chuck Johnston, Nick Valencia, John Couwels, Greg Botelho and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","""It was wrong and reckless. I made a horrible mistake,"" says Parker Rice .

"(CNN)Why is this Passover different than other Passovers? Because you may not have any gefilte fish at your table on Passover, which starts at sundown on April 3. February's record cold temperatures are to blame for the shortage of fish ingredients, reported Erica Marcus, a food writer at Newsday, the Long Island, New York, newspaper. ""The traditional Passover appetizer is made from ground whitefish, carp and yellow pike,"" Marcus wrote. ""All three are freshwater fish from the Upper Midwest, and all three are in short supply this spring because the Great Lakes are still covered with ice."" While some restaurants reported having no supply issues, it may be a different story for the home cook. There's great debate within the Jewish community about the flavor of the classic gefilte fish dish, which isn't always the tastiest food at the table. ""I've never seen what all the fuss is about,"" Marcus told CNN. ""It's about as challenging a taste as tuna fish salad."" The fishing boats just can't sail or fish on frozen lakes. Many of the Great Lakes are still partially frozen over, according to fisheries expert Ronald Kinnunen, an educator with Michigan State University's Sea Grant Extension Program. ""Nobody's getting their fishing boats out,""  Kinnunen said. ""I'm looking at the satellite images and Lake Superior's half covered in ice,"" he said. It's still iced over at the Mackinac Bridge, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan come together at the Straits of Mackinac, he added. Blame an early Passover this year. Next year, it will likely be better for fishing. Passover doesn't start until sunset on April 22, much later in the month. The fish dish is not a religious requirement of the Seder dinner, but don't try telling that to cooks searching for the right ingredients for their classic recipes. If your mother or other host is mourning not having the dish at the table this year, offer to make chicken Kotletky or another offering from CNN Eatocracy's list of Passover recipes from around the world.","Cold temperatures are to blame for limited supply of freshwater fish .

"London (CNN)Captive Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko has sent a stark message to Russian President Vladimir Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail. In a letter from prison, written in response to questions from CNN, she said: ""If Putin wants to defeat Ukraine -- let's try to defeat me first!"" ""But if he wants peace and friendship between our nations as he claims,"" she added, ""I am ready to make the first step towards it. ""My freedom will be that first step towards peace and understanding in Ukraine."" Savchenko has been held by the Russian authorities in pre-trial detention since last June. Her defiant message was written after CNN submitted a series of questions to the Ukrainian fighter pilot through one of her lawyers, Mark Feygin. We do not know under what circumstances Savchenko answered the questions, but Feygin says she wrote the responses on Friday as he was visiting her. Savchenko undertook a hunger strike for 83 days to protest her detention despite pleas from her family and her lawyers. She recently abandoned her fast after nearing death but has since resumed it, only drinking broth and milk occasionally to stay alive. Russia claims the 33-year-old is behind the killings of two Russian journalists hit by mortar fire at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine, allegations she has always denied. Moscow says she then crossed voluntarily into Russia and sought asylum as a refugee. The Ukrainian government, however, insists she was kidnapped by rebel forces and that she is a prisoner of war. ""I have already been in captivity for an hour when those Russian journalists died. I have not seen them, and our ways have never crossed.. The 'rebels' themselves told me that those journalists came under fire of their own 'makhnovtsi' [slang for 'anarchists'],"" Savchenko told CNN in her letter from jail. ""And the investigators knew all about it since the very beginning! And they have nothing on me! They simply thought that it would be easy to ""twist my arms"" and receive another star for their epaulettes. But it's not going to happen!"" she added. Savchenko's case has attracted wide international attention and turned her into a symbol of resistance against Russia in her home country, with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko awarding her the title ""Hero of Ukraine,"" one of the nation's highest honors. She has also been voted into the Ukrainian parliament despite her captivity. Despite her critical situation, Savchenko appears to have retained her sense of humor just as much as her determination, writing that she was feeling ""On the edge!...;) Close to Nirvana and enlightenment!;) Joking."" ""Holding on! But holding my body entirely on my the power of my will,"" she continued, ""because I am so numb that I couldn't feel the needle when the blood sample was taken from my vein today. ""Tottering, head is spinning, [blood] pressure 80x40, [blood] sugar 2.9, T [temperature] -- 35.7°C. But still be standing till 50kg [body weight]! Even longer if God let's me! Hasn't fainted even once and hasn't fallen off my feet."" The military pilot told CNN she is being monitored ""24 hours a day,"" which she finds ""very annoying."" ""Protection and security measures are such that King Kong would not have been able to break away!;),"" she joked again. ""But in general all is very decent and polite! Treatment is reasonable."" Savchenko's lawyer recently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that President Putin holds Savchenko's fate and that she wanted to await trial out of jail. Several international dignitaries have urged Moscow to release her, including EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini and the U.S. State Department, to no avail. But as Savchenko continues her hunger strike, is she willing to ultimately die in detention? ""To die?! That's not our methods!!!;) I'll think of something better!...:;),"" she said. ""I'll be on hunger strike as I said until I am returned back to Ukraine, or at least [until] detention is changed to a house arrest at the Ukrainian Consulate in RF, which is actually a part of Ukraine in Russia. ""There is no point starting eating in prison. The bite doesn't go down the throat here in this cage! And the truth must win after all!!!"" CNN reached out to Russian authorities for an update on Savchenko's case, who referred us to their last statement on Savchenko, dated from 20 February, where they call on the media to ""Let the investigators to finish their job. Let the court of justice to determine Savchenko's degree of guilt of and punishment for the crimes she is charged with."" Savchenko is currently scheduled to appear in court on May 13.","Captive Ukrainian pilot sends message to Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail .

"(CNN)First, the women. Now, the men. It seems everyone is getting in on the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot action. But not everyone is happy about it. Deadline reports that Sony Pictures is planning an all-male ""Ghostbusters"" reboot starring Channing Tatum and directed and produced by brothers Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. The studio is also creating a production company, Ghostcorps, which will include Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd, who were among the original ""Ghostbusters"" team, according to Deadline. ""We want to expand the Ghostbusters universe in ways that will include different films, TV shows, merchandise, all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment,"" Deadline quoted Reitman as saying. The film ""has a wonderful idea that builds"" on the premise of an all-female ""Ghostbusters"" reboot expected to begin filming this summer. That film is expected to star Melissa McCarthy,  Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. ""It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies,"" Deadline quoted Reitman as saying. All well and good. ""Ghostbusters"" is, after all, a well-loved comedy classic that gave the world the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. But the news, close on the heels the much-lauded all-female ""Ghostbusters"" reboot, has met with mixed reviews. ""Couldn't u just let the girls have this one ONE FREAKING TIME?"" Twitter user jessieroro13 posted. Others think perhaps it's time to derail the Hollywood reboot train, no matter which gender is in the driver's seat. ""How about no #Ghostbusters reboots, redos or remakes,"" Twitter user EA_Creative wrote. ""Why mess with perfection?"" The all-female ""Ghostbusters"" film is expected to be out next year. All all-male version is tentatively expected to begin filming in the summer of 2016, to be released the following year, Reitman told Deadline.","Sony is now planning an all-male Ghostbusters reboot, Deadline reports .

"(CNN)There were 10,000 runners and walkers at the Rodes City 10K on Saturday. Asia Ford was among the last. But a photo of her finish has caused a sensation online, thanks to a police officer who kept her going when she was about to give up. The race in Louisville, Kentucky, was another milestone for Ford, who has lost 217 pounds in her quest to live a healthier life for her children. According to CNN affiliate WAVE-TV, Ford trained for months for the event. But around mile 5, breathing became a challenge. ""I messed up and forgot to eat this morning,"" she wrote on her Facebook page, adding that she was still recovering from a bout of pneumonia. As she struggled to finish, to move forward and to catch her breath, her son Terrance stepped in to offer a supporting hand. Emergency medical service crew weren't far behind, just in case. But Ford wouldn't let breathing problems or an empty stomach hold her back. Louisville police Lt. Aubrey Gregory was impressed. ""The EMS guys got out to check on her, and she said I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping,"" Gregory told WAVE-TV. ""So I said I'm not going to let her stop, we're going to do this together. So I got out and I grabbed her hand. I had to meet this inspirational woman."" Flanked by her son and the lieutenant, Ford walked the remaining 1.2 miles. Photos show her face twisted in a grimace, Lt. Gregory leaning toward her, talking about health, trying to keep her mind off the pain. ""I almost had a slip up with my breathing,"" Ford wrote on Facebook, ""but a police officer by the name of Mr Gregory got out and took my hand to finish the race with my baby and I and WE MADE IT!!!"" Ford's story has racked up well north of 1 million likes on Facebook. In the comments, people shared notes of encouragement and congratulations for Ford. ""As someone who has also lost 200lbs...I know how HARD you worked for this wonderful moment,"" wrote Jennifer Bruce. Many praised the officer for helping and for caring. ""Now that's community service,"" opined one commenter. Others noted that this is a welcome good news story, especially after a spate of high profile police shootings. Ford's son Terrance expressed a similar sentiment to WAVE-TV, saying ""with all the stuff that's going on with police it's nice to know there good people out there."" Terrance also said his mother's tenacity ""makes me push harder to do the things I want to do in life."" As for Lt. Gregory, he and Ford will be honored by Louisville's mayor for ""health and compassion.""

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton permanently deleted all the emails on the private server she used to do official business as secretary of state, the Republican lawmaker who subpoenaed the emails said late Friday. Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, chairman of the House committee investigating the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, said Clinton's lawyer informed him of the news. ""Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server,"" Gowdy said in a statement. Gowdy had also asked that Clinton turn over her server to the State Department inspector general for an independent review. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said no. In his letter to Gowdy, Kendall said the former secretary of state ""chose not to keep her non-record personal emails."" ""Thus, there are no ... e-mails from Secretary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized,"" he wrote. But she ""has maintained and preserved copies"" of work-related, or potentially work-related emails she turned over to the State Department late last year. Kendall did not specify whether the emails were kept in paper or digital form. In December, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. Clinton has asked that those roughly 30,000 emails be released to the public. State Department officials have said they will release them after they have been reviewed. ""Representatives of Secretary Clinton's office have been in touch with the committee and the State Department to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible and that she's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in an email. Gowdy said it wasn't clear when Clinton erased the server, but it appears to have been wiped after October 2014, when the State Department asked Clinton to return her official emails to the department. The chairman subpoenaed Clinton's emails regarding Libya and, last month, the State Department turned over about 300 emails to the committee. Clinton did not have an official government email account, so her personal server was the primary repository for her emails during her time as secretary of state. ""Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,"" Gowdy said. But in his letter, Kendall said the federal law governing record retention requires that each federal employee individually decide what emails must be preserved. ""The manner in which Secretary Clinton assisted the State Department in fulfilling its responsibilities under the act is consistent with the obligations of every federal employee,"" Kendall wrote. Gowdy has also subpoenaed the emails of about a dozen Clinton aides at the State Department. That request is still outstanding.","GOP lawmaker who subpoenaed the messages says they've been deleted .

"(CNN)It's the Internet bromance that's electrified China. Two men from different worlds — a BuzzFeed editor from New York and a man in southern China known as ""Brother Orange"" — have united dramatically after social media helped them bond over a stolen iPhone. Matt Stopera, 27, was greeted with bouquets of flowers, hordes of photographers and screaming fans as he arrived in Meizhou, southern China Wednesday, embracing Li Hongjun --  a restaurant owner who somehow came across the iPhone that Stopera lost in New York over a year ago. Li doesn't speak English and Stopera doesn't speak Chinese — but Chinese social media users are convinced they are soul mates. The star-crossed pair first connected when Stopera noticed strange photos in his iCloud image gallery of a man taking selfies with an orange tree. Confused, Stopera took to the Internet to see if anyone knew who the mysterious man was. The story went viral in China, where Internet users banded together to search for the stranger, who they nicknamed Brother Orange. That man was Li, from Guangdong province, who was snapping pics with Stopera's old iPhone without realizing the photos were being uploaded to the BuzzFeed writer's cloud account. With the mystery solved, thousands of Chinese Internet users demanded a ""happy ending"" and clamored for the two men to meet. Brother Orange made the first move. ""Matt, I welcome you to come to Meizhou and try some local food,"" he said on Weibo, China's microblogging platform. That post was ""liked"" over 12,000 times. Matt quickly accepted.  ""Everybody wants me and Brother Orange to unite,"" he told CNN last month. While Stopera waited for his visa to be approved, the two swapped messages -- Stopera began learning Mandarin phrases, while Brother Orange posted videos of himself learning English. But when they finally met, the smiles and hugs said it all. According to images posted to social media, the two spent their first hours in China eating noodles and walking around tourist sites. They also planted a tree together. Chinese Internet users were over the moon. ""Matt crossed the ocean to meet you, how touching!"" said one. ""It really is an international bromance.""

"(CNN)Congratulations, Internet haters! Well done, keepers of the one-true-way-to-talk-about-race! If we don't tamp down the backlash against Starbucks ""Race Together"" campaign, I fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years. Is that really what we want? Look, I get it. Asking baristas to hold conversations about race is a lot to demand of already hard-working employees. Not to mention, the topic should probably be called ""systematic racism,"" not just ""race."" And there are legitimate questions about what Starbucks could realistically hope to accomplish, here. But for crying out loud! In the past 48 hours, racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing Starbucks for trying to fight racism than they have against other (actually racist) companies. The truth is that we cannot have it both ways. We cannot demand that companies address race, and then attack them when they try. Yes, it seems like harmless fun to pile on or retweet the snark. At some point, all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online. But the cost this time is that no corporation will want to do anything creative or constructive on racial subjects for a very long time. In fact, some activists are responding with such little sympathy, empathy and grace, that other corporations are like to run the other way. Again, is that what we want? Mellody Hobson, an African-American member of the Starbucks board and a personal friend, is a major supporter of this campaign. How will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion? Starbucks is trying to make a positive difference. If the company gets rewarded, others will follow. But nobody wants their brand to get beaten up. At some point in the future, activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior. But how seriously will anyone take us, when even the ""good guys"" end up getting kicked in the teeth and called racist -- for trying to OPPOSE bigotry? Modern science tells us that bias lives on, in even the most dedicated anti-racist. The only cure is talking about it. Our country needs more open discussion of race, not less. Companies who try to further that discussion should be rewarded, even if their initial attempts are imperfect. We can put forward suggestions and criticisms in a constructive manner: ""This is a great first step, Corporation! Here are five ways to improve the campaign -- and make it even better."" I think any human anywhere would be open to hearing that kind of feedback. But nobody wants to be called an idiot, just for trying.

Ironically, after all this is over, Starbucks will still sell plenty of lattes.

"(CNN)Lily wasn't moving when rescuers found her, hanging upside down in her mother's smashed car. It had flipped over into a frigid Utah river half a day before, and the baby was still strapped in her seat. As Officer Jared Warner dashed with the 18-month-old in his arms to an ambulance, she was barely alive. But she's doing better, her family said Monday. ""Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching 'Dora (the Explorer)' and singing '(The) Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa. She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers,"" they said. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25 years old. Lily might have died unseen with her mother, had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. ""Where the car was, you couldn't see it from the roadway,"" police Lt. Cory Slaymaker said. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. Police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water. The rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for Officer Bryan DeWitt. ""I don't remember doing anything but just doing it,"" he said. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Then they noticed the baby. ""She was definitely unconscious and not responsive,"" Warner said. But she was still alive, and rescuers were delighted to see it. She was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred when police believe it did. The night before, a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check, but he saw nothing unusual, police said, and dismissed it. That was at about 10:30 p.m. on Friday. Groesbeck's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment. ""The driver's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge, launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water,"" Slaymaker told CNN affiliate KUTV. The angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, 14 hours later. Groesbeck's death is tragic, but the survival of baby Lily is a story filled with hope. But just how did the baby survive the ordeal? Above all, said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, the biggest factor was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached, Cohen said. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures, Cohen said. Another factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story, Cohen said. It's a reminder that the human body is tough. Lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold, without food or drink. A mystery arose from the rescue: The police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help. The mother was dead, but the officers said that they heard an adult's voice calling to them. ""The four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car,"" Warner told CNN. ""To me, it didn't sound like a child's voice."" The voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright, he said. The mother was dead. The child was unconscious, but her eyelids were fluttering, and the rescuers knew she was alive, Warner said. It's one of those things that doesn't have an explanation, he said about the voice. ""It felt like I could hear someone telling me, 'I need help,'"" DeWitt told CNN affiliate KSL. ""It was very surreal, something that I felt like I could hear."" Tyler Beddoes, a third officer at the scene, said the same. ""All I know is that it was there, we all heard it, and that just helped us to push us harder, like I say, and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" The river is 10 feet deep in some places, police said, but the car hit a shallower spot. Images showed it only partly covered by water. Lily was not submerged, said Police Lt. Matt Johnson. Firefighter Paul Tomadakis freed her from the wreck. He ""grabbed the baby in my arm, raised its head up out of water, as I tried to release the seat belt,"" he said. Then Warner took Lily into his arms. ""The child was passed to me and I ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child,"" he said. Police have no explanation for the wreck. No alcohol or drugs were in play, they told KUTV. There were no skid marks leading up to the impact. A tow truck hauled Groesbeck's car out of the river, and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures. Groesbeck's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for Lily, and funeral costs for her mother. Late Monday, it had reached more than $35,500, surpassing its goal of $8,000. CNN's Melanie Whitley, Vivien Kuo, Elizabeth Cohen, Joe Sutton Jackie Castillo and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Family says Lily is awake -- smiling, laughing and singing with her grandfather .

"Dhanusha, Nepal (CNN)At Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters, clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes. Many of them, though, are clueless as to where they're headed. As a frequent traveler to the country, I've been approached many times by these men, asking me to help fill out their departure forms. Usually, when I ask what country they're traveling to, I get the same answer: ""I'm not sure."" They seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better. This time, however, I'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets. Almost every day, the remains of three or four workers arrive back in Nepal from the Middle East, according to Bhola Prasad Siwakoti, the secretary of the Nepalese Ministry of Labor and Manpower. Every other day, at least one dead body arrives from Qatar, he said. ""Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar,"" says Suryanath Mishra, who served as ambassador to Qatar from 2007 to 2012. ""They get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers."" He cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes. We are waiting for the body of Kishun Das, who left Nepal for Qatar only eight months ago. The 38-year old was his family's breadwinner and the father of five children. His younger brother, Bishun, is at the airport to receive the body. He also works in Qatar and is in Nepal on leave. I ask him why he's alone. ""We don't have money to bring other family members to receive the body,"" he says.  ""But they have been calling me every other minute asking for the update."" His phone rings. ""I'm at the administration filling out the paperwork."" he tells the caller on his phone. ""No, he isn't getting any compensation."" With more than 350,000 migrant workers, Nepalis make up the second-biggest community in Qatar, after Indians, the embassy in Qatar claims. When contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in Qatar, a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation. Saad Al-Mraikhi estimated that some 400 Indian and Nepalese workers die each year in Qatar. ""It is desperately unfortunate that any worker should die overseas, in a foreign land, away from their family,"" the spokesman said. ""But it would be wrong, we believe, to allow the statistics to be consistently distorted to suggest that all deaths in a population of 1.5 million people are apparently the result of workplace conditions, either directly or indirectly, which is the prevailing and erroneous narrative."" Al-Mraikhi spoke about recent changes in his country, including the introduction of a wage protection system, improved living conditions and increased penalties for companies that violate rules. ""While the vast majority of workers in Qatar are fairly treated, we recognise that a minority are not.  That is why we are reforming labour laws and practices,"" he said in a statement. As we wait at the airport, a Qatar Airways plane lands. At 7:40 pm, it is the last of three that depart and arrive every day. Before Qatar won the right to stage the FIFA World Cup in 2022 and embarked on a hugely ambitious, holistic construction plan to support it, it was a single flight a day. Hundreds of passengers disembark from the plane. ""They are mostly migrant workers returning home,"" an airport official tells us. We spot a cargo worker transporting a bright red box carrying the body of Kishun. Even in a country where even a fight between two stray dogs can gather a sizable crowd, coffin arrivals don't seem to attract many spectators. The scene has become all too common. The coffin is loaded on to a jeep provided for free by the Nepali government. We follow it on the journey to the family's village in Dhanusha district, a seven-hour drive from Kathmandu. ""Normally, vehicles are not allowed to drive on this highway after 8 p.m. because of the dangerous condition of some of the roads at night, but since I'm carrying a coffin, the police let me go,"" the driver of the jeep tells us. The Nepali government has eight vehicles designated to deliver coffins. They're kept busy. ""They call me the coffin guy,"" the driver says with a dark smirk. At around 1 a.m., we stop at a roadside shack. All of us eat except for Das' brother. ""I'm mourning. For religious purposes, I need to remain pure. So, I can't eat anything,"" he says. I see him buying alcohol shortly after. ""I'm too stressed because of my brother's death. I need to comfort myself."" Back in Qatar, where alcohol is banned, he and his friends manage to fulfill their needs courtesy of the local black market, he tells us. ""It (the alcohol) is of very poor quality, but that is our only option,"" he adds. Even before we arrive at the village just at the break of dawn, we hear the howling. Dozens of villagers have already gathered at Das' home. His father cries out in agony, ""Hey Lord, what have you done?"" Then he faints. All the family members shout at the coffin. The wailing and shouting is almost deafening. And it goes on for hours. As a journalist working in South Asia, I have seen a lot of desperation and misery. But the screeching was so intense; it's something I will never forget. ""He alone was taking care of his parents and his family. How will they survive now?"" a villager asks. Most of the spectators are women. Most of the men from the village have gone to the Middle East to work. The few who are left behind start preparing for his cremation. Mishra, the former ambassador, says 55% of Nepali migrant workers deaths in Qatar are from ""sudden"" cardiac arrest, 20% die from work-related accidents, 15% from traffic accidents and an alarming 10% commit suicide. Nepali government records show more than 290 workers have died in the Gulf state in the past 420 days. Put another way, two Nepali workers die in Qatar every three days. These are young men dying in the prime of their life. ""The cause of deaths needs to be investigated properly, and urgently,"" Mishra says. ""In general, it is due to tension led by exploitation, adverse climate, poor working and living conditions and alcoholic intoxication."" In Das' village, almost all the men we meet have spent time working in the Middle East. Many had recently returned from Qatar. They tell stories of hardship and of the deaths of their co-workers. Time and again, none of them seems to be convinced with investigations into their friends' and compatriots' deaths. And again, amongst the keening and wailing of his distraught family, no one is sure how Kishun Das, brought back home in a red coffin along hazardous roads, met his end in Qatar.","A spokesman for the Qatari labor ministry details recent changes to the law .

"(CNN)The director of ""Midnight Rider"" has pleaded guilty to charges related to the 2014 death of a crew member while filming. Randall Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass Monday morning in Wayne County (Georgia) Superior Court, Deputy Clerk of Courts Betty Taylor said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced on March 24 the probable cause of the accident was trespassing by the film's crew. As part of the plea deal, Miller will spend two years behind bars and then serve eight years of probation. The deal prohibits him from directing films or being in any supervisory position in movies that would make him responsible for the safety of others for a period of 10 years. Miller, who was also ordered to pay $20,000 in fines and perform 360 hours of community service, was remanded in to custody of the sheriff to begin his sentence. A freight train hit members of the crew of the Gregg Allman biopic while they were working on a railroad bridge in February 2014. Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones, 27, was killed. The production had applied to the railroad company for permission to film on the bridge but was denied, according to the Savannah Morning News. Several other crew members were injured in the incident, CNN affiliate WTOC reported. 'Midnight Rider' pair surrender to authorities . Jones was mourned throughout  the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and her death was noted in the Academy Awards' ""In Memoriam"" montage. Three additional members of the production staff faced charges related to the incident. As part of the plea agreement with Miller, charges were dropped against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, Taylor said. Miller and Savin are listed as owners of Unclaimed Fright Productions Inc., the film's production company, according to the indictment. Jay Sedrish, the film's executive producer, also received 10 years of probation. As part of his plea deal, he will be banned from supervisory positions in films for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. A third member of the crew, first assistant director Hillary Schwartz, was found guilty after a bench trial, according to District Attorney Jackie Johnson's office. Schwartz was sentenced to 10 years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. Like the others, he was ordered not to be involved in the safety of film crews. Schwartz had made a deal to provide testimony for the state if the case went to trial, according to the district attorney's office. Jones' parents were in court for the pleas and the trial of those involved in the death of their daughter, addressing the court before the sentencing of each, according to Johnson's office. CNN's Todd Leopold and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NTSB found probable cause of train accident was trespassing .

"Dingzhou, China (CNN)Bian Xiuzhi carefully pulls back the clear plastic from her tattered photo album. She wants to show me her favorite photograph of her son. It's from a few years ago. It shows Bian Liangjing standing proudly in front of a temple gate. ""This is the best one because he looks so handsome,"" she laughs as tears fall on to the album. Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. ""If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return. I know he is still alive,"" she says. I first met family members of those who were on the airliner that night as they stood in shock at the arrivals hall of Beijing airport. I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying ""none of those on board survived."" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. ""I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,"" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media. Both the Chinese and Malaysian governments maintain they are doing everything they can to help. Meanwhile, Bian Liangjing's family, like all the others I have met, is stuck in a vortex of grief. His brother shows me to the room where they would sleep as young boys and the corner where they kept their toys. Bian Liangwei says they were best friends and that his older brother looked after him. ""When he was here, everything was OK with our family, now everything is up to me. I hope he is somewhere alive. I just know he wants to come home soon to us,"" he says through his tears.","Chinese mother of son on missing plane still believes he will come home .

"(CNN)A woman who claims she was injured in the Boston Marathon bombing has been charged with stealing money from funds set up for the victims. Joanna Leigh claims the indictment is retribution for her vocal criticism of the way One Fund Boston disbursed the funds. Authorities say Leigh, 41, collected almost $40,000 from One Fund and other sources after claiming to have suffered a brain injury during the attack. They say she received $8,000 payment from One Fund Boston, which was set up to compensate bombing victims. She's also accused of receiving $1,700 from a school fundraiser, collecting more than $9,000 in contributions from an online fundraiser and getting more than $18,000 in benefits from the Massachusetts Victims for Violent Crime compensation fund. The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack. But Boston Police and Suffolk County investigators say she wasn't hurt. She apparently did not claim any injury or seek any medical treatment until about two weeks later. ""When she did begin to make those claims, she billed herself as a 'hero' who ran toward the second blast,"" authorities said. Leigh says the indictment is payback for her criticism of One Fund. She and others have claimed they weren't properly compensated by the fund because of the way it calculated payments. If someone's injury didn't require an overnight hospital stay, he or she received $8,000. Those who were hospitalized got $125,000 or more. ""I don't think this is about me; I think this is because I spoke out about The One Fund,"" she told the Boston Globe on Thursday. ""I think this is about killing the messenger."" Leigh will be arraigned Monday. She intends to plead not guilty. The indictment comes as Dzhokar Tsarnaev stands trial for the bombing that killed three and left more than 260 people maimed or injured.

"(CNN)Amy's Kitchen Inc. says it's recalling nearly 74,000 cases of its products that could contain listeria. In a statement released through the Food and Drug Administration on Sunday, Amy's Kitchen said that it was voluntarily recalling the products after learning from one of its suppliers that it may have received organic spinach that was possibly contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. The California-based organic and natural food company said it wasn't aware of any reports of illness connected with its products, but was recalling them ""out of an abundance of caution."" The recalled products, which are listed on the FDA's website and were distributed throughout the United States and Canada, include multiple types of vegetable lasagna, tofu scrambles, spinach pizza, enchiladas, brown rice and vegetable bowls and stuffed pasta shells. Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth.

"(CNN)When Selena was breaking concert attendance records at home and abroad, there weren't a lot of crossover pop stars who looked like her in the United States. There was Rita Moreno and Gloria Estefan and ... well, that's about it. The March 31, 1995, death of the Mexican-American singer plunged many Latino listeners into mourning and brought her music to the attention of English speakers who would soon become fans. Selena Quintanilla-Perez started singing the Tejano music that eventually made her famous in her father's restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father Abraham taught the family band and named them Los Dinos after his own group from earlier years. Selena's brother, A.B., played bass, and her sister, Suzette, played drums. When the family moved to Corpus Christi, the group started getting gigs at local parties and weddings. Selena was only 15 when she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards. That got her a record contract, and several albums followed. She eventually married her guitarist, Chris Perez. In 1994, she won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album for ""Selena Live!"" and seemed poised for mainstream stardom. When the president of Selena's fan club shot her to death the following year in a Texas motel room, her first English-language album was months from release. Her death made international headlines. She was 23 years old. Twenty years later, her influence is still being felt. Her official Facebook page still has more than 2 million likes, and fans are remembering the singer who crossed barriers and made them sing and dance to her blend of Tejano music. Fans will celebrate her life and legacy at the commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi in mid-April. Here are five things you may not know about Selena. Selena had to learn Spanish. A third-generation Texan of Mexican descent, Selena didn't grow up speaking Spanish. Neither did her husband, Perez, who played guitar in her band and fell in love with her on the road. In his book, ""To Selena, with Love,"" Perez said they practiced speaking Spanish before their first big publicity blitz in Mexico. ""In Mexico, Selena mangled her conversations in Spanish like the rest of us, but not for long."" ""She said, 'It'll be cool. You watch. I'm going to learn Spanish and surprise everybody,' "" Perez wrote. ""She got better and better, to the point where I'd have to ask her to slow down so that I could understand what she was saying."" She sold out the Astrodome. Selena performed several times at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at the Astrodome to sold-out crowds of more than 60,000 people. (It wasn't just any rodeo: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the Osmonds have all played the event.) ""We had 20 performances this year,"" Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show, told the New York Times in 1995. ""We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome."" Her album went to No. 1. Her 1995 crossover album, ""Dreaming of You,"" went to the top of the Billboard 200 the first week it was released. She was the first Latin artist to debut atop the list. ""There were supposed to be 14 tracks, but we had only recorded four of them, so we put together a tribute album of new and old songs,"" Nancy Brennan, then vice president of A&R at EMI, told Texas Monthly. ""Making that album was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do, because we were listening to her voice all day and crying as we were mixing the songs."" ""Selena"" (the movie) ignited Jennifer Lopez's career. Starring as Selena in the 1997 movie of the same name, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to be paid $1 million for a movie role. Lopez was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. ""Getting to play the part of Selena was life-changing for me,"" Lopez told Para Todos magazine. ""I got to immerse myself in her life, got to know her family, her home, her culture ... every part of her story. It was a special time in my life both professionally and personally. Playing her not only opened doors for me in the film world, but it inspired me to start my own music career. In a lot of ways, I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had that experience."" Selena's killer is eligible for parole in 2025. Yolanda Saldivar, the president of Selena's fan club, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1995 for Selena's murder. Saldivar must serve at least 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole. Selena was meeting with Saldivar at a Corpus Christi motel to discuss her concerns that Saldivar had embezzled money from her when Saldivar shot her, according to trial testimony. Saldivar argued that she accidentally fired the shot, but the jury didn't buy it. CNN's Victoria Moll-Ramirez contributed to this story.","Selena's music attracted Latino fans in the U.S. and Spanish-speaking fans abroad .

"(CNN)One of the most pernicious phrases in the debate over how to counter extremist use of social media is ""whack-a-mole."" In national security circles, many believe that suspending social media accounts used by violent extremists is a pointless endeavor. They argue that, as in the children's arcade game ""Whac-a-Mole,"" suspending accounts is a fruitless endeavor because, they claim, new accounts are created for every account that is suspended. To examine this assumption, technologist Jonathon Morgan and I collected data on millions of Twitter accounts, including tens of thousands used by ISIS supporters, and found substantial evidence to the contrary. In September 2014, Twitter began to crack down on ISIS supporters who used its platform, suspending tens of thousands of accounts over the course of several months. While many users did create new accounts during the first month of the crackdown, the number of new accounts plunged after September, even though suspensions increased. Twitter has indicated that its suspensions fell at least at the high end of our estimated figure, possibly even higher still. The result is that suspensions are outpacing the number of new accounts successfully created, possibly by a wide margin. The size of ISIS's support network on Twitter is shrinking as a result. Additionally, we found that the suspensions targeted some of the most active and effective users in the network, the professional activists who empowered ISIS to broadcast its propaganda to unsuspecting audiences by spamming hashtags such as #WorldCup and #CakeBoss. Not only has ISIS suffered a blow to its ability to spam others, its supporters on Twitter are so weakened that they are now hoist by their own petard. The hashtag that ISIS uses to promote its own messages has been taken over by opposing spammers, trolls and activists, who frequently tweet five times as much anti-ISIS content as ISIS can muster on any given day. ISIS content continues to be available online, of course. The number of suspensions is not sufficient to completely deny them the use of Twitter. But their audience is shrinking and their ability to game Twitter with manipulative tactics such as auto-tweeting ""bots"" has been significantly diminished. An estimated 10% of tweets sent by ISIS supporters are directed at rebuilding their social networks rather than disseminating propaganda, and that doesn't account for the additional impact of time lost to the process of creating new accounts and waiting for followers to find them. These are worthy goals, and they detract from ISIS's ability to accomplish its online strategy of intimidation, provocation and recruitment, which is discussed at more length in my new book with Jessica Stern, ISIS: The State of Terror. ISIS users call the suspensions ""devastating"" and their fury provides evidence that suspensions hit them where it hurts. But that doesn't mean suspensions are ineffective, any more than a cold day outside invalidates decades of temperature trends that show the impact of climate change. The view outside your window, especially if you are an analyst or journalist following a couple hundred terrorist accounts, will not always accurately reflect an online climate where tens of thousands of accounts are in play. While our study was only a preliminary look at this issue, it examined a body of data that dwarfs any existing study on the subject. While future research will help clarify the impact of suspensions over time, it is not likely to ever fully settle the complaints of the whack-a-mole crowd, who are as persistent as their favorite metaphor. Nevertheless, it's time to move the serious debate away from the question of whether suspensions are effective and toward more complex issues with a better grounding in the available data. There are complications that arise from the suspension process. One of the most notable we observed in our study was the question of how people in the network behave under pressure. Our analysis suggested that the social network of ISIS supporters on Twitter is becoming more insular, with users following each other more and becoming less and less exposed to outside influences. While it is harder to enter the network in the first place and to stay there as an active user, it is possible that this echo-chamber effect might lead new users to radicalize more swiftly and more intensely. Tampering with an online social network, through suspensions or other means, is a form of social engineering, and we need to better understand what that means for users. We would be better served by research into such new questions than by continuing a tired debate about whether suspensions are effective at degrading the size and online distribution networks of extremist groups. It's time to take this debate to the next level, and let the whack-a-mole mole stay whacked.","Many argue that suspending social media accounts used by violent extremists is a pointless endeavor .

"(CNN)Sony Pictures is expanding its ""Ghostbusters"" movies with Ghost Corps, a collective headed by original ""Ghostbusters"" director Ivan Reitman and star Dan Aykroyd, that will oversee the expansion of the movie franchise beyond a cinematic universe into television and merchandising. The first order of business will be to develop a new male-oriented ""Ghostbusters"" that will be released after the much ballyhooed female-centric movie being put together by Paul Feig. The movie, which is to star Kirsten Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, shoots this summer and will be released July 22, 2016. New all-female 'Ghostbusters' cast chosen . Joe and Anthony Russo, the duo behind ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and who signed a first-look deal with Sony last week, are being tapped to produce and direct the new movie. Drew Pearce, who penned ""Iron Man 3"", will write the script while Channing Tatum, another Sony favorite after the 22 Jump Street movies, will also produce with his partners Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan. If all goes as planned, Tatum would also star in the movie. Read the original 1984 THR review of 'Ghostbusters' Reitman will also produce the new movie.

Why Studios Want More Women-Led Blockbusters . How seriously is Sony taking this?

"(CNN)Student leaders at the University of California-Irvine vetoed a resolution on Saturday that would have banned hanging flags of any nation, including America's Stars and Stripes, in the lobby of student government offices, amid widespread criticism from students and alumni. The Legislative Council of the Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine's passed the resolution, ""Flags and decoration adjustment for inclusivity,"" in a 6-4 vote Tuesday with the stated intention of creating a ""more inclusive"" environment. The resolution said ""the American flag is commonly flown in government public service locations, military related entities, at homes, in foreign lands where the US government has a presence,"" and its ""symbolism has negative and positive aspects that are interpreted differently by individuals."" Its passage drew widespread opposition from the campus community and beyond for being offensive and unpatriotic. ""As a military veteran, American citizen and taxpayer, I find this piece of 'legislation' highly offensive,"" a commenter said on the ASUCI 's Facebook student page, in one of the more mildly worded complaints. ""This is a public school, supported by taxpayers, (yes, I know, most of you pay tuition, as well, but that does not cover the entire cost), and it is appropriate to display the United States Flag on campus. Please reconsider your actions and rescind this resolution."" Current students also registered their dissatisfaction with the resolution, saying the resolution does not represent the student body as a whole. ""As much as I hope that their decision gets vetoed and that the administration will take some accountability for allowing such a controversial issue to be voted on in the first place, I also hope that people will stop generalizing us and saying that they will refuse to hire UCI students or that the generous donations of our alumni will fall, or even worse that we are not proud Americans. The majority of us would be proud to stand out there and wave the flag ourselves if need be,"" another commenter said. The UCI administration issued a statement saying ""this misguided decision was not endorsed or supported in any way by the campus leadership, the University of California, or the broader student body."" Student-body President Reza Zomorrodian also publicly opposed the legislation, leading the Executive Cabinet of student government to convene on Saturday to veto the legislation. ""We fundamentally disagree with the actions taken by ASUCI Legislative Council and their passage of R50-70 as counter to the ideals that allow us to operate as an autonomous student government organization with the freedoms of speech and expression associated with it,"" the executive cabinet said in a statement. ""It is these very symbols that represent our constitutional rights that have allowed for our representative creation and our ability to openly debate all ranges of issues and pay tribute to how those liberties were attained.""","Legislative Council of University of California-Irvine's student body passed measure Tuesday .

"(CNN)The governor of Virginia has ordered an investigation after a black student at the University of Virginia was injured during an arrest early Wednesday. The university's Black Student Alliance distributed a photograph, showing what it said was Martese Johnson, 20, during his arrest. Blood splatters his shirt and covers his face. Video from the incident shows Johnson pinned to the ground, screaming: ""I go to UVA! ... You f****** racists! What the f***? How did this happen?"" An officer can be heard telling the student to stop fighting. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students rallied in support of Johnson. And Johnson himself took the microphone. ""Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects ... please respect everyone here,"" he said. ""We are one community. We deserve to respect each other, especially in times like this."" Earlier, the Black Student Alliance issued a statement denouncing the incident. ""Today, we are reminded of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice; as University students, we are not impervious to the brutality that has reeled on news cycles around the country,"" the group said. ""We have marched and shouted that we are Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, but the proximity of this morning's brutality to a member of our community has deepened that wound. It is no longer happening only on national television -- it is a reality here and now at the University of Virginia that we must face as a collective,"" it said. People are also speaking out on Twitter where #JusticeForMartese was trending Wednesday evening. The student's name had 16,000 mentions on Twitter in the past 24 hours. According to the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), uniformed ABC special agents arrested Johnson after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment and questioned. He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, ABC said in a statement, adding that Johnson was treated for his injuries at a local hospital and released. In a separate statement, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said that he has asked the Secretary of Public Safety to open an independent Virginia State Police investigation into the use of force. The special agents involved in the incident will be restricted to administrative duties, pending the results of the investigation. Johnson is a third-year student double majoring in Italian and media studies. He has no criminal record, according to his attorney, and holds a variety of leadership positions on campus. ""As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,"" attorney Daniel P. Watkins said. ""I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously."" The president of the University of Virginia urged anyone who witnessed the arrest, or who has information about it, to contact authorities. ""We have not yet clarified all of the details surrounding this event, but we are seeking to do so as quickly as possible,"" said Teresa A. Sullivan. ""Today, as U.Va. students, faculty, and staff who share a set of deeply held values, we stand unified in our commitment to seeking the truth about this incident. And we stand united in our belief that equal treatment and equal justice are among our fundamental rights under the law.""

"(CNN)Latest developments: . • One of the pilots on board Germanwings Flight 9525 was locked out of the cockpit when the plane crashed, a senior military official told The New York Times Wednesday, citing evidence from the cockpit voice recorder. • Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said ""we have no information from the bodies investigating the incident that would corroborate the report in The New York Times. We will not participate in speculation, but we will follow up on the matter."" • Helicopters have airlifted some victims' remains from the site of the Germanwings plane crash in the French Alps, the Gendarmerie said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate France 2. Full story: . Investigators trying to determine what caused the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 have made a startling discovery in an audio recording, according to a New York Times report: One of the plane's pilots was locked out of the cockpit before the crash. ""You can hear he is trying to smash the door down,"" a senior military official involved in the investigation told the newspaper, describing audio from the cockpit voice recorder, one of the plane's black boxes. ""We don't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out,"" the official said, according to the Times' report. ""But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door."" Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said it was looking into the report. ""We have no information from the bodies investigating the incident that would corroborate the report in the New York Times,"" spokesman Boris Ogursky said. ""We will not participate in speculation, but we will follow up on the matter."" The Times' report is a ""terribly shocking revelation,"" CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz said. But he and other experts cautioned that it's still unclear what could have been going on inside the cockpit. Possibilities range from a medical emergency to something more nefarious, like a suicide mission, CNN aviation analysts said. Officials previously said that hadn't ruled out terrorism, but it seems unlikely. French authorities revealed earlier Wednesday that they'd been able to access audio from the recorder, even though its external casing was damaged. But they disclosed few details about what the recording actually contained, saying only that there was one audio channel with voices on it that went all the way up to the time of the crash. ""It is too early to draw conclusions to what happened,"" said Remi Jouty, head of the BEA, the French aviation investigative arm leading the probe. ""There is going to be detailed work performed on that audio file to understand and interpret the sounds and the voices that can be heard."" Finding the plane's second black box will also be critical to understanding the mystery of what went on inside the jet. That box, the flight data recorder, hasn't been found yet, but Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Wednesday that there's a high probability it will be. Investigators scoured dangerous terrain in the French Alps as they searched for clues in the wreckage. Workers dropped to the crash site from helicopters, Jouty said, and had to be tied together because the steep area in the mountains is so treacherous. Spohr said Tuesday's plane crash ""represents the darkest hours"" in the history of his company, which owns Germanwings. Officials are struggling to understand how an airplane that ""was in perfect technical condition"" with two experienced pilots ""was involved in such a terrible accident,"" he said. But even worse, he said, is seeing the heartbreak of the relatives and friends of the victims who perished in the crash. ""What they have gone through is, of course, incomprehensible,"" he said, describing what he said was an emotional meeting between the relatives and airline executives Wednesday. And now, he said, the company's focus will be taking care of them. Special Lufthansa flights will take relatives and friends of victims to southern France on Thursday, so they can be near the search scene, he said. ""We need to understand what happened,"" French President Francois Hollande said. ""We owe that to the families."" The doomed flight  was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday in the French Alps. Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for about eight minutes. The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of about 6,000 feet. Then it crashed. There were 150 people from 18 countries on board. Mother, daughter from Virginia among the victims . Teams have begun the daunting task of identifying the victims' bodies, but caution that it could take time to complete. Investigators are still trying to piece together what caused the crash. Jouty, the head of the investigation team, said the debris suggests the plane hit the ground and then broke apart, instead of exploding in flight. Radar followed the plane ""virtually to the point of impact"" in the Alps in southern France, Jouty said. The flight's last altitude recorded by radar was just over 6,000 feet. FBI agents based in France, Germany and Spain are looking through intelligence sources and cross referencing the passenger manifest of Germanwings Flight 9525, two senior law enforcement officials said. So far, their search hasn't turned up anything that ""stands out"" or anything linking the passengers to criminal activity, according to one official.
